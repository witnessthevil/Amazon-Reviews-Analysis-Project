Every game that has come out since, I've had to check out and this one is no exception. I'll admit, as far as gameplay and graphics are concerned...it pretty much is the same as Deadly Alliance. Yet, what sets this one apart from the rest is its' online play, its' konquest-puzzle-chess mode, and the fact that it brings back alot of the older MK favorites with familiar as well as new moves. That's more than enough to reel me in.I have to confess, though, that my favorite part of Deception was Puzzle Kombat. I found it strangely addicting even though it was pretty much a rip-off of Super Puzzle Fighter II. Believe it or not, it's one of those games that I wished they'd make for the Gameboy Advance or something. It was that addicting. I set more time playing that than the actual game. Course, I got plenty of time to get into the actual game itself later.Anyhoo, I love Deception and I'm sure you will too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Fast & Furious","reviewText":"I've never played any of the Shinobi games except for this one so I consider myself a non fan. But I am a fan of Samurai/Ninja games (Tenchu, Way of the Samurai, Kengo, Bushido Blade). The only thing Shinobi has in common with prior games of the genre is that you fight with a sword. That's it. Shinobi is the fastest Samurai/Ninja game I've ever seen. This game is not about deep thinking or stealth. It is about speed and finesse.What I liked about the game:- Good graphics, high frame rates, and beautify cutscenes- though the cutscenes don't really move the plot along in any interesting way.- The hero is very cool.- Hero can pull off a wide variety of moves using very simple controls. To a spectator it all looks very cool.- It's really your skill in finessing these moves that determines if you survive in this game. You have to master the rapid sequential kills (called TATE) in order to defeat the later bosses. This is not a Quake game, hacking at a boss repeatedly won't kill it. The controls are designed to assist you in reaching this state of \"TATE-ness\" but you have to allow it to happen- ie use the R1 button frequently.- Also watch the demo screens when the game boots up, they are useful in figuring out what kinds of moves your character is capable of.What frustrated me about the game:- I was warned by prior reviews that this was a difficult game- it really is very difficult. It took me about a dozen tries to get through level 3. That's before I found out that I can cut through some of the walls in the Mall to reveal health bonuses. Fortunately if you get killed at a boss level you resume in the boss fight level, not at the beginning of the level.- Camera has a mind of its own sometimes- especially in the most awkward times- like when you are trying to deal your death blow to a boss.- Graphics is repetitive. For each level you enter, the textures are reused an aweful lot.- There are no save points until an entire level (including boss) has been killed! This is the most frustrating thing about the game, but if you think about it for a moment, you'll quickly realize that being able to save the game at an arbitraty point would in fact kill the pace of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Getting Lost in an Odyssey","reviewText":"One prominent feature of JRPGs is the emo male protagonist.  Only a handful of games break this mold.  One such game would be Lunar: Silver Star Story and Eternal Blue.  While Lunar held to the same themes as most JRPGs by discussing the importance of friendship, the battle of Good versus Evil, it maintained a general sense of joviality.  Even when things inevitably went dark, the characters kept their happy-go-lucky attitude.Lost Odyssey is the antithesis of Lunar.Kaim is your typical tortured soul protagonist, except that, unlike most others who write bad poetry while metaphorically slitting their wrists and bemoaning their wretched life, he actually has a reason to be.  He's an immortal, apparently cursed to live forever and has already lived 1,000 years.  So, when the game begins with a climactic battle involving a meteor, he's had many lifetimes of sorrow, guilt, death and tragedy that would obviously make anyone's existence incredibly dour.  If you're a sucker for sad stories, Kaim's tale will undoubtably tug at your heart strings.Basically, two stories are going on at once in Lost Odyssey.  There's the current story that I'll get to in a bit.  There's also the back story that comes flitting through in written form every once in awhile.  You see, Kaim suffers from another JRPG staple: the amnesiac hero.  He, and other immortals like him, don't remember much about their past for some reason.  And so, as Kaim continues his quest, events will trigger memories and you have the option of reading them.  These little vignettes are written by Kiyoshi Shigematsu, an award-winning Japanese novelist, and it shows.These 34 stories, in fact, often overshadow the main story line.  The main quest involves discovering why Kaim and the other immortals are amnesiac and they quickly become embroiled in a political landscape more polarizing than the current times we live in.  A few different countries eye each other ominously and one of the main points of contention comes down to technology and magic.  Add in some political backstabbing and enough emotional baggage to sink the Titanic and you basically have the very interesting and mature story in a nutshell.The combat is typical JRPG; turn-based and random.  Eschewing their previous game's encounter system (Blue Dragon), Lost Odyssey has plenty of random encounters.  Fortunately, with the exception of a few areas, the encounters aren't as frequent as they have been in some games.  A couple additions to the combat and leveling system add to the thrill.  For instance, taking a cue from Shadow Hearts, you can equip various \"Rings\" on characters which will add various abilities to their attacks.  The twist is that you have to trigger these additions by holding the right trigger and releasing it as a big circle perfectly shrinks to match a smaller circle.  This little homage to Shadow Hearts should be expected since Feel Plus, a studio working with Mistwalker on this title, is comprised of some ex-Sacnoth employees who had created the Shadow Hearts series.The leveling system is also pretty interesting as you have Immortals who don't learn skills when they level and Mortals who do.  Consequently, you can \"skill link\" an Immortal to a specific Mortal Skill and learn it eventually.  This creates an interesting dynamic where you want to have Mortals and Immortals in your party to gain their knowledge and also to have them level up.  The one complaint I have is that members not in your party don't automatically gain experience.  And due to the fact that you'll want your mortals to level so you can learn more skills, you'll constantly be flipping your formation around (you can have five members in your party at a time).From a sound perspective, Lost Odyssey surprised me.  The score from Final Fantasy mainstay Nobuo Uematsu is familiar and different, bringing to mind some of his excellent compositions from Final Fantasy.  Meanwhile, this is one of the few JRPGs to offer a Japanese vocal track if you'd like to listen to that...and it's one of the only games where I don't want it.  The English vocal staff is excellent for the most part.  I really, really like it and the dialogue is (mostly) written well.So there's obviously a big elephant in the room.  Lost Odyssey is very reminiscient of Final Fantasy which is to be expected since you have Hironobu Sakaguchi, the father of the entire Final Fantasy series, and his cohort in musical crime onboard.  Then you add in the fact that Feel Plus is made of ex-Sacnoth employees who were, in turn, former Square employees...and you have the recipe for a game that's pretty close to Square's long-winded series.Along with the aforementioned party-swapping to level, a few other complaints bring the score down.  For one, there's a lot of load times.  And load times during cut scenes which is a huge no-no in my book.  The frame rate does take a few dips every so often and while it's not a deal-breaker, it is noticeable.  And the beautiful graphics are often marred with aliasing issues, resulting in what's called \"jaggies.\"  Combat also takes awhile to load into, as the game shows you various images, then the main characters are introduced before finally showing the enemies and the battle starts.  All of this is to hide the load times, I'm sure, but it slows combat down a lot.Ultimately, though, the complaints are minor nuisances in what is a great addition to the JRPG line.  It's fun, mature, dark and sad, sometimes all at once.  Unfortunately, Lost Odyssey seems to be taking a beating in the mainstream gaming press who have said it's \"soooo old fashioned,\" a claim that probably wouldn't be made if you switch the words \"Lost\" and \"Odyssey\" with \"Final\" and \"Fantasy\" with some roman numeral...maybe with a dash and a number.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001TOMQSK","description":"Sega Aliens vs. Predator 69038 PC Games","reviewerName":"humanbeldot","summary":"Great visuals and a unique twist on gameplay, lacking elsewhere","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that the newest \"Aliens vs. Predator\" game, developed by the same team that developed the original 1999 hit, is fun. Pure fun. Graphic, gory, colorful, dark where it needs to be, AvP is worth purchasing if only for the beautiful visuals and...not so pretty ends to your foes.Each campaign, as before, is unique. The game builds upon what made 2001's \"AvP 2\" so fantastic: more flexibility as far as gameplay, nicely cramped spaces, vast and beautifully rendered open areas, a real scare factor on things popping out of the darkness, all that fun stuff. The vision modes for the Predator are pulled right out of the films: the Alien vision mode really ups the insect nature of the four-legged monsters as they crawl about on walls and ceilings like roaches. Sound effects come straight out of the movies; the chatter of the Marines below you as you stalk from above can be entertaining to listen to; Aliens are a genuine threat; and so on.Now, the bad: where's the plot? From the day it was announced, there was never a mention of a plot. Now, I know the original AvP game had little to no plot, but that was pretty normal for games of that era. We are now in the 21st century, with such games as \"inFamous\", \"Tomb Raider Underworld\", and \"Halo\" keeping their audiences with not only breathtaking visuals and great gameplay, but also a story that sucks you in. This incarnation of AvP lacks what \"AvP 2\" had: a story, with three campaigns that intertwine and only truly make sense after you've played all three. It was a story about gaining your honor (Predator), freeing your allies and attempting to overtake the planet (Alien), and discovering betrayal and exacting revenge (Marine). More than that, it was fun. This new AvP drags its feet on story; the graphics and fun gameplay simply cannot overcome this easy-to-fix shortcoming.Still, the game is worth the new release price (which is rather steep, but reasonable). What it lacks (glaringly) in plot, it mostly makes up for in fun. We can only hope that the soon-to-come \"Aliens: Colonial Marines\" holds a better story than this one does, while also balancing that with fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"drew","summary":"Hold on now.....WILLIAM","reviewText":"Hey william, I noticed a bit of A attitude problem in your review, I have a right to my own opinion, and EXCUSE ME, FOR SPELLING DUMB WRONG.And one last thing, I think your computer is screwed!!!!!I didnt give the game 0 you loser!!!!!!!You cant give the game a 0!!!The site wont let you!!!!I gave the game 3 stars.Mostly for the battle system.Why should you care!!!!!I think I hate you to WILLIAM I guess a person cant write a review without being ridiculed for a spelling error, or opinion.I hope you dont write a review back, because I dont want to here it!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2004"}

From what I hear it was an underappreciated game on the PS1.  Despite being developed by RPG giant Squaresoft, Xenogears didn't possess the hype necessary to pull me in.  I was too caught up in other franchises to pay the Xeno universe much notice.However, all that changed the first hour I was into Xenosaga.  85 game hours later (and just 30 minutes ago) I finished it.  Now I'm hooked and very much interested in what Xenogears was all about.What drew me into Xenosaga wasn't the convincing, futuristic atmosphere.  It wasn't the slick graphics and impressive battle animations.  It wasn't the superb music and sound effects.  No, it was the outstanding story and characters.  These two aspects unfold in highly entertaining cinema scenes packed with perfect amounts of humor and drama.  They do a good job of keeping you interested in the characters, as well as the plot.  They're so professionally done you'd swear you're watching a movie, not a game.And therein lies one problem.  As you've no doubt heard, Xenosaga holds the record for longest and most frequent cutscenes in any game...ever.  I, for one, never had a problem with Xenosaga's cutscenes.  In fact, they were the reason for me to keep playing!  Thankfully, there is a feature to skip any cinema scene at any time, so no one can complain there.If you like complex customization options you'll love Xenosaga's menu system.  At first glance it's intimidating, but spend some time going through it and you'll begin to see how things work.  That's also true with the battle system, which may not be what most RPG players are used to.All of the music in Xenosaga is done by a full symphony orchestra, and it sounds stellar.  I just wish there was more of it.  And I wish it wasn't reused so often.  The best example of this is the battle music, which never changes, not even for boss fights (except for the final battle).Sound effects are perfect throughout the game.  Battles are riddled with satisfying impact sounds.  Footsteps sound appropriate to whomever is walking around the environment.  It's all top notch.The only non-graphic/sound complaint I have has to do with the best part about Xenosaga: the cutscenes.  I would have liked to see the characters' mouths move in synch with the English voices.  It's distracting but forgivable.Be prepared for plenty of unanswered questions by the game's end.  The title Xenosaga is accurate.  Seeing as how there's going to be six-seven parts, this is one ambitious game series.  I'm already addicted and this is only Episode I!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2003"}

Brotherhood Raises The Bar","reviewText":"I've already bought the first two in the Assassins Creed series and decided to keep going with Brotherhood. The game mechanics are similar to the previous installments but they have added more weapons. So far I have only played through the first 3 DNA sequences and I'm taking my time (even doing side missions and restoring the city of Rome). Graphics just keep getting better with each release and the game designers always seem to do a great job of inserting \"in game\" facts to access when you pass a landmark. What I've enjoyed most so far was climbing the Coliseum ..... when you reach the top and begin running along the edge there is a great sense of height from above.Weapons have been stepped up, and by far my favorite weapon is the crossbow. It's just a blast to perch yourself up on a ledge and pick off unsuspecting guards at ground level ....... I have been getting a real kick out of doing that.I've always been a fan of Rockstar's GTA series and Red Dead Redemption, but these Assassin's Creed's games have all but taken over my XBox360 now. I used to be really big on first person shooters before jumping into sandbox (open world) games and I will say this: The assassin's creed series is very engaging and unique in it's presentation and style of play. It's a nice change of pace from games where there is a lot of shooting. I have started to really enjoy the style of the game and it's emphasis on being rewarded for stealthiness. If you bought the first two you can't go wrong here. I plan on playing some multiplayer soon but will likely wait until I finish the campaign first. I highly recommend purchasing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

It rouses a fixation, depriving sleep and razing all signs of the munchies.  Advance Wars is a portable cart aimed as a tactical knock off and effectively whops the target.  Nintendo yanks out a total hit with a chronic twist.  Their multiplayer and extremely balanced Turn-Based combat has players coming back for more and more.  The replay value on this life-draining bastard is the forerunner of its class.  Either played during sessions in school, on the passenger side, with a group of aspiring Commanding Officers, or accompanied with a pungent beverage in solitude, Advance Wars scores sky-high.Igniting in robust complexity, once the battle intricacies are soaked into your instinct the game goes ka-boom!  Lodge fortitude, play through it and soon you'll see why so many have fallen for this sweet sucker.  Before the true mayhem crops up, you are launched into guided exercises.  Avoiding the crash course, newbies will acquire the essential arts for the GBA's first warfare.  Subsequent to the training missions, the player should be ready for the maximized Campaign Mode.  Centered on Turn-Based battle, the essential goal throughout the game is taking out Commanding Officers or seizing their command centers.  Wrangled on land, air, and sea, the amazing part of the game is the perfectly balanced units.  All 18, outfitted with certain stamina points, armor, movement, attack range, and accuracy, are regularly used and maintain a purpose on the frontlines.  The infantry units, while naturally deleted off the screen, are the only ones who can annex cities that are used to accrue units.  One's surroundings (mountains, forest, reefs, highways, etc.) accomplish tactical implements as well as defense, subterfuge, or greater mobility.  Operations in the Campaign Mode are ranked depending on the players speed and technique.  AW coins, used to purchase extra maps, are awarded upon the player's performance.  Moneyed with a winning single-player campaign, and the option to directly replay all the missions, Advance Wars can stand alone as a standalone buffet.  Things just take-off with its cargo of customization traits and its several other modes.  But the unfeigned incentive to protectively hold onto the GBA is the multiplayer mode.  Enabling an up-to-four-player mode and trade with customized maps, Advance Wars coaxes as a spotless multiplayer pleasure.They're pixilated and they may be the state of primitive cartoon animation, but looks can deceive, for Advance Wars doesn't behave as it appears.  A downright, every bit of tactical thinking game, the graphics are wonderful except for the overly childish atmosphere.  Tidy and viewed overhead on a large battlefield, the tiny GBA screen shines with clear-sailing sight.  The animated, no-frills cutscenes shown when units strike each other are nice for the first 30 minutes, but swamps the game in the 31st minute.  Thank you Nintendo for the option to deactivate them.  With feisty visuals and appropriately incorporated audio, you cannot go wrong with the quality.When confined into detention, jaded to death, or suffering from the gritted-teeth addiction, Advance Wars somehow materializes into my head and mysteriously onto my palms.  Levels are designed so intelligently that the action is continuously ardent, and sometimes human competition can get pretty gripping with all the sticky sweat-works.  Greatly composed, unproblematic when learnt, and every bit full of tactical grandeur, this baby is done in superiority over all others.  Its solo-player playability and its multiplayer bonanza earns its strips and undying longevity.  Boil everything down and what you catch is a grand slam and myself roaring in chock-full acclaim.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2002"}

Although this title is technically not GRAW 3, I guess I sort of assumed it would follow the same lines as the first two games.  Not so much.  It's almost like it's own franchise.  You no longer take on the squad leader role of Scott Mitchell.  In fact, you are not even the squad leader.  You no longer have command of your squad, with the exception of a synchronized sniper shot order (which is pretty cool).  You still have the same toys (UAV, Stryker, etc.) and some new ones (enemy sensor, light-bending cammo, etc.).  The controls are good, but they differ from previous Ghost Recon games, which I think is kind of stupid - if it works well, why change it up?  The game boasts some pretty nice visuals and sound.  All in all, it's a pretty good game, it's just not what GRAW fans are used to.  I suppose Ubisoft didn't exactly market the game under false pretenses.  After all, the game is named Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, not Advanced Warfighter.

Condemned 2 leaves off where Ethan Thomas slowly becomes insane after trying to figure out all the violent crimes in the city. The game's main attraction is the new combat system. In the first you hit with RT and blocked with LT but now you can control the left and right hand with each trigger and you block by holding them both down. We get a lot more melee weapons such as toilet seats, bowling balls, bowling pins, and even bricks!The game also has more for you to search for in the game such as destroying sonic emitters, finding \"antennas\" which gives you tidbits from the news and \"responses\" which is a given time to hit the A button to respond to certain scenarios. (the reason why this cult is making everyone violence). While this adds more depth it's very distracting when you're trying to hear who's stalking you and trying to get sucked into the atmosphere. Speaking of that the game is very very scary. The game also is VERY dark to where you can't see anything and you have to turn your brightness up, and not to mention the almost useless flashlight. The game's gun play is better this time but isn't nearly as satisfying as the melee combat.The game also has a useless multiplayer mode where you play criminals vs. cops and you have to hide the evidence as criminals and find it as cops. This is both boring and stupid because the maps are very small and the cops have guns so it's almost cheating. There is also a useless fight club mode where you go into different arenas and fight to the death. This is both boring and still practically useless.

To say that T4 was \"highly anticipated\" is an understatement. It the granddaddy of PS2 fighters, and in the past the series has always offered something new and different. Not this time. If you've play T3 on PS1, then you'll be familiar with pretty much everything in offered here. Tekken's control system is firmly established now and while both satisfying and easy to use, it lacks the sense of complete control that Sega 's VF4 provides. While playing through the single player game, it soon feels more like a rhythmic button-masher session than a orchestrated fight. With each new game in the series, the back story has gotten more and more complicated (and I've played em all a billion times, so beileve me I know) so much so that in T4 the intricate web of tales hardly explains why all these fighters are beating each other up, and has no relavance whatsoever. If your a longtime fan (like me) though, some of it is mildly intresting, and in many cases the story provides a sense of closure for long-standing characters in the series. You'll get the most fun, like with any fighting game playing against a friend (and if you don't have those, there's always T4's Force mode, and I truly do feel sorry for you). The character selection offers a broad range of fighting styles and the walled arenas provide some intreting possibilities for completely one -sided matches.

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Far from Hellish...","reviewText":"Wow, what a great idea for a game. Take the classic descent into Hell, ripped from the pages of medeival poet Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy,\" but just make it all a little more kickass -- for example, instead of Dante the poet as the protagonist, let's make Dante a scythe-wielding crusader with a cross stitched into his bare chest. And do it in the style of the classic action franchise \"God of War.\" Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout right there! What a concept!Well, I'd be lying if I said this game wasn't fraught with missed opportunities. But not nearly as many as you've probably heard. Critics were unduly harsh back in early 2010 when \"Dante's Inferno\" streeted, perhaps because it is undeniably a \"God of War\" clone and perhaps because the game does admittedly lose some steam near its conclusion. But as for me, I had more fun slashing my way through Hell than I've had in quite some time. Gamespot's score of a 6.5 out of 10, for example, certainly doesn't do this game justice. \"Dante's Inferno\" may not deliver on all of its many promises, but it comes damn close.Again, you are cast as Dante, but not the Dante we know from history. This Dante is a deeply flawed individual who manages to earn your affections merely because of his stubborn refusal to accept his fate, or that of his lover Beatrice whose soul is condemned to Hell for having a little too much faith in his virtue. He's a dark, brooding character in much the same vein as Kratos from \"God of War\" (which is undoubtedly not a coincidence). And like Kratos, he's a real badass. At the beginning of the game rather than die from a should-be fatal wound, he hands the Grim Reaper his ass and steals Death's own scythe, claiming it as his own before heading south toward Hell in an attempt to redeem himself and rescue his beloved Beatrice from the affections of a very horny Lucifer. It's dark but overblown enough to still feel like a video game story instead of a somber meditation on the afterlife. In fact, peeling back the onion that is Dante's character makes for a very compelling story, and the title character is certainly one of the deeper and more interesting video game characters to come along in quite some time -- this side of the Ghost of Sparta, anyway.It's satisfying as Hell (pun intended) to kill waves upon waves of demons with Dante's stolen scythe. But as scary as that weapon looks, it's Beatrice's crucifix (which literally shoots crosses into his demonic enemies' faces) that really gets the job done. In fact, that cross must be twice-blessed by Jesus Christ Himself, because its mere presence greatly reduces much of the game's challenge factor on lower difficulty settings, as it's a powerful ranged attack that can never be depleted. Combining this with the scythe, some very cool magical attacks, a quite fair number of combo moves, and, best of all, some tight controls makes killing things in this Hell seem like Heaven.And the design of the game, by and large, is very inspired. Morbidly inspired, granted, but such is the source material. Sure there are a few typical horned demons to contend with as well as some flying creatures that could just about cameo in any action game ever made, but then there are the truly grotesque souls of Lust who, despite a very feminine appearance at first glance, are not shy about thrusting a huge, claw-tipped penis directly at your face. Likewise the mutant souls of Gluttony are gas-filled flesh bags who don't mind using vomit and/or shite as a weapon. Boss encounters are likewise quite memorable, including such baddies as one who rips swords from his own body and throws them at you and one which pits you against the eyeless guardian of the gates of Hell -- the decider, so to speak, of which souls belong in which circle of Hades. It's unfortunate that Lucifer, \"Big D\" himself, in all three of his guises no less, comes off as just plain silly. First he's a groping shadow-man, then he's a giant laughable beast with bat wings for a goatee, and finally he's your typical horned satyr whose only memorable trait is his giant swinging balls and a member that could make Mr. Ed jealous. After fighting a three-headed beast with mouths for eyes and a demonic Cleopatra with tongues for nipples, Lucifer himself just doesn't get the blood pumping.But perhaps this boss encounter with the Devil himself best describes the \"Dante's Inferno\" experience. Early on, the game is amazing -- a true contender to the \"God of War\" throne with its epic story, cinema-quality production values, and of course its depiction of Hell. Again, you've barely been playing the game for five minutes when you challenge the Grim Reaper himself to a duel. Now that's how you kick off an action game! And despite what you've probably read, the game stays strong up until maybe the 80% completed point. After the tangled forest of Suicide, it's admittedly all downhill, but just getting to this point -- what a ride it's already been.Unfortunately that's when the real suffering begins, as the devs clearly tried to pad out a somewhat short experience by scrapping solid level design and forcing you into a series of trials that would be better suited as bonus content. For example, you are tasked with killing a series of respawning enemies without using magic at one point, and then killing five creatures while attacking from the air without ever letting them touch the ground. It's silly, it's boring, and it feels like exactly what it is -- padding. Many reviews have mentioned this portion of the game as something of a deal-breaker, but I argue is it any worse than the final portion of \"Devil May Cry 3\" that forced you (again bearing the name Dante) to repeat several previous boss encounters before you could proceed to the endgame? And that game was quite acclaimed when it came out despite an equally, if not far more annoying buildup to the final confrontation. Those bosses were hard as hell to beat the first time -- fighting them again was just plain infuriating.All this leads to the aforementioned final battle with the Devil himself, which again fails to fire on all cylinders, but the same is true of many good games. One just wishes \"Inferno\" didn't feel like two development teams worked on the damn thing -- one, creating 80% of the game, doing a \"God of War\" worthy job, while the other, responsible for that last 20% not really having much of a clue what makes a good hack-and-slash actioner work. It's this split personality that sadly prevents me from hailing \"Dante's Inferno\" as a modern classic, but it still comes dangerously close. The music, the voice acting (apart from a silly-sounding Lucifer), the story, the atmosphere, the cinemas, and the gameplay are all excellent. Perhaps the only other flaw that bears mentioning is the annoying 40 second long minigame one must slog through to save the tortured souls of Hell -- it makes the notion of damning them instead and salvaging those 40 seconds of your life, even if you want to redeem Dante's own tortured soul, far too tempting indeed. But virtually everything else in \"Dante's Inferno\" achieves A-list status, and were it not for such an epic fumble near the finale, what a ride this would be. Hell, even opening doors is fun -- you impale a fat demon with your scythe and pound a button until the stubborn S.O.B. rolls up like an iron curtain and gives you access to the next chamber. Good stuff.So yeah, it's true that this game has some very tragic flaws. But if you're a fan of hack-and-slash action games like \"God of War\" or even \"Devil May Cry,\" miss Dante's descent into woe at your own peril. This is very nearly a classic, but, as per usual, the Devil had to go and screw it up.Final Score: 8.0","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

Aikens","summary":"flawed experience, but a fun one","reviewText":"First off, Fable 3 is only slightly related to fable 2 as you are the child of the hero on there and it is in the same world (the blind seer is back as well). I say you are the child and the game says you are the child but it doesn't matter what kind of \"hero\" you were on Fable 2 because even if you were evil and everyone hated and feared you then your hero became a beloved monarch who had 2 children. One of these, Logan, is the King when the game starts out and you are the prince or princess depending on the gender you choose. The storyline in Fable 3 is heads and shoulders above the other entries in the series, but Fable 3 has quite  a few problems as well as moments that have you asking what Lionhead was thinking.The Good:Good storyline (for a fable game mind you not mass effect worthy but good), Graphics and style are all wonderful, evil gnomes, great soundtrack and voice acting. The Sanctuary is a cool concept, lots of stuff to collect and a ton of side quests, took about 30 hours to complete nearly everything, improved multiplayer, and the gameplay is still fun if extremely simpleThe Bad:The game is quite glitchy as i encountered several glitches (no game stoppers but i have heard horror stories), the control scheme in combat is even more simplified, the game is extremely easy, no switching spells on the fly (you have to go to the sanctuary armory to change your spells, the touch mechanic looks bad and works even worse, there is no way to pick which expression you want to do, the levelling up mechanic is not very good as there is no complexity which would be fine but there is really no reason not to just buy everything, making money is really easy...buy pawnbrokers and shops and then buy everything. There is still no emotional attachment to anyone in the game as the expression system has actually gotten worse, the storyline doesn't really support being evil very well as even if you pick the evil options at the end it helps you save people for the most part(unless you just pull all of the money out of the treasury and transfer it yourself, but then whats the point of the storyline if you aren't going to save anyone), there are way too many legendary weapons to gather and you end up picking a favorite and leveling it up for the whole game, Your weapons may change appearence but they all end up looking alike if you are a total good character or a total bad character. Speaking of which being good and evil doesn't really change your appearance that much other than tatoos glowing different colors until the end of the main storyline and since you will have all of the chests then every good character and every evil character tend to have the same features and the real customization comes with the clothes, hair, tatoos, and makeup.In conclusion:I know I listed alot more bad than good but Fable 3 is still fun despite its many flaws. The thing that makes fable 3 so upsetting is that with a few tweaks like a harder difficulty (this could have a more complex levelling and combat systems) and a better system than the horrible expression system fable 3 could have been one of the best xbox games period...for now its middle of the pack but if you loved the first 2 you will love this one and if you have never played an rpg...fable is a great place for a casual or inexperienced gamer to start. In closing, Fable 3 is a flawed experience, but a fun one nonetheless","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Sigmund Freud","summary":"it gets old real fast","reviewText":"The horror suspense part of the game was good early on but the later levels you'll just pretty much know where the next enemy will come from. The weapons are fun to use and you get the best of bunch BFG, mini gun, etc. Monster design is really good especially the bosses you'll fight. Adventure is average length and you can play online which is a blast but the single player is a done deal once finished. But I'd recommend the collecters edition which gives you two classic \"Doom\" games in their full legnth, which is also cheap now so go buy that version for more replay value.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Ashern \"Hmmm\"","summary":"How to put this...","reviewText":"(long, in depth review / no spoilers) It's hard to explain my feelings about Uncharted 3. I remember playing the Multiplayer Beta before I had any knowledge of Uncharted's gameplay or story, and loved it. I then said, I can't wait to get this one! I also told myself that I must get Uncharted 1 and 2 before I get Uncharted 3, and that I did.I played the first one, loved it - the story was neat, the characters were vibrant, and it was a simple-but-effective combat system. I played the second one, loved it as well, and loved the new characters brought to the series; even the ones from the Eye of Indra Motion Comic. And the Multiplayer? It was fantastic. A nice lot of characters to choose from (although I did have the Game of the Year edition: extra playable characters,) and each one had a nice look and feel.And then we come to Uncharted 3. Where to begin? In no way is this a 'bad' game, it's actually quite nice. It has nice setup, nice story, and nice graphics (all the people saying this has worse graphics, well...That's only the case in Multiplayer Co-op. I'll get to this later).With that being said and known, the problem is that this story suffers from severe weakness. There's action throughout the game, but even the action itself is weak. I'm not sure how to explain it. What if I said: This game is like a fine sports car -- it looks GREAT on the outside, and even on the inside. And you also enjoy riding in it. However, this great sports car only goes up to 30 miles per hour. It's just...weak. Even though you love the spirit of this car, appreciate the looks, and even understand that this car can't go any faster, it still doesn't change the fact that. It's. Just. Weak.Less jokes, no characters that you can actually take sides with, none of that from the past 2 games -- even though the game has the same characters! Now, the bad thing isn't wholeheartedly the fact that the story is weak, because it is still interesting and entertaining; but instead of 'adding' and 'updating' things from past games, which would have made more sense, they 'changed' a lot of things.Yes, they added new gameplay types (movements/animations, etc.), but they changed things that people have grown to know and love. My main two gripes with the game is that A) They changed Chloe's face, and B) There's a new, annoying Aiming system.Gone are the days where Chloe was a hardcore, uniquely-faced woman. Now she just looks like a generic lady trying to be someone she's not. It may sound silly, but it completely turned me off from the game, just from seeing her face take such a drastic changed for the worse. On top of that, they changed the models for every character (including DLC characters from previous Uncharted games.) Some changes are welcome, where other changes just mess things up.On to the Aiming System: it was very difficult to play the game because of this -- at least for me. Pistols were my favorite weapon to play with, but now it's almost virtually impossible to play with them. You shoot one time, and recoil sends the gun flying upwards. You can't keep shooting unless you're dead-on with this game's new aiming system. They added way too much emphasis on recoil, that it messes so many things up. I died countless times because I either kept missing, or just decided to run in and Melee them out of annoyance.Luckily, I was pleased to see that the gun mechanics and gameplay is MUCH different in Multiplayer than it is in Singleplayer. Guns have better accuracy, shoot faster, and it's more easier to control. But In NO way is it Uncharted 2 though.To some people saying that this game was 'easy,' well, I played in Hard mode through the game, and it was quite hard. The puzzles are hard at first glance, but once you actually stop to think about them, they are pretty easy. Also, as other people have said: The game forces you into melee more than you are comfortable with. It's not REALLY true, I never became uncomfortable with it, but it happens every other 2 chapters it may seem.The graphics and things are fine tuned and look nice. The world is rendered beautifully, and the animations are also nice. About the Multiplayer Co-Op, what I was saying about the graphics is: Uncharted 3 Multiplayer has been setup to allow split-screen gameplay. That means someone from your house can join in Co-Op, and even other matches such as Team Deathmatch, etc. With that being said, Multiplayer is completely different than Singleplayer. Meaning, the graphics have been toned down -- but most likely to cope with this split-screen support. It's not a problem to me, although it's quite noticeable during the co-op movie scenes. But, I understand why and it doesn't bother me.It may seem like I'm not actually saying anything 'positive' about the game, but this is actually how I feel about it.The story mode is lovely and interesting, but also weak and disappointing. However, Multiplayer is, like I said, a completely different game. After playing Uncharted 1 and 2, I grew way too accustomed to those gameplay mechanics. When I got Uncharted 3, so much had changed that I was, again, disappointed. However, I fought my annoyances with the game and played multiplayer until it actually became fun!It took...a little while...And it was rough, to be honest. I thought I was going to straight-up dislike Uncharted 3. But I see now, that you have to FORCE yourself to keep playing it until you \"grow accustomed\" to the changes. Sadly, I don't give this game props for making me \"force\" myself to enjoy it. Though I know that... change is hard? At least these type of changes.So, to end my review: Pros and Cons. For everyone debating whether or not to get this: I can't even tell you. Even though it's good in the end (a slow and boring-but-interesting ride, that surely gets you to your destination), it's up to you to decide if you can fight through to the end. With many disappointments, probably-terrible changes, and no character to actually CONNECT to, it feels like there's not even a reason to play it. But I have something to say: IT GETS BETTER!!PROS:*- Once you actually grow used to the controls and mechanics, it's quite fun.*- Multiplayer.*- Split-screen availability.-- Sadly, I can't even FIND another PRO for this game. Lovely, visually stunning, interesting story I suppose?CONS:*- Terrible changes if you jumped directly from Uncharted 1 and 2 to 3.*- Although lovely, visually stunning, and interesting, the story suffers from severe weakness and lackluster gameplay.*- Character model (one in particular) changes that leave you completely dry inside, and distances you from the gameeven more.*- Completely horrible recoil system.*- A very disappointing game if you play this only for the story, and don't touch multiplayer.-----And that's my review! It may seem like I completely bashed this game...and honestly, I probably did. Now thinking about it, I think the main problem with this game is...Even though only a few things changed, they changed drastically. And, for me, those changes distanced me very far from LOVING this game. On a side note, this game was a bit more 'serious' than others, in terms of the story.With multiplayer, it's almost as if they tried too hard to make this the most spectacular multiplayer game. At first it was just a fun 3rd person shooter, now it's a little more..in-depth, and it's hard to say if that's a good or bad thing, as it can easily be a turn-off point.Final Review4 out of 5. And for someone who only will play the story, I would say 3...or maybe even 2 out of 5. Few changes, drastic nonetheless, can distance a person so far; in which is the example with this game. Fight -- no, MURDER your way through these changes, though, and you'll love the other side. It's just a matter of the person's will to continue...And also a matter of how strongly you were connected to previous Uncharted games. Luckily, I hadn't been playing Uncharted 2 for months or years, so I wasn't interlocked into it as much as others.I can truly understand how people can dislike this game, I really can. And also, I can understand how people can truly love this game. It depends on the person with this one, it does. I might have been a little unfair with my review, and with that being said, this was -- is, a great game, it just distanced me so far that it's hard to appreciate it's true value. And I don't like the fact that it pushed me at ALL.If you have any questions, just ask! Oh and one more thing: To access multiplayer, you must go to the Reedeem A Code section of \"Account Management\" or in the playstayion store, and input the code that is found on the back of your game's manual (instruction booklet inside Uncharted 3 case). This only applies to people purchasing this game \"NEW.\"For people purchasing it used, the code will most likely have already been redeemed, meaning you need to buy an \"Online Pass\" in the Playstation Store for $9.99. You only need the Online Pass to access Multiplayer, otherwise you don't need it at all. I read that if one pass is activated on a user account on a PS3 system, the online pass will work for all accounts on the same playstation. And/or on the same account it was activated on if you were to login to that account from a different playstation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"E. David Swan","summary":"Fine Concept, Bad Execution","reviewText":"I've played (and loved) all the Paper Mario games going all the way back to the N64 and I can without a doubt say that this is the weakest of the batch. So where do things go wrong? Leveling up is gone and for me this immediately hurts the game badly. Maybe I'm just old fashioned but I love leveling up and this problem is compounded by the fact that I kept getting lost as to where to go next. So now I'm wandering around, getting in battles I don't want to be in and I don't even get the consolation of building experience. You can increase your health meter by finding +5 health hearts but the main way to improve Mario is by collecting stickers.The concept of stickers is a good idea but the execution here is severely lacking. There are the common stickers like hammers and boots with varying degrees of power and these can be collected easily. Then you have the unique stickers (called \"Thing\" stickers that have a specific purpose. As the game progressed I collected a billiard ball, a lighter, a Chinese fan and so on and so forth but I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do with them. At one point I found myself in a darkened room and I assumed what I needed was a light bulb but I didn't have a light bulb. I had a car battery which didn't seem like it would work but maybe it could charge up the existing light bulb. It didn't, and when a sticker fails you lose it. I can re-buy them but it definitely limits my experimentation because it burns through my money. So now I need SOMETHING to light up the room that may or may not be a light bulb. That means going back to scour every level trying to find whatever I missed which is increasingly annoying because I don't level up and the fights are growing tedious with repetition. Finally I have to do what I hate doing which is consult gamefaqs website only to discover the bulb was hiding in plain sight. The bulb works and moves me about 1 more inch forward in the game only to discover I need a giant hook, maybe, to actually progress and it's back to hunting through levels.Compounding the issues is the fact that the Thing stickers take up a lot of space in your album squeezing out room for stickers used in battling. The stickers come in different sizes but you can't adjust your album for a tight fit of stickers so you're trying to manage limited space and probably trying to rip through stickers just to make room. You may very well come across an enemy susceptible to a specific Thing sticker which you aren't carrying because your album is clogged and your one chance to use it is blown. And here's the biggest kicker. If you come across a boss and actually figure out which sticker he's susceptible to and you just HAPPEN to have it in your album you could STILL use it wrong and not get the benefits. This could have all worked but they botched it big time.The average boss fight goes like this. You can't prepare for a boss fight ahead of time because you don't know what you'll be facing so it's unlikely you'll have the sticker they're susceptible to. Generally I have to sandbag the first fight in order to actually prepare by buying Thing stickers that seem like they might work against the boss. One boss was from the water so I considered the possibility that a car battery might be his weakness. Nope. I manage to beat the boss while plowing through nearly my entire sticker collection including a dozen or so Thing stickers only to get scolded by the game for not using the one sticker he's susceptible to. In hindsight I think I know what would have worked and it wasn't particularly intuitive but if I'm wrong I have no clue. Suffice to say my joy of victory is always dampened by the fact that I didn't do it correctly. Get this. I fought a boss ON A BASEBALL DIAMOND. Use the baseball bat, right. DUH!!! Except it didn't seem to have any extra effect. ARGGGHHH!!!! If you have to purposely lose to win the fight correctly that's a serious flaw in game design.In the end I just threw my hands in the air and used gamefaqs to guide me whenever I got stuck. When the game works it's a lot of fun when you figure out how to use a sticker but a vast majority of Thing stickers serve no purpose except to act as more powerful attacks. The graphics in the game are intended to be simplistic to play along with the paper motif but often times they felt lazy and uninspired rather than stylistic. This is not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination but it could have been a lot better. Players should be allowed to hold unlimited Thing stickers and encouraged to experiment rather than punished. As an example of a bad design decision there is a museum where you can attach stickers as you collect them. Except as you add them to the museum you are also losing them. That's just silly and the reward wasn't worth the effort. Weak Effort Nintendo. Try Again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}

I'm not going to spoil it here, though.  In the game, you play as a Spartan known as #6 and you join an elite special forces group of other Spartans to investigate a distress call.  Each of the characters have their own specialty, Jun is a sniper, Kat is a tech expert, Jorge is a heavy gunner...  What turns out to be a simple distress call ends up becoming a cataclysmic adventure.  (Because you weren't going to buy a Halo game to shoot a few rebel farmers who didn't want to pay their space taxes.)Graphics: 9/10The Halo engine has been revamped and it looks great, considering the long draw distances in the massive levels.  There are also some major events happening in the backgrounds as you play through the game.  The visual effects are very well done, the characters animate well, the vehicles, and environments all look outstanding.  If there was any room for improvement, I'd say the human faces could have used a bit more detail.Gameplay: 9/10Sure you can blow through the Campaign on Easy or Normal Mode, but this is like buying a swiss army knife and only using the toothpick.  REACH has lots to offer.The trademark of the Halo series has been its deep gameplay.  On Easy Mode or Normal Mode, you can run through the Campaign jumping over vehicles and smashing enemies in the face with the butt of your pistol, and taking down groups of aliens with your Assault Rifle.  You will definitely feel like a hero.  But if you play on Heroic or Legendary, you see the depth of the game.  There are two types of enemies that you face.  Those with energy shields and those without.  Coincidentally, there are two damage types in the game.  Plasma Weapons (which do more damage to shields and less damage to bodies) and Ballistic Weapons (which do less damage to shields and more to bodies.)  In the harder difficulties, you will have to use both types of weapons.  And lucky for you, you can carry two weapons at a time.  This makes the combat seem frantic as you make quick decisions about which enemies to shoot with what weapon.  Outside of combat, you also need to figure out what weapons that you should carry.  Shotguns are excellent at close range.  The DMR is a good all purpose rifle good for fighting at a distance.  The Assault Rifle is good against un-shielded enemies.  The Plasma Pistol is great against shielded enemies.  There are 20 different weapons in the game and all of them have their own advantages.Halo also has vehicle combat as well.  There are sci-fi versions of motorcycles, tanks, helicopters, anti-aircraft guns...  You can fight enemy vehicles in a vehicle or if you are skilled, you can hijack the enemy's vehicle and use it against them or destroy it instantly by busting open a hatch and dropping a grenade inside.In addition to the weapons and vehicles, the Spartans also have a \"special ability\" or an equipment item, that specializes their character.  These items are found in levels and picked up.  In Halo 3, you had Equipment, but they were single use and you were too afraid to use them because you never knew when you'd find another one.  In REACH, once you pick them up, you can use them as much as you want, but there is a cooldown period between each use.  Sprint, Drop Shield, Temporary Invincibility, Decoy, Active Camouflage, and Jet Pack are the abilities and they are pretty self explanatory.On the harder difficulty levels, the Elite Enemy Troops become more powerful, aggressive, and dodge grenades, forcing you to use tactics and improve your aim.The Combat of REACH is very dynamic.  Their AI is sophisticated and it knows how to take cover, flank you, steal your vehicle, drive a vehicle, and navigate around a massive map.  The combat areas are not tightly scripted linear levels, instead, the areas are open spaces with cover areas, high ground, flanking paths, etc...  This allows the players to use tactics to defeat the encounters.  Halo doesn't cheat with their AI, skills, and enemy abilities.  Most other games have tightly scripted levels, with simple enemies that only do one or two things.  This hinders replayability.  In Halo, everything is treated like it is a multiplayer experience.  Enemies can do everything.The physics on the objects are also dynamic and many of the objects in the environment are destructible.When you have open area encounters, with great AI, and deep tactics, players must use their problem solving skills to survive, instead of just relying on quick reflexes or temporary power ups.  REACH also records all of your gameplay and allows you to edit it and post it online.  Because everything is dynamic, AI, physics, complex combat system, there is a huge potential for Epic Victories and Epic Fails.Missions: 9/10The Mission Designs feature close quarter combat, open field combat, vehicle combat, air to air combat, space combat, low gravity combat, and air to ground combat.The Missions drive the story and feel epic in their execution.  (Don't just run though, stop and look around once in a while.)  There are a few cinematic moments in the missions themselves that aren't in the cutscenes.The level layouts are extremely tactical.  There is high ground, open areas for vehicles, flanking corridors, etc...  If you play on the harder difficulties and die a few times, you'll notice that there are always better ways to fight the enemies.  Also, the weapons that you want are always in the spots where you need them.  If you climb to the top of a tower... Hey look!  A sniper rifle just happens to be here!  If you are facing really tough enemies, the weaker enemies usually carry the best weapon to use against them.  Kill a grunt, take his plasma pistol, and use it against an elite!  Again, all of these subtle details are more apparent on the harder difficulties.Multiplayer: 10+/10You can play through the Campaign with 1-4 players, on 1-4 difficulties and Skulls.  (A Skull is a difficulty modifier that makes the game harder.)  You can turn on and off the skulls to customize the experience.REACH also features a firefight mode where you survive against waves of enemies, similar to Gears of War.  When you set up this game, there are tons of setting to make it extremely hard or extremely easy.Then there are the Vs. Modes.  They deal with killing enemies, or performing objectives on the map.  There are also a ton of these as well.And there is a FORGE, where players can edit their own multiplayer maps and play with their friends.Sound: 9/10The battles, weapons, vehicles, and effects all sound great.  The soundtrack is well done, too.  The only knock is that some of the in game combat dialogue is... err... not so great.Replay Value: 10+/10Halo Fans can play REACH for months.  Different Difficulty Levels, fully customizable coop and vs modes...Maturity:  TeenThe box says M, but Halo is just Humans vs. Aliens.  There is a bit of red blood from the humans and blue blood from the aliens.  There is no nudity, no swearing (unless you are playing online and the other players are cursing up a storm), no gore...  There is more violence in the Star Wars movies.  Seriously, the Star Wars movies are more violent than Halo.The reason Halo has always carried an M Rating is that when it was first created, the ESRB, pressured by congress, was overly concerned with \"head shots\" in games.  If you could shoot an enemy in the head for more damage, they gave you an M Rating.  The logic behind this was that games were teaching kids to shoot for the head because it does more damage, than shooting someone in the leg.  Wow... thanks ESRB and Congress.  Without video games, I never would have known that.  Really?  Head damage is worse than leg damage?!Overall:  9.5/10Halo REACH offers so much and it's only $40 now!  If you are a Halo Fan or interested in becoming one, this is the game for you!Buy it if you love Halo.Buy it if you love Sci-fi.Buy it if you love shooters.Buy it if you have an Xbox Live Gold Membership and will take advantage of all of the online options.Rent it if you just want to blow through the campaign on normal mode.It should take you 6-8 hours, but you'll be renting a swiss army knife to use the tooth pick.Avoid it if you have trouble aiming and don't want to practice.Unlike Call of Duty, there is no target lock aiming.This makes it a bit harder for casual gamers, but it also creates depth for the skilled players.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Moviebuffer101","summary":"THIS ISN'T REALLY HAPPENING!!!","reviewText":"GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY, SOUND AND STORY ARE ALL GRADE A. \"ETERNAL DARKNESS\" IS A TRUE GAMING EXPERIENCE.

This is a perfect port of the original Super Mario Bros. Every last mushroom and goomba is accounted for, and you'll feel yourself slipping into a blissful recollection of your early days as a gamer.

Playing Mario Brothers for hours on end. I would leave the console on at night (there was no saving Marios progress) only to have to start over the next day because mom turned off the console... she just didnt understand, \"I made it all the way to world 5-3!!!\" Mario was a huge success for its time!!! There was nothing better!!! So, feeling nostalgic, I picked up a copy for my gameboy advance.After a few hours of gameplay, I was done with it. In this day and age where games of the same price can be so much more entertaining... why did I blow my money on Mario? Its not that I expected cutting edge graphics, or changing the game (why change a classic. I would have been able to make it thru to the end if they just added one feature... just one. A simple thing like a save game feature would have given it 3 stars from me.This is a perfect example of Nintendo recycling old games and making a bundle. No thought process went into this... it was an old idea repackaged. One thing this did for me, is made me appreciate the advancement in the video game industry. In a day and age when reviewers complain about games being too repetitive, Mario does not deserve a good review... even from those of us who grew up with PAC MAN and GALAGA.I will agree that when Mario first hit the streets, it was the greatest thing out there. However at this point and time, Mario is definitly showing his age.

C. Orr","summary":"A Farewell To Thumbs.","reviewText":"When talking of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, there are those who wish to talk about how the game differs from the original XBOX versions (especially Ninja Gaiden Black (2005)), on the one hand, and those who wish to talk about Sigma as simply a great PS3 game. I would like to focus on the latter point. Sure, NGS is more polished graphically than its predecessor, and has a new playable character -the heavily bosomed Rachel- but it is fundamentally the same game to any but the most fanatical Ninja Gaiden fans.  Of course, Tomonubo Itagaki, who was Producer of the XBOX Ninja Gaidens, would disagree with this point: he has publicly denigrated the PlayStation 3 version of the game, perhaps because it was left to his understudies to make whilst he worked on the XBOX 360's Ninja Gaiden 2.  But let's put that down to ego and move on.Sigma is a beautiful game, but its real beauty lies in the complexity of the combat system. The game is quite simply a masterpiece of fast-paced control and combat design.  It edges ahead of games such as the excellent Devil May Cry series because of its wonderful balance of defence and attack, magnificently fluid controls and ultra-demanding difficulty level.  Its lasting brilliance is shown by how it  is able to instil a feeling of pride in a gamer who succeeds in defeating a boss, or mastering a combo move: it is the gaming equivalent of learning a martial art.  It is Ninjitsu for thumbs.Sigma, whilst not significantly \"better\" than the previous versions of the game, is wonderful despite -or perhaps because of- that.  Most significantly, it gives PlayStation 3 owners the chance to play the greatest action adventure masterpiece of the last twenty years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2008"}

Each of Spyro's dragon friends has fallen victim to the nefarious Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals. Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills. For this reason,Spyro the Dragonis an excellent title for youngsters or less experienced players, who want to play without having to master complex movement combinations.--Kasty ThomasPros:Large worlds provide hours of game playingVariety of scenariosEngaging graphicsCons:Low game skill requirements may prove less challenging for expert players","reviewerName":"ACEMAN1 \"HERE TO PISS YOU OFF\"","summary":"STILL LOTS OF FUN, A PLATFORMING CLASSIC  8 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"I'm very reluctant to try the new Spyro game for PS2, or to buy the Spyro games available for Xbox because Spyro games have stooped to such a low quality I'm afraid to play them. But for the old Spyro games on PSone I have no fears because these ones were developed by Insomniac (Ratchet and Clank, Resistance: Fall of Man), the studio that made the good ones, but sadly no longer makes them. The story is about how Spyro has to rescue all of the dragons who have been imprisoned in crystal cocoons by Nasty Nork. The gameplay functions very well for an old platformer, and never really gives you much trouble because of how smoothly it handles. The flight mechanic works well, but you can't use it all the time. The graphics look nice for the time, but are feeble by today's standards. The environments are bright and colorful and still have a great feel to them. You will spend your time defeating lots of enemies, rescuing your dragon friends, collecting jewels, finding hidden locations, getting health by letting your dragon fly buddy eat butterflies, and have a lot of fun doing all this. As much as this might sound terrible to some gamers, it's actually not repetitive and boring, but in reality a lot of fun. The biggest flaw of the entire game is the camera. The camera is a bit difficult to handle, and will unfortunately cause a few cheap deaths. Also, this game in some ways feels a bit too easy because within a twenty minute period I located 14 dragons. Plus this game simply isn't as fun as it's sequels Ripto's Revenge or Year of the Dragon. But this game is too much fun to really complain about, and I can guarantee no matter what demographic of gaming you fall in you will have a lot of fun on Spyro's PSone adventures.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2008"}

Unfortunately \"great\" isn't one of those things.  While it has a lot of potential in the story, graphics and sound departments, the execution was terrible.  The two teenagers end up being \"main characters,\" even though Basch and Ashe were supposed to be in the original plans.  It's my understanding that Square made this decision in order to please their target audience...  I've been playing the Final Fantasy series ever since the first was released way back in the day, and most of my friends still eagerly await (until recently) the release of new Final Fantasy titles.  They really need to stop with the teen angst theme (and why does Vaan look like a lesbian?)Another complaint is the license system.  While it gives some nice freedoms of character customization, it also could lead one into making everyone the same (especially if you plan on leveling everyone up to high levels.)  I prefer the whole \"level your characters up.  This one gets strength, and this one over here learns to cast spells.\"  Implementing talent trees or jobs as secondary things is fine, but making it too open with more than one character leads to homogeneous characters.The scenery in the game is quite breathtaking, and holds up fairly well even today.  The music is beautifully orchestrated, as usual.  The layout of everything is absurd, however!  You need to roam from town to town and zone to zone in order to buy upgrades, and the items in the  shops change as the game progresses.  This also imposes an issue with hunting the rare spawns.  They're not always where you'd expect.  Sometimes they pop up when you're not strong enough to fight them, and you run the risk of losing hours of leveling time.Ultimately, Square needs to rethink their philosophy about continuing this series.  It had such a great start.  But anything past Final Fantasy IX has pretty much lost me.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Average Joe \"Average Joe\"","summary":"Looks good so far.","reviewText":"The PSP (PlayStation Portable) is Sony's first handheld gaming system.

To be honest, that is one of the qualities i enjoy most about this game. It isn't trying to be SvR2009, nor should it. As great as the SvR controls are, they do come off as a bit stale. Legends offers a new and refreshing control scheme, and i for one welcome it.I am not suggesting that the controls in Legends are better, in fact i do prefer SvR overall. Although, i like that the controls in Legends are different. Also, being of the 80's generation, i will take the Legends roster over anything SvR has to offer on their best day.The control scheme in Legends of Wrestlemania relies more on timing, and less on learning complicated controls. So it is much easier to just pick up and play. Some SvR enthusiast's may consider these controls to be dumbed down for mass appeal. While i do see their point, i also believe that the timing based controls provide a better flow for the game, even better than SvR to some extent.The roster is impressive, but not extensive. There are around 40 legends, with some very obvious ones left out. You can import your SvR2009 roster, but i think that only compromises the nostalgic experience. Hell in a Cell feels a little out of place here, since most of the wrestlers in the game were long retired when that match type came to be.If anyone here remembers the extremely disappointing Legend's of Wrestling series, I would say you would certainly be better served playing this instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2XK","reviewerName":"Prometheus \"diosprometheus\"","summary":"The Worst of them .........","reviewText":"I have every Smackdown game going back to the original, and I have to say this game, despite the great graphics and sound, is simply the worst of them. First of all, let me point out that despite the import function for the Smackdown vs. Raw 2009 game, you will find that not all the wrestlers are imported, for example Paul London won't be imported.  I tried importing more than once and never got all the wrestlers and the same ones were missing all the time.  DLC can't be imported so don't expect any tag matches or matches between the Million dollar man and his son.The Button mashing, however, is what really ruins this game. Other Smackdown games had an intuitive system and remained fairly consistent over the years reaching, in my opinion, its apogee in the 2009 game.  This game totally revamps the system, or rather, reverts it back to some of the earliest non-analog Smackdown games.  This is just plain annoying.  Not only do you have to relearn the system for this game, but also the intuitiveness is lost.  The finisher move, like some of the older Smackdown games, becomes much harder to initiate, and reversals are controlled by hitting a bunch of buttons at the right time instead of hitting the right or left buttons in the 2009 and other recent  games.On the positive note, it is interesting to see what a sissy Hunter Hearst Hemsley was in his earlier days when he had no Motorhead music, and to have great managers back in the WWE like Jimmy Hart and Paul Bearer.Oh yes, forgot to mention no Divas allowed in this game.  Ever since the first Smackdown vs Raw game, the series has been dumbing down the Divas which once upon a time go do all kinds of matches including ladders, bra and panties, and even the elimination chamber and now they are not even allowed in this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2009"}

The tale is brought to life by an all-star voice cast. Fans will revisit this beloved story and come to care for a new troupe of characters in KINGDOM HEARTS II.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"4.5, truly fun","reviewText":"Let's be honest.  On paper, the idea behind Kingdom Hearts sounds like Square-Enix's money wet dream.  Take Final Fantasy, a franchise that has more otaku's than most out there, and add in Disney, another franchise that has a ton of fans and followers.  Meld them together and bam.  Insta-money.  Well, it worked for them.  They raked in a ton of money.  But, it worked for gamers like me.There's a moment early on in the game where the Blue Fairy from Sleeping Beauty gives the main character something new (I'm purposefully being nebulous) then says \"You'll need it because your adventure will be twice as difficult\" as the last.  If only that were true.  Kingdom Hearts II is a mix of great and not-so-great.  And I know my review is going to be pounded into the ground with so many unhelpful votes but I have to be the dissenting opinion in this case.The game begins by force-feeding you mini-games.  Uninspired, boring, repetitive mini-games that you HAVE to play.  You are required to gain 800 munny (the currency) and, in order to do so, you have to take jobs (read: mini games) and you will get paid upon your skill.  There are three levels of payment, 10, 30 and 50.  Do the math and you'll see that, depending on your ability, you will do these mini-games 16-80 times in order to gain the required munny.  They aren't necessarily difficult by any means, but it comes off as needless filler.Speaking of filler, while I think the prologue is necessary and probably has a very important relevance to the plot of the series, I was so ready for the prologue (which is a meaty 3 hours or so) to finally get out of the way so I could actually begin to play the main plot of the story.  I'm happy to say, that once you leave Twilight Town the story finally picks up.  I haven't finished the game, not even close I don't think, but the story is finally getting interesting.  And much more enjoyable than the first.Going back to the difficulty comment, the game is not difficult at all.  In fact, I have been able to set the controller down, keep hitting \"X\" and not pay attention to what's happening on screen.  The result?  All of the enemies dead, and me with full life.  This is accomplished by the fact that enemies drop a ton of health refills and the game is just too easy.  And, I have the difficult set up to the max (there's 3 levels).  I can only imagine the lower difficulties.  Now, I do know that this game is made to be enjoyed by kids and adults alike.  I perfectly understand that and the need for having a very easy difficulty so that Square-Enix can maximize their audience.  But, when the highest level difficulty results to me just hitting down X...I'm disappointed.Which is too bad.  Like some reviewers have said, KH2 utilizes a much much better battle system than the previous titles.  The most important change is complete control over the camera with the Right stick.  No more shoulder button pressing.  But now, also, the summons are different and better, the new abilities to meld with one of your teammates to do amazing amounts of damage, and other similar upgrades.  The AI is also much better this time around and your teammates won't waste as many of your items as before.  All of these make the game easier but more fun.  Unfortunately, with the difficulty already set to a very low standard, problems arise.There are some cool additions though.  They definitely stole from games like God of War and Resident Evil 4 with the triangle button presses.  Some areas are like interactive cutscenes ala the boss fights in God of War.  They are cool and fun.  Not as awesome as some in God of War, but still quite exciting.  And they throw some change into the mix.  The gummi ship has also been muchly improved, thankfully.I also wish we were exploring more new territories.  Sure, some of the territories here are really awesome, Tron and Steamboat Willy come directly to mind, but why must we continue to tread through repeats of the first game?  Yes, I know the story is set to do that.  But there are so many different disney zones that could have been used.  Where is The Black Cauldron?  Also, after you've revisted the places...you're going back to them again!  Yes, there are changes, but you're going back to them.  It seems awfully lazy.One thing I'm always amazed in is Square's ability to maximize their console to create the best product they can graphically.  While if you compare the game to the next Gen systems, the aliasing problems are through the roof at times, the animation style is terrific.  Everyone moves so fluid that you can easily forget at times you are watching polygons not a hand drawn animation.  Its absolutely beautiful to look at.  But the one thought going through my mind is, man what will they be able to do on the next gen systems?The sound is also really well orchestrated and utilized.  The voice actors range from Haley Joel Osment to Ron Perlman to Christopher Lee to Sean Astin to just a ton of voice actors.  Its really amazing.  Its disappointing that some of the cast from Pirate of the Carribean didn't contribute (\"scheduling conflicts\") except, most notably, Geoffrey Rush.I haven't beaten the game yet.  My review could possibly change as I progess.  I just wanted to get some of the important things out there to help people decide.  Honestly, most of these reviews are going to be pointless.  The majority of those who played the first one will undoubtably be right back on board with this one, reviews be damned.  I know I was.  I really like the game.  Don't get me wrong.  The story is absolutely excellent (once we got past the boring prologue) and I love what I'm playing and its fun to see the Disney franchise used in this way (by the way, you might want to pick up chain of Memories and play it (if you can) before playing this game.  The plot directly relates to some events of that game).  I do think that there are some problems, most notably in terms of the difficulty range that can reduce the game to button mashing without thought.  But, really, I'm in it for the story and the remembrances of childhood.Not a 4 star game, but not a 5 star.  If I could, it would be 4.5.  Kingdom Hearts II is a good game that will delight most, if not all, of its fans.  Its detractors will still fume about the problem.  But, if you played the first one, you're doing yourself a great disservice by not picking this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"A.

Now, that I have played the game, I am amazed at all the hype for this game.This is definitely a good game but nothing spectacular.Graphics are decent, gameplay is decent, sound quality is good. But the story is definitely the best part of this game. It is intriguing and engaging. However, if you've played Tomb Raider games before, then this is all familiar territory.The gameplay is a mix of simple platforming and shooting. Oddly the terrorists seem to have unlimited ammo. Also the island seems to be teeming with thousands of them. LOL.You go to a secret Land of the Dead underground area, possibly never before seen by anyone for 500 years and they magically are there. WTF? Very jarring.The platforming in this game is for kids really. Very elementary and simplistic. No challenge at all. The enemies are also quite straightforward and simple (on normal difficulty).There are no real outstanding elements in this game. There are little things here and there to collect as treasures but they're not that tough.Essentially, go to an area, kill some enemies, platform forward, kill more enemies, platform forward. Next cutscene and repeat. There are some jet ski and jeep segments but they're more eyebrow raising than thrilling. I mean who can drive like 10 miles at 40mph in a jungle like that in the middle of an island with no roads?Overall, I like the game but it is an average game tbh.

All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"DM","summary":"Open World RPG","reviewText":"The good:- Best thing about Sacred 2 is by far the Open World. Similarly to Sacred 1, from the very first moment of the game, you have access to most of the world, so - if desired - can travel anywhere. While there are risks with traveling in areas with high level enemies, there is also the reward of getting a lot of experience and unique items. Enemies level up with you, but not at the levels they did in Oblivion or Morrowind.- Second best thing: the ability to play co-op on the same screen is unbeatable. I played this with my spouse and we both enjoyed the game tremendously. In co-op, the camera is fixed at a certain height (zoomed out), but can still be rotated. This is a great plus, because it avoids the camera jerking seen in other games.- Gaming experience is excellent. In terms of gameplay - closest this can be described is as a clone of Diablo 2. Basically, you have the 3 sets of skills for each characters, each with 5 (or 6?) individual skills. You also have the unique items - here rated between 1 and 4 stars. You also have the socketed armors and weapons where you can add different other skills or improve your current ones. You also have 3 different quality levels between the sockets (bronze to gold). Same goes for the classes too - everything is covered from the High Elf (manual states that this is your sorceress), to other similar classes from Diablo 2. Oh, and yes, you can also recruit other characters in your party.- There is an insane amount of improvements over Sacred 1, biggest one being graphics. Game is fully 3D - you will travel to huge cities with detailed architecture, dungeons, islands, all type of terrain. Camera can be a bit of a pain sometimes (in single player), but works great for co-op. You can still ride different things, with each class having a specific ride.- Huge replay value! Many classes and a huge game. In co-op, we have put around 40 hours in the game and still going. In terms of XP, you can gain a maximum of 200 levels for the Bronze Difficulty, but there are additional difficulties that get unlocked, similarly to the 'other' game.The bad:- Clearly, Ascaron could not straight out copy the Diablo 2 menus and skill sets, so they had to reformat them, to look original. This was a tough thing to do, because Diablo 2 had the best menus from the very beginning. Thus, browsing through the Sacred 2 menus continues to be complicated - at least for the first hours of the game. Basically - I do not think there is a controller button left untouched, every time you need to get in the menus. Maybe the Back button?- While there are easily hundreds of quests to be done, there just isn't enough to the story to keep you interested in them. After a while, we stopped following the quest purpose and concentrated on XP. If story is what you are interested in - then Lost Odyssey is probably the best (J)RPG on Xbox.- The game had to be patched, but there still are minor issues here and there. Sometimes the menus do not work right, other times the texture redraw is not quick enough. Not a major issues for us, but may bother other people.The ugly:- Ascaron is bankrupt, so the chances of getting a Sacred 3 are slim to none.Bottom line: this is a great game for fans of Diablo 2, Sacred 1, Titan Quest and Baldur's Gate / Dungeons and Dragons games. While difficult in the beginning, the more you play the more fun it will become.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2009"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Sucker Punch got of lot of things right with the game, but some minor flaws keep the game from being perfect.First, the good stuff. Love the open playground that is Empire City's three areas: the Neon District, the Warren, and the Historic District. Climbing buildings, riding the rails (literally), jumping off rooftops, etc. Cole's powers are great; I especially enjoy using Thunderdrop when jumping off a rooftop. The story missions are interesting, giving you a little bit of everything from search and destroy, escort missions, to one where you have to get rid of giant poison ballons, just like in Tim Burton's Batman movie, with the exception of not having the batwing. The side missions tend to get repetitive, but not to the point where you don't want to do them. The graphics, music, and sounds are excellent, with things like the jingling of Cole's backpack and the cries of the bystanders adding little touches to the game. The storyline is good, with some predictable twists. The Karma choices, which will determine your path, don't affect the overall storyline, but will affect the environment, your character's look, as well as how the public's reaction to you.As for the flaws of the game: even though the platforming is fun, and at times vertigo inducing, its sometimes frustrating when you want Cole to jump or fall in one place and the game will just push him somewhere else. You will also occasionally see enemies or bystanders stuck in a falling animation, or Cole himself will get stuck when climbing a rail or a rooftop. The game is also a bit easy. I only died a few times, even on Hard mode, and the game only has 3 major boss fights.But again, the flaws are things that will not get in the way of enjoying this game. So pop in the disc and start playing. The people of Empire City need a Hero... but that doesn't mean it has to be you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}

There isn't a lot of development that happens in this game, but rather tying up the story. For the bulk of God of War III, Kratos is busy killing everyone who gets in-between him and Zeus. However, the last hour or so of the story is truly amazing, and the ending is in my opinion one of the best in gaming ever.- Gameplay: It's a God of War game. There's nothing directly new to the gameplay but it has been refined -- somehow -- even more. The unbelievable precision of past titles is once again here in the third installment, and this time around it's even better. Puzzles are still here as well as simple and challenging platforming. The game really does pack in a lot of variety while maintaining a consistent level of quality.- Graphics: One of the top 5 best looking games ever. In terms of scale, nothing comes even close, and no, I'm not exaggerating. Kratos is easily one of the most detailed characters in any game. Animations during cutscenes aren't great at times, but gameplay animations are solid. This is a stunning game.- Audio: Voice acting can be up and down at times. Kratos is great as usual as well as several returning characters. However, some of the dialogue is a bit out of place and can detract from the experience for a moment. On the other hand, sound effects and music are outstanding. The score in God of War III has delivered on all fronts, and the main theme is one of the best in any action game.- Replay Value: God of War III is 11 hours of greatness. Every moment is engrossing and enjoyable. While it is short, there are videos, unlockables, trophies and move to achieve. While there is no multiplayer or co-operative experience, this game has about as great of play value as you will see in any other AAA single-player title.Rating:Story: 9.0Gameplay: 10.0Graphics: 10.0Controls: 9.5Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 9.0Overall: 9.7Last Thoughts:Own it - God of War III is in my opinion the single greatest hack-and-slash game ever made.

And what a game this is with dramatic visual upgrades to its predecessors in the series. Hard to believe, I know, because I & II looked so good already. But....This may be the best looking game I have ever seen on the PS3. There is so much going on and so much to look at that there is replay value in just that alone. The game is presented in native 1080i (an upgrade from the Collection's 720p presentation), and the picture is just flawless. The game's DTS Surround audio will fill the room and rumble you right out home theater seat.Gameplay, while familiar to anyone that's played the first two in the series, never gets old or too familiar. I'm not a big fan of timed button presses and button mashing; I mostly just like shooting, but man God of War III is fun to play. My gaming horizons have officially been broadened. God of War III is one well put together game. The Quick Time Executions are easier, MUCH easier, than the first two in the series, because the buttons to press appear in the corresponding portions of your TV screen (i.e. a triangle execution appears on the top of the screen, square on the left, etc.). Analog L & R stick rotation QTEs are still a pain in the ash-covered neck though.Remember the movieClash of the Titans(with its remake scheduled for April 2010)? God of War III is that but you're IN the movie. You are Kratos, a former captain in the Spartan army and fallen God of War that now sets out to kill Zeus, the ruler of Mount Olympus. The game starts right where God of War II left off, and there will be blood! I'd highly recommend playing the I & II Collection prior to playing III, but by no means is it necessary. You can always go back and play the originals as prequels.The story is well told and flows like a well written book (or movie!). There are tons of cool mythological monsters and you get a fair selection of weapons to kill them with. The repetitiveness of battling some of the same monsters throughout the game is limited by some of the ways that you can execute...well...executions. The kills often look a little different depending on which weapon or brutal attacks you make. Ah, yes, nothing like ripping the privates off of an anatomically correct ogre!After playing so many 'next gen' 3rd person games released for the PS3 (likeUnchartedandDead Space) I was looking for God of War III to upgrade the controls to be able to look around at the scenery and my surroundings with the R stick while walking and moving around from room to room and during battles. But just like the older PS2 games the R stick is for rolling and evading enemies which is kind of a negative if I had to come up with one. God of War III has added \"magical pedestals\" here and there (according to the manual, but I haven't found one) that you need to be standing on that allow a full look around, although with a game that's so visually stunning I'm surprised that \"looking\" wasn't totally integrated into the entire playthrough of the game.My only other complaint would be the relatively long in-betweens from save point to save point. Nothing worse than getting through a particularly tough battle or puzzle only to find that the next save point is still 5 or 10 minutes away, but my loving wife says that it's time to head out to dinner, we're already late. Ever seen a grown man cry? Game makers need to take an example from theBioshock seriesthat let's you save anywhere and everywhere!A few complaints have been lodged about the game being too short...about 10 hours for a veteran gamer. But I'm no vet, and even if I was I can't see EVER finishing this game in under 10 hours. No, there are hours of entertainment in God of War III. On the Easy setting one could clock in at obver 10 hours; I'd recommend at minimum the Normal setting because the Easy setting is a walk in the park...even for me.For the few and far between that haven't played I & II, just play the Collection as soon as you're done with III, and after that you'll be ready for another go-around with III. That should take until just about summer, no? And like I said earlier, even if you don't need or want to play I & II, there's a ton of replay value in God of War III.Tremendously fun game.

The pictures are generally well done, although sometimes it can be frustrating when you click on an object and the game doesn't register your click (presumably because you're clicking on the wrong pixel).The mini-games, such as putting together a jigsaw puzzle, playing mahjongg tiles or playing concentration, are fun enough when they come between the find-the-object puzzles, as part of the main game. You can also unlock them to play them on their own, and I found them far too easy to be entertaining for very long in that mode.This game is fun, and it's always nice to have a game that you can play for short periods (as opposed to something like Zelda or Final Fantasy, which tends to be played for longer times at a sitting).

It's an adrenaline-charged thrill-ride that plays with it's FPS mechanics, encouraging creativity on behalf of the player. Throw in a sharp story with an amusing sense of humor to boot and you have one of the most exciting FPS games in recent memory!'Bulletstorm' puts you in the role of Grayson Hunt, one of the dumbest (and funniest) FPS protagonists since Duke Nukem! Grayson's a former soldier turned space pirate who, through a wreckless (and intoxicated) act of revenge lands him on planet that was a former vacation resort and now overrun with monsters and criminals. With his surviving crew member and a stranded soldier named Trishka, Grayson and his comrades have to fight their way off planet while he tries for another shot at revenge. The story of Bulletstorm, despite it's low-brow sensibilites (and d*ck jokes) is actually very well thought-out and engaging and actually makes you interested in these characters and their story. The ending is a bit of a let-down (and predictable) but the narrative carries this game better than any other FPS I've played.While a good story and characters are a plus, they're nothing if the gameplay doesn't match. Thankfully, 'Bulletstorm' is just as fun to play as it is to listen to. There's the usual running and gunning mechincs, but added to this is an electric whip/grappling hook that allows you to latch on to enemies (and other objects) and combine them with your guns and melee attacks for some wacky kills. Everything in the gameplay can be used to creatively dispatch an enemy and 'Bulletstorm' actually rewards you points for your kills which you use to purchase upgrades and weapons. The more creative (and tasteless) the kill, the more points you get.The pacing and level design in 'Bulletstorm' is also exceptional. While the game progresses on a linear scale, the environments and enemies are designed for maximum effect, so much so that you practically feel like you're playing through an epic film. Even the scripted events give way to some of the most memorable and exciting levels I've ever seen in an FPS with a giant wheel of death and a remote-controlled dinosaur being the standouts!Unfortunately, while 'Bulletstorm' is entertaining right to the end (and never wears out it's welcome) it is a very SHORT game. I finished it at around six hours and that was taking my time to find collectables.

I had heard(almost sickeningly too much) praise about Masqerade Redemption but never really got around to buying the title.  I love this game and am buying redemption on order as of this writing.  Masq Bloodlines lets you pick your clan whereas redemption didn't but it is getting a chance too.  I actually like the brujah better than any other clan anyway because he is not only a good fighter but his talants can be put else where at level ups.  The bonus to brawl is nice and lets me spend a few on other \"talents\" like dodge and subterfudge(anyone needs it).  Gangrel is also a good choice and is more well rounded than bruja and can \"Hulk out\" as it were. Allowing a +10 to Strength and others. Don't know if it stacks with animal form though.  The option to be evil pays little consequence and can get you on the road to good later(just say, your a misguided fool who learns his lesson thats' all).  Suck blood, violate the masq because you get it all back later if you just make the effort.  Beasting out is a good thing in the combat zone(and satisfies my hunger to beat sum moron to mush).  Mental crazy guy(not the Malkavian) who limbs the bounty guy is a satisfactory beat when you beast out as a Gangrel low on blood and humanity.  Priceless!  You pick from seven clans(I like them all, not a dud in the bunch like most RPGs).  Nosferatu is fun but is hard to scocialise and even if you use the sewer system you get caught quite a lot when you emerge.  Cops don't take kindly to you when you view the body on the Pier docks in Santa Moni, only vampires accept you on the beach, no where else are you safe from prying eyes(and cell phone cameras).  Dr. David Banner had it easy compared to the acursed cell phone.The RP element is better than any mideval or Space RPG I can think of a few.  People praised Redemption and I used to find that nausiating, now I know why they praised it.  I do too!  No weak, useless stats.  Charisma and even appearence have an important place here.  the ability to soak bullets gives incentive to raise Stamina, it works wonders later on beleve me! rifflemen are the acursed bane of Vampires.  The tutorial dude wasn't kidd'n about that!  You have many choices and they take some noggin nashing.  Don't buy the hint book, Prima is notorious for being condemning to certain systems of point spending and classes which I find that later these classes work.  Icewind Dale's(1+2) stratedgy guide sucked and makes you afraid to play certain characters.  I say go right ahead and it is more effective than you think!  Gangrels are started out with skills; to up melee I assume as in \"warrior skills\", but brawl needs attention too for blood feasting.  If you put something into a skill or feat not ascociated with your class, this game will forgive you and it is very benefitial.  Everyone needs sneak, security and subterfudge to effectively get info and girls to drain.  Also computer hacking for info and emails of people that need to be exploited.The graphics are excellent as far a quality more than the technology(though it is advanced 3d)  Girls are well drawn and the pretty ones have cute faces and bodies.  The only thing is AI is sometimes lame.  The guy in the diner(The chef) is deadeyed and staires at the cooking pot while you fire away at the rifflemen.  \"Gawd I'm bored, I wish I could quit this job and watch the mold grow on my ceiling.\"  some of the humans seem more dead than the vampires(the generic non-vocal ones that is).  I still think it's fun and realistic and the way-faced humans just add to the charm and humor.  The dialoge is just that snappy and humorous and with personality, not that generic crap where they try to be funny like on TV.  Great game.  Better than Baldur's Gate, Star Wars Republic Knights, IWD and all the rest.  If not for the bugs I would rate it five.  If you could faction like Planescape Torment, I would rate it six.

{"product_name":"B000E0VMVM","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"It's not happening this time around","reviewText":"I've been a huge fan of the Shadow Hearts series, but \"From the New World\" is the weakest so far. I might be a little biased as I played it immediately after finishing Final Fantasy 12 and it just can't compare to that, but even so I remember having a far better time playing the first game and the sequel, \"Covenant\". The story of Yuri and Alice really made the first game memorable, and the second was almost as good, with Karin making a very sympathetic female lead. This time, however, I am not warming to any of them.The story this time is a brand new one. A 16 year old called Johnny Garland has his own detective agency in New York (like all 16 year olds do), and one day a chance visit from a stranger begins a missing person hunt that leads to uncovering an evil force that threatens to wipe out the entire world. Along the way he gathers a team of new friends and so the stage is set for a typical RPG. Now, Shadow Hearts is famous for having off the wall characters and this time is no exception. I thought having the puppet master Gepetto and Princess Anastasia as part of your team in Covenant was whacky enough, but this time around you'll be joined by a giant drunken Kung-Fu cat, a kittenish female Vampire and a comedy Ninja. The trouble is that I'm having a harder time becoming attached to them in this game because they just don't seem to be original creations. Frank the Ninja is a direct copy of Joacim, with his weapon upgrades from found objects, and Hilda the childish and annoying vampire changes form between being fat, skinny or a bat in the same way that Keith and Joacim did. Shania the indian squaw can shape-shift into elemental fusion monsters like Yuri did, and characters learn new moves and spells by finding documents or manuscripts like Karin did. As this is supposed to be a completely new game, I found this amount of repetition in the characters to be very disappointing.Another thing is that in this day and age, there is no excuse for the playable environments to be so small. New York is represented by four \"boroughs\", most with just one street and no visitable buildings. Go the wrong way or step off the kerb and you drift back to the world map, showing you how tiny each location is. There's no moveable camera and the scantest populations of NPCs to talk to in each place. The dungeons are little better, relegated to just a few rooms or stages, with no more than about three varieties of enemy in each. You can do each dungeon level and boss in a single sitting and it sometimes seems like the game is whizzing by. The game still plays with \"alternative\" versions of real places, but it doesn't impress much this time around, with Alcatraz prison and the Roswell UFO site being very lack-lustre.There are some new ideas, but they are not all good. The stellar chart magic system is terribly clumsy and you have to navigate endless permutations of screens and options to set each character up with decent spells. Plus the stellar charts themselves have to be modified at shops to hold the better magic spells, which makes it even more of a bother. One good thing is that each character has unique abilities, which means that they are not endlessly interchangeable like in some RPGs (even in Final Fantasy 12 you could have built up all the characters in exactly the same way), and this gives some variety.The best thing about the series, though, is still it's trademark Judgement Ring system, and if you enjoyed the first two games for this reason you will be well served here. The battles have even become more complicated with the introduction of the \"Stock\" guage, which acts like a meter that fills up when you give or receive damage. This can then be used to unleash devastating linked attacks once filled. Managing Stock is crucial to a good battle, and I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the Combo mechanism, with great results for those who have good reflexes (missing the correct symbol button and breaking a good combo is frustrating but fair, because if you want that 4 chain Combo magic you have to work for it!).My overall impression is that \"From The New World\" has been created to ride on the glory of the games before it by simply copying them. It's nowhere near as impressive as \"Covenant\", and all it's ideas are second hand. It's also trying too hard to be funny. There's scarcely a serious moment in here, or anything approaching the depth or the adult orientated themes that the series did so well in the past. It's all now just a giant cartoon, and while Kung-Fu cats and fat vampires are funny for a while, they don't draw you into the story at all. There is scarcely any plot to speak of as it is, the whole game is just a chase from start to finish, following the villains all around the world. The fun in the game lies with the battles and becoming an expert using the Judgement Ring. Battles are complex and even random encounters need some forethought, especially as there are bonuses available for very good performances (perfect ring turns, enemies killed without having a single turn, etc), so there is a lot to enjoy. Boss battles can be long, but at the same time, the game never gets particularly difficult, and levelling up sems to happen very rapidly so you can easily make a powerhouse team to face almost anything. Sidequests are good - there are seperate side stories for each character which is a nice aspect, and something of a tradition now in the series. It's a shame that these good aspects are not complementing a more impressive basic game, because as it stands, the Judgemant Ring and the good \"extras\" are the only thing lifting a very short and mediocre RPG plot and characters into being a passable game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2007"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"A good foundation for great improvement in a second game","reviewText":"If you aren't a patient person, this game is not for you. Now, that's not to say the game is slow, because it's not. But there are true flaws in this game that you need to accept before you can really enjoy this game. So let me lay it out:The Good:-Strong story, with characters that feel real (within reason, I'm looking at you, SIE. And you, Brayko). The story is complex, and actually makes you think.-The gameplay mechanics wise, is pretty bad. Glitching, clipping, getting stuck in floors or in walls, the cover system...but what I mean is the way it works in terms of the story. What the gameplay does do is make most situations very tense, and make you wonder might be happening next. AND, unlike a game I liken this to (Mass Effect), I loved the ability to be able to play through using stealth. The option is always on the table, and I liked that.-Your choices matter. Now, your choices matter in Mass Effect, but nowhere near the way they matter in Alpha Protocol. And I'm glad AP didn't limit the types of choices you get to make. Because there are a number of big choices you get to make, along with more simple ones. The one drawback to this system is the conversation system. Sometimes the choices they give you aren't clear. For instance, at the end, one of the choices is \"Betrayal.\" What does that mean? Am I going to betray someone? Or am I going to talk about being betrayed? Along with that drawback is is the timer. It's both good and bad. It adds a dynamic feel to conversations you have, however, sometimes a character you are talking to is talking, and the timer starts, and you don't know what they are going to finish their sentence with, so how can you make a conversation choice that quick? I like the timer, but I think it could be improved slightly to allow you to at least digest what someone is saying before replying.-Being able to upgrade weapons and gadgets is nice.-The different ways you can play through the game. There are a lot of contacts and alliances possible in the game, but only a set number of missions and ways you can interact with these people. What that means is that you don't have time to court everyone. If you spread yourself too thin you'll end up with no real allies.-No morality bar. We have all played those games where are \"Goodness\" or \"Badness\" is tracked. This game does not, and I love it. There is no right and no wrong, only the choices you make -- just like in real life. It's refreshing.The Bad:-Weapons. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but Alpha Protocol seems to rely on a skill/chance system when firing weapons is concerned. If you ever played Morrowind, you know how frustrating it can be when you're right in front of someone trying to slash them with a sword and you are hitting nothing but air. In that same way you can be right in front of someone firing your weapon and you'll miss. It's aggravating.-The mini games. See longer reviews for just how frustrating these can be. My advice to anyone who hasn't played it is just to invest in the sabotage skill and use overclock a lot. It will ease some frustrations.-Out of place exaggeration. Why the game works for me is because it feels grounded, like it's something that could actually happen. But then they throw a character like SIE at you (Russian commando warrior woman who marches around in camo pants and a very revealing top. Really? That's the way a hardened mercenary dresses? Really, a completely unarmored and skinny Russian mob boss is the most difficult boss battle? It just makes no sense.-Your safehouse computers. Yep, I'm complaining about this -- If you have played the game, you saw the sweet setup in all of the safehouses. However, it's completely illogical. The servers powering your ONE computer you are using looks like they could run 200-400 computers at fast speeds. I'm not kidding, there are like 15 servers for one computer. Now, I understand the need for encryption and redundancy defenses and what not. But seriously, 15 servers? It's a minor point, but when I saw it I was like...WAT.Conclusion: If you have the patience for a good story (which is becoming an all-too-rare-commodity these days at the expense of clunky gameplay and frustrating mini-games, don't pass this game up. With the number of ways possible to play through this game, it's definitely one of the few games in recent memory I can recommend even at about $53. I intentionally left out any mention of graphics in my review, because the game is immersive enough that you don't really notice it. Yes, sometimes they show close-ups that really show how awful the textures look up close...but in truth, if graphics are that important to you, you aren't someone who is going to like this game anyways. Anyone gone back and played Goldeneye on the N64 lately? Fantastic game, but these days it looks like you're wearing a pear of foggy glasses, the graphics are so simple. It's the game that matters, not the graphics so much.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006JKAS16","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Ramos","summary":"The Greatest Platforming Trilogy In Gaming History Is Back!","reviewText":"If you're looking for a review of the games themselves, I suggest looking up the original reviews for the games here;Jak and Daxter: The Precursor LegacyJak IIJak 3. I will simply be reviewing the new features for the trilogy package as a whole.1. HD: The visuals in this game have definitely had a huge overhaul. The frame rate is a smooth 60fps, with hardly any hiccups or slowdowns. The character models look much more detailed and fine tuned. Environments look beautiful as well, and seeing many iconic locations remastered with detailed HD graphics can only be described as nostalgic. I hope they keep up the good work they've done with updating these PS2 classics when they make the Ratchet & Clank Collection.2. 3D: For many, this won't matter since the number of 3D TVs in households is still a slim number, but for those who do (myself included) it's a feature well worth mentioning. They did a great job making the visuals really \"pop\". The multiple layers are well placed for dynamic depth perception. It' really been a joy to play the trilogy in 3D so far. You can adjust the depth to your liking, but I found the default setting to be just about right.3. Trophies: If you're looking for a few challenges while replaying the trilogy, Naughty Dog's got you covered. The trophies range from challenging to pushover, but it's still been fun collecting them, as they have you doing things you might have otherwise never tried. The platinum trophy should give gamers a pretty big challenge to obtain, but with games like these, you'll enjoy every moment of the effort.Naughty Dog's Jak Trilogy has long been a staple of the platforming world and replaying these games is a stark reminder why. It's a steal for $40, but for any less it's a must own! They just don't make games like these anymore, and they probably never will again, so it's definitely worth picking up a copy and reliving the joys of playing the original trilogy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!)","summary":"A Fantastic RPG Game That Gives A Lot Of Fun And Entertainment","reviewText":"This game is what I was really hoping more RPG games would be like, meaning that you can actually live the life of a character of the game world instead of just doing quests and slaying the monsters.  In the game you'll get your own farm and house to start you off and later as you build up both in crops and money you can expand your house to be able to do more,  such as have a forge to make weapons or farming equipment,  have a laboratory to make elixirs to help crops or yourself while doing dungeon exploration, have a kitchen to cook up wonderful cuisine to give to your friends  neighbors or potential wife.  The game also allows you to try and woo the girl of your choice and win her hand in marriage as long as you meet her expectations,  and of course you do have the dungeon explorations and quests you can do but don't feel to rushed as there isn't a real time limit for you to finish those quest at a determined.  I just started this game a few days ago and am still amazed at how fun it turned out to be,  as I said you can build up money by raising crops but you can increase the product you sell by cooking it up to be a more tasty dish or item such as turning cherries or oranges into jam and getting twice what you would normally get them for,  or forging and crafting a weapon or item to sell for a bit more as well.  That is what I truly enjoy this game so much as you don't have to wait at a guild for the next quest or try and finish said quest because there's a time limit to complete it.  The game does have the standard Rpg dungeon bosses you have to defeat to open certain new areas in the world or to continue with the main quest,  and while there won't be blood and gore the bosses are pretty tough so before tackling them straight on I'd advise building up your players level before facing them.  The animation and artwork are similar to the games Eternal Sonata and Tales Of Vespira and the music is a nice little touch to the game, the music isn't really fast paced heart stopping music but more of a relaxing soothing music again similar to ES and TOV. If you just want the fighting and bloody and gruesome battles Rpg's than this game won't be for you but if you want something a little bit different from the usual rpg's we've played in the past try this one out,  you might just find how enjoyable this game turns out for you...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2009"}

Arkham City is a fantastic game. The graphics are very good, and I like the art style (although it took a little time to grow on me). The musical score is epic, and the voice acting is top notch. The writing and story are very well done, easily as good as the Batman comics or cartoons. Where this game really shines is the gameplay.

Navigating the city is easy and fun, and using all of Batman's gadgets is rewarding.If you are a fan of Batman in any of his many incarnations (shows, comics, movies, etc.) and you've ever wondered what it would be like to don the cape and cowl and fight crime as the Dark Knight, Arkham City will make your dreams come true.

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"One of THE Best Online Multiplayers with a Catch","reviewText":"I actually first played Call of Duty World at War on the Xbox Live Gold but after a while I realized that all I was playing was this game online and I was paying a lot per month for the online service. So I purchased Call of Duty World at War for the Playstation 3 as online play here is free. I didn't notice any difference in graphics or game play. Call of Duty World at War is one of the most fun and addicting games that I have ever played online. I prefer this over Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2. Why? Because the mechanics are better and the graphics to me are better online. But there is a catch. There are cheaters in this game and they ruin the match whenever they come around. You'll find these players who are invincible or very difficult to kill because it takes more shots to take them down. Now I don't understand how it can be fun for these cheaters but it is definitely not fun to play a match when they are on. If you do encounter them, you can report them to Activision by writing up your list of offenders' tags and sending your document to uploads@activision.com. There is one player who is actually doing something about it and his tag is REPORT-A-CHEATER. He was very helpful to me and would highly recommend that you contact him on how to deal with these cheaters. He was the one that gave me the email address to Actision's reporting system. Be sure to go to Activision's website and then click on the chat. Then from there ask the customer representative for a case number which you will use whenever sending your reports to Activision. I now feel empowered against these cheaters instead of feeling helpless. I encourage you to do the same. I have seen cheaters come back stripped of their rank after a long hiatus. After the first ban they can have their console banned from joining online play. So it does pay to report these creeps. If you can overlook these cheaters, this game is the best for online play. I can spend two hours on online play without even noticing how long I have played. This game can suck many hours of your time as it is extremely addicting. Well, I gotta go now to get my Call of Duty fix.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001TD6SN0","reviewerName":"Facelord","summary":"An imperfect game, but the best RPG-fighting game I've ever played","reviewText":"The action in Dissidia is fast-paced, fairly easy to learn but(wait for it!) hard to master. You press the square button for HP attacks and the O button for attacks to an enemy's Brave points. If you have 2168 Brave points and to an HP attack, you do 2168 damage to the enemy; if you take out an enemy's Brave points altogether you get a boost of Brave points from a pool of Brave points that shows during a battle in the middle of the screen at the very bottom.The gameplay's solid, but it can be very frustrating to fight an AI opponent that's ten levels under you and lose every single time because of some stupid reason like JECHT BEING OVERPOWERED. The STORY, however, is one of the worst stories I've ever had the mispleasure of experience. If I made a drinking game that requires me and my friends to drink a shot of alcohol every single time characters say something along the lines of \"I fight to protect my friends!\" or anything involving \"the darkness\" we'd all die by the end of an hour. They could've gone the Super Smash Bros route and kept the characters silent outside of attack noises and made a wordless story that everyone can enjoy, but they had to do some dark-versus-light BS and botch 90% of the writing in the game. It's not smart writing, it's just meaningless excess. Less is more, and when will Square Enix' writers learn that DARKNESS isn't a good plot device? It's nonsensical and totally devoid of any meaningfulness. I've played over 70 hours of this game because it has lots of content and the gameplay is solid, but when I buy a Final Fantasy game I expect the story to be at least passable- this is offensively bad.The most notable aspect of this game is that it's so unique, is there really any other fighting game like this? It's just as much of an RPG as it as a fighting game, and the movement is all 3D. Normally I dislike fighting games in general but this game's the exception. I just wish the story wasn't so horrible and that those Jecht encounters weren't so frustrating.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

You have to make the right move or either you'll set off a chain reaction(which isn't bad, but it gets annoying from time to time.) or you'll run out of DP's(Destruction Points).  Which in my case is bad when you get thru the stage and get your results.  You also get to equip a lot of cool stuff that'll help you in battle and exspecially when fighting Chaos.Dissdia has all of your all time favorite characters starting from 1 all the way to 10.  It's a very exciting game and I was happy when I got this.  You can do a lot of things in here like...hmmm...fighting against a ghost character, or playing in wifi mode with friends and trade in friend cards so that your friends can challenge you and you recieve Moogle mail from of course the Moogles.  You can either fight in Casual or Hard mode.  You also have the villians from in here.  Like Golbez, Kelfka, Kuja and our all time favorite...Sephiroth!  It's a really neat game with lots of challenges and themes.  Basically to put it short, you can either choose Cosmos; The Goddess of Harmoney, or Chaos; The God of Discord.  Which team will you pick?  Good or evil?  Lol!And once you play with your own character, they'll have their own theme to the stage their in.I don't care what people think about this game.

While the 20GB drive was always a little on the puny side, the 120GB seems to be almost overkill.  I highly recommend this larger drive for any Xbox Live users who* Download a lot of \"permanent\" content such as \"Guitar Hero\"/\"Rock Band\" tracks, Xbox Originals games (which are typically about 5 - 8 GB each), etc.* Rip lots of music on to their Xbox for customized game soundtracks.* Watch movies/videos on their Xbox, especially in HD format.  This could become even more crucial if the reported partnership with Netflix to deliver downloaded content is ever announced.Copying the contents of your old drive is facilitated via a utilities disc and copy cable, both of which are included with this 120GB drive package.  After following a few simple on-screen prompts, it counted down the 1 1/2 hours that it took to copy my almost-full 20GB drive.  This step was very easy to complete and I had no trouble with any of my previous-purchased content, games, etc. running on the new drive.The only downside to the copy process is that it seemed to also \"revive\" a lot of the promotional and demo content that I'd long ago deleted from my old drive.  I'm not sure if the copy process actually restored these files from the original drive or if it is designed to load them from its own source (maybe the utilities disc?), but it was a minor annoyance to have to go back and re-delete all of these unwanted files one by one.Many of the reviews of the Xbox 360 120GB hard drive touch on the cost.  Yes, it's overpriced compared to standard hard disks, but it's also the only such peripheral available for the 360, so the griping is a moot point.  Simply put, if you download a lot of Xbox Live content, then someday you'll need more space than the original 20GB drive allows.  And there are ample opportunities to offset the cost on the secondary market such as selling your old drive (there's no way for the 360 to handle multiple drives at once anyway, so it's just a doorstop once you install the 120GB) and the copy cable.Again, if you want to experience the most out of your Xbox Live account, then just bite down on the inflated cost of this peripheral and then enjoy all of that spare room.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2008"}

The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"C.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Keith Doyle","summary":"Enjoyable Excellence","reviewText":"Any gamer with an open mind will simply enjoy Kingdom Hearts. Disney or Square fans will absolutely fall in love with it!The game oozes quality everywhere.  Beautiful artwork and animation abounds.  I loved the music!

It was a real treat to hear beloved Final Fantasy characters speak for the first time.The battles were never repetitive for me.  Unlike most players I didn't have a problem with the controls at all...once I got a turbo-fire controller, that is. The camera was the only thing that needed improvement, I thought.Like most Squaresoft games there was a significant amount of tedious item-gathering, but it wasn't as frustrating as in Final Fantasies 7-10.  This is only a problem for those gamers who are perfectionists and have to utilize EVERY SINGLE THING in the game...like me.My personal favorite moment in Kingdom Hearts was finding Sephiroth for the first time and hearing his One Winged Angel theme music.

The game offers 12 unique  single-player missions and support for up to 16 players via the network adapter  and a broadband connection.","reviewerName":"Therabbitssing \"on the rock that spews lava..\"","summary":"Not a gimmick...it's the real deal","reviewText":"Having watched the progress of this title over the months, I came away very pleased with the final product.  SOCOM US Navy SEALS is a great tactical shooter.  Those looking for a FPS where you go in guns blazing are in for a surprise, as this is not that type of game.  And it shouldn't be, since Zipper had input from the US Military on this game.The headset/microphone is what makes the difference in this game.  Yes, the graphics are great, the sounds perfect, and the levels (both on and offline) superb.  The headset makes a good game into a superb one.  You use it to control your team in the single player mode, barking orders to them and surprisingly, it works without a hitch.  I tried using accents, changing my voice, and all sorts of things to get the thing not to work and yet it works.  I swear at least 99 percent of the time the game recognizes your commands.  It  sounded like a gimmick, but it works so well I was surprised.And now we get to what many of you will buy the game for.  Online play.  Yes, play with up to 15 other people online via a broadband connection (you do need the PS2 network adapter) and take the role of a SEAL or a Terrorist.  There are 3 modes online:Supression: your standard deathmatch...take out the other team.Demolition:  Sort of a capture the flag game where two teams race for a bomb in the middle of the map and has to plant it at the other team's base.  If it's planted at your base, you've got 30 seconds to defuse it.  A lot of fun when you have 7 others on your team against another team of 8.Extraction: My favorite mode:  SEALS have to rescue and extract via a helicopter at least 2 of 3 captured hostages while the terrorist team keeps them from accomplishing their mission.There are 12 online maps, and all are large and suit the game very well.  All the weapons are very realistic for a console game, and the online play is intoxicatingly addicting.  Add the headset with realtime voice chat in which you can actually communicate via voice with your teammates and the game goes up another notch.SOCOM does have a few bugs in it's online play, namely a player list which shows who's on each server, but not where you are playing.  Hard to find your friends this way.  Another is some glitches where a person can hide and not be killed in a few of the onlin maps.  Other than that, the play is great, with lag only rearing it's head once in awhile.Those without online capabilities still have 12 missions to go through and will still have a lot of fun playing the game.  I never thought this game would be so great, but it is well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2002"}

Deep multiplayer","reviewText":"It is hard to believe many people are not feeling this game. Initially, I thought this game was not going to bring much to the table on the single campaign or the multiplayer, but I was dead wrong.Single Campaign - The story is very gripping, thrilling, and epic. MW2 nor any other COD campaigns has a story, such as this one. Of course, the setting is during the Cold War Era. Your character is being interrogated by some unknown individuals about his role in various classified missions. His explanations are played out in the missions, which you will endure. The levels are filled with everything you can think of, which is mass enemies, and many explosions. Players will fight in various places, such as Cuba, Vietnam jungles, the dark corridors and rooftops of Kowloon city in Hong Kong, Laos, and the snowy landscapes of Russia (cliche').Graphics/Sound - The graphics will not exactly remind players of MW2. However, they are still superb. On the contrary, the characters remind me of how the characters look on GTAIV. The sound is ok. However, if you are looking for a FPS with more realistic sounding weapons, I recommend BFBC2 or MOH.Gameplay - The gameplay of this game is the same as any other COD title, which is a good thing.Multiplayer Pros - I am glad that Treyarch got rid of the noob perks, such as commando (most hated), one man army, double wielded shotguns, tactical insertions, ridiculous explosion radius, painkiller, and many others we have grown to hate in MW2. Therefore, the multiplayer relies more on skill.The multiplayer is deeper and more customizable than any COD title. The player has many, many options. The greatest new option is the theater mode, which allows players to replay and record previously played matches. After each match, it is saved for review. During replay, bars is shown, which gives the player the options to either play, fast forward, or record the previously played match. The player has the options to replay the whole match or go straight to each kill or death.Another new mode is called Combat Training. This allows players to practice multiplayer with or without friends in the maps against CPU enemies. The skill level can be tweaked to your liking. These enemies have good AI. They have some good aim, and will nail you. I would recommend this option for people, who are new to the series or want to get a feel for fighting in new maps.Other multiplayer options are to earn COD cash, which can buy new weapons. Then, they have a mode, which you can sign a contract to earn COD cash. For example, you can sign a contract to earn COD cash for knifing an enemy in the back. The contracts constantly change, which is a good thing. There are many other game modes. Of course, if you have not been hiding under a rock, you know about the Wager Matches and the One Shot matches to name a few.Multiplayer Cons - The selections of weapons are not as deep as other COD titles. Not to mention, the hit detection is horrible. Either the weapons are not as powerful or the enemies can take more bullets. There have been times, where I have shot an enemy four times, and I was not able to drop him.The Verdict - In my opinion, this is the best COD because of the single campaign, and the tremendous depth of the multiplayer. The many options can keep players very busy for a while. At this point, I do not know what options are left for multiplayer in upcoming COD titles. Treyarch really dug deep with the various amounts of options they gave to the player. The graphics are a shade below COD standard. However, if that is not your hang up, this title is worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

It excels in every aspect and is an amazing thrill ride. The game plays a lot like many other third person shooters namely Uncharted, because there are some jumps and ledges for Bond to climb around to kill his enemies in this installment. These little added platforming sequences add some great depth to the already stable shooter mechanics. Added as well are driving missions. These are done extremely well by the developers behind Project Gotham Racing. They look great and the cars handle with some great precision. After all what is James Bond without some car chases. There isn't an over abundance of them but they are of great quality and add the movie-like experience that Bond fans want.The graphics are a lot better than I expected. Some areas look better than others but overall the game is gorgeous. There are also quite a few cut scenes which is rare for a Bond game. They are well done and add even more to that movie-like feel the developers strived for. Daniel Craig along with Judi Dench lend there voices and it really adds to your feeling of actually controlling Bond.There are both stealth missions and full out action ones. Also in the stealth missions you can just kill everything and not be stealthy at all if you wish. You use your smart phone to hack cameras and computers and it is your tried and true gadget of choice. Most of the time you have to do a quick time event to hack the electronic device. These QTE events are fun and done pretty well. There nothing extraordinary but they do make you earn the use of your gadget.The game uses a cover system that woks rather well. You can easily switch cover and guide along it in order to position yourself to kill the target. Another big part of the combat system is the physicality that Craig brings to Bond. You will probably kill a lot of enemies by punching them in the face. The game rewards you for doing so by giving you a free head shot. Every person that you take down with your fist gives you a Bond moment where you are guaranteed one head shot. It works similar to the system used in Splinter Cell Conviction. You zoom in on a guys head and pull the trigger. No one can shoot you while you are in this mode.The story is also a great highlight. Is it the best spy tale ever? No, but it does have it's share of twists and turns, and really keeps you hooked to find out who's behind the curtain pulling all the strings. Also there are a ton of of Bond type moments that you expect. There are funny and some unbelievable moments that come with the territory and are very typical of a Bond movie or game in this case.This game is in no doubt my choice for GOTY. It plays with great precision in all aspects. The story, car chases, Bond moments, and just plain kick ass quality that we expect from a movie all inter twined in this amazing game. If you are a fan of James Bond or just 3rd person shooters in general pick this game up I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2010"}

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful.

The world map is terrible. Very grainy and terrible music. Not to mention uninteresting. The best thing about a Final Fantasy game is the amazing storyline. Not so in this. I'm not really clear what the storyline is in this game and I've played it. You never get to know the enemy in this game or why he/she is evil. That makes fighting them pointless. The fighting in this game is horrible. In order to get strong you need to draw from enemies which leaves you open to attacks. If you use magic you loose your strength. I did like the gfs having their own health though. Rather than taking away mp when summoning, a gf will take hits for you and they can grow their own levels. They have too many levels though. In order for some of them to get strong you need them at level 100 which takes many many MANY hours of countless fighting. I haven't seen the ending of this game. The final battle is the only thing I have yet to do. I got bored and quit. I've switched to Final Fantasy 9 for now.

I've been playing with Rocksmith for a few days, and I think I have a grasp on what Rocksmith does, doesn't do, and what you might be able to expect.I think the most frequent question I have had my friends ask is: Does it work? Yes. The synch through a cable that goes from 1/4\" out to the xbox's USB does not feel laggy.  Be sure to follow the guided tuning to get the best results. But the short answer is: Yes, Rocksmith does what it promises. But what it promises and what people expect are sometimes two different things.If you expect to jam with friends or use Rocksmith at a house party, it may not work for you. First off, there's not a lot of \"gaming\" going on here. There is a multiplayer, and while there are also mini-modes and scores/points to achieve, at its core Rocksmith is a guitar tutor.  Rocksmith in NO WAY resembles Rock Band/Guitar Hero.  Those other music games are designed for a party experience, but what you do with those instruments bears very little relationship to playing a real instrument.  In Rocksmith you are playing a real guitar (you do need your own electric guitar).If you're still on board, Rocksmith can be a useful tool for learning to play the guitar.  I am a novice at the guitar.  Rocksmith includes tutorials and info on all the basics such as tuning, and frets and strings. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, I believe Rocksmith can teach you to play halfway decently. However, learning to play the guitar (from scratch) is a long, slow process. So, don't expect to really rock right out of the box.The visual information that Rocksmith throws at you is pretty intense. There is a fairly steep learning curve here.  But again, the rewards include learning to really play the guitar. Moreover some of the on-screen information includes \"tabs\" (tableture), which is a form of sheet music for guitar-- if you practice enough Rocksmith, you could theoretically pick up any \"tabs\" sheet music and play.PROS:+ You are learning to play the guitar+ It works with any guitar with a 1/4\" outCONS:- learning the guitar is hard work, no matter if you're using a game or not.SUMMARY:I think Rocksmith is IDEAL for people with some guitar background: rocksmith may be the perfect excuse you need to practice extra.  Beginning and advanced guitar players will both find something useful in Rocksmith, but I think both with find it frustrating.  Beginner guitar players may find rocksmith overwhelming, there is a lot to learn-- and you should be cautioned that Rocksmith can tell if you PLAY a note, not if you play it well. Advanced players I feel would need human feedback to determine how well they are playing (tone, emotion, etc). If you're serious about putting in the time, I think there is something for everyone in Rocksmith. However, I also think that realistic expectations and patience are keys for enjoying rocksmith.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}

Look at it.  Smell it.  And then think about what you are getting for that with this system.Basically I bought it for two games. Nintendoland and Super Mario U. I have no interest in sloppy ports for games that I already own or never cared about. The system looks nice, the graphics look nice (on those two games anyway). I don't care about the Netflix, etc. I have a million other devices including my TV that already to all of this. It is cool that you can be watching something on Netflix and browse selection on the gamepad at same time. Other than that, the non-gaming features are meh. The load times are long for anything. Battery life is not good on the gamepad. I don't like the gamepad. I bought a nice tv because I want to look at it not a small screen. I have a 3ds, Vita, Nexus 7. I can look at one of those for that. I was very undecided as to whether or not i wanted one altogether. I decided to buy it from my brother at retail with the future in mind really only for Nintendo exclusives. I also wanted to give him someone to play with online. No one else seems to want one of these that we know.I had a chance to borrow my brother's system for days before deciding to take another new one off his hands. He couldn't use his really because of his girlfriend's kid who was getting one for Xmas. His connected to my network just fine and it stayed connected. no issues. The one that I got though would not connect for the life of me. Of course all of my other stuff worked fine. I found an article that said i should manually assign the IP and use weird DNS IP's. I did this and it then connected. Here is where the fun began. I tried doing the mother of all updates and it would download for a bit then drop connection and spit out an error code. I would then connect, test fine, and it would prompt me to download again and it would die at some point. I did this over and over for many times. Tried resetting network, etc. Nintendo's support page for this error suggested that I try again later, cut down on network traffic, or call support. I wasn't downloading or streaming anything and speedtested fine. I then decided that I would hardwire it.  No ethernet port.  I noticed that my original wii didn't have one either but, I never had issues with it or any other gaming system I have ever owned.  I will also mention that there is no optical audio out.  awesome.  I called support to ask the tech if they were having network issues. He said that they were not. Then I was put on hold while the tech 'researched' the issue. The call was disconnected. I tried to call back and there was just a bunch of static.  That static saved me a bunch of money.  Thank you Nintendo support.This is when I came to my senses that the system in it's current state and price point are not worth the frustration or my time. I could have troubleshot why my other 15 devices have no issue and this one does. I could have called support back.  I could have scoured the forums.  I could have walked upstairs and grabbed one of my old routers and hooked it up to see what happens.  I decided not to.  After returning it to my brother, he could complete the update just fine on his network an hour later. It could have been Nintendo's issue or my network's. All my other devices say the 1st one. Like I said, not worth the effort.I feel that it's a decent system. I also feel that it's overpriced and late to the game. I am certainly not going to give this amount of money AND time just to play 2 games. I could have been playing games on my systems that work better, cost half as much, and have many times the game selection. Remember back when Nintendo made game systems and not gimmicks? Why not just a system that hangs with the competitors with a freaking regular controller?  Why didn't they make the gamepad optional?  I hate the gamepad.  It's dumb and it has a resistive screen.  It reminds me of the early $100 android tabs except with handles.  It weighs considerably more than my Nexus 7 tab.They have THE system for one year.  I hope they take advantage of it and realease some good exclusives.  When they have 5 or more games that I'd like to play and cannot get elsewhere, I'll reconsider.  Until then, I'm going enjoy my stack of cash.  The system went back to the store.  I have never been more excited about getting rid of 'the next big thing'.NOTE: my active router is a D-Link DIR-625.  I work from home and connect to two VPN's.  I have no issues ( save the ones that everyone in my org experiences).  I have a desktop, laptop, work laptop, netbook,  2 tabs, smart phone, wii, 2 Xbox 360's, PS3, LG LM6700, Roku, WDTV player, PsVIta, and a 3DSXL that use this gateway regularly.  That's not counting my girlfriend's tab and laptop.  None of them have an issue at all.  Not the ones upstairs either.  The Wii U was about 8 feet from the router.  I also have a 16Mbps/2Mbps connection speed that is very steady.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2012"}

A third person shooter that looks and plays like a blockbuster asian themed action film. While the cutscenes at first are somewhat jaggy, they get better towards the 2nd 3rd levels. But really who cares about cutscenes, for me its about gameplay and Stranglehold is hitting the action dept. on all cylinders.Only tequila mode slows down the pace and you'll need to use it to stay alive. Luckily it automaticly refills so you'll be in constant use of it. The bullet trails are quite well done ,as you can dodge bullets (slow mo tequila time) in 'stand off' mode , its like wild west duel ONLY with 5-10 against you..simply awesome. And sniper tequila mode d-pad up aim fire and you follow the bullet like a bullet cam and wil get a unique cinematic kill or not if you missed ,which is unique every time, not the same cutscene over and over, Very cool. The graphics are quite nice and cinematicly done, not the best textures but still very very nicely drawn and detailed,lots of asian themed art, very visually stunning in some areas ,in short, a very pretty game. And you can destroy just about anything you shoot like stone carvings of chinese dragons 6+ feet high etc. Sometimes the action is so intense I have to take a break . While the constant shooting can get repetetive ..the tequila time and the acrobatic movement make up for the simple game mechanics, which is shoot everything and shoot it again. You'll slide across a counter while shooting,jump onto a push cart on your belly while shooting, hop up to a railing banister,slide down banister shooting, hop through a window shooting, kick over a table for cover while shooting,all in one continuous smooth motion. WOW simply stunning shooter gameplay. The controls are smooth and easy to master. The use of the LT is what causes you to do all those acrobatics..and tequila time (auto-enters) while aimimg at an enemy. Also you can manually turn it on with RB . Alternately in options menu you can turn off (auto-enter) tequila time while aiming at enemy, if you want complete manual control of tequila time. If your a fan of shooters ..or fan of Maxx Payne and Matrix games ...  Stranglehold its simply awesome and much better IMO. Something to hold you over until HALO3 is out or if you need a change of pace from (equally awesome) Bioshock...  Stranglehold's only (7) levels being the one  negative thing, the levels are pretty big mostly linear , still Stranglehold is just so intense, what it lacks, it makes up for in fantastic shooter gameplay which it has in spades.

I played it a few rounds at a time between studying for my exams and came down with the &quot;just one more try&quot; syndrome. If you're looking for a quick and easy way to stifle boredom or waste time, Wario Ware is for you.There's only the thinnest of plots; Wario wants to make money by creating his own video games, so he gets a bunch of friends to help him. The gamer must help them through their misadventures by playing through various 3-second mini-games. These games test your reflexes and skill with some truly bizzare scenarios: cut through a piece of meat, help a power ranger-esque fighter defeat bad guys, draw a line with a crayon, pull turnips, even help a cute anime girl snort her snot back. There are over 200 of these mini-games, and scoring the required points on them will open up even more. Even though the games are short, they're entertaining and beg for you to replay them to beat your own score.The controls are simple; Nintendo's philosphy on simplification at the expense of graphics and presentation hasn't always worked, but here everything's flawless. Controls don't get more complex than pushing the direction pad and A button. Graphics are intentionally simple, but full of style and humour. And again, the replayability adds a lot to the overall package. Like Tetris and Dr. Mario before it, Wario Ware will always entertain after other games have come and gone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2004"}

I tried playing Warrior Within on PC but it wasn't fun playing with a mouse and keyboard, a console controller is key for this sort of game. Years later I heard that the story arc of the series was really good, so I wished I had kept trying Warrior Within and then played The Two Thrones, but was I really going to dig out the PS2 and play them when I was already playing amazing HD games on the PS3? Of course not.The HD Trilogy solved this problem, and I was very excited to re-play SoT and finally play the remainder of the series. The games themselves are a lot of fun, however - this HD remaster by Ubisoft has some serious bugs. The sound is pretty poor in SoT, it starts and stops mid-song, and it's rather distracting. But the BIG problem with this game is that it freezes my PS3. Right after the first save point I was wall-running and it froze. I couldn't even shut off the system with the PS button, I had to manually reboot the machine. I figured it was just one of those occasional freezes and re-loaded the game with little consideration of the event...until it froze again in the exact same spot.I returned the game to the retailer and exchanged it for another copy. I re-loaded and this time it worked fine - great!...until it froze again, a couple of levels later. Again, when I was wall-running. It appears to be when you're wall-running and the game wants to show a tip at the bottom of the screen, for whatever reason, it can't handle it. I searched the boards and found many people had the same problem and it seems the fix is to disconnect the PS3 from the Network/Internet because any background downloading or Internet activity screws it up. I am writing this review to confirm that this does indeed fix the problem, and it's not a huge deal, but I don't believe I should have to do this in order to play a game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2013"}

Darn skeleton fish.","reviewText":"I've played harder games than this one, but its certainly no cakewalk in any way, shape, or form.  It will definitely test your ability to inflict and dodge attacks.  Your life preserving strategies will get quite a workout too.  You've got to be on the ball if you want to get through this game.  Even with maxed out stats, you can't just plow through the game and take hits.  Heck, even with max strength I wouldn't mess with those knife-throwing eagles.  I just ran away from them, and still somehow lived.There's no way you can beat this game without a walkthrough.  No freaking way.  Way too many dangerous mazes and unobvious methods to get items.  And you need ALL of the items to get through the game.  You can't just pick and choose.  You need to have the thunder spell to beat the boss, and you need to have all the magic containers to get the spell, see.There are really only two places where you'd get stuck in this game.  Unfortunately one of the places is right at the beginning and the other is right at the end.  At the beginning, Death Mountain really is DEATH mountain.  I can't think of any way to get through it except by building up experience points like crazy and leveling up several times.  Those red alligator cavemen are monstrous.And at the end, well, just walking along the path from the giant spider to the Great Palace is a heck of a challenge.  Dinosaur men throw barrages of rocks at you with the accuracy of snipers, and one-eyed ghosts fly around randomly, knocking you into lava and zapping away whatever lives you have.  Thank goodness if you actually make it to the Great Palace, you can continue from there.What really makes this game so different from the other Zelda games is the jumps.  In Zelda 1 and 3, there aren't really any jumps, and if you miss a jump in Zelda 4, its not really all that big of a deal.  Start where you left off and try again.  But if you miss a jump in Zelda 2, it costs you dearly.  Miss three of those and you're back at the beginning, and believe me, there are plenty of enemies around to help you miss those three.The odd thing though, is that while the combat system and the required jump-dodging are what makes this game hard as heck, they also are what make the game good.  After some practice, you'll be impressed at what you're able to do.  Especially once you figure out how to get past those boomerang guys.  The controls are practically flawless, and my only complaint about them is Link's sword is too short for the upward thrust to be particularly effective.  Half the time I'd use that attack I'd take damage instead of give it.Quite primitive, and definitely not as good as Zelda 3 or 4, but it has some neat items and spells, and its definitely a man's game.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on.

This game was NEVER promoted as RTCW or part 2 for pete's sake. It is a stand alone game called \"Wolfenstein\". I knew this from reading about the game BEFORE buying it.- The graphics on my computer (having a 9800 GT card) were excellent. The AI was definately not bad. Not as good as the best games out there but not bad at all.- I had no issues with any phantom walls or clipping issues.- There was plenty of ammo for the weapons supplied and new, better weapons (and powers) became available throughout the game. You will never be in need of a weapon.- It is only partially linear. It gives you a map and gives you multiple objectives. You take on the objectives and go to new maps as they become available and only in the order you choose.- Every time I thought this game was about to end, it kept going. It's definately NOT a short game.- The map markers and compass were a little frustrating. It may tell you to go NW to get to your objective. You go the way it says to go but it actually requires you to go SE first through the sewers and find some secret door that will wrap around back to the NW. This is a small annoyance to me.- Replay value is increased by the fact that, if you enter a new map/screen and there are 6 enemies waiting for you, you can go back through the door and \"reset\" the screen. When you come back, different, or even NO enemies will be there. So each time you play, the game will spawn different enemies in different locations. This does not include boss battles of course.- Boss battles didn't take 10 tries to kill. Usually you can figure out how to beat them pretty fast. Pausing the game and viewing the objective, usually hints or even tells you what to do.I highly suggest picking this up as a FPS game. I have only played the SP campaign.

I, personally, have been waiting for this game for a VERY long time. I am a huge fan of the original two games because of the noir feel they had to them. I had HUGE expectations for this game. I actually thought that no matter how good this game was, it wouldn't be able to meet my expectations. I have been proven wrong, and I could not be happier. Max Payne 3 is a milestone in 3rd person shooters. It's polished, finely-tuned, and gripping. The graphics are amazing, and the story is what you would expect from a Max Payne game. Well, maybe not entirely. Some of the original noir feel is lost. This is an action-heavy game, more so than the first two games. Gone are the surreal moments and the graphic novel cut scenes. In some ways this is a shame, but the game is fantastic. It really sets the bar for 3rd person shooters. Rockstar has always had the ability to write good stories with compelling characters and interesting plots, and Max Payne 3 is no different. I refuse to spoil any part of the story for anyone, since I do believe that this a game that everybody should experience, but I will say that this game is certainly not for the faint of heart. This game is bloody and violent. Some scenes will stay with you. Max Payne is a broken man, and the game goes to great lengths to make you understand just how broken he is. All in all this game is phenomenal. It's entertaining and very well made. I have yet to try the multiplayer portion of the game, since I like to play through the campaign before I jump into online play. I will update the review once I do.(Update 05/17/12)I've played a few matches online, and I have to say it's been fun. I've been kicked out of a few matches for \"connectivity\" issues. Aside from that, I have no complaints. The game modes are what you would expect from many multiplayer offerings, but the addition of bullet time is very significant. Bullet time is also handled in a very coherent way, it doesn't hinder gameplay at all. Weapon unlocks are similar to Black Ops, in that as you level up you unlock new weapons but you are not forced to buy them if you don't want them. One thing that I did not like was the fact that my DLC weapons are not unlocked completely, I still have to purchase them with in game cash. Other than that, I fully recommend the multiplayer portion to those who want a break from your typical first-person shooter fare.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

We have Rabbids 1 and it's ok, but a bit difficult and not really multi-player which is why we bought it. The jokes are funny yet appropriate for kids, which is great for parties. Ok you can't throw the cow in the Rabbids 2 (ok we do miss that one) and yes you can move on to the next game even with a lame score. Big Plus+ for me!But it's fun to dress up the rabbids in costumes, you can mix and match anything you want. Rayman has some good costumes as well. The instruments are easier to play in RR2. In Rabbids 1 you had to be a maniac to keep the beat and my wife mostly had to do it as I'm an old RPG player and no way was I going to keep up with the super fast beat.Rabbids 2 is clearly designed with the Wii in mind, games are a bit easier to play and instead of being thrown in a cell you get a victory dance for the winner and the loser gets hit by cars or sinks in a boat etc...For parties Rabbids 2 is lightyears ahead of Rabbids 1.We will be buying Rabbids TV Party after the holidays.The rabbids games are offbeat and seriously funny. Rabbids 1 is for more serious players who want more of a challenge, and I will say this the Rabbids 1 shooting games are considerably better than Rabbids 2. But that's about it. Replaying games is much easier in RR2, you can replay any game very easily, multi-player or single.Oh and if you don't do well in the shooting game you don't get to fight the boss and if you don't do well in the games you don't get the funnier costumes. So you still have to do well! RR2 makes it harder to hit the rabbids who now actually jump out of the way of your shots.The A button to reload is a pain since you can't use a Nyko Perfect shot.But overall this is a fantastic party game. Our friends just love playing this game as a group.If you want a party game this is a top notch one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

The ridiculous amout of lame dialog an chatter from your wingmen is enough to make you shoot them down yourself and go at it alone if you could. Right now that's my biggest gripe.

Time will tell what the replay value will be. I'm a fan of shooters especially simple ones like this one; Here's your weapon there's the target now blow it up..gotta love it. That said a game where the fun is blowing up stuff would do itself a favor by throwing in a scenario where some tactical nukes would be involved.

I loved the island theme and semi-open world design. Crysis 2 was a flop IMO... The urban theme just didn't do anything for me, and the whole alien thing started to get a little old. Crysis 3 shows that Crytek clearly wanted to stay in their comfort zone as many of the design elements were transferred over from Crysis 2. The game does feel a lot more polished than Crysis 2 though, which is nice. The controls are fantastic, and the game is well optimized (running at nearly 99% on both GPU and all four CPU cores). Getting ~26-40 FPS on a GTX 560 @ 1920x1080, \"very high\" resolution, FXAA, and \"high\" system specs. Not bad.Now that Crytek has nailed the technical aspects, they need to be more creative with the setting and storyline. The storyline in Crysis 3 is so dry...

I totally agree and I think it's not only the best Action game but also One of the best games ever created.  It has a brilliant story line which I won't bring up since You can find time to read other reviewers since they pretty much tell you.  The game is a stealth game.  It pretty old Stealth game Acctually, the game is about 7-8 years old.  I was one of many Fans to buy this amazing game when it first hit stores.  Metal Gear Solid earns its 5 for these things.  Story, Gameplay and Villans.  The villans in this game are awesome.  From the moment you get to the Ocelot fight to getting your hands on Rex You will love this game.  Metal Gear solid Has bin one of the most Popular Playstation games and has spawned sequals(ala MGS2 and now Mgs3)  And what makes Metal Gear Solid one of the best games is also the fact that Metal Gear Solid has one of the best Storylines in a game.

I have played the beta for a month now, leveled and unlocked all the guns in the beta. I have been playing many other recent FPS and TPS including Uncharted 2, CODMW2, MAG, BFBC2, MOH, CODBO, KZ3, and Crysis 2. My review would be strictly for multiplayer. Personally, I like this game WAYYYYYYYYYYYY better than Crysis 2's Multiplayer Mode. No one has \"cloak engaged\" so you could just focus on taking cover and shoot! There just so much action in there and once u get over the learning curve, you will enjoy it a lot! This game feels a lot like MAG. If you have never played MAG before, you might not like this game, especially those who are jumping from Black Ops to SOCOM4. The learning curve might be a little higher than other games, but it's worth it and it's a lot fun! It's a little difficult to get used to from taking cover and aiming at the enemies. Also, it's a little difficult to shoot the enemies really close to you, but changing the sensitivity would make it easier and using the submachine guns in close combat! Patch 1.02 already came out so the on-screen view became wider. I think the game is great! There's also a \"classic mode\" for those SOCOM veterans.  This game's multiplayer would definitely last you for a long time! Gather your friends and form a CLAN!IF YOU HAVE THE MOVE AND IF YOU ARE A MAG/UNCHARTED FAN, I HIGHLY SUGGEST PICKING THIS GAME UP!

Pure is one of them. It is not adulterated, no un-necessary crap included. The game is extreme sports on four wheels. Your skill in pulling off tricks gets you the winner trophy.As this game doesn't try to be a jack of all, either you will fall in love or may not bother about it. If you are one of those who loved games like Skate, older ATV games; dont miss this one. Try out the demo, it is a very good representation of the basic gameplay.The game is very easy to pick up. But to be a true master and unlock every thing you need to practice a lot. The gameplay is very well balanced; you can't just be a one trick pony. There are three modes in the game, I like all of them. You need a different mind set to champion each style. My most favorite is freestyle. All you are doing is pulling of tricks for extra time. It is purely your skill, nothing else.For me Graphics is not just polygon count. I would like to see good art work too. Art style and texture work is stellar. Probably this is the best looking multi-platform racing game so far in this generation. As you jump higher and higher you can see a much wider area. They look awesome, it is like riding up a gondola looking down. Areas are very varied from lush forest to snow covered mountains. Very well done with lot of details. Iam not a big fan of the shiny bloom lighting, but it is there. It seems to be very common in new racing games.Online works like a charm. Every mode is available online too. Don't approach this game as you do in vanilla racing games. Driving fast all the time wont help you much. Make sure to nail the tricks, build up your boost meter. It is a extreme sport game. While playing online, I would suggest turning off hit detection; It get very chaotic.Another impressive feature is ATV customization. You can even build the entire ATV from scratch. Only complaint I have is, you can't use your own textures or custom paint. So all the ATV's either custom built or the ones from the game look the same. Customizing your ATV becomes very important at latter stages as the vanilla ATV wont cut it.More time you spend on this game, more you will fall in love. Most of the useful stuff gets unlocked very early so it doesn't grind for long. The strength is in its game play. After you invest a certain amount of time, you just never feel leaving away.Black Rock Studio has done so many iterations of ATV games in the past, Pure is a big fan service.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002B1TDV8","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"A good game, but only if you personally try to make it a good game.","reviewText":"Scribblenauts is a game that is victim to over-inflated expectations.  The game isn't terrible by any means, but I will argue that it isn't that great either.GAMEPLAY: Different.  I am going to avoid calling the gameplay great, bad, good, or terrible.  Honestly, the gameplay is good or bad depending entirely upon how the player decides to approach the game.  To summarize, you are presented with a bunch of different puzzles which you solve by typing in words of objects.  The objects can then be manipulated using the stylus, equipped to your character, destroyed, detonated, shot, launches, etc.  If you simply look at each level from the perspective of quickly finding any solution that enables you to move onto the next level, you will end up very bored very quickly with this game.  The same solutions can be used to solve so many different puzzles.  If you go out of your way to create weird, crazy, and wacky solutions to otherwise simple problems, the gameplay suddenly feels fresh and enjoyable.CONTROLS: Hit and miss.  While typing in words and summoning strange and unique solutions to the puzzles works well, the other controls in the game tend to fall flat.  The stylus only control for your character is imprecise and [...].  I can excuse almost every other fault in this ambitious game, but the controls are maddeningly bad at times.  Giving some direct control over the character using the d-pad and some buttons would have been a huge improvement.SOUND: Quickly forgettable.  The sound doesn't bother me, but it doesn't draw me in either.GRAPHICS: Plain and simple and stylish.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of reused graphics.  A lot.  This goes back to my previous criticism that many of the 30,000 objects you can create in the game are clones of each other.VALUE: Either very high or terribly low.  For people that constantly look for creative and odd solutions to the puzzles in the game, there is quite a bit to offer.  If you look for the quickest and easiest routes to victory, you will find the same solutions will work for you over and over and you will probably get very bored very quickly.COMPLIMENTS TO THE GAME:+++ The game is based on a clever idea that encourages and rewards creative problem solving.+++ The 30,000 word vocabulary means most stuff you type in will come up.  I have stumped it a few times, but usually it gives you something, although not always what you expect.+++ A simple and pleasant graphical style that fits the design concept.CRITICISMS:--- Attack of the clones.  The 30,000 word vocabulary is misleading and a good chunk of these are clones of each other.  For example: titan, giant, and ogre are all the exact same things.  Dinosaurs also tend to be a lot of clones of each other as well.  It is a very common problem in the game.--- Maddeningly poor controls.  A highly anticipated game with high production values such as this should never have controls this bad.  Just plain sloppy.--- The game's \"do anything you want\" premise makes some of the puzzles far too easy.Overall, this game is a great technical demo.  If you are creative and enjoy going out of your way to solve problems by the most unconventional means possible, then this game is probably for you.  One example, in an early level I had to catch a butterfly.  I could have used a net, but I chose to use GLUE and a ROCK and brought the butterfly down to the ground by gluing the rock to the butterfly so it couldn't fly.  Over-complicating the level was fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2009"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"Fun, but some very annoying oversights","reviewText":"First of all while this did basically steal and re-envision Bioshock's theme and gameplay the combat does have a very different feel because the powers, enemies, and even how the weapons work/shoot are very different. The main problem is you can't save any time, and it inconveniently saves before you pick up items and all that. For example, while in a room that gets flooded with mobs you need to destroy about 20 egg things first. The room is very difficult... which is a problem because it saves BEFORE clearing all the eggs. (And the eggs don't involve combat, just targeting then hitting one button in an empty room.) So every time you die you get to spend a few minutes just re-clearing all those eggs just to die 30 seconds later. About 10 deaths in and I want to throw the damn PS3 through a window.In addition to that when some events start you can't immediately fire and after that usually can't aim for about 30 seconds, so you are stuck inaccurately shooting. Also some abilities share a button... which means it is very easy to unintentionally pick something useless up rather than making a time slowing orb for example. These issues don't sound major, but they make the game much less fun than it should be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}

I'll admit, there are more out there but too numerous to mention. At any rate, add another one to the list...Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga. Although not an actual sequel to Paper Mario, this game is an absolute blast to play. The story goes something like this...An evil witch has stolen Princess Peach''s voice, replacing her fair speech with explosives! As chaos breaks out in the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario and Luigi head for the castle and meet up with Bowser, who had just arrived to kidnap the princess. When they find out what happened, these sworn enemies join forces and go beyond the borders of the Mushroom Kingdom, following the witch to a neighboring kingdom. After an aerial ambush crashes their ship and sends Bowser to who-knows-where, Mario and Luigi embark on foot, learning new moves and combining their brotherly might to fight off enemies as they venture toward the kingdom''s castle. If the witch finds the Magic Beans hidden deep within the castle, then all may already be lost. The residents of this new land prize humor and laughter above all else, so the brothers' adventure quickly takes on the tone of their humor and personality and that is where it begins.With unique RPG elements, you can level up Mario and Luigi, increasing their stats and powers. To me what makes this game so special is its' puzzlesolving elements. Although it looks like a kiddie game, it's anything but. Even if you hate Mario and Luigi, you owe it to yourself to play this awesome RPG. You'll definitely get your money's worth as it's a long one.

{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"A Great System But Not Perfect.","reviewText":"The Playstation 3 is a great system no doubt, but it is not perfect, there are still stuff they could have done better. There are 3 systems, the Playststation 3, the XBox 360 & the Nintendo Wii. Each system has a special thing that the other systems don't have but lets face it, none of them are perfect. I chose the PS3 because I love the Playstation but I could've easily got any system, there all great. The 360 came out first and has the best graphics out of the 3, the Wii has a completly new way to play games thats why its so popular because of the emphasis of the controller being an extension of your body while you play. And the Playstation 3 is kind of like a mix between the 360 & the Wii because it too has great graphics and the new six-axis is kinda like the wii controller because of the motion sensing.The Playstation 3 still has yet to reach it's expectational potential, a lot of people underrate this system because of the lack of games but that doesn't meen its a bad system, it still has yet to have good games like Metal Gear Solid 4, GTA 4, Assassins Creed, Devil may Cry 4 etc. You just have to be patient. I agree that games do make the system, and since the 360 has a year over the PS3 obviously you have more choices of games fo the 360 then the PS3. But even so you still have games that are out right now like Resistance: Fall of Man, Motorstorm etc..Now the good parts of the system is the graphics, it is similar to the 360 when it comes to power games look great especially in 1080p. The actual system looks great, pure shiny sleek black, nice and heavy. The controller is great and much lighter, the new six-axis motion is great and fun to use in games that support it, its wireless and no batteries like the 360 controllers and you can recharge it using a USB connection. The menu is similar to the PSP (if you have one) there are specific sections like Movies, games, Music, Internet and stuff like that. the system has a 60GB harddrive which is 3 times more than the 360's harddrive which means you could add more demos and whatever. The system is very quiet almost has no sound at all. Easy to download demos and even full games on the PLaystation Store by using the internet. FREE ONLINE, download games, play online, using the internet for free, thats right its free unlike the 360. It's a cheap Blue-Ray player which is the best type of Video Media right now.Now the bad parts. This is an expensive console even with the $100 price drop and I bought full price half a year ago. The system is very delicate and can catch dust very easily and can break very easily so take good care of yours. The lack of games, its still a problem but patience will get me through this until Christmas. Downloads of demos online is a great idea but takes way to long, about twice as long as it does downloading demos on the 360.  The controller has no rumble which is one of the most important parts of getting into the game, without rumble its hard to really feel the game especially in shooting games. The box doesn't come with and HDMI cable which is retarted becase the system is meant for High Defintion, you would think Sony would add an important thing like that.All in all the system is a buy, like I said before each system has its own special thing going for it, no system is perfect but the PS3 is a great system so go ahead and buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2007"}

Good game.","reviewText":"I've played the original Bejeweled on various consoles and on PC, and this game follows relatively the same concept. You're given a board of colored gems, and your goal is to line up three or more like-colored gems to clear them from the board. Gameplay is relatively easy and fun, and it's a great pick-up game when you have nothing else to do.Lining up gems and clearing them is quite easy. Using the stylus, you select a group of four gems, which become highlighted in a circle. Touching this group again rotates the gems clockwise. This means you can change the position of gems, four at a time, one position clockwise for each touch of the stylus. You can then select other groups and do the same thing. In the process, you can put gems in any position and build up combination moves. Even as you rotate the 4 gems, they don't revert to their original positions if you don't clear matching groups. This gives you a lot of freedom in moving gems around and developing strategy.There's a quick tutorial, and the game highlights hints for your next move.The good thing about this type of game is that there's no story, nothing to read, and it's just \"pick-up-and-play\". Once you learn the simple mechanic and the general rules, it's really easy to play. Sound effects are really basic, and the music is entertaining but not obnoxious. It's really easy just to get hypnotized by the music, concentrate, and play this game for hours.

The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience. Two convex analog thumb pads and two force-feedback solenoid rumblers round out the features. This controller is also compatible with all software that supports the original Dual Shock controller.","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"Probably the best game controller on the market today.","reviewText":"With three different gaming consoles on the market today, there is heated debate over which console is the best of the bunch. One of the main points brought up in many discussions concerns the consoles' controller, an important part on any system. A good controller increases the level of gaming enjoyment, while a bad controller dampens it. With that said, after trying the controllers for all of the different systems, I can honestly say that the Playstation2 controller, the Dual Shock 2, is the best controller on the market today.The Dual Shock 2 is actually a direct descendent of the original Dual Shock from the original Playstation. Is this a bad thing? Not at all. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Sony knew they had a good controller with the Dual Shock, and transferring virutally the entire controller to the Playstation2 was a smart idea.So how does a controller with 2 analog sticks and 14 buttons become one of the best controllers ever created? One word: design. The design of the Dual Shock 2 is optimized for the gaming experience; everything feels right in place and right where it should be. Of course, players with really big hands might find the controller a little small, but overall it's a perfect fit for almost every gamer. And the mechanics of the controller are perfect; analog control is flawless, and the pressure-sensitive face buttons are a nice addition. Plus, when you press a button, you know that a command will be recognized.Is the Dual Shock 2 really that good? Think about this: there are peripherals dedicated to hooking up the Gamecube and Xbox with the Dual Shock 2. Need I say more? The Gamecube's controller isn't bad, but it's bizarre design can take getting used to. The Xbox's controller is just plain horrible; it's far too big for many players' hands and the buttons don't feel right when pressed. The Dual Shock 2 is the best controller on the market today, and because it's made by Sony, it's durability and reliability are guaranteed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00004ZBSX","reviewerName":"Yossarian","summary":"Grab these two","reviewText":"I just finished both games, and I highly recommend this bundle set to anyone who likes (1) RPG games, (2) Post-apocalyptic themed anythings, (3) games that don't make you do anything or (4) science fiction in general.  The basic premise of both games, as recounted by numerous previous reviews, is that you have to make it in a world defined by the typical nuclear fallout (ahem) disaster.  However, there are so many ways to make it, and they're all such fun, that these games should appeal to most people.  Fallout 1 is a shorter game but in many ways is more elegant; if you play it conscientiously you'll have a feeling of satisfaction at the end for having seen and done most of it.  Fallout 2 is much larger in scope and in time commitment, and unfortunately suffers a bit from it.. there are more bugs, more 'dead' items and quests that were intended to have some purpose in the game but never did, and so on.  Some could argue this, in fact, merely adds to the gritty reality of a game where everything doesn't end up in a neat little package at the end, and there aren't answers to all the questions.  Or maybe the programming staff was just overworked.  In any event, the games are addictive and reward curiosity.  High points:1)  Emphasis on character development.  A karma counter keeps track of your overall good/badness, and as you progress you are offered various 'Perks' that enhance or define your character, such as Salesman or Demolition Expert or Kama Sutra Master.  Others you earn through gameplay itself.  Multiple avenues of play exist for any type of character..while your first character in both games is probably going to emphasize gunplay and high Agility, later on you can try a diplomatic or manipulative or pure thieving character as you see fit, and play what amounts to an almost completely different game.2)  So many explosions.  These games have lots of fighting, on a turn-based system allowing for micromanagement of both yourself and your 'friendly' NPCs.  Use burst fire to take out packs of charging wolves, aim your scoped hunting rifle at someone's leg to keep them from chasing you, send a rocket down a corridor into a pack of unsuspecting guards.  It's all there..and the death animations are not for the faint of heart.A few negatives:1)  As is typical in RPGs, making 'bad' or 'evil' decisions or dialogue choices tends to screw you.  If you want, just pretend your evil character secretly enjoys the hypocrisy of agreeing to rescue someone's orphaned kitten with a boo-boo on its paw; it would be nice someday if RPGs rewarded evil characters for doing evil things.2)  Armor.  Basically the goal of both games is to get your first suit of Power Armor.  This transforms both games from a grueling, constantly-reloading ordeal of random accidental deaths and burst-fire horrors to a breeze.  This, of course, makes perfect sense...once you're a walking tank, most things bounce off.  However (although Fallout 2 handles this a bit better) there is very little middle ground..even with Combat Armor II (the next step down) you get mauled a lot.3)  Uncontrolled NPCs.  Sure, by definition you shouldn't be able to control an NPC, but it can get truly annoying when one of your NPCs blasts something, and then moves 1 space directly in front of your other NPC for no reason, and then that second NPC, naturally, fires a machine gun directly into his head.  It makes you wonder if 'friendly fire accidents' are really accidents.  Depending on your party size, you can spend a lot of time watching your allies gun each other down like post apocalyptic three stooges.Those aside, the games are very detailed and can be played as quickly or as slowly as one wishes, with numerous subplots branching off the main plot.  The first game does have a timer for the completion of the main task, but that can be extended during the game, and in fact the game goes on (sans timer) once that task is completed.  Fallout 2 does away with that completely, allowing you effectively all the time you want to explore.  So if you always wondered if how Mad Max would have done if he'd had more ammo for his shotgun and access to the occasional flamethrower, pick them up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"P. Taegel","summary":"Just One More Save Point...","reviewText":"SYNOPSIS: An alien artifact drives people murderously insane then reanimates their corpses into mutated monsters.  You play Isaac Clarke (An amalgam of Asimov and Arthur C), the sole survivor of Dead Space. Not only is Isaac trapped aboard a massive space station with hundreds of these things, but religious fanatics want to use him for the information in his head and the government wants to kill him for it.GENRE: Survival horror.GAMEPLAY: Third person shooter.  However, instead of the usual center of mass/headshot gameplay, these necromorphs require dismemberment.  Hence, Isaac has a number of unconventional weapons at his disposal that make this task more feasible (an arc welder, force gun, plasma cutter, electric saw, etc).  A couple of weapons have been added to the arsenal from Dead Space, but essentially the gameplay remains the same.  The addition of a proximity mine thrower makes it easier to strategize and lay down some defenses against the heavier onslaughts.  The suits now come equipped with thrusters, so space walks are free roaming as opposed to the linear jumps in Dead Space.ISAAC CLARKE: This time out, Isaac is no longer the \"mute protagonist\" of Dead Space.  Now that Isaac reacts and responds to the other characters that interact with him, the narrative of Dead Space 2 is much more fulfilling and enjoyable to watch unfold.  He's also being haunted and slowly driven insane by strong hallucinations of his girlfriend.DLC: The downloadable content, available at five bucks a pop, offers beefed-up space suits and weapons.  Essentially, it provides you with items you otherwise wouldn't get until a few levels into the game.  The upgrading system remains the same, however.  So if you really want your gear and weapons to be great, you've got to upgrade them using credits and power nodes you collect throughout the game.  Hence, the weapons and suits offer a boost if you get them toward the beginning of the game, but the DLC doesn't make Dead Space 2 a cakewalk.DEAD SPACE EXTRACTION: Dead Space 2 also comes with the Wii game, Dead Space Extraction, a rail-shooter that incorporates the Playstation move controller.  I've played Dead Space Extraction.  It's a GREAT game, and maybe one of the best written games I've ever played.  The fact that this game is included is seriously cool.OVERALL: Dead Space 2 is one of the richest, most thrilling gaming experiences I've ever had.  It's also scary as hell.  If you don't like horror movies, gore or to be scared, you'll hate Dead Space 2.  It's suspenseful, and quite often necromorphs jump out or sneak up on Isaac at unexpected moments.  The visuals are stunning.  The story is compelling and unpredictable.  It's one of those games where I would intend to only play for an hour before going to bed, and six hours later I found myself watching the sun come up.  I just couldn't put down the controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

At a time of writing this review Borderlands 2 is free and that's an awesome game. I would encourage you to buy the full year even at $50 - which is a standard price -you'll save almost 20 bucks over buying it in three month installments. And be sure to look for deals between Thanksgiving and Christmas Amazon and many other places sell a one year subscription for $30 starting a black Friday and you see continued sales up till Christmas. I've gotten a one-year subscription to PlayStation plus the team $29 and $39 multiple times. The only caveat to be noted about the free games is that you need to keep your PlayStation plus active to play them. This is a big deal as PlayStation plus can be little under three dollars a month if you can get it for around $30. All in all it's a great deal on a great service.One thing I want to encourage you to do even if you don't want the free games add them to your cart and start the download a.k.a. purchase them (they are free but you still have to \"purchase\" then) this adds them to your history of purchased games. This way you don't have to actually download them if you don't have space but in the future if you want to download them you have that option. I do this for almost every game that's free because in the future I might want to play them but at present I might not have the desire.It should be noted we don't need PlayStation plus if you just have a PlayStation 3 because network play is free there but if you have a PlayStation 4 PlayStation plus is required for multiplayer games but not for Netflix Amazon and the like. And if you want to play free to play games those normally do not require you to have PlayStation plus on the PlayStation 4.Thanks for reading I hope this helps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007JZB3","description":"TRON 2.0is an action-packed story-driven title inspired byTRON, the groundbreaking science-fiction motion picture. The game takes place in present day, approximately 20 years after the events of the film. Playing as Jet Bradley, son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley from the movie, gamers are digitized into cyberspace and will race on light cycles, battle corruption both inside and outside of the computer world, and explore locations including the Internet Hub, Firewall, Corrupted Server and Light Cycle Game Grid.","reviewerName":"Shanghaied","summary":"Excellent Presentation","reviewText":"I was at first somewhat skeptical of this game; I'm both a huge First Person Shooter fan as well as an enthusiast of the original Tron movie.  When I heard they were making an FPS based on Tron I had mixed feelings; I was worried that the genre would provide an insufficient medium for the game and would turn off many potential player.  I'll be the first to admit that Tron 2.0 does cater to some of the more obvious gameplay cliches that are nearly everywhere in the FPS world.  Alot of the weapons in the game remind me of the generic weapon set in any FPS; you've got your sniper rifle (known as the LOL in this game), your shotgun, your rocket launcher (known as the ball launcher), etc.  The levels were also a tad linear, and while the game length was of a good length for the story, the game overall wasn't that difficult to complete.  That much was unrefreshing to say the least.Honestly though, none of that matters.  \"What?!\" you ask?  Tron 2.0 has a lot of features that, even if not totally unique, cumulatively make it an addictive and fun game experience.  The action is pretty much nonstop, and there are few puzzles (jumping and otherwise) to detract from the frenzy.  Learning to master the disk makes the game very rewarding as well; it's a versatile enough weapon that it is still useful even when playing on the hardest difficulty level, and gained experience from single player disk use carries over largely to multiplay.Furthermore, the graphics are completely immersive.  Though the game uses a Quake3 based engine which will soon be outdated, I'd never have guessed that just by looking at the game itself.  The level design and stylized nature of the game looks every bit as good as it did in the movie.  Trust me, it does.  Really.  From the \"glowy\" effect from characters in the movie to the virtual landscapes around you; the overall game looks totally beautiful and are creatively designed.  The best part is, you don't need a state-of-art system to enjoy the visuals; this game runs very well on a 1.0 ghz 512 MB RAM based system with a Geforce 3 (or Radeon 9200+) based system, and that's on med-high detail.The weapons you use, while being similar in function to many other FPS games, look very cool as well.  The LOL is my personal favorite and I use it almost exclusively along with the disk. When you whip the LOL out, instead of having it just magically appear for no good reason, you summon a bunch of geometric figures that inevitably flurry around your hands and form into the weapon, which looks totally sweet.  It, like every other weapon you collect, is an enhancement of 4 \"primitives,\" the basic weapons you can use no matter what.  You can get these special enhancements to these primitive weapons by collecting and using \"subroutines\" that you can find in boxes or defeated enemies.The voice acting in the game is top notch and features guest appearances like Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Bruce Boxleitner, and Cindy Morgan.  The music is AMAZING, and essentially consists of remixes of Wendy Carlos' original score from the first movie.Light cycle racing is also here as well, and as someone said on a Tron message board, \"it's like snake on crack.\"  That's very accurate to both the gameplay and the challenge, and it accomplishes this all while staying true in form to the movie.  There's even a grand prix mode that you can play through with only light cycle racing.Overall, I think this is a very well made FPS.  I enjoyed playing it and will likely pick it up again.  If you're looking for a more intense multiplayer experience then I'd recommend Battlefield 1942 or Jedi Knight 3, but if you want a more visually and atmospherically robust single player experience, this is the best you'll do on the PC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2003"}

Wells","summary":"MS Points: Unlock the Potential of Your Xbox","reviewText":"Xbox live points are a great way to enhance games you purchase for the xbox.  I buy the points on amazon.  The free shipping makes xbox points convenient and cost effective.  There is code on the back of the card that is already valid. All you have to do is redeem the code in xbox live.I like to buy my points through amazon because I have had issues with xbox live when I give them my credit card number. On multiple occasions, Xbox live has locked my account because of the points I purchased from them (if you choose to buy directly on xbox live, it is better to buy once large sum of points--the xbox fraud unit locks the account if there are multiple small purchases).  Unlocking the account involves waiting up to a week and multiple phone calls to xbox live support.  While I appreciate their security, I prefer to avoid the hassle.The 4000 points card allows you to buy many items on xbox live. Most arcade games range from about 800 points to 1200 points.  Add-ons range from about 160 points (for Rock Band songs) to 1600 points for very-large add-ons.  Its a good denomination because it lasts for several weeks.There are some great xbox live \"arcade\" games.  Many xbox 360 games offer additional characters, levels, missions, and other add-on materials that can make a great game even better. But xbox points can be used for more than just game add-ons.  Xbox live offers movies, music, and avatar items.Everything you buy on xbox live is saved in your download history.  So even if you delete it to make room in your hard drive, it is available to be downloaded again.Personally, I find xbox points to be a great investment that allows me to unlock the games I purchased for many additional hours of play.  For your entertainment dollars, expanding your favorite games is winning proposition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDQ1","description":"InSuper Monkey Ball, you're in control of a cute little monkey trapped inside a transparent ball. The objective of the game is deceptively simple: tilt the floor with your analog stick so that your monkey ball rolls towards the goal. Your success is all in the thumb: the more you tilt, the faster the ball rolls. Just be sure not to fall off the edges! You can play with up to four others to see who can master the tilt and get their monkeys to the finish line ahead of the pack.","reviewerName":"\"wellmlynn\"","summary":"Simple, Fun, and a Great Game","reviewText":"Super Monkey Ball is a nontraditional game.  The basic concept has no plot and it bears resemblance to the pinball madness games that older gamers might remember from the past.  For those who are unfamiliar with older games of this type, the idea is to tilt the stage with the joystick and maneuver a monkey in a ball (hence the name) and reach the goal.  The idea seems very simple at first, and it is, however when you try the 'expert' levels, you will realize just how hard this game is.  The game is easy to pick up and hard to put down...you will not finish it quickly.One of the major pluses of Super Monkey Ball is the multiplayer mode.  Three starting games are present, in which you have the ability to 'monkey fight' which is where you try to push another monkey off of the stage using a punching glove and extras in an arena, very similar to 'Bumper Ball' in the Mario Party games.  Also, there is Monkey Target in which you try to land a monkey ball on stages to receive points.  Complimented finally by Monkey race, in which a mariokart-ish engine is used, with only three tracks.  Also, the bonuses in the game which are earned by doing well in the main game are fun as well.  Monkey Billiards (Pool), Monkey Bowling, and Monkey Golf (Putt-Putt).  Overall, the multiplayer is a very enjoyable experience.Music is good, and it doesn't inhibit the gameplay...Graphics are decent, and don't take advantage of the gamecube's abilities, but they aren't going to make you turn your head the other way or break any mirrors.  Also, the Controls are very easy to pick up.  The joystick is the only thing used in the main game...Overall, I'd give this game 5 stars, and it is a must for the serious gamecube gamer!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2002"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Dwayne Hicks - 3/22/14 till Gears 3 on Xbox One","summary":"New to Resident Evil","reviewText":"I was new to the resident evil series and had downloaded the demo for this game on PSN. I hated the demo with no tutorial to explain the melee system and help with real time inventory management I kept dying from endless hordes of zombies. so I did not buy the game at launch. However after reading all the reviews I decided to buy the game any way months later. Man am I glad I did.Pros-This game looks great and is super addictive. It is so fun blowing away the monsters in this game. I have played through this game twice and there is still so much more to do the replay-ability n this game is off the charts I will be playing this for a long time. Online Co-op mode is great and as long as you have a good partner you may just run through the whole game in one sitting thats how fun this game is. With a headset the game is intense and very fun.Cons - The final boss battles with wesker are very tedious. Controls take getting used too. Playing the game with AI partner is so frustrating Sheva continually shoots you in the back.If you were like me and did not like the demo, I still suggest at least renting the game you will most likely love it.

{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Xebec51","summary":"Good game-bad port","reviewText":"I'm not saying this is a bad game by any means-just look at the rave reviews it got.

For one, the game is very simplistic. There is no leveling up, there are no side quests, no secret weapons (at least not the first time you play), all you do is run around this HUGE seamless map and fight a total of 16 giant monsters. Some fly, some walk, some slither, some swim, and one that just stays right where he is.The boss fights are truly amazing! And like many reviewers have said before, when you slay one of these mammoth beasts, you can't help but feel a little sad at having killed such an amazing creature.Another thing this game does a good job at is giving the player the sense that they are seemingly powerless. When you shoot an arrow at one of these monsters, chances are it will hit the fur and deal damage equal to 1/100 of the monster's total health, or the arrow will BOUNCE (great arrow physics in this game) harmlessly off the monster's armored body.The environments are breathtaking (deserts, forests, lakes, mountain passes, valleys, etc), all the time reminding you of Ico because of the shades of colors used are so similar.Then there are the minor details that add to the game: 1) If you reflect the light off your sword into a grassy area, a small ball of fire will appear for a split second. 2) Arrows shot at the monsters stay embedded in their fur. They don't disappear instantly and it is often possible to pepper the top of a monster's head with arrows until it looks like a pin cushion!--and the monster STILL isn't even close to dead yet!!!When it comes to boss fights (and that's all this game really is), my favorite ones were against the flying creatures (especially the second one), the two-legged monster with a sword in his right hand, and the lizard monster in the arena. But to be honest, all the fights are exhilirating in their own little way.I rated Ico 5 out of 5 stars. Unfortunately, SOTC only captures about 4.5 out of 5 and right now I'll go into why SOTC slipped half a point.Simplistic, but TOO simplistic: All you do is run around on foot or with your horse, Agro, and follow the beam of light that your sword provides to find the next monster. There are no minor enemies of any sort. Sure, a few lizards and birds you can kill and eat, but this doesn't noticably alter your character.With a game that is boasting such beautiful environments, I felt that the least they could have done was have a crystal (that acts like a camera) to allow players to take screenshots. Maybe this could have even been incorporated into a clever mini-game.Although you have an arrow and a sword, you always have to resort to the sword to finish off a Colossus. The arrows are mostly just for distraction or for hitting hard to reach areas. Don't get me wrong, I wounded the first Colossus down to half of his health with only arrows, but I was disappointed that I couldn't finish the job with that same strategy. It would have added much more replay if there was more than one way to kill a Colossus.If there was one thing I hated about SOTC, it was the camera.When you're riding your horse, the camera is usually situated so that you and the horse are on the left side of the screen (why not centered???) and directly behind you. The problem with this, is that you can't see directly what is in FRONT of you. Your horse is not so dumb as to jump off a cliff, but still, many times you'll find yourself almost doing just that. The simple solution to this problem would have been to have a \"Lock\" feature, to keep the camera in place or locked onto a specific target.One of SOTC's strong points is it's sprawling, open landscape, just waiting for an adventurer like you to run around and explore it. But at the same time, they stabbed themselves in the foot by making it that you can only fight the Colossi in a specific order. And every time you kill a Colossi you get warped back to the huge castle you started at. The game would have been much more adventuresome if the sword did NOT give you clues to where the Colossi were, but if instead you just wandered around until you bumped into them.The gameplay is very short-lived. I beat the entire game, from the time I pressed Power on my PS2 to the time the game said, \"END\", in about 11 hours. To be honest, I wouldn't mind fighting a few of the Colossi again, but to play the whole game again would seem like a chore.This brings us to the ending of the game. After having finally beaten the last Colossi, I was disappointed in many ways by the ending.HERE THERE BE SPOILERS****************For a short while, you get to CONTROL a Colossus, but the controls provide little or no positive feedback. I could make my Colossus turn around, but it appeared that it randomly breathed fire or smashed his arm into the ground. What's the point in letting a player control something if you are not really in control if it???SOTC would have had so much replay value if there was a mode (after beating the main game) where you get to control all of the 16 Colossi and fight a computer AI character. Really! Who WOULDN'T want to shoot lasers at a little guy on a horse or shake your body around and try and throw him off and then step on him?After that part of the ending, the horse (thought dead from falling into a river) meets the princess in the castle and together they find . . . a baby???!!!In ICO I really cared about the fragile princess, trying to rescue her while fighting off hordes of shadow-shapes. In this game, the only emotion I felt at the end was sadness, because the main character you've identified with for 11 hours is now nothing more than a child without a future.*****************HERE END THE SPOILERSWith so many complaints, how can this only result in deducting HALF a star in the overall rating of this game? Simple. SOTC earns its high marks because it is an original follow-up to a great game and offers gameplay and experiences that you will not find on any other console. The developers of this game get major kudos for thinking outside of the box and trying something different. This game is just brimming with wonderful ideas, unfortunately it could have used a few more and just needed a bit of polishing up with a few others.Our hero effortlessly holds onto the harsh crags towards the very top of a mountain of great video games but fails in ever reaching the summit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"kirill lagountchik","summary":"don't expect to actually PLAY your way thru the game...","reviewText":"If you are like others, then when you are getting a video game, you actually want to play it, not watch it. So that's why this &quot;video game&quot; cannot be classified as one. You are going to be watching the cutscenes for the most part in Metal Gear Solid 2, so don't expect to experience any intensity or adrenaline while you &quot;play&quot; this game. The gameplay itself isn't that great to hide that flaw. While the graphics are very good(I have seen a lot better visuals in other action games), it is not a lot of fun to watch a movie made with an in-game engine, where the developers include a gimmick that allows you to rotate the camera and zoom in while you watch.Overall, MGS2 is a lack-of-gameplay kind of game. Sure, the graphics are nice when you have those tight little rooms to play in, that is why Konami could raise the bar in the graphics, because there are no wide-open spaces that could limit the quality of the graphics. Places where the game is set have a very &quot;locked&quot; feel to them, with small rooms, tight corridors, and very limited outdoor environments. There is a lot of detail though: high quality weather effects, nice facial expressions, rain bouncing off the barrel of your firearm, fluid and smooth animation, real-looking smoke, fire,....nothing that you would not find in other games of 2001, there is nothing special in MGS2. The audio on the other hand is pretty much like the first Metal Gear - the audio is great, the voice acting is superb, and the sound is very well done, unlike in other games that have good graphics but lack good sound (it is very common these days), Metal Gear Solid 2 is an exception, with outstanding sound, voice-acting, and soundtrack.The actual gameplay is based on stealth. The AI in the game is smart and the enemies will not shoot you as soon as they see you, unlike in other games they will try to avoid shooting you upon the encounter unless they really need to, it is the same thing the cops would do to the bad guy if there is no threat of them being killed. They will try to disarm you and knock you out, and that kind of stuff - all of it is pretty cool. The interaction between Snake and the NPCs (non-player characters) is astounding. Snake can sneeze all of a sudden and give himself up or if he is careless, guards can locate him by following his footprints. He also can distract guards in all kinds of ways, for example, he can drop something on the floor when nobody is watching, wait for a guard to come by, this item will draw the guard's attention and eventually will lead him to either being killed or incapacitated. Snake can also hide the bodies of the fallen enemies from other guards so they will not become alert. This is what you will see in Hitman.In Conclusion, MGS2 is not for a hardcore gamer. The part where you play the game is short, the story is easy to get lost in, and guards will come back to life - very annoying, and the fact that the best cover is a cardboard box is pathetic. The main weakness (to most people, but some think it is a strong point) is that a big portion of the game is cutscenes and an overwhelming and extremely complex story. On the plus side you have those &quot;brilliant&quot;,&quot;gorgeous&quot;,&quot;breathtaking&quot;, or whatever-you-call-it graphics, which are no big deal to me. What also is great? - gotta be the sound. What I would say? - if you like stealth so much, get this game, if you are a big fan of Solid Snake/Metal Gear, you probably already have it, some of you are disappointed, some of you are glad the way this game was done, but for me, a true video game enthusiast, this game is no biggie, could have been a whole lot better if it was more like the first one.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2001"}

Kim","summary":"Not quite enough for 5 Stars...But still..","reviewText":"I just finished playing Castlevania:Harmoney of Dissonance. I have bought two other great GBA games along with Castlevania, and without any hesitation I picked Castlevania to play it right  away. I can honestly tell you that I'm satisfied with overall production value, however...I read it in the magazine/reviews, saying that music was way out of line, outdated like good old NES time.. I wouldn't say it's THAT outdated, and also it was good enough, more than enough to create and convey the classic atmosphere of Castlevania series. What I really liked about this series was the graphic. Personally, I'm not really into graphic when it comes to gaming, however, graphic plays a significant role in Castlevania series and I'm more than satisfied with the graphic, which they managed to produce. The movement of Juste, the protagonist of the game, is simply unbelievable, par with the one from the Symphony of the Night for PlayStation.Ok, I'll get to the point. I really welcome the idea of expanding the whole map so players can spend more time, which i find myself being thrilled like in PS version, like they did for Symphony of the Night for PS. However, the way they expanded, or more accurately doubled the size of the map, wasn't that inspiring like in PS version. In PS version, they included this 'inverted' castle, where every single area looks and is brand new, with all new enemies...whereas in this version, it was just simply doubled instead of being 'new'... So though you were going back and forth to get from Castle A to Castle B, it felt like you were just running around the same castle with little bit of change here and there, which you could tell it was done poorly with no solid effort.  I was more frustrated then found pleasure out of this poor, poor effort of simplying doubling the original castle, compare to awesome PS version (I might be complaining about this simply because i have played PS version, for those who haven't played PS version, i'm not sure about how you will take it as..)I didn't think the bosses were that easy, or may be it's just me who were having hard time with them. My point is that if you are there to fight with the bosses with no potion or any kind, I don't think there are lot of people out there who can say that they can manage to beat every single boss easily with confidence. It looks like the boss fights turned out to be easy one because of there's unlimited, literal unlimited supply of potions from merchants- Okay, may be you can control yourself from using no potion at all, but the VERY ESSENCE OF CASTLEVANIA SERIES HAS BEEN THIS 'THRILL' YOU GET FROM FIGHTING EVERY SINGLE BOSS WITH LIMITED HEALTH, PERIOD. The very serious flaw of PlayStation version, the flaw that the game became way to easy toward the end, has been fixed in the Circle of the Moon, the previoius GBA version by having consistent difficulty, yet that 'similiar' problem, I wouldn't say it's similiar but overall-wise, the game was on easy side when you compare it with previous Castlevania games. Of course, this game has this RPG element to it and character has to become stronger to face stronger enemies, but the game was still on the easy side.I believe they could've done something by drastically raising the difficulty as the game progresses.Now, why would I give this game 5 Stars with all the critical flaws I just mentioned above? Well, I don't know, but it seems like it's hard to find a 'worthy' game, worthy enough to finish it all the way, devoting my time out of busy schedule these days. So I figure that it offered enough elements and fun factor to finish it all the way in couple days. It's a great game. Well, it's a Castlevania game and i might have this favoritism for the series, however, I'm satisfied with this very series for GameBoyAdvance from objective perspective as well.Enjoy it!PS: Don't forget to get the 'real' ending","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2002"}

Well, Red Steel 2 should probably have a different name, because there is barely ANYTHING similar between this game and the game that came before it. The only thing kept from the original is the sword + revolver gameplay.Red Steel 2 is about a member of a clan who was banished for a certain number of years. When he comes back, he finds that the village where his sword+gun wielding clan had once lived had been turned into a ghost town over-run by bandits. The storyline takes this simple starting and turns it into a great adventure that soon turns into a clan war, with the Hero being the only one left of his clan.The Hero is supposed to represent the kick-butt guy inside all of us, and through precise motion control that has never been felt in a video game, through flawless first-person-shooter game mechanics, and through a 10 hour compelling storyline that'll keep any gamer playing, Red Steel 2 takes you on an adventure to that part of you that fights off the army that opposes you.Young players, or even young viewers, be warned that this game can look quite violent. Looking on isn't so bad as actually playing: doing the motion control and stabbing the villain, which makes it feel as if you REALLY have done it.

The system is pretty light at about 6 pounds.The controller is in my opinion the best controller of the last gen game consoles.  You have to buy a memory card to save your games which is good if you have friends that play the games you do.  You can just bring your memory card with you when you travel.  Also, if you insert the memory card before you put a game in you can look through your card to see what games you have saved on it.  This is good if you want to delete a game or make a copy of another.  It also shows you the date and time you made the save.  I though it was neat to see when I saved the games I saved on it.The system plays very quietly and lasts a long time.  I have had mine since like 98 and it still plays great.  If you looking for a big game list, your in luck.  If you look playstation 2 games up on amazon you will see more than 1000!  They have games that more than likely everyone will enjoy.  Now you can go online with the system.  However I'm not sure how many games actually have online portions in the ps2.  It was to late for ps2 fans to care.  Also, you could have a hard drive for the system for games like Final Fantasy 11.  I only have one because I beta tested the game and got mine free.  I don't know if more than 5 games even use the hard drive.  You don't need to have games to use it though.  You can store all your ps2 game saves from your memory card to the hard drive.  I have SO many saves on it.  So that is one cool thing you can do.  I am pretty sure the new ps2s don't even have space for the hard drive.

Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk.

It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Revival of a Classic","reviewText":"Metroid: Zero Mission is a remake of the original Metroid.  But this isn't just any remake: It's packed with lots of extras and new gameplay elements to update it from the original.  Updated graphics, story and extras. If you've played the original Metroid or LOVE the Metroid series you OWE it to yourself to pick this game up!Nice updated graphics will enhance the gameplay and exploration of the game. Nice, sharp, crisp graphics that are to die for! Not only that but now the game includes Full Motion Videos to move the story along!  This game truly takes advantage of the GBA's capabilities.The sound has even been improved and you'll undoubtably love the new upgrade in sound.  Better sound effects and the music is not so different from the original (though I loved the original).The gameplay is more or less the same but this time you've got more help.  The game now has the map in the upper right hand corner of the screen to guide you.  Statues also help lead you to your next objective as well.  Hallways are also changed.  Also, Samus has a Power Grip and Space Jump ability, previously not in the original game.The game also includes a whole new mission! After you defeat the Mother Brain there's actually more to follow.  This will help to tie all the Metroid games (including Prime) together.  Not to mention that as a bonus Nintendo threw in the original Metroid!  So you can actually compare the two.However, the game still has its setbacks.  For one, its still rather short. Longer than Metroid Fusion but not by that much.  Second, the new statues guiding you make it seem like the game is holding your hand too much.  That and the fact that this game is much easier than the original (that can be good or bad).  But don't let those things stop you from picking up this title.  If you're a Metroid fan you owe it to yourself to pick this up right away!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2004"}

I love the pace of Portal 2, as well as solving the puzzles. I may be in the minority here, but I don't play games competitively; I play them to have fun. Thus I found some of the puzzles very challenging, definitely not easy like some of the reviewers have said. Yes I am prepared for a barrage of \"lrn 2 play\" comments. Therefore, I have not played the co-op mode. The camera takes some getting used to, but the portals really do abide by the laws of physics. You exit a portal at the same speed at which you enter, as well as the same orientation. It would be unnatural any other way.

I'd been paying very little attention to the Xbox at that point, so I didn't know what game to buy with the console. I'm a big Silent Hill fan, and I knew that the Xbox version of SH2 included an extra quest, not to mention Silent Hill 3 had recently been announced and my brain was basically abuzz with Silent Hill fever... so I bought Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams. Well, the extra quest ended up taking less than 90 minutes to complete, and I was then left with a copy of a game that was in almost every other way identical to the PS2 version, but with a slightly better looking flashlight effect. To anyone else in a situation similar to mine, I heartily recommend Halo, Munch's Oddysee, GunValkyrie, and Jet Set Radio Future.To everyone else, if you enjoy a complex and mature psychological horror mystery that will creep you out like you've never been creeped out before, get Silent Hill 2 NOW.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2002"}

(almost)","reviewText":"This review is mainly about the game and not its security features (activation or otherwise). As you know, the controversy about the sexual encounters in the game was blown totally out of proportion. The MOST you will see is Liara's bare bottom and back. I'd rate it somewhere around PG-13 content.The music and soundtrack is incredible and apropos. It reminded me of Blade Runner and 1980s electronic music, and I wasn't surprised to read an interview of the designer for Mass Effect 2 described it the same way.The interface is rather clunky at times, especially when ordering squad mates around or controlling their weapon usage. The Mako rover controls aren't THAT bad, but the physics engine is totally messed up. The DPV/FAV in Battlefield 2 has some decent physics and they should have modeled the Mako after that vehicle since it is also an EA game.The weapons are usual run of the mill sci-fi stuff, nothing too extravagant. The best weapons to get are the Spectre Master gear when you have over 1 million credits and you are over Level 50. The best armor to get Is Colossus X, and I recommend getting the highest level Shield Modulator you can so you get extra shields.The game play is annoying at times. There are lots of side missions like the ones in Oblivion or STALKER. Admiral Hackett wants you to investigate X in system Y. Admiral Hackett needs you to negotiate a situation, kill someone, or do something. If you finish the main plot, you cannot continue playing. Mass Effect 2 is supposed to change this, although I totally understand why Mass Effect 1 does not allow this. The Citadel takes a pounding in the main storyline at the end, so the designers would have had to make a new model for Citadel in case you continued playing.The main plot is too short. Once I equipped my squad with decent hardware and weapons, all of the enemies were too easy. I spent 20 hours playing but I figure about 3-5 hours is all that is needed to finish the main story. All of the mineral searching and side missions became repetitious so I stopped doing that. Decrypting everything from probes, rocks (yes, you have to decrypt mineral samples), lockers, and cases got boring very quickly.Pros: Immersive story and music. Decent voice acting as well. The graphics are not cutting-edge for a game that came out in 2007-2008. The hair on many of the characters looked fake.Cons: Portions of the game play are repetitious and boring: rover driving, mineral searching, side missions, decrypting stuff, and the elevator loads.Overall: I'd definitely recommend playing through Mass Effect if you are a fan of Oblivion or STALKER.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2009"}

Both games utilized branching chapters with different character POV, as well as a countdown \"barometer\" to heighten the tension.While structurally similar, Heavy Rain is at it's best a much more beautiful, and troubling urban vision... not getting bogged down in supernatural or sci-fi conventions requiring copious suspension of disbelief, it instead strives vigorously to create REAL tension by taking the player to places rarely seen in videogames. It's settings are striking and depressing and highlight the frailty of the characters to wonderful effect. It has a quality of truthfulness to it only hinted at in most games. As videogame art, it is a real high note.The downside, is that you really can't break out of the game's underlying design aesthetic of appearance of choice. In no way does the game adapt or change it's storyline depending on the decisions you make. It tells it's story and prompts you to react or not to react to different situations. There are 'stronger' or 'weaker' cutscenes that will follow certain actions, but they do not alter where the story goes.Co-dependency of the character arcs is another problem. In order to use another character more fully (see more cutscenes that fill out the story), you may find you have to screw up with the one you're playing. This is a very counter-intuitive context in a story with high emotional stakes, like Heavy Rain.There is some questionable stereotyping of women here as well, either depicting women as sex objects, or failures without men, or falling in \"love\" for no apparent reason. It would not bother me as much as it did if other aspects of the story were more tawdry and b-grade, but in a game trying so hard to sell the idea of connection with family and weathering tragedy, using women (and in particular, mothers) as props seemed in questionable taste.Cliched characters aside Heavy Rain is still a dazzling and visceral experience with an evocative message about fatherhood, and it's a joy to look at... but there's not too much to do once you've beaten it once. You get locked up in the characters the first time you play and replaying it just feels cheap. Indigo Prophecy differed in this perhaps in that the 'mystery' really wasn't central to the plot, so replaying that game felt more natural.I would recommend this game as a rent, to buy would depend on the taste of the gamer, although it's certainly demo material.Definitely R Rated, adult themed game.  Not for pre-teens whatsoever.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004YVOCYG","description":"","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"A \"Must Have\" For Fans of The Series","reviewText":"Many of the 3 & 4 Star ratings on here tend to touch on the same \"talking points\" I will make as far as what is good and bad about the game. If you have the previous 3 titles, I will say without hesitation, you should add this to your collection for the obvious reasons. Even though I have only played through about 75% of the story thus far Ubisoft has made a great effort to fill in many unanswered questions from the previous entries. In AC: Revelations the story isn't nearly as captivating as the previous entries ....... there just aren't any real fascinating characters introduced in this entry, plus I felt a very big void without some of my favorite charcters from AC:2 and Brotherhood in this entry (I won't give names or details to spoil it, but just to give you a heads up).As far as gameplay goes I would have thought Ubisoft could have further improved the controls for this one. They've never been 100% perfect but I always would overlook that aspect of the game because the story was always awesome, characters were memorable, and some of the side games added to the gameplay in the previous 2 installments made for excellent \"fill-in\" time when you wanted to just explore the open world.They did add a few new features and other reviewers accrately pointed out the pros and cons of these. Bomb making adds a little strategic planning and I haven't mastered it yet, but I am goofing around with it a bit and trying for some of the so-called Bomb challenges. My biggest issue though lies with the Den Defense ...... why ? Some may actually enjoy something like this being added in a game but I don't care for it, plus the controls for it are not very polished (clunky you could say). Add in the armored attack sequence at the end (which I fail at 9 out of 10 times !!) and that makes it even less enjoyable than it already is. I will finally add that this concept really isn't even new. I have played the Undead Nightamre add-on pack for Red Dead Redemption and one of the things that you do in that DLC from Rockstar is defend your towns from \"re-infestation\" of Zombies who take back control while your out trying to save another town. At least that (in an add-on pack) was OK to play and you get a \"Spinning Plates\" achievement for having all towns saved at the same time, so there was a little incentive to hold them all down. With AC: Revelations that is not the case and furthermore, it's nothing but a headache when your trying to aquire money and restore the city, then find out the Den is under attack and the stores you have not restored become locked under Templar control again, it's just annoying !! Ubisoft could have done away with this and added more depth to the story ...... a trade-off I would have gladly taken. Thankfully I was able to purchase this title through Amazon on a 1-day sale for $35. It was shipped fast and it arrived 2 days before its scheduled arrival date !! Very fast !!As I have already stated, it's a must have if you have been a fan of the series, but it falls a little short of the other entries particularly when it comes to the story. My advice is wait to get it at a reasonable price and try to avoid the $50+ asking price that's out there now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

Making it to the end of the game was very rewarding and made it all worth it!For those of you who have played Kingdom Hearts for the PS2 and are going to play Kingdom Hearts 2, this game is the one that links Kingdom Hearts with Kingdom Hearts 2. In Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, the whole story explains what happened to Riku after the events in Kingdom Hearts, and it shows what happened between Axel, Sora, and Namine before Kingdom Hearts 2. So why isn't this game KH2 and the new one for the PS2 Kingdom Hearts 3? Well, it's because this game isn't a true sequel to Kingdom Hearts because you play through all of the same levels as KH1, and by the end of the game Sora loses all of his memories, so it's as though the whole thing never happened. (Dont act like that's a spoiler, play the game for ten minutes and it tells you that it's going to happen.) But it's worth playing to find out what happened between Sora, Axel, and Namine in the past.For those of you who haven't played the original Kingdom Hearts, or dont own a PS2, the game is worth playing because of how cool the KH series is, and since it's not a true sequel and has a story of it's own... You dont have to play Kingdom Hearts to enjoy it.Although this game's battle system is very annoying and hard to work with, the game has an amazing story and great graphics!Making it to the end of the game and seeing the breath taking 3D ending cut scene makes all of the frustration that you felt while playing through certain points in the game all worth it!Pros: Great game with a great story!Amazing 3D cut scenes throughout the game make it a pleasant gaming experience!It's amazing that the GBA is capable of such Great graphics, and PS2 quality cut scenes!Game contains the KH theme song, \"Simple and clean\" which plays during the credits after you beat the game!The voice acting, while limited, is still very good.A great game for people who like Kingdom Hearts, but dont own a PS2.The story for Riku's mission is very deep and explains what happens after Sora's mission ends, so it's kinda like you're buying 2 games in one!Cons: The card battle system is very annoying, and takes alot of getting used to.Leveling up is hard because you have to collect gems that fall from your fallen enemies to gain experience!Because of how you level up, you have to run around, or roll under other enemies on the field in order to get at the experience gems!Leveling up is also annoying because of the fact that you need alot of CP (Card Points) to increase the size of your deck, so you're always having to upgrade your CP which makes it hard to find time to upgrade your HP (Health Points)Sometimes you'll get so frustrated while playing that you will feel like turning it off, and never playing it again!50/50: You have to unlock The Soul of Rebirth option if you want to play as Riku and find out what happened to him after KH1, but Riku's mission is so much fun and so much less annoying to play than Sora's mission so it's well worth the trouble of beating the game as Sora to unlock it.While there are no cut scenes during Riku's mission, the cut scene at the end of Riku's mission in nothing short of awesome!Overall: Although this game can be very annoying at times, and even drive you crazy! The game has a great story, and even when you're most frustrated with it, you'll find yourself wanting to play it just so you can see what happens next. On top of that, this is one of the only GBA games that I've ever seen that has 3D graphics anywhere in the game! Sure there have been other GBA games with some 3D, but not this kind of 3D! I'm talkin' PS2 quality 3D! The game itself isn't 3D, so dont get the wrong idea... But the cut scenes that take place during certain parts of the game are. So if you've got the money, I recomend buying this game. Yes, it really annoyed me at times, but the amazing ending made it all worth it for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2006"}

Grand Theft Auto: Vice City more than expands on the world and leaves in very few problems.Story: While making a deal, our sort of hero(who actually has a name this time: Tommy Vercetti), rival gang members shoot everyone but him and take off with the money and a large supply of cocaine. So in order to find it, again, our sort of hero has to go through a bunch of missions that relate directly or not to the missing money and cocaine.Gameplay: This is where the game shines as if you had doubts. You can run over pedestrians, shoot them, hit them with bats, bomb them, drive cars off ramps, change your radio station, get some prostitutes, this has everything. Although, not everything. Target system is still annoying(A guy with a gun is aiming at you, why you aiming at the woman across the road?) and some missions will annoy the [stuffing] out of you.Graphics: Very nicely done. While it's still cartoon blood and rather minimal explosions, the city has been made extra sweet looking, as well as the cars.Music: ah, the voices. Lots of times you'll go \"hey wasn't that voice from Goodfellas?\" or that guy who you can't pinpoint the voices. Then there's a lot more radio stations to choose from.

It is very unforgiving of mistakes, but most of the \"trash\" mobs are harder than the bosses.. Many areas/fights you just will die unless you read a guide or a player left a hint beforehand, because there is no other way to know how you need to prepare. The fights are fun, and normally being hit more than once without healing up means you die, but really once you figure out (or look up) what you need to do for the fight it is extremely easy. When people talk about how brutal it is all they really mean is having to fight your way back to the souls you lost or losing them forever if you die again.. not challenging, just unforgiving.The tendency system is extremely annoying. To gain pure white character tendency you need to kill black phantoms. To kill black phantoms (other than players) you need pure black world tendency in that area. For that you need to kill yourself several times in body form (and resurrecting with a stone to kill your body again.) The most frustrating part of all this is if you log in the game while online it resets your world tendency, and can reset it randomly while your playing online.. Pure black is a bit easier, just need to kill some friendly npcs. Its like watching paint dry.. why people love doing this is beyond me.There is also an area where you literally trudge around in water picking up loot with very little fighting at like 50% reduced walk speed and chug poison dispels since the water randomly poisons you for several hours.. seriously? Granted you can skip the loot and get through it all in under an hour.. but why have an area like that at all?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2011"}

There is still all the depth and enjoyment of the original, while adding two more characters and the next level of Kumite mode, Quest mode!  This mode is a challenging ongoing game where you make your name in every arcade in Tokyo, eventually getting to the center Arena, to become the best Virtua Fight in Japan.  Yes, it is a bit tacky, but that is not what is important.  Customizable characters get even better as a new array of items is found.  You can also get new fighting modes in the central arena, like balance and a mode where you take extra damage when you hit the floor.  The fighting moves have always been, and still are, incredibly complex and deep.  This is one of the only games I have seen that includes evasion, counterattacks, throw evades, and rolls that allow you to avoid ground attacks.  It takes a while to master, but once you get it, it is a very deep and ingenious control system.  The reviewer that gave two stars seems to be what most people are that dont like VF4: impatient.  He claims that it is too easy in quest mode, but by the time you progress throughout Tokyo, you begin to fight some fighters that are modeled after real people that are among the best VF players in the world.  They also lack the patience to go to practice sessions and explore the numerous moves available to them.  The only regretable thing to VF4 Evolution is the lack of training your own A.I., which is included in the original.  Most VF4 fans can compensate by just whipping out their old copies.  If you are new to the series and you want to play the A.I. training version, then I suggest that you buy VF4 and VF4 Evolution, they are only $20 each and are both well worth it.  Overall, I would say that VF4 Evolution is a wonderful game that makes other fighting games, with the exception of Soul Caliber 2, look just plain silly.  VF4 Evolution, in my opinion could even top the prowess of SC2.  Buy this, or at least rent it, you will not regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2003"}

Unfortunately, Black Isles did not strike gold twice.  While Icewind Dale is a carbon copy of their excellent Baldur's Gate games in many ways, it lacks the personality that make the BG series great.IWD actually has a number of things in its favor.  The character creation system is very rich, allowing you to customize your party of six in true D&D; fashion.  Also, there is a long list of abilities, spells, and equipment that you'll run across, as well as visually appealing environments, solid voice acting, and compelling music.  Some of the dungeons can be genuinely creepy, and there's a sense of accomplishment once you clear one out.Unfortunately, the game is deeply flawed.  IWD is a bit too hard, even for a person who has some experience with RPG dungeon-crawling.  Even worse, it's an artificial toughness designed to lengthen the game by requiring you to repeatly reload saved games.  Your characters will die countless times, and this simply can't be avoided.  And since your cleric will not be able to resurrect dead party members until late in the game (Raise Dead scrolls are expensive too), you will not be able to continue the game with dead characters.  It's really a shame that the developer did not pace the game better, since it's going to turn off a lot of people from the very beginning.If you can get beyond the tedium and frustration of having to save the game every 2 minutes (and reload it almost as often), the gaming experience is still rather uninspired.  The story is lackluster and cliche.  There is none of the banter between party members that made Baldur's Gate so fun.  All of this together becomes mind-numbing after a while, since the game profoundly lacks a sense of purpose or narrative power.  It's all really unfortunate since some effort obviously went into creating the game.Ultimately, if you haven't played Baldur's Gate, by all means play it (both BG1 & BG2). If you've already tasted the glory of the Baldur's Gate series, then IWD will probably be a disappointment.Pros:+rich D&D; character creation+good voice acting and music+wide range of spells, items, etc.Cons:-unnecessarily tedious and difficult-lackluster story-Baldur's Gate clone without the personality","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2006"}

From treasure hunting, to storyline, to stealth gameplay, to strategy firefight, to run and gun, this game does it all.  Elements of drama, romance, action, science fiction/fantasy, adventure, and comedy all rolled into one.  Some games have attempted multiple elements before (GTA IV, anyone?) but were overhyped and fell terribly short.Uncharted 2 is phenomenal to the point that I will be comparing future games (and now even past games) to it.  The graphics defy description.  I have a 50\" Panasonic Viera G10 television, and I have never seen a game with environments that range from lush, sunny, and beautiful to dark, dreary, creepy, and grimy.  As you fight the badguys and leap from precarious perch to precarious perch you will be in awe of your surroundings.  I sat RIVETED to my seat for exactly 8 hours and 6 minutes STRAIGHT without moving for food, drink, or sleep.  I decided to save and grab a drink and realized (after I saved) that I had been at it for six minutes longer than I spend at my JOB every day.  I was so engrossed and involved in the story.  I was angry when Drake suffered setbacks and elated when he figured a way around the bad guys or triumphed over an obstacle.The voice acting is stellar, the sounds in the game are crisp and clear, the graphics are unmatched by any other existing game, and now I find myself wanting to pick up Uncharted: Drake's Fortune to get those last three trophies for my platinum.  I want to kill more bad guys with all the different weapons.  I want to find all the treasures.  There are some levels that I want to play over and over all by themselves because they can only be described as epic.  The game flows from play to movie without any hesitation.  The controls quickly become second nature and are comfortable to execute.If you have a PS3, do yourself a favor and save whatever money you can to buy this game.  If you do not have a PS3, go beg on the street corner or collect cans or mow lawns to buy one and then buy this game.  You are missing out on a game that has landed its name within a very elite collection of games that define their genre.  How Wolfenstein set the name for FPS, Halo redefined FPS, Final Fantasy created RPGS and how FFVII blasted the RPG genre into everyone's video game dialogue.  Among Thieves has redefined 3rd person action/adventure gaming and has carved itself a notch at the top, more than likely to be potentially dethroned only by the (already prayed for by me) release of Uncharted 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}

This game is really nothing amazing after playing the DS version, that version felt new, great and a ton of fun. This version brings back some of the good stuff, the classic art and the usual power-ups plus some new additions like propeller hat. The design is usual, a bunch of worlds, have to pass through them, get to the dungeon, pass that crazy lava inspired goodness, and get at the bad guy. This new version has great background music, too.Something isn't right with this iteration which is why I'm removing a star, the motion controls feel like it's forcefully designed just for the sake of including motion control. The game could have lived really well without the motion controls that weren't very good for some parts of the game like tilting motions.

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"PantsuPanic","summary":"If you're buying for co-op, read this.","reviewText":"A paint by numbers Mario platformer that does little whatsoever to evolve the series. Primary selling point is the co-op multiplayer. However co-op suffers terribly due to the constant unavoidable collisions of players bashing into one another. Due to this failure of game design, players will constantly kill one another due to accidentally jumping on each others' heads or knocking each other off ledges, etc. If players could simply pass through one another like ghosts without colliding, the co-op would have been awesome. As it is... the co-op is a broken aggravating mess. Take away the co-op, and you're stuck with a cookie cutter Mario platformer that doesn't live up to the NES and SNES glory days by a mile.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

I stopped several times just to watch the lighting and transparency effects. I am continually impressed by the 360's ability to process such complex effects while delivering an action packed game at a smooth frame rate, no drop-offs or lock ups.I do, however, have some complaints. Bioshock makes it way to easy to win. A directional arrow shows you exactly where to go, which is nice, but in the same breath, you will focus more on the arrow pointer than on the gorgeous levels. Often you will complete gopher missions: pick up object A and drop at point B. Your enemy is not varied much. You fight basically a variation of a humanoid/mutant and the wet-suit dude on the box cover. I also wish the game would have put me outside of Rapture because I became bored seeing the same neon color scheme. In all, Bioshock rocks. Don't mind my whining. It's a great game, so take it for a ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2007"}

With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

What more do you want, fanboys?Pros:+ The graphics are the best I've seen yet on the 3DS.+ There is so much content, meaning unlockables and modes.Cons:- The controls are uncomfortable to say the least. There is no possible control scheme out of the box that is remotely perfect.If you use the default setup of using the touchscreen to aim, your left hand will cramp because you have your left index finger bent the whole time trying to hold onto the flimsy, thin L-button for dear life. Because of \"Ocarina of Time 3D\", my L-button was already on life-support, so sometimes, even when I am holding the button down all the way, it won't register on the 3DS, and projectiles won't emit from Pit's weapon.If you use the face buttons to aim, like in the \"MGS 3\" demo, you lose precision.If you use the circle-pad to aim, you gain the maladroitness of reversing your moving and shooting hands, something not seen since playing FPSs on the N64.Constructive ConclusionThis game would have been awesome on the Wii.

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Incomplete pass","reviewText":"Honestly, I am not a football fan at all (So I apologize if this review doesn't help), yet I'm familiar with the Madden lineup of video games thanks to my older brother, who has played Madden since its2000 edition on the Nintendo 64(Stopped atMadden 2007though). I had my own experiences once I played a demo of Madden 2004. However, I've never touched it since that one play, let alone any Madden game since. But out of pure curiosity (Gotta see what the hub-ub is about!) and boredom, I gave Madden 25 a shot.I sure have not missed out much.Madden 25, to me, served as a reminder that a football video game just doesn't work when portrayed in such a realistic manner. I really wanted to actually, you know, PLAY the thing, but there's so many pauses in between plays that it feels like I'm spending half the playtime on watching football players wander around close up to the camera. When I finally gain control, it's only a matter of time before the play ends and a pause follows. Oldschool NES classicTecmo Bowlwas a football game, but it gave the player all the options and input. Between plays in Tecmo Bowl, the only pause there is is when you're selecting the next play to call. Madden doesn't make me feel like I've done anything in between plays. While I will admit it's nice how Madden tries to present itself to look like real football, as a video game, it just is not fun.Besides, video games are ABOUT having fun, and doing what cannot be done in real life! If I wanted to play football, I would go and play football. Granted, I'd probably have to beef up a ton and gain some dexterity, but it'd still be the real deal!On top of that, it doesn't seem like there's ANYTHING that I haven't already seen when my brother was playing his unnecessarily multiple Maddens.  I mean, seriously! I'veseennumerousversionsofPAC-MANthat have more differences than the annual Madden releases!Plus, you'd think that with an exceptional number on the cover like 25 would make the game acknowledge that it's meant to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of this long-running charade, but no. It does nothing to acknowledge the Anniversary. It's just Madden.Again.And again.If there's anything that I do notice differs from Madden to Madden, it's that the graphics continuously grow more detailed, but at the same time, also loses color. Compare the colors of Madden 2007 to this. 07 is more colorful and appealing to the eye.On top of the colors being worse, I couldn't help but facepalm at the graphical glitches that pop up every now and then. The graphics clearly have not been perfected for release. There were certainly a couple times where I've seen a football player drink Gatorade during an intermission, but WAIT - The guy holding the bottle for him is holding it slightly below the player's mouth. OOPS. And then there's the occasional static hair and semi-puppet-like animations for everybody. To think EA was really trying to stress its new game engine. What's that supposed to accomplish again?If there's one very positive remark I have about the game, it's the quality of the in-game commentary. The commentary is absolutely flawless, and creates the atmosphere of a lifelike football game. I just wish the rest of the game was this top-notch.Unfortunately, we're left with a mess of a rushed product. Madden 25 is exactly what you'd expect, except probably worse. Now that my curiosity has been fulfilled, I should really go back to playing an actual video game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2013"}

This is a huge sandbox work full of crazy creatures with Attitude combining some excellent RPG elements making it a hell of lot of fun to build up your character.Watching there heads explode or seeing your STRONGMAN going berserk and tearing the enemy to pieces never gets old.Outstanding combat and graphics. Smooth animations, smooth controls, fun and challenging boss battles, COOP make this a must own for anyone. The COOP feature puts the icing on the cake.There some issues that will frustrate. The COOP doesn't always work, sometime playing you can hear voices of other online players that are not in the game, freezing, and the worst problems of all \"DRIVING\". Your car will constantly get stuck on and in everything cause lots of back and forth travel. You will also get stuck just simply walking, you character will just get stuck in a rock and if you cant kill yourself you must restart. In some cases this stuff can be a frustrating game breaker. The driving is not refined and is poorly executed. You even touch a pebble your car stops cold.If you haven't already pick this game up and when you finish its is supported by some great DLC. \"General Knoxx, Zombie island\" for a few bucks.So buy this game, strip the flesh and salt the wounds...:)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2010"}

I heard they were going to do a remake for it on 360 and at only $40. I pre-ordered it right away as i never came back to the halo series after the first game.The campaign is as good as i remembered, they touched up a lot of things graphically and all in all its a blast to play from start to finish. Skulls,achievements and easter eggs they're  all there and fun to obtain.online multiplayer, i have been spending my time online a lot. I have never played halo CE online on the xbox before but i did play it on the PC with LAN and it was a blast. Sadly its not the same multiplayer from the original but its not a problem for me as i never played that much anyway(i played it in my computer class in HS). But they did add a classic playlist which i gravitate to more whenever i start multiplayer.Fantastic game if your new to halo or just want to take trip through memory lane.  must have and its only $40 go buy it now!Here's hoping halo 4 is just as great","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"C.

And while old, Goldeneye is still exhilerating. I was stupid enough to trade in my Goldeneye copy for a nwer but NOT better game. Don't make the same mistake that I did, please! It is hard to get your hands on a good copy of Goldeneye these days. Protect your Goldeneye games! This game lives up perfectly to the movie, and for a 1997 game, the graphics and sound are excellent! Sure, Nightfire's fun, but it never revolutionized the gaming world like Goldeneye did. Goldeneye shoots TWINE and Agent Under Fire out of the sky. Nightfire can't even hold its ground against this solid and superb N64 title. In Goldeneye, you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film, and the single player campaign holds its ground. But multiplayer is where the game really shines, and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters 2 even. I have not played Goldeneye for over a year, but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly. Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy, I believe that Goldeneye is better, and I have a strong debate on that. The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED!! It boils down to this:if you own an N64, please play your Goldeneye copy or if you don't even know what this wonderful game is about, buy it now! Hey, all X-Box owners, Goldeneye is even better than Halo! There's no debate on that. Buy the game that started it all!My Rating:9.9!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2003"}

For $19.99, I decided to try it out.  Good move.  I started out with the Colts on the default level, and even though I lost the first game, I ran the table quite easily and won the Super Bowl.  It was quite enjoyable, but way too easy.  I decided to try it out on All-Pro in practice.  Still pretty easy.  I finally decided to try a \"Legends\" difficulty game of which I won.  So, I started a season on this, the most difficult level.  After four games though, I gave up.  I won two competitive games, then got blown out for no reason in the other two games.First, the positives.  The graphics are amazing.  The camera angles zoom in and out perfectly when passing.  The instant replays are highlights are truly realistic.  The presentation, with the SportsCenter highlights at half time are really polished.  The controls are intuitive and easy to get accustomed to.  The playbooks are well organized and easy to navigate.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first season.  Passing is fair and improvement can be seen with practice - exactly what you'd expect to see in a game.There are some negatives as well, but not that numerous.  The non playing aspects of the game (franchise signing, free agency, drafts, and the crib) are pretty boring, but fortunately you don't have to deal with it if you don't want to.  The crib is a sorry attempt at providing a place wher you can buy random rugs, lamps, and other non-related football stuff.  Also, lateral passes and dump offs just plain don't work.  Apparently Peyton Manning can lob a forty yard pass right into the receivers hands, but a five yard hitch will go ten feet above the Running backs head.  Running is way too easy in the early levels (Pro - 9 yard average), and way too difficult (Legends 2 yard average).  Also, some things didn't make sense.  Edgerrin James is somehow inferior to his backup in the latter level.The worst part, though, is the inconsistency of the last levels.  I still don't understand how I can win one game, and then lose 56-0, and then win again in the next game.  One game gives the feel of the perfect, competitive game.  Then the next game, Ahmen Green turns into Jesus on cleets and I feel like breaking my controller.  It's not really a more difficult level, it just is a cheaper level.  A terrible design that ruins the long term playability of this great football game, and though huge, is still the only major flaw.All in all, it's a good game.  For the price, it brings it to near great status and I would recommend it to any football fan.Pros:Great ValueGreat GraphicsPresentation - SportsCenter is polishedExtremely funCons:Laterals, outside passes don't workToo many dropped passes and interceptionInconsistent and cheap games in the more difficult levelRunning too easy in the easy levels, too hard in the end.Difficulty - MediumLearning Curve - Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"Fun...until it gets too frustrating.","reviewText":"\"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" had the potential to be a great game: incredible graphics, interesting story, and the whole Star Wars universe to work with.  While the game comes out looking fantastic, it's ruined by horrible playability.  Simply put: this game is what I have always feared RPG games would be.  The camera has a hard time following you; I died numerous times simply because the camera shifted to where both the Apprentice AND his opponent weren't on-screen.  And the controls are sluggish; if you want to strike with your light saber, you have to anticipate when you'll use it, and press the button about a second in advance (in case you're wondering, your enemies don't have the same hesitation).  And don't even think of trying to swing your light saber while in midair; you will simply hang in the air, executing an impressive-looking combo, while your enemies are free to shoot you at their leisure.Maybe it was just the system I played on (PS3), but \"The Force Unleashed\" had far too many flaws for my taste.  Get this: there's the option to save during a game, at any time you want...but you can't load from where you saved, you can only load from where the game automatically saved you (which isn't always in a logical spot; I walked away after spending a couple hours trying to defeat a difficult character--thanks, crappy camera--and then, when I finally beat it, I died immediately afterward by falling into a pit because the camera couldn't keep up with me, and had to start over BEFORE the battle).  The loading time, too, is unbelievably slow; and you have to load a lot--there are even loading times to go between menu options!Ultimately, I feel let down by \"The Force Unleashed.\"  Is it an incredible-looking game?  Oh yes.  Is it fun?  Yeah, until you get so frustrated you want your money back.  I gave it three stars because I have the feeling I will return to it in a few weeks, once I've gotten a few other games out of my system, and have the time to just die repeatedly.  But as it stands, I'm rather sorry I bought this game.  Could've been great, but too many flaws ruin the experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

This is truly one awesome game. It is an open sandbox game, and quests are easily located. Meanwhile you can roam the terrain and shoot anything that moves!The guns in Borderlands sound terrific, they really make this a cool game. And there's lots of guns. Guns, guns, and more guns! As you use the various types of guns, they will level up and increase your fighting capabilities. Lots of ammo, too, is required to survive the rigors of Pandora, as you search for the ever-elusive Vault!There are four characters to choose from, and each has their own skill set. I liked Mordecai, since he gets a great healing item later in the game, but all of the characters have merit as playable roles.And, to top it off, there is DLC on the disk now. My favorite was the Zombie Island, and I suggest you head there around level 36-37. Armory of Knoxx is still a challenge at levels 38+, so do that one second. Last, but not least, is the intergalactic ninja claptrap episode!Borderlands has its share of boss battles, and they are tons of fun.
