Coming from a guy who used to have to play \"Strat o Matic,\" football, (An incredibly accurate, but time consuming game,) seeing all of a game plan pan out on screen was a miracle.  I'm 52, give me a break!I won't drone on about what others have already stated about the game, so for me, the deal breaker is Franchise Mode.  Why screw with the most popular mode in the game, to this extent??No fantasy draft, can't move my team, edit a player's ratings, or position, change teams, or create a fantasy team!I was hoping this year we could move a team, and keep the same uniforms, something EA has said they would do for years.  Nope.Hey, for $60.00, If I want a 350 lb running back, with hands like Jerry Rice, and DeSean Jackson's speed, why not?  All female league, sure!  (Actually not a bad idea.)The game play is great.  Passing, running are spectacular, and I love experimenting with leading my receivers into the spot I want the ball.Graphics are stunning, linebackers don't jump 20 feet in the air to bat down everything over the middle, and I don't get sacked every time I want to run play action.Wonderful, right?  So where am I going to do all of this, in Exhibition mode??  Not everyone likes to play the people who pose as casual gamers online.  Screwing with Franchise Mode was Galactically stupid, and a deal breaker for me.  Next year, they'll restore \"Franchise,\" and call it a \"New Feature!\"I never thought I'd want to see this game just go away, and 2k take the reigns back, but it's here!Selling this piece of crap on EBay, and I'll wait for the new, \"Lingerie Football League\" or \"Arena Football,\" to come out.Maybe they'll have a real Franchise mode.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

It is a workout wii disc, not a game.  You use it to achieve your goal in fitness whatever it may be.  This is what I thought of it.Graphics-The graphics were really good.  The backgrounds were really nice, and there are lots to choose from.  There is a resort, an office, an oriental hut, a garden, and more.  Also, when I first got this, I had to look very closely to see if Maya (your personal trainer) was real or not.Sound-You can choose your music track.  They have everything from hip-hop music to 80s music to techno music and more.  They are just workout songs, though, NOT chart topping # 1 hits or something.Working Out-When you first get this, you enter your info (weight, height, age, etc.) as well as see how many crunches, push-up, and squats you can do.  This will evaluate what you need to work on.  After all of this, you choose the type of workout you want (cardio, yoga, upper body strength, lower body strength, core body strength, and flexibility) and the music, background, and length of a workout you want.  The more times you workout the closer you get to unlocking new music and locations.  The workouts feature a moving bar at the bottom of the screen telling you what move you are doing and what move is coming up next.  At the end of each section Maya will ask if it was too easy, hard, or if it was just right, also anytime during the workout, you can access the menu to make it harder or easier.  The game will also ask you if you have a step, hand weights, stability ball, and heart rate moniter.  If you have any of these, then you enter it in, and it will periodically give you a move that features that piece of equipment.Fun-A workout should be fun, and I think everyone will like this disc.  It gives the viewer the option to choose their workout, music, background, and length, so I think most people will enjoy.Overall, this is a great fitness product for the wii.  Most people will like the ability to customize their workout, and most likely the viewer will get results.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2009"}

The graphics are incredible as like with a few other titles it shows the power the Wii U has in going toe-to toe with the PS3 and Xbox 360 for graphics quality and the soundtrack like with Super Mario Bros,Zelda and Sonic is a nice catchy tempo that fits the levels throughout the game.  The basic controls are the same as with the previous Wii game so there's really no new control combos and the like to learn  and like with the previous game you have co-op which can help or hinder depending on the second player. Some have asked about single player and the other characters you team up with sometimes throughout the levels like Diddy Kong,in the levels you'll get a chance to team up with either Diddy/Dixie or Cranky Kong and each has their own somewhat unique ability to help you. Diddy Kong keeps you up in the air a little longer when you make a jump,Dixie Kong gives you a quick floating elevated boost up when you jump and Cranky gives you a quick higher jump.So for owners of the Wii U looking to add a few games here's one to get for the game library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001TOMQSK","description":"Sega Aliens vs. Predator 69038 PC Games","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"A fun but VERY mixed-bag of tricks","reviewText":"Wow. Where to even begin with the messy, mixed bag that is `ALIENS vs. PREDATOR' (AvP)? ......I guess I'll start by giving some thoughts on the game overall and then break it down by each campaign in the order I played them. Bear with me, because this is going to be a long review. Partly because of how I review things, partly because this is like reviewing 3 separate games. Please keep in mind a few things : 1) I am a HUGE fan of both the Aliens and Predator movies (well, the good ones at least!), with `Alien' being my favorite movie of all time. 2) I played through each campaign on hard mode, so I fully realize some of the beefs I have may be due to difficulty level. 3) Despite the MANY issues I had with the game, I did enjoy it overall. See #1??The Game In GeneralTHE GOOD : A fair amount. First off, the simple fact that you can play as either a marine, a predator, or an alien is very cool. It's nice to be able to step into the 2 iconic monsters' skins and see the world through their eyes. Additionally, the settings and environments for each level all look very good and are different enough from each other so that it doesn't make them all monotonous. Even though you play through each of these levels in each campaign, you experience them from different perspectives and methods of moving around which also helps keep things fairly fresh. Normally I don't pay too terribly much attention to the story in a video game because I'm not playing a game for the literary value. If a story is horrendously bad, it won't stop me one bit from enjoying the heck out of a game (see `BAYONETTA' which possibly has the worst story ever, but is also my favorite game ever). However in the case of AvP, the story was actually quite good and when seen from the 3 different perspectives, it's even better. As well, all of the sounds, weapons and even `ol Carl Bishop Weyland himself (voiced by the actor from the movies, Lance Henriksen - definitely a nice touch!) are straight out of the movies. And all of the weapons, ammo and health are scattered about appropriately enough so you never really run out, but at the same time, you have to be careful to conserve your resources. Another point of interest that I realize some might find irritating, but I found refreshing, was the sense of realism when it came to `special interactions', as I call them. For instance, when you harvest a civilian as an alien, reload as a marine or recharge your weapons as a predator, you're still very vulnerable to attack and can even die during these brief interludes. There are other examples in each campaign, but many of the games I've played give you a bit of an `invulnerability window' while doing things like this. Not AvP. Sure, it ticked me off every now and then, but in hindsight, I actually respect this design choice. It just makes logical sense. As one last thought for the good in general about this game, in addition to the 3 different campaigns, you can also play a survivor mode where you're a lone marine fighting off ever-increasing waves of aliens and there's also various online modes to play as well. In fact, it's the online modes that are really the strong point of this game. They're a blast to play and it's especially fun considering, again, you can be and be facing off against 3 different species.THE BAD : Also a fair amount here, too. The biggest glaring weakness is the entire Alien campaign, but we'll deal with that soon enough. Otherwise I'd have to say the controls are for crap. I played this game after playing a few other first person shooters (RESISTANCE 2 for instance) and AvP was a stark contrast against them in terms of ease of control. To be fair, I don't know how else I would have done it because there's a lot to take into consideration across 3 different species (although the marine and predator are similar), but I still found it problematic. As I mentioned above, all of the weapons and sound effects seen in the movies also appear in the game, but there were a few things I found myself asking \"was this really necessary?\" For instance, were androids REALLY necessary in this game? Wouldn't human stoolies for the company have been just as purposeful without cramming these artificial soldiers in? And I don't recall ever using the Predator's mines other than just to see how they worked. Plus, his heat visor was absolutely useless (though cool) except in one or two spots. As for the sound effects, it was absolutely laughable (and grating) to hear the marines utter pretty much only 3 different sentences throughout the campaigns, unless there was a specific programmed conversation or line relating directly to what you were doing. Something else that was laughable was the AI. It was astoundingly bad. You could literally kill a marine standing right next to another marine and they just might not notice! And talk about stupid - some of the characters would actually run and hide in a corner with their faces in their hands, if you approached them! I mean, really!?!? It was almost refreshing when some of them chose suicide over whatever you had in store for them. Tacking right on to the blisteringly dumb AI, was also a severe lack of logic on things. For instance, why can the predator jump 20-30 feet in some areas but not 2 feet in others?? Why do marines and others go TOWARDS the sound of an alien hissing? There were many other things like this throughout each campaign but I'll leave it to you to discover them. Something else that should be noted, though I don't know whether it was a good or bad thing, is each of the campaigns is relatively short, with each having only about 5 or 6 different levels and each level taking about an hour or more to play, depending on your skill level. As one last thought for this `bad' section, (and I realize this depends on your gaming style) the PS3 trophies / Xbox achievements can be VERY tough to complete 100%. The lack of checkpoints in Nightmare difficulty and a few of the online trophies (anyone who has read my other reviews knows I hate online trophies) can make this a really difficult game to get a Platinum Trophy or 100% completion on. Just something to consider if that's your thing....Now for the individual campaigns.....The Marine CampaignTHE GOOD : This was overall the best of the 3 campaigns and the one you really should start off with. The familiarity of a `human' FPS is a nice way to ease into the game and the first 2 levels, especially, contain some genuinely creepy moments that will make you feel like you're watching the better of the `Aliens' movies. All of the weapons are fun to use (especially the smart-gun) and each has their place in the story. Even the motion tracker with it's constant clicking and pinging added to the atmosphere, even though I know may others just found it annoying. I guess, for me, what made this the best campaign was the ratio of good versus bad in the campaign. It's just not as pronounced as it is in the others. All in all, it's a pretty standard FPS that has some great moments and a few under-whelming ones...THE BAD : Unfortunately, like all the other campaigns in the game, the marine campaign has its' problems. Beyond some of the general problems with the game that I've already mentioned, and that apply here, the most glaring problem with this FPS campaign was..... the shooting. Your main weapon tends to be the pulse rifle. And its' sight / target is not easily visible like some of the other weapons are and it requires absolute pinpoint accuracy. All in all not bad if you're going for realism, but try shooting an alien as it jumps from floor, to wall, to ceiling, to wall, to floor, to wall, to.....well, you get the idea. Not exactly easy. Now try it with a swarm of them! And for all the good the bullets seem to do against either the aliens or the predators, you may as well be shooting rock salt. It's not that they don't die eventually but you'd certainly expect them to die a little faster against a rapid-fire barrage of hot metal. Good thing there's a `wash-rinse-repeat' tactic that works fairly well against them:  hit `em to knock `em backwards and shoot `em. Too bad this needs to be used as much as it does - it just makes it unnecessarily repetitive.The Alien CampaignTHE GOOD : Barely anything. Seriously. Other than being able to control (if you really can call it that) this iconic creature, there just isn't much good here. I suppose it's kind of cool to be able to walk on any surface and through vents, etc., but that in and of itself becomes a problem, which we'll deal with shortly. It was fairly fun to play this campaign because it's definitely something different from both a standard FPS and from the other 2 campaigns in the game, but there was so much frustration involved here, it just sucked a lot of the fun right out of it. It was nice though to be able to absolutely haul @$$ when needed because the marine and predator, even at a sprint, aren't anywhere close to as fast as the alien at a sprint. It's just too bad you'll need to retreat from danger as much as you will. This is supposedly a pretty tough critter, right? At least that's the way the movies make it look. The game has other ideas. Then again, the alien, is a big space insect, so maybe its' strength is really it's numbers?? ...One last good thing about the alien campaign is the `finishing moves'. They are brutal, bloody and just what they should be. Whether it's harvesting a human by putting a face-hugger on them, spearing your tail through their chest or mouth, or giving their cranium the `ol run-through w/ your second set of jaws, the aliens finishers are quite satisfying indeed. At least they got something right here.THE BAD : Oh, so much. So much so, it made me wonder why they even had this campaign in the game other than they had to, because, well, it's AvP. The most glaring problem with the alien campaign is the controls and the aliens' inability to transition to surfaces as smoothly as it should. The alien can move pretty fast, as I've previously mentioned, so it's downright dizzying crawling all over the place 360 degrees and discombobulating being upside down. So when the alien doesn't transition to surfaces as smoothly as it should, it makes for a genuinely frustrating experience. The aliens' target / crosshairs / whatever, which is shaped like a teeny, tiny `T' is supposed to help you keep track of what's up and what's down, but it `s so small and, again, things can move so fast, it's not easy to tell what's what sometimes. All in all, I found myself staying on the ground as much as possible, to make things easier. Kind of defeats the purpose of being the alien, doesn't it? Another glaring weakness of this campaign was the aliens' attack strength. I know that a game can't make things TOO easy, but for one of the most fearsome creatures in the galaxy, as another reviewer elsewhere said, \"you may as well be tickling your enemies\". It's noteworthy that the same applies to the predator, but it's funny that this isn't the case when you're playing the other creature's campaign. That is to say, as the alien it's damn tough to take down the predators, but when you're a predator, the aliens can take you down rather easily. And the same applies in reverse. This just gets back to my `lack of logic' beef I mentioned in the `general' section. Also, as I mentioned in the previous section, the finishing moves are quite satisfying and rather brutal, but there was one in particular I couldn't help snickering at each time I saw it. It involved the alien grabbing a marine and then gently caressing their face with its' tail before lopping their head off. Bloody and vicious to be sure, but, just seemed .... odd.... considering the other finishers. Anyway, enough of the bad w/ this campaign. Suffice it to say, I hope those of you who play this particular campaign end up liking it better than I did (though I did enjoy it in small doses),  but overall this is just downright abysmal.The Predator CampaignTHE GOOD : A decent bit actually. If the marine campaign was the best overall, this one was definitely the most interesting. The first thing that impressed me was the predator's visor. Not the heat vision (which as I've already noted was basically useless for the most part), but the way in which it highlighted all the items of interest in your surrounding environment. This made it much easier to form strategies in terms of where health or weapons could be recharged and what path you'd need to take to get there. It also allowed you to see where you could or couldn't jump and highlighted the collectibles. A rather handy tool all the way around! In addition to the visor, the various weapons were all fun and easy to use, plus their controls all made sense. Another thing about the predator campaign that made it fun was the blend of approach it took. By that, I mean it had elements of the marines' run-and-gun approach and elements of the aliens' stealth approach and it was balanced rather well. It was also quite cool, at lest from a story perspective, to see a little bit more about the predator's `hunter' culture. Though this mainly played out in cut scenes, it was also prevalent in some of the scenery and things you interface with. Speaking of the scenery, while it was possible and at times necessary in the alien campaign to view it from above, the predator did so without making you wish you were back on the ground. From this perspective it was nice to see the previously played levels from the treetops and rooftops and added a whole new dimension to the action. As I mentioned in the few good spots for the alien campaign, the predator campaign also has some devastating, bloody and wicked finishing moves. Beyond just plunging your blades through a marines' chest, you could also rip their head off, pulling their spine out with it. Easily the best finishing move in the whole game!THE BAD : Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to predator campaign to be the best in the game, it just wasn't. Partly because of some of the things I mentioned in general, like the game's bad logic when it came to where the predator could or couldn't jump, but partly because of where it strayed from the movies when this game did everything it could to incorporate as much from the movies as it could. For instance, anything you do other than jumping while you're cloaked, caused you to un-cloak. Want to use the plasma caster? It causes you to drop your camouflage. Want to attack someone with your blades or throw the battle disc or spear? Same thing here. And as anyone who's seen the movies knows, this wasn't the case in the cinematic presentations. In fact, that was partly what helped make the predator such a lethal and fearsome ..... predator. If the game really wanted to put you at a disadvantage while cloaked but keep its' continuity with the movies, why not un-cloak just the blades when extended (which is always)? I guess what I'm getting at (and this applies to all the campaigns) is, for a game that strived so hard to stay true to and incorporate as much of the movies as it could, why such glaring inconsistencies? Another inconsistency that just made me go \"HUH??\" was that while you could finish a marine off by plunging your blades through their chest via the finishing move, why is it that it took many numerous swipes of your blades at close range to do so in melee combat? Just made no sense whatsoever. Overall this is a pretty good campaign, but it's not without some significant and glaring weaknesses.THE BOTTOM LINE : This is a game that I dearly wanted to love. I truly did. I was even trying to be forgiving about it after some of the horrendous reviews I'd read. But despite that, the game has some significant and glaring issues with it, and the alien campaign itself drags the overall rating of this game down a notch or two on its' own. I found myself screaming at the screen a good number of times and was quite ready to be done with the game after a while, which I don't usually experience. Still, the game has some redeeming points and is overall a good bit of fun to play. Especially if you're a serious fan of the respective franchises, as I am. The online mode is a lot of fun and the single-player campaigns make for some good variety. Buy at a discount if this kind of thing is for you otherwise rent it. Just don't pay full price for this - at $40-$60 it's a rip-off.UPON FURTHER REVIEW..... : From time to time I'll come back to my reviews and re-read them and re-play the game a bit, just to make sure I didn't leave anything out or see if there's anything I want to revise. In the case of AvP, I guess I have to say that despite my criticisms, the undeniable fact that this game is flawed in a good many ways, and the sheer amount of frustration I experienced with aspects of the game (Nightmare Marine Mode & some of the online trophies, anyone?), I actually enjoyed this game A LOT! I really did. And as blasphemous as this probably is to say, I liked this game better than 'Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2' (which, incidentally I played right after AvP). But I guess that just goes to show there's no accounting for taste, right? In looking back, I found this game to be VERY challenging and just a ton of fun. Even the Alien campaign I sandblasted in my review, I enjoyed a lot more when I went back and played it in Nightmare mode. Maybe it's because I knew what to expect? Maybe it's because I had my expectations already properly adjusted to be low? Who knows? But I can definitely say, that out of all the shooters I own (including Dead Space, Resistance 1 & 2, COD : MW2) AvP is my favorite. Go figure......So I'm bumping up the rating I gave it, because, ultimately, a videogame is measured not on it's technical or aesthetic merits, but on how much FUN you have with it. And again, after all was said and done, I really enjoyed the hell out of this game despite all it's flaws.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S. BubPros:Gorgeous graphicsDecent gameplayCons:Amateurish if consistent art designToo short","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Okay-ish FPS but fails because it isn't Unreal","reviewText":"In 1998 Tim Sweeney changed the face of FPS gaming forever. Unreal was released and became a major gaming hit that revolutionized fps, along with practically reinventing the game engine (the unreal engine is a very important core gaming tool behind many modern fps today). That concept was a reality thanks to Tim Sweeney spending 3 years in his garage. At the time this was the reason to buy a graphics cards like a Voodoo or a TNT and run it on your Windows 95 system.Unreal was a deep game, lots of levels, lots of running around, lots of shooting, mindless blasting, pressing levers, going through levels that have some maze qualities, running across the same bad guys with some variations, the textures, AI and level design surprisingly still able to deliver on a satisfactory game play today. Unreal beats a lot of fps games that have since been released. It is an all-time great for those of us gamers out there who remember the end of the 90s and remember what it was like to play fps games that people would line up around the block to buy.Unreal was not followed up directly by Unreal 2. In fact Unreal become a multiplayer called Unreal Tournament that was released in 1999. The next update was Unreal Tournament 2003.Unreal 2 was released in 2004. It pretty much tanked for a couple of reasons. The first was that it was not a sequel to the original Unreal (that ended in a cliff hanger). Unreal 2 is a new story about a marine that travels from planet to planet picking up alien artefacts while blasting aliens. Unreal 2 has some great looking environments. There is a game here and if you have played the best FPS has to offer then Unreal 2 is worth checking out. However it is nothing like Unreal and that is a major drawback. Also it is 10 times slower than the original Unreal as your marine walks at a snail's pace about in a clunky suit. The missions are very leisurely, linear and extremely easy to beat. The game isn't a challenge but at the same time the environments are very well rendered but the story isn't very good. I found myself finishing it though because there are only so many FPS games out there.So if you are looking for an FPS you haven't played then I would suggest replaying the original Unreal and then if you feel you must then go for this (it is usually available in Unreal box sets). All in all this game was a cut below par but did look good at times and there is a nice array of weapons to use but the spirit of Unreal is departed and what is left is something that doesn't deserve the name it has.Pros:EnvironmentsRange of gunsCons:It is not UnrealIt is very slowStory is not good","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword.

While the game has under gone a drastic amount of changes is it enough for this game to stand on, or have the changes made done nothing but sink the ship?  In short a bit of both!  Dungeon Siege 3 simplifies the experience and gears the entire game for console users essentially putting the PC experience on the back burner.  In doing so gone are the micro managing of your comrades, a basic inventory system with a very basic leveling system that does little to promote individual variety(you eventually unlock everything).Still what we have here is a solid game that will not be a disappointment to the Hack & Slash RPG fans of ye olde day such as Diablo, Titan Quest, etc.GAMEPLAYWhat can I say.. it is a hack n' slash RPG.  Be prepared to go through dungeons grinding away on mobs and collecting loot!  Dungeon Siege 3 does not disappoint in this category. It brings lots of gameplay something crucial to any video game; especially a hack and slash type.  You have a choice of 4 pre-made characters which of course breaks down into typical Warrior, Caster, Rogue etc. When not in dungeons you will be visiting towns to buy and sell goods, pick up some simple quests that are not to bad to complete, and of course continue the storyline.  It is fairly simple but gets the job done.  Dungeons are varied as are the types of mobs you encounter so things get changed up enough to not get boring.  Throw in a variety of difficulty levels and drop-in/out co-op and you have a pretty solid gameplay experience.Combat is handled exceptionally well I feel for a hack & slash on a console.  Your main attack and 3 skills are bound to your attack buttons while blocking and your stances are controlled via the shoulder/trigger buttons.  During mid-combat with the warrior-type lets say, a bunch of trash rushes you just switch to a 2-handed stance and hack away.  By doing this you open up your 2 Handed skills. Middle of the fight a boss mob comes in you can just switch, on the fly, back to a sword/shield stance and of course unlock 1 handed skills.  You can map 3 skills per stance which makes you have to choice between the available skills per stance.  Toss in Proficiencies, which add some customization to the skills by allowing you to pick a perk for that skill, and you have a simple yet somewhat diverse set of skills.  While it is no Diablo or Titan Quest in skill variety and customization it keeps it very simple.GRAPHICSThe game looks pretty good on the console.  I have not checked it out on the PC but it is a very pretty game.  The fire effects aren't bad and the variety of colors and effects for your skills are awesome.  By no means is this a perfect engine here but it has graphical appeal and does help to make the world a bit more recognizable.  I did notice some slow down on the PS3 version when I was looking awkwardly at fire with the camera, but I tend to try and kill the frame-rates on purpose at times.  Combat however was very smooth and I noticed no difference between the PS3 or 360 versions when it came to the FPS during combat or cut-scenes.SOUND/STORYThe effects and sound track here aren't bad.  I would say average.  Nothing special to talk about but the voice acting I would say is sub-par.  Many times it seemed as is the actors/actresses really did not care much about their lines.  This puts a damper on the already boring storyline.  Yes there is a storyline here for a Hack & Slash!  A detailed storyline to boot!  Problem is I found the storyline incredibly boring and uninteresting.  A lot of it had to do with the dialogue as it really didn't sell you on the story.  Still there is some meat here to give purpose to your adventure.REPLAY/LENGTHWhat good is a hack & slash without replay!?  Well this game boasts some solid replay value if you are up for it.  Where as past Hack and Slash games I have played allow you to continue on harder difficulties with your existing loot... not the case here. There is no Game+ feature here. Instead you just start a new difficulty from square one again.  Replay value will come down to simple trophy/achievement collecting, simple enjoyment of the game and of course Co-Op.  The game itself took me around 13-15 hours to complete on my play-through; and I have yet to replay it on another difficulty since nothing carries over.*** CO-OP FEATURES *** ( 4 player ONLINE support, no LAN support, 2 player LOCAL co-op )A crucial part of this game that people have been getting confused about.  Co-Op works very strange in this game and while it does work.. it doesn't at the same time.  Much like how the game really simplified the elements almost to a fault, the Co-Op was simplified far past a fault.  Not only is there a lack of Game+ here, but Co-Op works fairly backwards for a game of this type.  If you hop into a game online or with your friend only, your SP character WILL NOT be used.  No progress you make with your friend/PUG will carry to your account.  You are simply there for moral support you could say.  To make things worse, even if you are doing Co-Op on different accounts (like a 4 player PUG group) the host is who the camera centers on.  Meaning you are locked into the hosts camera frame.  While this just takes time to get used to, it seems like a colossal step backwards compared to previous hack&slash; titles.  The overall Co-Op experience can be a lot of fun if you put aside gear, level and just work as a team to have some fun.OVERALL 73% (7.3) .. CDungeon Siege 3 is not a bad game by any means.  It simplified the Hack & Slash elements to suit the console but in doing so it over-simplified the elements down to a no-brainer.  While perhaps a disappointment at first glance Dungeon Siege 3 still brings gameplay to the table and lots of it.  There is plenty to do here, and despite a slightly simplified dungeon design you still have tons of baddies to plow through and loads of loot to gather.A weak inventory system holds it back as does the Co-Op method used by the game but still... this is the kind of game Hack and Slash fans have been craving for a long time.  It is a fresh change of pace for the genre despite being simplified.  While not a full-price for some, it is a game worth picking up if you are a fan of the genre.  The flaws in DS3's armor are not bad enough to ruin the game but it might leave a sour taste if you set expectations to high.**NOTE: I was disappointed with the absence of SET items.  However with no real game+ mode, and a 10-15 hr campaign it is understandable why they were probably absent","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

You do not 'die' but you also do not advance at various spots if you can not do the exact aerobatics required of you. And for whatever reason the Prince likes to jump and jump and jump and not necessarily wall climb etc. I'd say the flaw is partially mine except as I said I have if not mastered every other game at least controlled other games well enough to enjoy them and get through them.I have Assassin's Creed from Ubisoft. The characters and story there are much more compelling and it is beautiful and a true pleasure to play. Here, not so much pleasure. Just loads of frustration.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2009"}

Even after all these years on market, it never gets old.Now, the X1 controller is, without a doubt, a new standard in the xbox's line-up of controllers. I have bought this one from gamestop and it's in my home, ready to be played with the xbox one, so this review is a summary of using the controller from all of the events that I have attended (xbox one tours, microsoft store xbox one events, e3, gamescom, etc.) so I have had a fairly lengthy time using the controller. The ergonomics are simply brilliant as the controller fits snugly in your hand and it is a bit smaller and tighter so all the buttons are more easily reachable.One of the best things about the new controller is the impulse triggers feature. Oh, man. These things are just great. They said that they integrated a whole bunch of tiny rumble parts so that when you shoot a weapon, drive a car, run in a game, etc.- whatever you do in a game will match the action to the rumble feedback for more realism. I tried this out with forza and man, this is a world of difference. This feature alone would warrant this controller 5 stars, but the improved grip on the thumbsticks, the more fluid trigger-to-button layout, and the removal of the battery pack bulge on the back add even more value to this controller.Now, the last thing I have to mention. The D-pad has been finally fixed. It now rests in a depressed setting at the same location as the x360 controller, but now the D-pad is designed to work flawlessly with fighting games and other games that rely more on the D-pad. I tried this out with killer instinct at one of the events and it worked wonders. Huge, huge improvement over the xbox 360 D-pad (which was just awkward).Overall, the Xbox One controller is brilliant, already piling more improvements and features on top of an already awesome xbox 360 controller.The improved D-pad, innovative impulse-triggers feedback mechanism, insanely comfortable grip and ergonomics, and other tiny little things make the Xbox One controller a great new addition to the Xbox family of controllers.Oh, and that sweet looking Xbox logo at the top looks slick as ever.Hopefully, my impressions/review helped any of you guys and gals out.Peace and game on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

I love turn based strategy and Advance Wars is definately pretty high up on the list of must owns for the genre.The lack of an RPG element (which has pretty much taken over turn based strategy games in recent years) is somewhat of a blessing. Don't get me wrong i enjoy building up characters but it's definatly a nice change of pace to be able to just jump in and start playing without worrying about much else.It's also worth mentioning that Advance Wars is fairly difficult.

With a huge budget and great graphics, this game could have been so much better! The combat is easily the best part of the game...too bad you rarely get to kill stuff!!! Half the game you spend hopping around on platforms and solving idiotic puzzles. If I want to play with a puzzle I'll download a puzzle game...pushing blocks around and pulling levers is boring and time-wasting. Dying over and over because you jumped two seconds too early is also a game play mechanic back from 1993. If I wanted to play a boring platform/puzzle solving game I would go play the original Tomb Raider.Its definitely worth a rent for the combat, though. I love the cross-powers, its just a shame you rarely get to use them. The graphics are great as well, and the story is pretty interesting. I just wish developers would stop with the checkpoints already, especially on games like this where you fall to your death often. I originally gave this 3 stars after my first play-through, but decided to come back after playing it again and say that while its not perfect, its as close to God of War as you can get, and has some cooler aspects as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2010"}

For you people complaining about the GoW fanboys dissing Dante's Inferno...IT PLAYS LIKE GOD OF WAR!!!!  Take Kratos, make him a Crusader in a monotheistic world, and chuck him into hell.  Basically, picture a blatant ripoff of the level where Kratos is in Hades from the first GoW and throw in several bloated disembodied sexual organs.This game feels so...disjointed.  First, I sew a cross-shaped tapestry into my chest, then I take down dozens of humans with a giant pole arm right before a wussy jabs me in the back with a dagger.  I then face death and steal his scythe...and then move on to save my wife...who's named after a cow.There are little mutant babies that pour out of a giant evil woman's nipples...sphincters that erupt flame while you swing past them on intestines...and succubi that have giant female...uh...organs...that they fling out and smack you with.  Apparently the succubi also have a screaming case of gonorrhea because they can squirt it out and splash you in the face with it, which stuns you.  The best badguys are the big fat gluttons who fart when they walk and barf all over the place.My biggest gripe with this game is the rappelling.  I want to take this game and drive to the house of whoever thought it was a good idea to take a game with imperfect camera control and somewhat inaccurate controls and then make it to where you have to hit certain areas in JUST the right spot or you fall to your death and then I want to ram the game sideways right up his fire-spurting sphincter.I also wish a serious case of syphilis on whoever thought it would add to the game to make me hit the \"O\" button REALLY REALLY fast whenever I want to drink from or \"open\" a fountain.  What the hell?  I stab my cross down onto a fountain and then...  What?  Does pressing the \"O\" button mean I'm praying REALLY hard?  If I could take true control of Dante I'd jump up, squat down, and drop a big giant deuce right in that fountain so that whoever came along next had to stare at what came out of MY flaming sphincter.  Pray over that you a-holes!The game is alright if you have an X-Box 360 but if you have a PS3 rent or borrow but do not buy.  I don't care how butthurt the fans of the game get.  You have a PS3 for Pete's sake...and Pete says wait for God of War III.I want to add that I've given this game an extra star to offset the morons that automatically gave it one or two stars.  There was some dipstick spouting retarded crap in the forums and though I feel this game isn't a work of absolute perfection it certainly doesn't suck...it just has a few quirks that annoy the ever loving crap out of me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2010"}

(with an update)","reviewText":"As someone who has played this game over & over again on the computer, I was psyched to discover that it was being ported to the DS. I figured it would be great for those moments when I wanted to play a game, but didn't have a whole lot of time to spare. I wasn't disappointed.If you haven't played Bookworm before, it's basically a game where you form words out of tiles. The more you play, the harder it can be to spell words as unused tiles remain on the board. Eventually fire tiles appear, which will burn through the tiles below. (That can either help or hurt you.) If you don't form a word with said fire tiles, it will burn down the bookcase & end the game. The DS port of the game has you filling up various rooms in a library (18 in all). There's a nice side portion of the game where if you do words in a theme (numbers, family, etc) you can complete a list. (I have yet to actually achieve this- completing a list is easier said than done!)There's also an action version of the game where some tiles will spontaneously catch on fire, making the player have to move faster than they would in the original version. Since I've only ever played the free online version, I'm unsure as to how much of this is new to the DS.As far as game play goes, I liked it. It's just as addicting as the online version. I liked that you didn't have to do one long continuous play to reach other rooms in the library & that you could pause the game & return to it later. The only faults that I'd find with this game are that like other reviewers have stated, this game is not for left handed players & that sometimes the controls were a little wonky. I'd start selecting words, but sometimes I'd be unable to complete a full word if part of it formed a smaller word. (For instance, the game might count \"fan\" as a word rather than let me complete the word \"fanatic\".) A lighter touch with the stylus helped this & it isn't a complete dealbreaker- there's enough to the game to keep my playing.This is one of the better ports to the DS & fans of the computer game will love this version of it. It's a nice break from the typical RPGs & fighting games that I normally play & it's definitely going to become one of my \"long trip\" games.EDIT:One thing I forgot to add into my original review- there are words that don't show up in this game that count as words in the computer game. It's nothing major- just really random words such as \"gie\", an old Scottish word & such. It won't really interfere with game play, but I did find it mildly annoying that it wouldn't work in the DS port. (Not enough memory for an exhaustive word list, I suppose.)EDIT 2:I'm updating this after a while playing it because well, this is a game that you can play over & over again. What you think of it months down the line matters.Here's my opinion on it: I still love it, but the fact that sometimes a word will submit itself before you are finished bugs me. I've had it happen enough to where it's extremely annoying. Again, not enough to where I'd chuck the game but it is really starting to irk me & it's kept me from playing once because I got so mad that it wouldn't complete the whole word I'd made.

You could win it in one day, so it's not worth the money. I bought COD4 because I loved the series. I was impatient. I could've waited a bit for the price to drop, which is usually what I do because no game is worth $65 unless it guarantees several solid months of gameplay. Videogames are getting shorter and shallower while the price increases and satisfaction decreases. Designers now emphasize the multi-player campaign, which requires just a few maps and letting players kill each other, over the single-person. I dislike buying Xbox 360 games now because I don't get good value for my money. The younger generation doesn't understand that a ten-hour game is a rip. And ignore those \"best game ever\" reviews - it is not. The game is primitive. The campaign is painfully linear and no matter how many times you play it, the enemy always comes from the same direction, saying the same things. Designers need to change this and offer multiple paths. They could at least have a map randomizer or enemy randomizer that stirs up things a bit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2007"}

The combat has been tweaked, the camera angles and directional controls have been (thankfully) fixed somewhat, and they've added a handful of new force powers and enemies, but past the surface this is really just an extension of the first game. In my eyes, that's not such a bad thing; the same enjoyment of tearing through enemies with deadly abilities like lightning and force push and exciting lightsaber moves is still here. The addition of a second lightsaber makes for some very cool looking moves. The boss battles are if anything more intense and epic than in the previous game. All in all, I would say it is a general - albeit relatively small - improvement to The Force Unleashed. All of this however, cannot make up for the fact that this game is INCREDIBLY SHORT!I didn't pay any particular attention to how long I'd be playing this game, but I would clock it in somewhere around 5-6 hours spent over two days of playing. And it's not like I was playing on easy either, this was on hard difficulty. I died several times, got hung up on a boss battle or two. And still, this game was over in the blink of an eye. I was expecting some significant middle-of-the-game plot twist during a long cinematic scene, when all of a sudden BAM; the end credits are rolling. Adding insult to injury is the fact that (without giving away any relevant plot points) the ending is clearly built to make you buy the inevitable third game in this franchise whenever it comes out, and leaves you feeling empty and disappointed. For a full priced console video game, such a short game-play is unacceptable. I processed a refund with Amazon right before writing this review, because this was just not worth $60.With all of that said, I would say this is a perfect game to rent. It's definitely pretty fun, provides some value entertainment, and you are practically guaranteed to be finished with it in time to return it.So in summary;PROS:-A slight but significant improvement over the original-Better camera and directional controls-Dual wielding lightsabers and Jedi mind trick? Come on.CONS:-One of the shortest console games I have ever played-Ending is very week, plot is also generally lacking.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2010"}

The dialogue is bland and perfunctory, without choice or consequence in any serious measure.  The enemies are all normal Star Trek enemies, and basically reskins of each other.  The exploration is limited to pressing a button on a shiny object and getting some useless mineral reward.  If you imagine a game like Mass Effect, Dragon Age or Fallout with the Star Trek license you will be severely disappointed, because you end up with a bland and stale traditional MMO with no feeling of story, exploration or discovery what-so-ever.  I think we all pretty much knew this would happen when this was announced as a Cryptic MMO instead of a single-player RPG, but it is still disappointing to see.Space combat is probably the saving grace here... very fun, and though insanely repetitive it never really grows old much.  Ground combat is fun but extremely buggy the last time I played, just not a polished experience at all.  Even if combat was awesome across the board though, you still need a reason to fight, and STO gives you nothing... no story, no innovative missions, NOTHING.Unless you love Guild Wars style MMO missions, avoid at all costs, despite the license.

As a result, it had its fair share of problems that ultimately affected the overall quality and enjoyment, which of course led to the game not selling a lot of copies.  However, four years later, in 2010, \"Just Cause 2\" was released exclusively for the seventh-gen, and it is so amazing and polished, it makes the first game look like it was released in the stone age.  JC2 is stuffed to the gills with everything you could ever want: innovative technology, amazing graphics, over-the-top situations, jaw-dropping size, upgradable weapons, and some of the best physics ever created.  It more than deserves the Platinum Certification it proudly earned.Completely unrelated to the story of the first game, JC2 takes place on the fictional South Pacific island of Panau, where a US-friendly president has been assassinated by his son, who has installed an oppressive dictatorship.  To make matters worse, a high-level operative who works for \"The Agency\" (no, really, that's what it's actually called) has disappeared on the island, and is presumed rogue.  As sexy Hispanic agent Rico Rodriguez, your official job is to infiltrate Panau, discover if the operative is rogue or still Agency-friendly, and hopefully assassinate the new Panauan dictator.  Your unofficial job is to cause as much chaos and destrution as possible without giving a crap.One of the most enjoyable aspects about JC2 is that it completely revels in being larger than life, impractical, and over the top.  The very first mission has you base-jumping out of a heliopter after a dead body, hanging on to the bottom of the helicopter while shooting enemies one-handed, and using a massive SAM site to obliterate a government military installation.  The very last mission involves you fighting the dictator on top of launched nuclear cruise missiles while you grapple to different missiles mid-air to input abort codes into their guidance computers.  This game is like the most unrealistic James Bond movies all jacked up on anabolic steroids.  In fact, you are actually unable to progress in the game's story until you cause a certain level of chaos, whether that be destroying government property, killing civilians, entering restricted areas, or assassinating high-ranking army officers.The other enjoyable aspect of JC2 is your special grapple hook.  It's by far the most valuable tool in the game, and it lets you rapidly zip through the air to cross gaps and scale buildings.  You can also use it in combination with your parachute to keep yourself in the air while you travel.  Additionally, you can use it to pull enemies off high ledges and send them falling to their deaths.  Not only can you use it on humans, but you can also use it on vehicles too, which comes in handy for flipping over pursuing cars and Humvees.  Nothing beats the satisfaction of grappling up to an assault helicopter, throwing the pilot out, and then using it to destroy everything else in sight.The weapon system mechanics are also astoundingly well-done.  You can carry two one-handed weapons and one two-handed weapon, and you're able to dual-wield both one-handed weapons at the same time.  This provides remarkable versatility for combat with both foot soldiers and vehicles.  Ammo can be restocked by simply walking over downed enemies' weapons, or purchased through the black market.  As you progress through the game, you're also able to upgrade your weapons, enhancing aspects like damage, clip size, and fire rate.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

You set them too high and something good can stare you right in the face yet you'll completely miss it.Such is the case with Alan Wake, a game I had eagerly anticipated for several years, back when this \"psychological action thriller\" game appeared as if it would be a little more open and would involve a slower, more psychologically gripping narrative.What Alan Wake turned out to be was a moody, atmospheric action game with a solid enough story and gameplay that is fun but repetitive.A recipe for disappointment? Maybe. But only if I demanded that the game be what I wanted it to be rather than appreciate it for what it is. Sure, I wanted the game I (mistakenly) imagined, with a more open world and intense narrative and true chills and intelligent puzzles. What I got instead was a different sort of game, but you know what? It was a solid game nonetheless.Alan Wake bills itself as a psychological action thriller, and that's about right. The gameplay is third person shoot shoot shoot, no more, no less. Enemies appear, you shine a flashlight on them to wear them down (think of it like wearing down an enemy's shields), then you shoot them. Sometimes you're in a vehicle, sometimes you're dodging flying objects, sometimes the locations vary, but by and large the action is very repetitive. Crisp, well handled, and enjoyable, but almost no variety. It gets old fast, especially since the gameplay offers little else BUT that. Practically nothing in the way of puzzles, no platforming, and most exploration is purely trinket hunting with no tangible benefit. Oh, and the brief driving segments stink.Where Alan Wake excels is in mood and atmosphere. The game's depiction of the American Pacific Northwest is gorgeous, but even more gorgeous (not to mention chilling) is the swirling, mist-like darkness that envelopes the world throughout the game. It's not scary, exactly - the Silent Hill games do a far better job of making you feel uneasy - but it IS glorious to behold. It's truly one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played. Despite the utter linearity of the levels, it's a joy to romp through this world. The town of Bright Falls feels surprisingly real.So, too, do most (but not all) of the characters. Sure, the story is filled with Stephen King clich&eacute;s (which the game itself acknowledges), but the characters, especially Barry, are well realized. You really get the sense that there is a lot more happening in this little town; as if there are many stories yet to be told. If there is one character who isn't well-realized, it is, sadly, Alan Wake himself, whose continuous pointing-out-the-obvious narration seems to be directed at an audience too dumb for words. That's too bad. Why assume the audience are morons? The result is that Alan Wake himself looks like a moron.Does Alan Wake live up to all it could have been? Was it the game I hoped it would be all these years? The answer to both questions is no. The linear levels and unvaried gameplay amount to a game that is a standard third person action game with a new coat of paint.But that doesn't mean it wasn't fun to play, because it was. When I took the game for what it was instead of what I wanted it to be, I enjoyed the world of Bright Falls and the slowly unfolding mythology of the story, found myself thrilled by the gunplay and combat, and was enamored of the mood and atmosphere of the game. The game may have fallen short of greatness, but I've visit Bright Falls again.Four stars for being memorable.

Everything felt just like it should when aiming, running, jumping, ect. The guns are all cool, and are all very pleasing to fire!

This game is more like babysitting, you want to enjoy multiple activities, but if you decide to get a job... forget it. Even on your days off, the time is a bit of a challenge, you have to eat, you have to clean, you have to take a bath, and by the time you've finished these things... it's noon already. You are lucky to get in 1 or 2 activities and something's going to get cancelled out if you don't want your sim to stay up late and over sleep. Which results in you being ready to take on an activity with other sims that are clearly ready to go to bed.It's incredibly dumb... &#34;Lets make a game that's too quick to enjoy much of anything in the world that we've spent all this time developing.&#34;, makes absolute sense... if sense meant something absolutely stupid.Some may really like this game, and may avoid getting their sims to work in order for them to get more time to enjoy activities, but it's still too fast. If we buy the game we should be able to enjoy it and not be rushed through the experience or it's not worth buying. Would I get the Sims 4 game? Heck no! They'd better give us the option to slow down the clock (without the world slowing down) as well as the option to stop the clock and enjoy things in order for that to be truly worth it to me. The smallest things take up chunks of time in Sims 3, and the experience is far from enjoyable...I really mean that. So think long and hard before you buy this game. If you want to get a game where you are stuck in the routine of constantly feeding, bathing, and cleaning without much of any time to enjoy much of anything else in the world, then this is for you.If you want to get out and explore freely without having to worry about rushing right back home because the day is over after the necessities and the attempt to do a few things, then this isn't for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Batman Returns for a Deeper, Bigger Adventure...if You liked Arkham Asylum, You Will Love This Game","reviewText":"Batman Arkham City, wow, in a word, exhilarating, exciting, fun, bigger in scope, more complex in game mechanics, more challenging and a great game over-all.  The makers at Rocksteady that brought you Batman: Arkham Asylum have brought a sequel that is a worthy contender for game of the year.  If you played Arkham Asylum, you know what to expect.  The missions, the stealth, taking out 20 thugs at once, gadgets galore, riddler challenges to boggle your mind, being the world's greatest detective and one of the best super-heroes to ever grace comics, movies and video games.PresentationYou're in arkham city.  It's beautiful.  The graphics are about the same as Arkham Asylum if not a little bit better and more polished (if that is possible).  The game feels like a Batman game, it feels like you're really in Gotham.  The music and the sweeping menu screens suck you in for the total experience.  This game looks good and sounds great right out of the gate and from the voice-acting to the lighting effects, everything in this game is polished to the last detail.GameplayYou know what to expect if you've played Arkham Asylum.  You have some new gadgets and combos, you're able to use your gadgets in combat with a quick fire feature which is nice if you're aimed in the right direction.  The soaring now is complimented with some dive-bombing allowing you to pick up speed and the grapple hook gun allows you to sling shot to really give you a speedier sense of freedom.  Batman has rather seamlessly flown from limited freedom to a more sand-box open world environment.  There are distress calls and crimes in action you can stop.  There are side missions and other crimes to solve as well as riddler trophies and puzzles all throughout Arkham City.  But don't expect these things to be easy.  You really have to be a detective here and use your head.  Aside from some tutorials explaining how to use gadgets, upgrades and new combos, the game doesn't really hold your hand.  It lets you figure out where doors are, how to find just about everything pretty much on your own.  Occasionally as you begin to head in the right direction, Batman will make some comment about what he needs to do **hint, hint**.StorylineThe story is that all the inmates of Arkham Asylum and Black Gate have been dumped here in a walled off section called Arkham City.  This works well, as it's similar to the asylum, except that the people locked in this place are not even meant to be locked up in individual cells, it's more of a slums-divided up into gangs each following various super-villains, and they're allowed to have guns and various other weapons and of course it's your job to find out what the heck is going on.ConclusionThis game does try to imitate a lot of what it's predecessor did, and for the most part it does that quite well which is something considering the boots it has to fill.  This game improves a lot on the previous one without changing a lot or taking any huge new risks.  This game is a sequel, so obviously it has a lot to live up to and at first I found myself realizing this isn't the same game as Arkham Asylum, and that made me sad, but those feelings quickly went away the deeper I got and the more awesome I realized this game is.  It is a rare sequel that is as good as the original and given that there are some new combat moves, new gadgets and a new character to play as (Catwoman), there's plenty to love in this sequel, therefore if you loved the first, you won't be disappointed by the second.  In fact, I'd be hard pressed to say you'll love this game, I know I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2011"}

The graphics are great , the voice acting is top notch , and the combat is great. The combat is not quite as fast and fluid as Kingdoms of Amalur but it is great none the less. If you are sick and tired of the slow combat and story line of Skyrim you should give this game a go. Now I will say that the language in this game is explicit and It has some sexual content in it hence the mature rating so dont be supprised about the things you see and hear , but this takes nothing from the game to me as I find some of it actually kind of funny.So bottom line, this is a great game for an adult player with excellent combat , graphics , voice acting, and story line. Also your Character actually has a voice in this game unlike your mute character in skyrim. This really helps to make a very immersive game. I highly reccomend this game to any RPG or action game fan. have fun and happy gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2012"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

I enjoyed this game's story more then the last game because the character's have more depth to them this time especially Dom.  The graphics and of course the voice acting was superb.2.  The fight scenes were great.  The boss fights were fun as well, and I enjoyed seeing the queen this time.  I was hoping to kill her, but I guess I will have to wait until GOW 3.Cons1.  The lambast had no leader.  How the heck can there be a civil war if the lambast have no leader.  I actually believe the locust must be stupid if they can't beat a enemy that doesn't have an leader.  They seemed to have about the same number of people, so I am confused about how the Lambast are winning.2.  The difficulty wasn't as hard as the last GOW.  I guess General Raam was just a hard boss to beat lol.3.  I didn't enjoyed the multiplayer for some reason.  It just didn't gel right with me, but then again this is my opinion.Overall this is a great shooter game.  I am sure many people enjoyed this game, but the lack of campaign hours just made this game feel lukewarm to me.

My ps3 downloaded the latest 1.4 patch which seems to have fixed the game. After eighty hours of play with no lag it seems like the latest patch has made the game playable even after the save file is 8mb. Only twice did the game freeze on me and a glitch seems to be preventing me from finishing the Forbidden Legend mission which is really annoying. Other than that, the game plays beautifully, even after hours of continuous play. I decided to upgrade my rating back to the original five because, for all the problems the ps3 version had, this game deserves it.*Original review with updates*Before I begin, I should point that I'm still a recent convert to Elder Scrolls fandom, having never played Morrowind, let alone the two before that. In fact, I only played Oblivion for the first time this year. Oblivion was the first open-world RPG I'd ever played and was also the only one that took me months and months to get tired of, having little patience for RPGs longer than 60+ hours. Once I was hooked, I wanted Skyrim as badly as anyone else because I knew that even if it was only better than Oblivion by a factor of 1.1 it'd still be a godly masterpiece.With that said, this will mostly compare the two, Oblivion and Skyrim.For starters, the character creation is more stream-lined and simpler than Oblivion's while still giving nearly infinite choices. I admit the character creation in Oblivion was a bit of a joke since none of the races looked very appealing in the first place and looked more like rejects from a low budget CGI movie. The Dark Elves didn't look menacing, they looked like red-eyed Keebler elves; the Argonians looked like anthropomorphic iguanas and everyone else looked like dolls.Skyrim's character's look real and beautiful this time, and fine-tuning their features is easier since all the slider bars go from 1-5 or 1-10 instead of a mind-numbing 1-50. Coloring your Argonian is no longer a chore that involves fighting with the color sliders every step of the way. If you want a rainbow colored Argonian you can do it. Eyes are no longer off limits either, nor are scaring or face-paint if so desired.One big thing that may disappoint some is that they took out the birth-signs. However, it's still possible to have different astrological effects added to your character via stones that are scattered across Skyrim's landscape, much like the one's in Oblivion that could grant your character another greater power.The number of skills has been reduced from 21 to 18. At first glance this may seem like they dumbed it down but they really didn't. Each skill has a number of perks that can be unlocked with every level gained. Such perks include reduced magicka cost on different schools of spells or the ability to zoom in on targets in archery. There are more than 200 different perks to be unlocked. However, since you can only unlock one perk per level and go as high as level 80 it's impossible to unlock them all. This will make deciding what kind of character you want to be all the more challenging since you can only specialize in so many things, unlike in Oblivion where you could make a cheap, jack-of-all trades character.You level up as you increase your skills, just like in Oblivion, but unlike Oblivion you don't have to senselessly grind other skills to make a balanced character. At level up, you decide which attribute you want to raise, Health, Magicka or Stamina. Speed, strength and endurance no longer factor in, every thing is more simplified. Some may not like this, but I say less is more. You can focus more on game play and less on tedious grinding to raise all your stats like someone with OCD.Here are a few example of how the new skill perks work.One-handed affects both bladed, axe and mace weaponry. Again, this may seemed dumbed down but the unlockable perks in the One-handed category include skills like increased critical hits with blades or more bleeding damage with axes or the ability to ignore armor rating when using a mace. This way, you won't end up with a character that has high attack power with a sword but low attack power with an axe like in Oblivion. That seemed dumb! You can specialize in one type if you like and still fight effectively with the other type.Want to do more damage with fire magic? Unlock a perk in Destruction that increases the power of fire spells. Other perk exist for Frost and Shock as well. Be a fire mage, or a Frost mage, or even unlock them all if you want! Just keep in mind that perks aren't free; what you specialize in effects how you play.Unlock a perk in archery that slow down time while zoom in on a target. Bullet-time, anyone?Smithing is also fun. This time around, equipment doesn't break down in the field. This may seem unrealistic but no more so than reparing your equipment without a forge! Seriously, being able to repair equipment everywhere in Oblivion, even in a cave, was silly. It's much more gratifying in Skyrim. Smithing includes smelting, for melting down ore into the raw materials needed for crafting; tanning for turning your pelts, the spoils of so many killed animals, into leather for armor; and forging, for creating your own weapons and armor. Lastly, you can also super-improve your gear and you don't have to have level 75 Smithing to do so. The higher your smithing the more you can super-improve weapons and armor, making continual upgrades throughout the game so a piece need never go obsolete, at least until you get the ability to make better equpiment.Skyrim's graphics are a great improvement over Oblivion's already great looking graphics. Sparks will fly off in random directions from torches. Shadows, patches of light and reflected fire light will change shape with the ever dancing candle flames. Smoke from fires will be carried off in one direction by the wind, and the snowy gusts on mountains trail will look real enough to make you feel cold just watching. While in a cave, I came across a grotto with a water fall. I had to stop a moment just to look at it, it looked so real...People in town and the city will get dirt on their faces while working and then later have clean faces when coming down from the day. Dust, snow, water, it all looks good.While making my way through a cave, a saw the giant shadow of a bandit imposed on the wall as he stood in front of a fire. It wasn't scripted either, it was real time. That's impressive.There is one annoyance, though. When traipsing about the wilderness, you can still see the grass grow in the distance as a new area is loaded. This is one leftover from Oblivion I could have done without. If anything, it's more noticeable because you're already looking at the gorgeous environments. I bet PC users with lots of ram don't have to deal with that.People have more interesting things to say. Once, while using healing magic on myself on a bridge a passing Imperial soldier said, \"practice your fancy magic somewhere else!\" I had to laugh at that. Of course, people will still start talking some random sound byte like autonomatons should get even 3 feet close to them. Also, I was really hoping you could make your character get drunk somehow. What's the fun of having beer and mead if your character can stumble around!The so called Dovakhin helm is actually just an iron helmet. There's a video on Youtube of \"Dovakhin\" in a bar but I've seen him, he's not Dovakhin, he's just some random guy wearing an iron helmet. Just thought I'd tell you that.Fighting dragons is certainly more stimulating than closing an Oblivion gate. While I didn't mind shutting down Oblivion gates I could still understand if somebody told me it was tedious and monotonous. The dragons seem to be anything but. The dragons will fly around in circles for what looks like kilometers while you wait for them to come around for another attack. Sprinting from area to next, desperately trying to catch up with it while painfully aware of your own earthbound limitations really makes you feel like you're fighting a dragon. It usually has the upper hand and sometimes it's all you and the city soldiers can do just to wound it.The environments in Skyrim are more fun to trek on foot since the world of Cyrodill felt relatively flat with civilization always in walking distance. Skyrim is a lot more rugged, and dangerous.3rd person mode is a little more improved but you'll still want to stick mostly with 1st person. These games were just designed for 1st person and won't work better any other way. This isn't Dark Souls where 3rd person combat was intense and deep (and I had to make that comparison just to break the ice brought up by haters between both games. They are both great in their own way! They're also too different to compare. Please, compare this to another open world game) Using magic is a lot more fun since you can shoot a stream of magic until your enemy is dead. Shooting ice magic may as well be like spraying liquid nitrogen from your palm. And seeing your character use a finishing move against on opponent makes combat all the more fun. I swear that in those short cinematics I can see my Argonians fangs as he smiles or grimaces or whatever while shoving a sword through a bandit's chest.The story is more interesting this time around. I praise the Elder Scrolls for creating a universe that is deep, well crafed and genuinely fascinating, but let's face it, the main story in Oblivion boiled down to nothing more than a few fetch quests and other easter egg hunts. Skyrim's story has characters that are remarkably deep, especially with the top-notch voice acting! This is a breath of fresh air from the typical stories involving moody, tormented emos with existential problems in other games *cough Fail Fantasy 13 cough* There's politics, religion, conspiracy, an ancient prophecy, and an uneasy desicion whether to support an empire or a rebellion. Do you support the empire, which has become the puppet of High-Elven racist supremecists who want to stamp out the worship of Talos, the patron deity and founder of the empire? or do you support the Stormcloak rebellion who want to preserve the worship of the cannonized god-emperor while paradoxically fighting the same empire which he himself created? Desicions, desicions...And if the desicion which side to support seems obvious to you just keep in mind that nothing is black and white. The Empire only participates unwillingly with the High Elven Dominion and the leader of the Stormcloak Rebellion is no saint either.The world itself has more detail. The Nords are truly what you would expect teutonic vikings would be. The Bretons are Celtic like mystics who are somewhat savage in their worship of evil witches. The Redgaurds are the Elder Scrolls equivalent of the Moors; a sophisticated, manly warrior race with curved sarasin sabres. The Imperials look more Roman like. Olive colored skin and imperial legion armor that looks like Centurian armor. They even have Latin ranks in the Imperial legion such as Preator and Preafect and Queastor. My favorite race, the Argonians look more dragon like while the females look velociraptor like. Nice!The RPG aspects are phenomenal. Wether you're out taking in the gorgeous enviroments or walking around a city, quests can happen unexpectedly. And quests have their own story lines. In one town, I was running around, doing some detective work, interogating people, trying to solve a mystery involving some corrupt gaurdsmen and their connection to a resistance movement living in the hills; one of the players of this story was called Nepos the Nose (sounds like a Dick Tracy villian!). Then I got in too deep, got framed for murder, was sent to prison and had no choice but to conspire with one of the conspirators inside to escape. That was fun.And Deadric quests are amazing. Unlike Oblivion where you had to seek out the shrines or cults and ask for a mission, in this game they have a way of finding you! You won't even know you're doing a quest for a dark god until you're already in! Then you have to make a moral desicion whether to go through with it or not but no matter what you can usually expect some kind of reward.And that's how this whole game is. It's amazingly organic. There are so many surprises and points of interest. This truly is a Role Playing Game. Technically, those Japanesse ones I grow up on don't even count, not that they weren't good they were just stories on rails. This game is limitless, it will make your head spin. It makes Oblivion look small!Be warned, once you start playing you won't want to stop!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"E. Batica","summary":"Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat DA was pretty good as a whole and an excellent boost from the last game (Mortal Kombat 4). The game itself is awesome. A new fighting system that gives each fighter a weapon and 2 different fighting styles. That adds a little more \"personal\" element to the series rather than the original format of everyone has a high kick, low kick, high punch and low punch. Now, everyone fights different. Plus there are some pretty cool things that you can do with the weapons.There are some returning characters in this one, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, Sonya Blade, Johnny Cage, Sub Zero, Kano. Kung Lao and of course, Scorpian. And of course, where is Mortal Kombat without new characters and hidden characters?! There are 9 hidden characters that you must unlock and 3 new selectable characters to start with. EXCELLENT!I could only think of 2 down sides to this game. Shang Tsung has been made a lot less cheap than usual and CANNOT MORPH into anyone anymore. Some of the Fatalities are really good and some of the others are really dumb. Example, newcomer Bo Rai Cho. Trust me, when you see it you'll in comparison of new Fatalities from Kano, Cage and Scorpian.I gotta give this one a big thumbs up because no longer is this game truly impossible if you can't do the combo system. It's nice to know the combos (which might I add are little easier to perform as well), but you can't fight it out as well. Slightly like Tekken's style of combat but I still have to say that Mortal Kombat is still it's own game. The 3 fighting styles per fighter usually doesn't make a difference in the fight itself. It's just cool to do basically.And my last final note on why I enjoyed this game. Shao Khan is dead! Personally, I was getting sick of his character. The other really great thing is that LIU KANG is dead also!! For me, that's a personal bonus to play because now I no longer have to deal with people who don't know how to play (ie use the combos) but can do Liu's cheap moves over and over and over again!Either way it goes, Mortal Kombat DA is a quality game and definitely worth picking up. Check it out you might be impressed with the new facelift that is Mortal Kombat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2003"}

But actually it is not bad.  I actually read the instructions (for once) and figured out how it is SUPPOSED to be played.  If you turn off your light and use the charge up on the melee weapons and throw them you can fight off monsters and kill them more effectively.  ESPECIALLY if you turn off your light which adds to the fear because you are in the darkness but also the monsters can't see you.The music on this game rocks.

So you're actually progressing through the story as your learning how to play, as in most games.  The game isn't spending 10 hours just teaching you the play mechanics, you get a sense of progression as you learn how to play and you go through a good chunk of the story as well.Yes, it's linear, but again, you're progressing through the story, so it makes sense, and no, you're not running through a tunnel the entire game, nor most of it, most areas are some what open.You're not exploring in the way you're thinking (zelda, oblivion, fable, etc...), but i view actually playing the entire game as exploring, you don't know what's going to come at you next in the story, therefore it has the exploring feel to it, atleast i think so.Compare the graphics of this game to any other xbox360 game and you will be impressed, the game looks great.Yes, this is still basically an rpg, give this game to anyone who doesn't know what an rpg game is and they would'nt be able to classify it, because again, it's basically an rpg.  Focused more on fighting, but it still has great rpg elements.It's one of those games that as you play it, you can just see all the hours spent from tons of people hard at work to make this game what it is.  Very few games have this amount of polish.The fat has been trimmed away, but the meat is still there.  I don't need to run around a town looking at stiff npc's interacting with other stiff npc's, or saying 3 words to me over and over again whenever i get close.  That doesn't immerse me in the world.This game is story driven and to me that is what is most important, if the story isn't there i don't care.The only negative is the dialogue, not the voice acting mind you, but what they're actually saying.  The dialogue feels like it was written from someone doing an internship for an rpg magazine, it's afternoon special quality, seems out of place compared with how awesome the rest of the game is, i think a lot of that has to do with what's lost in translation.  But then again, Final Fantasy hasn't been known for it's dialogue.The bottom line is that you certianly get your money's worth.  Most people are going to find this game enjoyable, come at it with an open mind and you'll be happy.  The Final Fantasy \"feel\" is still there!

They are:1. Missing Letters2. Split Decision3. Pasta Letters4. Block Letters5. Word Shuffle6. SafecrackerThese six games are varied and entertaining enough to become close to addicting. They are easy games to learn, and offer enough variety that the games don't feel as though they blend together.In regards to improving vocabulary. I am not to sure how much improvement there will really be, unless it is a child playing the game. The description says there are 17,000 words I only recall running into duplicate words a couple times. So there seems to be enough variety there as well.Some have complained about the difficulty for users who are left handed. I didn't find it to be a problem at all. That could very well be a personal thing though.Overall, I enjoyed this game and found it to be very addictive. I also like the daily score that you need to reach to advance to higher levels. It's a nice touch and encourages people to play. While it may not have the depth in number of words I would have liked. It held my interest and provided hours of entertainment. I recommend this game to the younger crowd, I am not sure how much benefits adults will get out of it aside from fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"TIGERCAT716 \"I Love Nietzsche's Girlfriend&#34;\"","summary":"GOOD GAME, UNIQUE STORY. . .","reviewText":"UPDATE: I just played it through for the for the first time in about eight months.  It's much better and my first two times.  Good shooter game, good graphics, good music, good cut scenes.  Good job 2K games.  All \"negatives\" listed below are negligible.  I still would love to kick \"Ice-T\" Adams's butt for being a self-righteous, insubordinate, trouble making bigmouth.  You won't go wrong adding this on to your collection of shooter games--UNIQUE, even if it's not the absolute best shooter game. There are a one or two more minor \"decisions\" I uncovered in the game of no real consequence too.  I also played for a few on-line and that was fun too.You're really trying to figure out what when on, who the who the bad guy(s) are, who are the good guys.Everything comes together at the end with flashbacks. It seems like everyone was into survival ultimately at the expense of someone else, it seems.You start off on a rescue mission for the Colonel who saved your life and his men, the 33rd.  That mission fails, but you press on for revenge.Good game, not great, with a unique and mind bending story.  You listen to the radio operator, who is a lackey of the Colonel, to give narrative to the story.  You also pick up intel which fills in the story, you also see executions, murders, graffiti on the walls.  You have 5 decisions that I know of, but they aren't too consequential. It's not that big of a deal which way you go.The action is pretty good to good, but not great.  There are some challenging situations.  There is one situation, where you are manning a machine gun, and it's a bit of a challenge to discern and shoot the enemy and not your teammates while they try to reach the top floor. The story is unique, it has you guessing and wondering.  No real good guys.  'Ice Tea' Adams, I can't stand that guy.  If I we're a Lieutenant, I would not have him on my team.Some pre-rendered action sequences during battle, one in particular which I don't like because it detracts from the combat and enters you into a pre-determined situation, but the others pre-rendered situations are good.  There are a couple of survival situations.  The ending is like one big hallucination and flashback of everything that went on during the game which was genius.WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT THIS GAME:1)Controls, described below2)Concussive grenades: seeing the effects/affects it has on the enemies3)Sand and the effects of sand: when you throw a frag grenade in a sandy environment, the sand will deliver a concussive effect to all the nearby soldiers.4)Strobe lighting effect for one mini-battle: you enter a room, the light in the room will alternate from being on for a second and being off for a second while a big heavily armored and tough to kill enemy soldier is coming at you. The soldier will be in one position on left for one second, the next time the light comes on, he will be in a completely different position.  The first time you play, you think there might be two of them--Genious.CONTROLS, COVER SYSTEM AND SHOOTING BEHIND COVER ARE REALLY GOOD, AND BETTER THAN WHAT OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED: I would like to clear up the falsehoods that some people have written in their reviews about the game:1) Run/sprint just by pressing the A button.  Just press and release--THERE'S NO NEED TO HOLD THE A BUTTON DOWN.The is good, because you won't find yourself sticking to cover or taking cover when you don't want to as in other games.  (You can still sprint by holding the A button, but you will gravitate to the nearest cover position)2) Take cover by pressing the A button.  When sprinting, you can take cover by just pressing the A button, or holding the A button.  Holding the A button seems to allow you to slide into cover if he cover is waist high.3)Vault over cover by pressing the B button.  VAULT OVER COVER when sprinting by HOLDING B (just pressing B will cause a melee attack).This works better than Gears of War series and Mass Effect 3, because you hurdle over the obstacle/cover position similar to a track athlete. In the Gears of War series and Mass Effect 3, you go into this take cover and climb over cover combo move.4)Blind fire from cover. Just press the right trigger without aiming with the left trigger.  You can adjust where the blind fire goes too.5) Marking targets by pressing down on the right bumper also reveals enemies behind cover.  Just hold down the right bumper, pan and scan the environment up, down, left and right until you see a hiding enemy.6)SWAPPING COVER WORKS GREAT, unlike what someone else reported: while taking cover and if there is a cover position to your left or right: you can swap cover by pointing the left stick to the right and pressing A, or pointing the left stick to the left and pressing A.7)Most weapons have a secondary fire, silencer, fire rate, or aiming scope.  Just press up on the d-pad to equip the function.The rest of the controls are standard.I just wanted to these things out about the control scheme, because what I read from some of the other reviews discouraged me, but I found out they weren't true.I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE DECISION MAKING.  I've played the game twice total (with other games in between).THERE ARE ABOUT FIVE UNIQUE DECISIONS (or paths) to choose through the game that I know about--one at the very end. The decisions only affect the following few lines of dialog, the flashback hallucination at the end, watching someone being burned alive, and avoiding a major battle.THE GAME DOESN'T GIVE YOU AN ON-SCREEN PROMPTING THAT THIS IS A DECISION TO CHOOSE CHOICE A or B.These are the decisions that I can remember: POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT (I'll try not to spill the beans too much):**AGAIN POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT**DECISION/CHOICE NUMBER ONE: (I call Adams 'Ice Tea' because he sounds like Ice-T the rapper--he's probably voiced by him)'Ice Tea' Adams is on your left, Sgt. Lugo is on your right.Two Army guys are beating up the CIA officer (forgot his name).Bigmouth 'Ice Tea' Adams repeats a couple times saying that we're here to save people.Sgt. Lugo is saying that we need to rescue the CIA officer and just tell me to shoot.1) You can shoot the two Army guys/mark a target and shoot and you'll have an epic battle eventually breaks out.  You'll save the CIA officers life (temporarily).2) Follow 'Ice Tea' Adams to the left and under. The CIA officer will be killed right there.  Adams says to go silent (equip your silencer by pressing up on the d-pad using your MA1 or whatever (M-16 like rifle).  Adams takes out one guy silently, you take out two other guys silently plus anyone else silently and you avoid the major epic battle described above.  If you screw up and don't take out the guys silently, the major battle described above breaks out.DECISION/CHOICE NUMBER TWO:The Colonel on the radio, or the radio operator lackey, has two men hanging with snipers pointing their rifles at them.  You (Lt. Walker) must decide to kill on of the two be killed yourself (or at least have a battle break out).  The guy on the right is a civilian caught steeling water (a capital offence) and the guy on the left is the army guy who killed five of his family members when attempting to apprehend him.  You choose to kill on or the other.  I've played it both ways, but didn't play the game where I didn't shoot any of the two.DECISION/CHOICE NUMBER THREE:One of the ally Colonel/Officer who helped your team--he seemed like a saint, is pinned under a flaming water truck.  As he's talking, he sounds like he made some unpopular decisions and seems to really be a bad guy too.  He asks you too not let him burn to death. You shoot him or let him be consumed by the flames--(You get to see him being burned to death alive and screaming for a few seconds).DECISION/CHOICE NUMBER FOUR:Your teammate, Sgt. Lugo is found hanging and being taunted and beaten by civilians.  'Ice Tea' Adams tell the civilians to back off and is threatening the civilians.  You can either open fire on the civilians or not and just let things be.DECISION/CHOICE NUMBER FIVE:At the very end of the game when you, Lt. Walker, is \"talking\" to the Colonel or having hallucinations of doing so, you can either shoot him or shoot yourself.YOU DON'T GET TO MAKE THE DECISION AS TO PRESS ON TO GET REVENGE OR GIVE UP WHEN THE MISSION FAILED, OR TO TAKE WATER OUT OF THE CITY.THE CHOICES YOU MAKE WILL CHANGE THE SUBSEQUENT DIALOG AND CHANGE THE VERY ENDING FLASHBACKS THAT OCCUR WHEN EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER, OR SEEMS TO COME TOGETHER.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

It was not always so. For a long time there was a great void in my life. A completists nightmare. one two four five six seven....wait a minute!! where the heck is three?? Now I can finally live out my sordid fantasy...finally! The game is fun. It sports a similar stripped down old school system like one. The magic system is pretty much the same except for the fact that you can equip and unequip spells as needed. It was a great game to play through, and I would have given it five stars but for one thing. The DS did nothing for the game, and I cant say for sure, but it could have changed the whole dynamic of game play by making the thing 3d. Is it 3d? yeah it is. Isnt 3d a good thing? Well...let me remind you that the original starfox was 3d.... I think the game would have been better if it had been brushed up and released on the advance personally. What you get as is? a bunch of dumpy triangular warriors with massive expressionless heads! I think in this case things would have been better left to the imagination.problem 2: The DS added in a whole new mail feature where you could trade mail with your other friends who play rpgs....ok heres the thing...Ill say it. RPGS are an activity I do alone!! I dont want to network, I want to play a single player rpg... Perhaps if this had simply been an extra feature there would be no problem, but every one of the new side quests in the game revolves around sending a slew of emails back and forth to your other friends with gameboy advances who are also playing FF3. So essentially if you have no friends like myself...you will never be able to complete everything in the game...unless you buy another ds and cartridge.

If they do a sequel I will have it on preorder as soon as I hear about it.It has the bit of mystery of the X-files but is basically a combo game with shooting/puzzles and even a few Autopsy's thrown in.

Horrific Cinematics.","reviewText":"This game, like many games I've seen, are overrated.This game is fun. However, if you play a lot of different RPGs, I'm going to have to say you won't be seeing something that'll blow your mind.There's monster arena in this game, but honestly, it's not all that super indepth. I mean, with a team of monsters that I made from the lowest rank which is hackzilla, potbelly, and brickman, I was able to beat Ranks G (the lowest rank) to rank B. Anyway, best team to beat monster arena is the golem brothers aka brickman, goldman, and stoneman. Any questions ask me.There's alchemy in this game, which is the MUST use method to create some high class equipment that you'll definately need. Alchemy requires you to mix ingredients into a pot, available a bit later in the game and is upgradable, and you have to walk around. Walking around in town takes longer than walking around in the field. For more info visit gamefaqs dot com for faqs on this. Walking around is a must in order for the ingredients to form in alchemy.Anyhow, my biggest complaint about this game is that the cinematics for this game aka the little short video clips places in the story to make the story more believable.....completely suuuucks. Horrible, unimaginative, uninspiring, uncreative bunch of cinematics. You'll probably be like....uh...okay. This game also has some humor but the cinematics suuuuck so much that its hardly funny.If you respond to this review by \"Ah who cares about the cinematics, its about the game play\", then you're the type that'll fit into the saying \"pearls to a swine\", which actually applies to the majority of the easy to amuse population. A game is a mixture of ingredients just like you placing the ingredients in alchemy for this game. Wrong mixture means it doesn't work and your mixture becomes ineffective or not effective at all. This game's gameplay is decent, I find the boss battles easy, especially after you play FFX where one mistake means getting obliterated (which is ridiculous). This game gives you a chance of still winning even though you made some wrong choices. Again, horrifically lame cinematics, typical RPG fighting (you take one turn, they take one turn, turn is based on agility of you and the enemy but is randomized as well). This game DEFINITELY requires you to grind aka burning precious time to level, get gold, and get tokens at the gambling casinos.So people giving this 5 stars, sorry but there's nothing special about this game. If you come down to the barebones of this game, it's very typical.This game is still fun however, expect to put around 100 hours on this game. I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2009"}

Well, this is defiantly more like the original to me in terms of tension, and I got a couple of yelps playing so far. I was also irritated about the fact that they put in a feature that allows you to purchase from a online store. So far it hasn't taken away from the game for me, so that is a non issue. The game looks beautiful to me. The gun system can be a little complicated, so I just stick with my trusty plasma gun, and play with the other one's every once in a while.  I'm only in the second chapter, and so far I love everything about this game. I wish I had more friends who had this game so that I could play some co-op with.  Even tho you interact with other people, you still get the feeling of being all alone. The enemy's seem a little harder to kill this time around, but it's a great welcome. Get's your blood pumping. The game mechanics are pretty much the same. So if you weren't sure about getting this game. DONT BE! As of right now, the game is doing pretty good, but if your a fan, please get a new copy for the sake of getting another sequel. I think EA said that they haven't canned this series, but I would hate for them to change their minds. I thought this game was going towards the RESIDENT EVIL route and going farther from it's roots.

If you haven't played any of the previous games before I do advise doing so as while not needed they do make references to the past games and some of the story of the character histories that will clear up some of the confusion on what's happening between the game characters now. Of course the graphics are better then the previous games but don't expect the quality like The Last Of Us though as this game series keeps itself more on the light hearted scenarios with little real drama.  The voice cast for the game are great as they have kept the previous actors/actresses from the previous games which is of course much appreciated.So for fans of the Sly Cooper series or those just looking for a good light hearted action adventures game here's a great choice to try out..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00A750QIE","description":"","reviewerName":"JWink","summary":"Fun game with some improvements from last year","reviewText":"There are several great additions to MLB 13 The Show including the new Postseason Mode.From the 2012 version, there is not a huge leap in the animation, the realism was already top-notch and most modes remain the same.Those who already own MLB 12: The Show will be looking for a reason to buy the latest version besides just updated rosters. Fortunately, the postseason mode provides just that.Some people are likely not going through an entire season while playing every game. In all likelihood, you are simulating at least some of your games and hoping you are a good enough general manager to get your team into the playoffs.Even the Road to the Show mode feels a little too drawn out for an average person to keep interest.  However, the Postseason brings the shortened time frame to those who love baseball.  With this feature, you can customize the 10 teams that will be involved in the playoffs. You can now spend their time playing fewer games with a heightened intensity. While many of the features from franchise mode do not carry over, it still has the feel of your own team competing for a World Series.Additionally, the mode features a different presentation from the regular season. The crowd is louder, the broadcast is more intense and even the announcers seem to be involved in the action.  It truly captures the essence of October baseball and puts it into a video game.Sports video games often have to find a perfect mixture of fun gameplay and a realistic experience. The overall game does a decent job of this, but the postseason mode makes it even better.MLB 13: The Show is another winner in a series that's easily the best baseball sim out at the moment.  MLB 13 suffers from the same feature crawl that many annual sports franchises do, meaning it's largely similar to last year's iteration with a player roster update. But the Road to the Show improvements, The Show Live mode, and the fielder's throwing meter make this a worthy upgrade from MLB 12 for either the player who wants to play game by game or for those who want to shorten the season and still get the feel of MLB in its entirety.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

True next gen game.","reviewText":"To call Heavenly Sword just a game is an insult to the obvious blood sweat and tears that went into creating it. Heavenly Sword is a multi media entertainment package that is both a game and a movie experience. To play it is to understand the meaning of that statement.I've played many games in my life. Started out with an Atari 2600. Many good games I have played too in that time span since the golden days of gaming started. Heavenly Sword ranks up there as one of the best. Yes it is short but again this more then just a \"game\". The voice acting and CGI work is without a doubt some of the best I've ever seen in regard to presentation and just draws you right into the story from frame number one. The visuals of the game play itself are breath taking. Truly a work of art to savor and enjoy. You will find yourself while playing just taking a moment to pause and stare at the splendor on your screen. Granted it does help to have nice HDTV for the ultimate eye candy. In this respect my review is biased because I am playing this on a 47 inch full 1080p LCD HDTV. Even though the game itself is only 720p and 30fps it does not in any take away from the splendor of what you are seeing on the screen.The game play itself is fluid and easy to adapt to. The combo system is fantastic and implemented well. The musical score fits the mood. The story is engaging and keeps you glued to the PS3 wanting to find out what happens next awaiting the next awesome cut scene. Plus the extras that are available are enough to keep you busy past the 6 hours or so of game play. This is not a rental folks, this is a must buy. It's the type of game you will want to pull out to play again or to showcase the power the PS3 to your friends.If you need a reason to feel like you made a wise investment with your PS3 past the Blu-Ray player this game surly delivers the goods and makes it a justifiable purchase with a great hint of the awesome things to come that the PS3 is going to deliver. Don't even fret about it. Click the buy button now and you will be glad you did once you pop in the game upon arrival at your door step.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"Monnie","summary":"EA ruined this game","reviewText":"When I played the demo, I was thinking I might not like this game.  I decided to give the game a chance though since I liked all of the other UFC games.Big mistake.  An even bigger mistake was letting EA sports make this game.  Playing this game feels like playing Rock'em Sock'em robots.  The controls just feel awkward and so does the striking.  The ground game was honestly better in the previous iterations of the UFC game.  It's like they put so much work into making the graphics and they didn't carry over that same detail to striking and fighter movement.  This game isn't worth the money and they should dump EA sports and go back to whoever made the previous games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2014"}

If you haven't then your money would be better spent on that game first.To me, this game was kind of flat and uninspired. The landscape was bleak and while I understand that it is set in the desert it is just downright boring. A few other things I didn't like were the expected use of overly ridiculous mutations, like giant cazadore flies that take nine .357 rounds to kill. What's worse is that there was never just one of them or even two, usually more like five or six. The whole concept of this creature is just dumb anyway eventhough te game is rather comicbook-ish which I don't have a problem with. Didn't much care for the hillbilly stereotyping or the abundance of old west style weaponry either. Or the unnecessary reloading benches that litter the Nevada wasteland.Loading times in this game are atrocious, probably because of the large amount of data that has to be processed and their are some mostly minor graphical glitches as well but neither issue is a game-breaker. There's an ironsight glitch with the \"cowboy repeater\"(how stereotypical...) that is frustrating as hell but you'll be canning that rifle soon enough anyway.Some things did come off very well. The NCR (New California Republic) was completely awesome and by the end of the game I was ready to dive into my TV and enlist. Interaction with this faction was easily the highpoint of the game. The developers also did a superb job of relaying the feeling of mounting hostility and impending war. As the game progresses the barely audible, distant artillery fire that existed in the beginning becomes exponentially more frequent... and closer, NCR outposts begin receiving more and better equipped troops and your missions, or \"quests\" if you like, begin to center more and more on the cross-factional hostilities and tying up all the loose ends in an attempt to give \"your side\" the edge. This aspect of the game was wonderfully done. You genuinely felt the urgency of the things you were being asked to do. They had weight to them.The supporting characters were mostly great and I have to be honest and say that I even developed sort of a short-lived crush on Cass, my ever-present and unwaveringly loyal female sidekick.I thought Caesar's Legion was a bunch of over-masculine jackasses. I hated them so badly that I replayed the game several times just to make sure they were all dead. The Great Khans faction was pretty memorable. Kinda hard not to like them eventhough they're really just a bunch of dope-running ne'er-do-wells. The thing with them is that many of them simply had nowhere else to go and the Great Khans offered them shelter and security. You'll feel pretty bad if you end up having to off most of them and go back to their camp at a later date. There'll be a few stragglers hanging around and one of them will be a young girl. You'll find her sleeping in her tent and if speak to her all she says is, \"I can't believe everybody's gone\" and, \"Why'd you have to kill them all\". So sad.... They aren't a bad bunch, not really so don't be mean to them. The Brotherhood of Steel and The Enclave have a very limited presence. That's kind of a drag but it's okay because there's a backstory to why that is.They mostly did away with the maze of endless hallways and interconnected rooms too which I won't be complaining about.All in all it IS a worthwhile and satisfying game no matter how you slice it. It certainly is not it's predecessor but second installments rarely are. If you like RPG's there's no reason you won't like this one but if you haven't played Fallout 3 yet then I have to say it's a much better game.HINT: Apparently if you want to complete all the NCR related missions and gain their full support you absolutely have to disarm the bomb on the tram. I've done everything else right but have never gotten this done in time and every time I fail I can no longer complete all of the NCR missions nor gain their full support. So, when it comes time for that(you'll know when)save the game so you can keep restarting until you get the thing disarmed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

Basically, you had just punched in for work when all hell breaks loose - by this I mean aliens are teleporting into Black Mesa and killing off everything in site, and soon US Marines as well as Black Op forces enter the scene looking to kill you and the civilians as well. Its up to you to find a scientist named Dr. Rosenburg and help him repair a mini-teleporter so you can escape.If you've played Half Life or it's other expansion pack entitled Opposing Force then you know what to expect in this game: lots of puzzles and lots of action. You run around as Barney, looking through his eyes, as he clutches his weapons tights and fights his way through Black Mesa. You'll gather weapons like pistols, magnums, shotguns, assault rifles, grenades, rocket launchers, a crowbar, and others. All these will be used to fight off dog like things that send out shock-waves, Vortigaunts, tad pole like monsters that spit acid or whatever at you, and US Marines that were sent in to kill any living creature within Black Mesa.The difficulty is a little hard, and the puzzles are a bit tricky. For example, to kill a US Marine (otherwise known as HECU Soldier) it takes like 5 shotgun blasts or 3 magnum shots, or the puzzle where you have to complete an electric circuit but the game does nothing to tell you how to solve it.... and you only find out by accidently moving a barrel in between the wires and the charge goes through the barrel.The ending of the game was kind of lackluster, but certainly better then Opposing Force. You're helping Dr. Rosenburg and his colleauges finish charging this mini-teleporter. As you wait for the thing to charge so you may flip the switch and open the portal to leave, HECU soldiers come barging in. You fight them, open the portal and run through. You appear outside with the scientists who note that something is wrong - your glowing green. Quickly you teleport back to Xen (the alien homeworld). Then you appear back outside where you hear Rosenburg trying to figure out whats going on. Just as quickly, you appear in some sort of room and oyu see two HECU soldiers dragging an unconsious Gordon Freeman (the protagonist from Half Life) and saying things like \"we should just kill him now.\" and so on. Then you teleport back outside and Dr. Rosenburg notes that your no longer growing green, that the scientists couldn't have done it without you, and all of you go driving off away from Black Mesa.The only real downfall I have is the lack of action (fire fights) andhow short the game was. It was incredibly short.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return, as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

Well, compared to this second installment, the originalMass Effectnow seems like a typical space-RPG/Shooter.Having played the original game will not only help you better insert yourself into Commander Shepard's boots (you can actually import your original character form the first game - choices and all) - but also appreciate the improvements more.The story is darker and (without spoiling it) the choices harder to live with. Combat has been streamlined, with tactical decisions (using cover, taking the high ground) now being more important, without the game loosing its shooter character though.Both the visuals and the sounds are exquisite. Not only are the graphics really impressive (and I am running WinXP so that is DirecX-9 mind you) and the sounds dramatic but the voice acting and dialogue integration should be taught in game-design seminars.In this second installment there is no actual inventory to speak of (more on this later), loading times are shorter and better concealed (remember those endless elevator rides? Now forget about them), and accessing your special abilities menu has been simplified.In a true BIOWARE tradition, the available companions all come with their own special abilities and personal stories to explore.The selection of armor and guns has been reduced. There are about 15-20 guns to choose from and very limited loot. The guns I do not mind. Personally, I'd rather have a small number of well designed and fun to use guns at my disposal than a myriad of guns that in the end make no real difference (ahem...BORDERLANDS?).Having said that, I missed the thrill of looting and upgrading my equipment (not to mention having a real inventory). I mean, that is a great part of the fun in any cRPG! I am not holding my breath but maybe one of the upcoming DLCs could take care of that?And if I am to open the improvements-request file, how about speeding up those minigames in the next patch?Finally, you also get a personal apartment aboard Normandy (an excellent idea introduced in FALLOUT-3) which you can equip with various ornaments and personal items (from fish for your aquarium to a...space-hamster - I call mine Boo).As for the DRM scheme used, the game does contain SecuROM but (similar to DRAGON AGE and FALLOUT-3) it only uses a disk-check. MASS EFFECT 2 neither requires any online activation nor does it limit the numbers of its installations. It is not the best solution possible but it is a compromise I can live with. If you still find this objectionable, you can now make an informed decision.All in all, I found MASS EFFECT II to be a beautiful RolePlaying Movie of a game, an immersive cinematic-action shooter with limited loot and more story than equipment choices. In other words, MASS EFFECT 2 may not be a pure cRPG or a cRPS experience (Dragon Age: OriginsandFallout 3still rule those segments) but nevertheless it is an experience well worth its admission price.Go for the light-sensors Boo! Go for the light-sensors!!(no, I am not explaining that...)HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Do you want Just Dance? Dance Central? Zumba? All of these games have a similar idea carried out in different ways, but in the end it all comes down to taste. If you an adult primarily wanting to get some exercise you will probably want to try one of the Zumba games (the songs are more older hits and less pop music that on the radio right now, and the game is about exercise not high scores). If you are looking for a game for younger people, you will probably want something like Dance Central or Just Dance.This Just Dance game is (like all the other newer dance games) an evolution of the series that has many improvements over the first games. It also features a lot of newer pop songs that kids are more likely to like. if you are an adult, you probably aren't going to be crazy about the song list. If you are a parent buying for your kids, look over the song list to make sure it's the kind of thing you want your kids dancing to (tastes, morals, and mileage varies).For fans of the series, they pretty much know exactly what they are getting.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"C.

While similar to Oblivion there really is no comparison because the science-fiction story in F3 is not only leagues ahead but is movie quality on par with anything Valve has had to offer and then some more. F3 is an extremely story driven game and while the single player campaign is maybe shorter than expected you don't have to finish the game at all. You can go about the lands, engage the enemy (or friends) as much as you like. This is a major advantage that this game has. You can play it in so many different ways, do things differently, behave another way, good or bad, and the environment/story will respond accordingly. You can also freely roam the wastelands after you leave your home in a post-apocalyptic vault to venture outside, doing whatever you want and so while the main campaign is possibly undersized, F3 is not short of ways you can play it. In that respect the game is endless.While the game is like a first person shooter there is also the RPG feature. This essentially means you might have a headshot in your line of site but it's only statistical. There is a special VATS system though where you can let a computer take control of your shot and you see the blast in slow motion and here you can see why the game has an adult rating. Things can get quite gruesome, bloody and severed although maybe a little repetitive in the ways things explode and this is one of the games criticisms (as well as maybe a little sluggish movement and lack of binoculars [but you have a sniper rifle]) but that is where they end. Everything else about this game is magnificent, immersive and addictive.The wasteland itself is gigantic and is simply one of the most amazing landscapes designs for any game ever. It is flawless, virtually photorealistic at times and there is nothing even remotely like it. Every detail down to a rock crack is like it would appear from a digital camera shot of the real thing. You go on multiple missions around the wasteland visiting shanty towns, mines, destroyed settlements, castles, towers, cities, mountains, deserts and even ships that people are living on. The scope of the different surroundings is without parallel as well as the amount of gadgets you can collect, perks you can achieve and weapons you can trade. It is a do anything game on the scale of grand theft auto. You can either go it alone or go missions. The choice is yours and that is really what the game makers have done. Fallout 3 is all about how you play it.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Kingdom Hearts is awesome....","reviewText":"You know, I have to admit it.

Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Affordable, Versatile and Typically Excellent Turtle Beach Quality and Performance","reviewText":"Turtle Beach's CoD: Ghosts Ear Force Shadow is the most affordable of a trio of new headsets released in conjunction with the latest Call of Duty offering.  The primary trade-off for the lower cost of the Shadow is that they are wired vs. wireless.  This restricts movement and adds some complexity to the setup, but it also means that you never need to worry about supplying or recharging batteries.  So it's not automatically a bad thing - just a reminder that you need to carefully consider how you'll be using them when making the choice.One of the first things that I wanted to check out was the size of the headset itself.  I've been using an older Turtle Beach (The Ear Force Delta that was co-branded with Modern Warfare 3) and while I always liked its sound and performance, the headset itself was just small enough that I never could get the earcups 100% over my ears.  The Shadow has that extra bit of room so that I can do so, and the resulting comfort and blocking of outside noise is very good.  The headset's frame is molded plastic that has a bit of a click-clack feel, but the hinges and connections seem to be solidly built.  The earcups are soft breathable material and the top of the headband is padded.  The color that appears to be white in the product shots is actually closer to light grey in person. I'm actually not a fan of the Ghosts logo, particularly on the Shadow, where it looks small, like an obligatory afterthought shoehorned into the design.In terms of setup, the Shadow consists of the headset, a separate amplifier box (about the size of a box of Tic-Tacs) and a the cords to connect the two to whatever device you choose. The Shadow includes a number of different audio cables to support however you might have your console and A/V system configured.  The main USB cable is about 6 feet long, which may be too short to support the distance between most people's console and their couch.  You can also connect a second device to add to the sound mix (e.g. a phone or audio player).  I tried combinations of my iPhone, a PC and an Xbox360 Slim and they were pretty easy to set up.Sound-wise, the Shadow does very well.  Of course it's not audiophile standard, but few-to-no gaming headsets are, and given the Shadow's entry-level price, the sound is better than expected.  Mid and treble were clear and pretty crisp, although I found that the bass was on the light side despite the size of the Shadow's drivers.  The amplifier box has separate dials for adjusting the treble and bass mix. I was able to turn up the headset's volume to about 70% before I heard any distortion and they were already well beyond the loudest I would ever consider using for a sustained amount of time.Gaming with the Shadow also worked very well.  I particularly liked the separate volume dials for game and chat sound, and having them on the amplifier box (as opposed to the headset itself) made it easy to find on the fly.  Chat sound was great on my end and other reported that my voice sounded good with minimal background noise.  The game sound from the headset was clear and plenty loud, although I did quickly miss the surround sound of my Ear Force Deltas (which, to be fair, were over twice as expensive as the Shadow).For $99, you're getting a comfortable headset with good sound quality, great mic pickup, and the versatility to use with a variety of devices, including the next-generation consoles. Given my experience with Turtle Beach quality, this makes them a good investment. If you're a CoD fan, then the branding touches make it a no-brainer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

If you play this game with the Super Game Boy accessory for the Super NES, you'll have access to specially selected color palettes and custom border graphics.As the story begins, K. Rool has kidnapped Donkey Kong, and he's demanding the entire Banana Hoard as ransom. It's up to Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong to rescue their kidnapped pal. A wild assortment of friendly animals like Rambi the Rhino, Squitter the Spider, Squawks the Parrot, Rattly the Rattlesnake, and Enguarde the Swordfish help the two little monkeys in their adventurous mission through over 40 levels. Each exciting area is filled with special traps, hidden items, and dastardly Kremlings.People who have playedDonkey Kong Country 2on the Super NES will recognize many of the elements of this game. For example, Diddy Kong can do his signature cartwheel, and Dixie Kong can do her helicopter hair spin. And, you'll need to collect Kremcoins to be able to pass Klubba's Kiosk and get on to the Lost World.

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime. By completingMetroid Prime, you can unlock Samus's fusion suit for use inMetroid Prime.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A solid entry into the franchise","reviewText":"There's always parts of the Metroid series that kind of confused me as to why I like it. Part of it is that I always loved games where \"point A to point B\" was relatively simple. Not that I want easy games but I like games where I can just pick up and go and after a bit of brainteasing, I figure out where next to go whereas in this series you can explore continously and still find more than you thought was there. With the first Prime being my favorite, Fusion is another one of those games where it's expertly done and well-crafted but you end up treating it unfairly to other games, either in the series or in general.Story: More story-extensive than anything (that is, until Corruption), Samus was infected by a strange parasite known as X while on SR 388. Almost dead, scientists use a Metroid-based vaccine to cure her but while on the space station, the parasite breaks out and quickly infects the various areas. Not to mention a Samus-like enemy, the SA-X, is after her and with the help of a computer AI named Adam, Samus has to rid the station of X before it infects other planets and civilizations.Graphics: With the help of some cutscenes, the story in Fusion feels more grander than before and through rather simplistic screens (i.e an image of Samus with overlayed text) it's a more immersive story. As far as the ingame graphics are concerned, they're fairly commonly seen and everything is as it should be but it has a bit more detail and levels have a bit more going for them.Sound/Music: As always, the music has that otherworldly quality to them where it's quite haunting and eerily beautiful in its orchestration as the music is meant to help support the gameplay rather than be its own catchy tune a la Final Fantasy music. It might not be a downloadable soundtrack but it's a pleasure to have on anyway, that is if you like that ambient stuff.Gameplay: Same old, really. Samus starts with barely anything and through exploration, upgrades her suit and weapons which include staples such as the morph ball, charge beam and various suits. My one complaint is that there wasn't a lot brand new. Most of it I've seen before and aside from one upgrade I probably haven't seen yet in the 2D ones, everything feels too familiar. Also, many people might not like the hand holding the game does since every new area or objective completed has you go to a navigation room where Adam will tell you what to do next, even say with red arrows (literally) what room it's in. I didn't like this and preferred Prime where it told you the specific room but not exactly the route on how to best get there.The difficulty is fine aside from the bosses since like most of the series, the bosses can easily whomp you and quite a few almost made me throw the DS across the room since it felt too unfair at times. I don't mind a game that challenges me and keeps me on my toes but games where quick wits and careful playing still nets you game over screens just isn't my idea of fun but I guess it balances out the game: easy exploration, tough-as-nails bosses.It might not be my favorite entry of the series but any Metroid really tends to be worth a playthrough and Fusion is no different.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2005"}

Groh","summary":"Combining the Best of Mario Kart for Wii and DS","reviewText":"This review is with the help of my 12 year old son - a huge Mario fan for many years. He has played (for many hours) Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart 64, Double Dash (GameCube), Mario Kart for DS, and Mario Kart for Wii.So in his words...\"I really like the feel of Mario Kart 7. It combined DS and Wii games and took out the inconveniences of both. While loving both of the other games, I couldn't get the hang of tilting the Wii remote to steer, or trying to get past anyone on 150cc DS. Luckily, MK 7 plays like a slightly easier DS with the design of a better-controlled Wii. There are 16 new courses, 2 of which take place on Wuhu Island, from Mii games. Some of these races are divided into sections instead of laps, which I found to be very interesting. The hang glider and underwater sections are actually more plentiful than I expected, varying from a little hang glider ramp to laps that are halfway underwater. It also has 16 Retro Courses, from all past games. Unlike other installments, they added more shortcuts and took advantage of water hazards, an example being the pool from Gamecube's Daisy Cruiser.There are many coins scattered over the courses to collect, which you use to unlock new cart customizations. I haven't tried out the best combinations, but racing with the standard cart is great, too. The battles add three new courses and bring back three old ones. While some of the better arenas were overlooked, like Pipe Plaza or Block Fort, I'm happy with the new ones.Overall, this is my second favorite Mario Kart game coming up behind Double Dash and a great addition to the 3DS lineup.\"As an adult playing it, it is fun but my finger gets tired holding down the button for gas and I get a little motion sickness playing it after awhile.

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

K. Malone","summary":"Brave, experimental, and unique. Oh, and GREAT.","reviewText":"Notice the devisiveness of most of the customer reviews of this game... There is a reason for this; FFVIII is a definite love/hate title. It's rare that I find anyone who says &quot;Eh, FFVIII was OK.&quot;The 'thing' about FFVIII is, it strays away from what &quot;RPG&quot; has meant to most videogame RPG players over the last 15 or so years. It breaks many RPG traditions, even more than FFVII did. Meanwhile, many companies are still recycling the innovations made many years ago in previous FF games. If you're new to the RPG genre and have no pre-existing bias, you would be a fool not to give this game a try. It's a must. However, if you are a long-time FF fan, you will fall into one of two catagories:A) Conservative- these are generally the people who hate FFVIII. They discovered the FF series with FFI or IV or VI, and to them, THAT is what an FF game has to be... when an FF game moves away from the earlier style and sensibility of the series (2D 8 or 16 bit graphics, ultra-lighthearted script, a story even a five year old with down syndrome could grasp), they scream bloody murder and &quot;WORST FF GAME EVER! A DISGRACE TO THE FF NAME!&quot; They would rather play half-baked cookie cutter RPGs like Suikoden. They know what they like and that's all they want. They would be happy to play the same games over and over and over for eternity, just change the names of the characters and slap a new title on it and they'll think they're playing something new.B) Progressive- we also started playing FF on the NES or SNES, but these fans are in love with not only the FF games themselves, but they also value the actual EVOLUTION, DEVELOPMENT, and GROWTH of the series. Sometimes accused of being &quot;masochistic&quot; or &quot;mindless&quot; Squaresoft fans, the truth of the matter is that over the course of many years and many games, we have seen Squaresoft time and time again show that they simply tower above the competing videogame developers. Square and their games are not perfect, but they certainly come closer to perfection than anyone else. FFVIII is no exception.One of the best features of the game is the cast of characters, and their characterization. These are perhaps the most-fleshed out and realistic characters ever seen in an RPG. Each one has a very distinct and well-defined personality. (And when anyone says that Squall, the lead character, has no personality, please ignore them. He does have a clear personality... which just so happens to be extremely low-key, calm, and cool.) The story itself is unlike any other RPG you've ever played. Rather than the the complex and grandiose epic that was FFVII or the operatic and sweeping FFVI, FFVIII is a bit more along the lines of a mystery intertwined with a romance. Gameplay is also radically shifted from the norm. Magic spells are taken from enemies rather than learned by leveling or unlocked from items. These spells can then be attatched to a character's various stats in order to boost them. For those who love micro-management, it's heaven.I believe FFVIII to be a true masterpiece, and I recommend it to all gamers, with the exception of bitter and closed-minded &quot;old skool ff fans&quot;.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2001"}

Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"GamePlayer30 \"RW112\"","summary":"This is Hardcore","reviewText":"This game has beautiful hand drawn sprites and backgrounds.

I would humbly say I'm slightly better than someone who has never picked up a guitar before.Like many who purchased Rocksmith, I was ready to graduate from Rock Band and Guitar Hero. I was hopeful that Rocksmith would do several things for me:1. Inspire me to pick up a real guitar more often.2. Teach me to play entire songs.3. Improve muscle memory.In short, Rocksmith has succeeded on all counts!It will, however, NOT TEACH YOU HOW TO READ MUSIC. As a result, don't expect to play songs that are not in the game. This shouldn't surprise you but somehow I keep reading reviews about how this doesn't compare with a real instructor, which isn't what it's meant to do. That said, I still love this game! Here's why:-INSTRUCTION-Rocksmith delivers on the promise that you can plug in any electric guitar and learn to play songs. It also teaches beginners how to tune and how to use various playing techniques. The verbal directions and visual cues are perfect to help you accomplish your goals. Additionally, you can repeat any lesson along the way. Lastly, the game is adaptive, meaning that it will adjust to your skill level automatically. In other words, Rocksmith will only display one out of every ten notes initially. Once it realizes that it's too simple for you, it shows you more notes (or vice versa). This is not going to be an easy road but it's a very doable one.-SONGLIST-The songlist is respectable and spans many genres and several generations. The first song that is presented to you is Satisfaction. I wasn't totally excited but this is actually the perfect first song because A. everyone knows it, B. it's relatively easy to play, and C. will inject every beginner with a little confidence. By my second session, I'd already skipped ahead to try some old favorites like Sweet Home Alabama, Vasoline, and In Bloom. My only wish is that there are more mainstream songs. For instance, it has two songs by The Black Keys and two songs by Muse. I'd gladly trade one of those for a Doors, Led Zeppelin, Ozzy, or Aerosmith song. Moreover, Rocksmith seems to have pretended that the 80's glam-rock era didn't exist! No Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Poison, Ratt, etc...-REPLAYABILITY-It is very easy to spend an hour in this game and not realize it. Rocksmith is ideal for goal-oriented people like me. I'm motivated to play in order to improve quickly so Rocksmith gives me more notes to challenge me. With over 40 songs in the lineup (not even including all the DLC that keeps growing), Rocksmith will keep me busy for a very long time, or at least until Rocksmith 2 is released.-LAG-I have my xbox connected to a receiver and have no lag issues. It's as sharp as plugging my guitar directly into an amp.-GRAPHICS-The visuals are nothing spectacular but it works fine for the game. Let's face it, no one buys this title for the graphics anyway. From a usability standpoint, Rocksmith does a great job of utilizing colors and symbols to represent what it wants you to do.-MULTIPLAYER-Aside from not using miniature plastic instruments, the biggest difference between Rocksmith and RB/GH is that this is not a party game. Multiplayer is non-existent. The objective of the game is to teach you how to play songs with a real guitar, not rack up some arbitrary score or \"save\" each other from a virtual concert fail.-RECOMMENDATION-Not only do I play with my electric guitar a lot now, but I also pick up my acoustic to practice the songs I've learned so far. For someone who probably spends too much time holding a controller and not enough holding instruments, Rocksmith has made me less guilty about turning on my xbox and made it less embarrassing when playing a guitar -- all for under $100. With the right expectations, Rocksmith is a true gem. Buy without hesitation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Save one of the best for last","reviewText":"After the Prince of Persia trilogy ended with the well-received \"Two Thrones\", many wanted a return to the puzzle platforming of our favorite wall-runner but since the story was pretty much wrapped, where would Ubisoft take the series? Redo favorite \"Sands of Time\" but in more HD graphics and slight changes or go in a new direction? Well not only is it a new direction but it's also a new character with a different art style to boot. While reaction wasn't as massive as \"Wind Waker\"'s unveiling, many were wondering how this new one would handle and I have to admit, it works beautifully. Sure it's got the always-present platforming woes of mistimed jumps and a \"flaw\" found in its difficulty, but honestly this was a world I wanted to stay in as long as possible and I haven't done that in a long time.Story: No longer are we a proud son of royalty but rather a drifter/thief looking for his donkey (amusingly named Farah) who has a nice collection of treasures on her. The Prince is caught in a sandstorm and runs into Elika, part of the Ahura clan, an ancient tribe whose role it is is to keep the God of Darkness Ahriman imprisoned with the Tree of Life. But when Elika's father destroys the Tree, Ahriman is unleashed and fills the world with corruption and brings strong warriors who guard \"Fertile Grounds\" which can restore the land to normal with Elika's help. With Elika's special abilities and the Prince's acrobatic and skills with the blade, we'll travel through beautiful locales and bring the land to its former glory and destroy Ahriman.Since the story doesn't have any ties to the Sands of Time trilogy, it's best to plunge into this expecting a new story and characters rather than hope this is a part IV, let's say. But keeping that in mind, Elika is one of the best videogame females around and the story is great to go through and not deep (though these games usually aren't), I get immersed into the story easily and the history. Cutscenes and dialogue between the 2 is controlled by the Left trigger buttons where you'll get either hints for the puzzles, Elika and the Prince's past and thinking or history of each individual world. While it's purely optional, it further enriches the world though not having to keep pressing the button could've been nice.Graphics: Using the engine that powered \"Assassin's Creed\", Ubisoft chose to present a more colorful and painter-ly quality to the visuals and the results are stunning. The colors, the art design, the fluidity of the animations and the worlds, both corrupted and healed, are quite a sight. Like \"Okami\" for the Playstation 2, this game is poetry in motion. One slight knock is that occasional the game will freeze; not reset-freeze but it'll temporarily stop for a few seconds then keep going and I'm not sure if everyone will experience this but I did find it from time to time.Sound/Music: Yes there is no heavy metal riffs and we once again find ourselves surrounding by lush, orchestral music with Middle Eastern influences and it's lovely. The music always maintains a sense of wonder and whimsy and it helps add to the adventuring and exploration. Voice acting is provided by Nolan North who also did Nathan Drake from \"Uncharted\" and while the emphasis on widecracks and absense of Yuri Lowenthal is lamentable, he grew on me over the course of the game. Kari Wahlgren (Ashe from \"Final Fantasy XII\") however is fantastic and her voice makes a strong character that much better.Gameplay: The game follows the platforming acrobatics of the original trilogy and adds some new moves such as grabbing onto rings suspended on ceilings and walls, using your gauntlet (that claw-like mitt on the cover) to slowly repel down a wall and the big change which is the form of a double-jump like maneuver where the screen will drop in color which is a clue to use Elika to launch yourself further and while occasionally I couldn't tell when the button was needed, there's moments where you do so much moves in one go that it's kind of exhilarating to do so much moves in one go. This of course means trial-and-error gameplay, right? Sure except you can't die. Ever. Should you look like you're going to fall to your doom, hit Corrupted areas or miss a button during combat, Elika will jump in and pull you out in time. Does it make it easy? Well yeah but on the other hand, with a game so dependent on speed and momentum, this is what \"Mirror's Edge\" tried to do but failed at: fun with no stops. Sure you return to the last time you touched ground but there's no annoying \"you died\" or \"now loading\" screens and it's one of those games where you can just GO everytime you play.Whereas combat in the original trilogy was typically you against a dozen or so, here it's just one-on-two with Elika being your combat buddy. Basically there's 4 moves: X is sword, Y is Elika attack, A is acrobatics (jump basically) while B is gauntlet which launches enemies into mid-air while Right Trigger is your block with timed blocks allowing counterattacks. Instead of random button mashing, here it's about rhythm and chaining together moves to get the upper hand. Occasionally a quicktime event will pop up which will either save you from redoing the battle over or a button masher where you press a button repeatedly. It's a fun system though the mashing sequences require faster-than-expected presses and even occassionally it'll ask to press a button (say for example Y) and I press it in time yet it reds out indicating I missed it and I go \"uh but I pressed it\". A handy combo list in the menu gives some help and tactics and there's quite a few to learn and even an achievement/trophy for finding them all but it is pretty simple.After battle over the \"Fertile Grounds\", Elika's heals the world and returns it to his past majesty and here's where the collecting starts. Scattered in each area are \"light seeds\" and no joke, there's 1001 of these suckers and for achievement/trophy seekers well...have fun. However, you don't have to get all of them to progress and getting a certain amount will give Elika access to special plates scattered in levels which either rocket you over to a next one or a wall-scaling game where you have to dodge ledges and obstacles to get to the top. Since the game takes on a more hub-based structure rather than just pushing forward, there's some backtracking but it's fun to return to that one high ledge you couldn't get to previously.Does it have flaws? Sure with the mistimed jumps and one move instead of something else, the apparently problematic lack of difficulty (as opposed to frustration as an alternative) and the weight of the \"Sands of Time\" as a comparison, \"Prince of Persia\" will either be one of the better gaming experiences all year, a disappoint or somewhere in the middle. Personally, I'd be more than welcome to see a sequel one day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Josh Perkins \"antisugarcoated\"","summary":"great game, but...","reviewText":"Hello, I would like to say that I am a huge Silent Hill fan.  I reserved a copy of this game and was the first to the store to pick it up.  Later that same day, I beat this game.  I think it took me around 6 to 7 hours to beat it.  Not long, but around the same time as the second game.  Now, if I'm gonna spend 50 bucks on a title, I think I should get 50 bucks worth of gameplay.And you know what, that's exactly what I got.This game is great, even though it may be a bit short.  What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.  The graphics are amazing (i'm glad people are finally noticing) and the characters are some of the most realistic looking ever seen by the gaming eye.  But the storyline, again, comes out on top.The story is the real meat and potatoes of any Silent Hill game.  It is the driving force behind anything good.  Because it certainly isn't the atmosphere that keeps people going around that dark corner or walking blindly into the next room.  Mainly because the atmosphere in any Silent Hill game attempts to make you wet your pants and stare at your character on the screen, hoping they'll make their way through the nightmare hospital on their own while you just watch, so you don't have to control them.  I'm not saying the control is bad, it's just I found myself stuck in the middle of a dark hallway, not wanting to move in either direction because of the noises coming from both sides.Now this didn't happen so much in Silent Hill 3 as it did in 2.  In 2, I was scared to death to do anything in the dark.  But in 3, I felt a little more confident about my actions.  And I think I know why.  Now, after I played and beat 3 and unlocked all of the cool extra stuff, I immediately sat down with the two games and compared the heck out of them.  And I've come to the conclusion, that as wierd as Heather (the heroin of the third game) may seem, she is nothing compared to the craziness of James (the hero of the second game).  And my main proof is this.When you find a deep dark hole, or some nasty crap that looks like it may need investigating, James has no problems.  He just jumps right on in the hole, not even checking to see how deep it is.  And when he finds a hole in the wall with a strange noise coming from it, he just sticks his arm right in there.  Now Heather on the other hand, as much as I love her, is kind of a wuss.  She doesn't want to jump down the dark hole unless there's a ladder involved, which is smart, but that means you'll be walking around alot of area to get to the other side.  Now I know they couldn't have the two character match personality wise, but I kind of miss the psychotic side of James.  And in no way am I demeritting this game, which is excellent and totally different from any of the other games in the series, for not being as crazy as the second game.  In fact it's a little bit more crazy at the end, but I don't want to ruin anything so...Anyway, if you love to be scared crapless, go out and purchase this game, which is now in the 20 dollar price range.  So sit back, be scared, and enjoy the new entry to a wonderfully sick series.Graphics-5Sound-5Control-4.5Overall-5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2004"}

This will change from one gamer to the nextWhen Pokemon Red and Blue came out, Pokemon Yellow followed just a year later to expand on the games.  When Pokemon Gold and Silver debuted, Crystal followed shortly thereafter.  When Ruby and Sapphire came out, it wasn't long until Emerald followed.  It was only a matter of time before Pokemon Diamond and Pearl also got a third version into the mix.  Pokemon Platinum.  Just like the previous \"third\" versions of the games, Platinum adds in a few new things, though it's hard to say you'll ultimately want it if you've already got Diamond and/or Pearl and you've already worked your way through them.  Then again, you might find some of the extras worthwhile.Pokemon has been doing the same thing since it came about ten years ago.  The formula is so familiar to gamers that there's a \"been there, done that\" kind of feel all over.  You choose a starter and go off from home to collect several Pokemon, collect gym badges and ultimately defeat an evil team of Pokemon Trainers that are up to no good.  All the pieces of the formula are there.  If you've played any of the previous Pokemon games before then you've been here before.  Yet it doesn't stop Pokemon from being an overall addictive game.  While some will find Platinum (as well as Diamond and Pearl) to be a little too much of the same thing, the gameplay can't be denied.  Pokemon has been doing the same thing for over ten years now, and it's still fun.Pokemon is actually really strategic and in-depth. That is to say, it requires a lot of thought, and believe me, some of these battles require a lot of your skill. Battles are turn based, where you select a command and then watch a round of combat. There's a paper/rock/scissors effect here, however. Each and every Pokemon has a type, and some of the attacks they use reflect its type. This makes up what deals massive damage, what deals no damage and what deals just normal damage. Grass may be strong against water, for example but grass is also weak against fire, but in turn, fire is weak versus water. This effect plays through with seventeen and different types, and there is no best type because every type has a weakness. It's because of this element that Pokemon is so much fun to play. Just trying to construct the perfect team will take you more than a day, and with over 100 new creatures to collect, you can form endless amounts of teams. Just catching all the Pokemon alone will keep you busy for well over 50 hours. To add to the effect you'll face several other trainers as well, and you never know what they'll throw at you. Your strongest Pokemon may very well become your weakest in certain battles just because of its type.The battle system itself is made even simpler by the touch screen. Where as before you were scrolling through menus, battling can simply be done by touching the different options on screen. It makes battling a lot faster, especially because the icons are pretty big. Luckily, there's never really a point where you have to use the touch screen if you don't want to, and battling can still be done the old fashioned way if you so choose.As with Ruby and Sapphire there are also moments of two on two battles. Usually they come with either two trainers taking you on at a time, and you'll send out the two Pokemon in your top roster, or you'll be with another trainer who will send out his or her Pokemon with yours. It adds to the strategic feel of the game, but the moments of two on two battles are pretty few and far between.Pokemon Platinum adds a couple of new things, though not much.  Most notable is, of course, is the distortion world.  Aside from this there's not that big of a motive to get Pokemon Platinum if you mastered one of the other two versions.  It's great if you don't have either one, but it's hard to want to pick up Platinum just for the Distortion World alone.  There are a couple of other little goodies sprinkled about, including improvements in the online factor of the game, but it's still essentially the same game you got two years ago.  And for the most part, that isn't bad.The Pokemon games in and of themselves are full of little hidden secrets.  There's so much you can do after the main quest is over.  You can also enter into different contests as well as go after legendary Pokemon.  Pokemon can easily keep any gamer busy for well over fifty hours.Pokemon has never really been a game you go after for eye-candy. There are some moments where some 3D effects come out, but not very many. The sprites are more or less the same sprites they've been using since the Red and Blue versions. Ideally, the game doesn't look all that much of a step up from Ruby and Sapphire, and they were not fantastic looking games either. It's really colorful, but the DS is capable of so much more than this. Likewise, in battle is still the same. Fun to do it, but the Pokemon still only flinch to attack, and there aren't a lot of animations going on, and we're still looking over the Pokemon's shoulder. Essentially, the combat engine hasn't changed since the series first outing in 1998. There are some move animations that look really good, but aside from that it's hard to look past the simple fact that the game's combat engine hasn't really evolved since the original games came out way back in 1998. This isn't the original Gameboy, this is the Nintendo DS.The sound is also no exception. A lot of it sounds really tinny.  Most of the sound effects such as the Pokemon's cries are ripped straight from--you guessed it--the original Gameboy versions released in 1998. That's not to say all the tunes sound bad, it's just to say that a lot of what you're going to hear is recycled.  While the sound effects are dated, the music certainly isn't.  It's upbeat and keeps you on your toes.In the end, the production values aren't exactly something that'll disappoint you.  Though it might still be nice if someday Pokemon could get an update.  It's still an improvement.Despite the games graphics and sound, Pokemon Platinum is still an excellent title.  If you don't have Diamond or Pearl, you might as well pick up this one.  If there was anything to fret about over Pokemon it would be that it's just too much of the same thing.  Not to Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, but to the series as a whole.  There are plenty of additions, but the truth still stands: We've been doing the same thing for ten years.  But it's still a fun game regardless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

You can drive around big cities, get out of your car whenever you want, and shoot anybody at any time, and have cops hot on your trail. Here's my stack on this game:Graphics: 7/10. The graphics are not good. They are very blocky and overall pretty painful to look at until you get used to it. Some effects are good though, such as when cars explode. These graphics were probably considered fairly good in 2003, but now they are just sub-par.Sound: 8.5/10. The sound is awesome. Awesome radio stations, people screaming, great sound of rain hitting the pavement, the guns sound great, everything is pretty good soundwise in this game; just not the best.Control: 8/10. I am a SOCOM player and I like to use the analog sticks at the same time to move, and I like to use R1 to shoot; but that's not the case here. You can move with two analog sticks, but it's not very easy to do, and isn't worth doing anyways. The cars all steer differently and drive differently, which adds to more realism; which is extremely cool, and there are a lot of different cars depending on which island you're on.Fun: 8/10. This is a great game; the best in the series; and I have great fun with it, and this game doesn't seem to get old. Sure there are times when it will make you want to put it down for awhile, but you'll start playing again whenever you want to take your anger out on something.( Note: This game is rated 'M' and is not intended for people under the age of 17. )Even though I'm 14. ;)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2005"}

The graphics! If you loved the freedom of being able to roam freely around and cause as much havok as possible, then you will love gta3. It is Grand Theft Auto 2 with better graphics, weapons and gameplay.I'll start off with talking about gameplay. The gameplay is about the best there is for any game. You can either play missions and beat the game or put in a couple of good cheats and go cause mayhem. The gameplay clearly gets a 5/5.Now to the graphics. Well, this is where the game most likely lags the most. While good back in '01, we now have games that push the ps2 to the limits. If you're going for graphics then pick Gta 3 up for the computer. The graphics get a 3/5.Music/Voice acting/Sound Effects ect. The music is good. You can flip throught the radio stations to find what you want to listen to. I personally like Double Cleff Fm. 4/5Voice acting is the best there is. The mouth moves right along with what the person is saying. 5/5Sound Effects are top notch. From cars screetching to a stop to helicopters flying by to gunshots. The sound effects are some of the best I've seen. 5/5And finally Replay value. Not much, you beat it and its beat. The replay is not very good. 3/5Grand Theft Auto is a must buy for anyone with a ps2. No matter what kind of games you like. This game involves shooting, driving, and some strategy. Don't worry about the 'M' rating. The language isn't bad, I've seen alot worse (can anyone say, the getaway?). The violence is what this game gets the 'M' for. What can I say, your a criminal working for mobs and gangs, there is going to be violence and language. If you own a ps2 you need to get this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2003"}

While it's true that you can die pretty easily, you can also farm levels pretty easily (I'm around level 100 and have never been stuck spending more than 30 minutes to reliably farm an extra level).  There are two reasons for a 4 star (borderline 3) review.  One is the relatively weak story line.  Occasionally something occurs that reminds you there is an overall storyline, but not too often.  Mostly it's explore/kill/level-up/equip from one area/boss to the next.  The gameplay and exploration are interesting enough so I consider this essentially neutral.The thing that bugs me is the notion of being &#34;invaded&#34; by uninvited players when online and human.  If you don't remember/want to turn off the default online mode, whenever you are human (e.g. because you want to summon help for a boss battle) you are also at risk for invasion.  In my experience invading characters seem to be very well equipped and levelled (so not sure really what they get from invading, I suppose I could try myself to find out) and I've died several times, losing my human status, requiring me to spend more humanity to retry the same boss battle.  For revenge I now keep a stack of indictments handy, but that's only revenge, it doesn't do me any good after I've lost human status.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"G. Guberlal","summary":"Grand X Auto","reviewText":"Here's my take on the Doublepack which is way overdue, but finely tuned for the XBOX system making the wait seem moot. The PlayStation2 verson lacked the ability to add custom tracks to either game, simply because the Hard Drive doesn't come out until Q1-2004. However, even with the expected arrival of the 40 GB Drive that launches with Final Fantasy XI, GTA owners still won't be able to customize the game for their feel unless an enhanced version is released. Now, you have both games at top-PC quality level (perhaps above -no fiddling with graphics cards and audio cards, just place the DVD-disc in and go) both graphically and in audio. The way these 2 games were meant to look, sound and feel. Load your music, and ride into the cruel streets of Liberty & Vice Cities.

I have no doubt about it.  Grandia II takes a close second, but it just cannot overpower the greatness which is SoA. I absolutely loved it.  The odd thing, however, is that Skies of Arcadia doesn't really have one thing in specific which really blows away the competition, in my opinion (it does have some very good high points, of course).  It is simply solid, in every aspect.  How much I enjoyed it transcended just the sum of its parts.One of the two things which really stands out is probably the characters, especially in context of the plot. The main character, Vyse, is a young, brash air-pirate who wants to explore, go beyond the known boundaries of the world, and become legendary.  That is a perfect set-up for a game.  Fina is a girl who has fallen from the stars on a mysterious mission.  There is Cap'n Drachma who is a tortured ship captain who is hunting a giant arcwhale.  Gilder is an air pirate, who is smooth, and cool, and has pistols.  There are a whole lot more, but I think I've made my point.  I cared about all the characters.  They were awesome, and cool.  I liked everyone even more because they partially abandon the Japanese Anime personas.  It is original in that aspect.The set-up of the world of Arcadia is one of the best parts.  A world with no bottom, just floating islands, where people travel with ships and use weapons powered by magic stones which fall from the various moons.  It is a world with air pirates and a large variety of different people and cultures.  You are an air pirate.  From there, the storyline pens out.  A lot of the game is just random adventuring, but a good proportion is involved with actual events related to the plot.  The evil guys intend on stopping all war and problems, and in the process, take over all of Arcadia.  They plan on accomplishing this by finding massive moon stones which can invoke and control incredibly powerful creatures known as Gigas.  You've got to stop them, by getting to each temple first.The story isn't all too original (though like I've said before, everything adds its own special elements), but it sort of does that on purpose, and seems to almost be paying homage to a large number of old RPG classics and cliches.  Others have already pointed out the correlations to FF7. Those are real, but there are relations to many other games as well.  The general feeling through SoA is one of cheeriness, though it isn't too joyful and happy (less happy than Grandia, for one).In Skies of Arcadia, the combat is good.  At first, it seems to be just the basic turn-based, you on one side, enemies on the other, press attack system.  That is what it is, mostly, but there is something more to it.  For one thing, there is some movement.  It is important where you are standing for special moves and spells, but you can't directly control your position.  Second, you have normal magic points which are used for spells, but there is a shared Spirit bar, as well, which everyone draws from, used for special moves and spells.  Everyone can generate spirit to add to the pool, or take spirit from it.  It slowly regenerates and creates a nice combat dynamic.  Third, there is the resistence/element system.  You can change each person's weapon color individually during combat, to be able to do as much damage as possible.  It is necessary to switch weapon color for maximum effectiveness. The ship combat is another good point.  It was more entertaining than normal battles, mostly because you have very few of them.  It is a turn-based and more tactical type of combat.  Which the turn is actually happening, it does put too much time between actions, which draws it out, but other than that it is fun.Whichever color you are using at the end of combat gives you that color of experience.  Once you have enough experience of a color, you get the next spell in that group.  This has been done a lot before, in other games, but it is still fun.  It makes it necessary to use a variety of colors and to change often.  It also helps you guide the magic development of each individual party member, which is helpful.  The normal experience system is used otherwise, which is okay by me.The exploration aspect is also a lot of fun.  Exploring the beautifully detailed world is a huge part of the game.  There are special discoveries throughout the game which can get you some extra case (and some other special stuff, like a crew member).  You also have to scour cities for new members to join your crew. There is a whole variety of small side quest to accomplish as well.  The only thing which is slightly discouraging from exploration is the random encounters.  I admit, there are quite a few of them, and if you read all the reviews you will hear that a lot.  I don't like random encounters, but they are bearable, and there aren't as many on land as in the ship, or as in a lot of old school games.  I didn't find myself as unbelievably furious as some of the other reviewers.  After awhile, you get to fly above and below the clouds, where there are no monsters, less than half-way through the game.  I've played a lot of RPG's, so I didn't really care.I'm surprised I haven't mentioned the graphics yet, but they weren't as important to my Skies of Arcadia experience.  Don't get me wrong, they are very nice, especially the characters, but that isn't really the focus.  Looking at things is fun, but never too much more in RPG's (or any game, really).  The music is nice, and works well to set the mood, but it isn't great.Everything considered, Skies of Arcadia is one of my favorite RPG's.  It took about 60 hours to beat, but I didn't find everything (I did find a lot).  In general, it was somewhat challenging, but never too hard.  It is a lot of fun.

Enter an exciting gameplay environment that authentically recreates the whimsical time period of the film and expands the lore and supernatural events that seemingly plague New York City.","reviewerName":"John Lindsey \"John\"","summary":"A great comeback for the Ghostbusters in digital style!","reviewText":"Set in 1991, New York's favorite parnormalists known as The Ghostbusters are still eliminating spirits. A new recruit joins the amazing four to help our fellow men but a new evil force is driving the city into chaos including the Sedwick hotel where the boys busted Slimer for the first time. It seems that the boys in suits including the newest member will face a bigger challenge then the last two adventures they did.An outstanding and worthy game for the popular motion picture series is definitely stuff that delivers to fans of the movies. It reunites the actors like Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson as the Ghostbusters especially Annie Potts as Janine and William Atherthorn as Walter Peck with some new characters voiced by Brian Doyle Murray and Alyssa Milano as Peter Venkman's new love interest. The graphics are outstanding yet realistic that really makes the GB characters look just like their movie counterparts and awesome creature designs. The Controls are very unique on how you can capture ghosts in different ways then trap them just like in the movies, the voice acting is outstanding here including the writing which the game was written by Ramis and Ackroyd. It's a fairly simple but unique game that plays as the third movie but as a game instead of a film, you even get to meet some familar faces like Slimer with Stay Puft Marshmellow Man who is more powerful this time even with killer marshmellow minions even that librarian ghost.Here in this game the score to the original GB is used as the soundtrack for it as it even has the famous theme song by Ray Parker Jr. and this game even expores the origins of the first two adventures even on what originally caused the river of slime in part 2. it even incorporates the same humor that made the original a masterpiece and you even can use different blaster weapons such as the slime one used in part 2.One of the best games i've ever played coming for a GB fan like myself, if your a fan of the movies then you'll have a blast that is probably the best GB game since the Sega Genesis GB game and Real Ghostbusters Arcade game, it's even better then the horrendous NES GB 1 and 2 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000K2R4","description":"The Dreamcast system is, in a word, awesome. Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"dreamcastluvr \"Born-again Gamer\"","summary":"Dreamcast in 2011","reviewText":"Just bought a Dreamcast about 3 months ago. Never owned one before, however a friend of mine had one back in the day when it was still somewhat popular 11 years ago. I wasn't really into video games at that time, but I loved playing Soul Calibur with him.Fast forward 10 years later, and I've picked up video games as my new hobby. After getting a Wii, a 360, a PS3 and a PS2, the collector and retro-gaming fan in me wanted to add a Dreamcast to my video game stock. The Dreamcast is a great piece of video game history and still offers great gaming to enthusiasts like me, yet the high price tag of yesterday's technology will no doubt discourage mainstream interest.You should not expect to pay much for a used Dreamcast. They usually fetch around $30 - $60 along with a few games on Amazon or eBay. The new ones (or the ones being sold as \"new\") are quite a bit pricier. New controllers and VMUs are going for less than $10. Many of the games are still affordable, but rarer ones such as PowerStone 1 & 2 still command high prices. To contrast; When I got my PS2, I was able to get a lot of the games for $5 - $20 each. But quality Dreamcast games that are still in good condition are costing me $10 - $40. I also invested in a VGA adapter to get the best picture (which is well worth its price) as well as some PS2 & Saturn -> Dreamcast controller adapters (great for all those fighting games). All-in-all, for a great Dreamcast experience and to get the collection going with some great games, you will certainly be paying more than what you would for a comparable PS2 collection.The system itself is definitely good quality and sturdy, but very noisy. The larger-than-life controller isn't that bad and is actually great for games such as Sonic Adventure and Crazy Taxi (and other driving games too), but for fighters such as SFIII, Project Justice, and KOF, I prefer the Saturn controller via adapter. The cool thing about the DC controller are the triggers ala Xbox which go great with shooting games and the for gradual speed increase/decrease in driving games. The things I don't like about it; the thumbstick is obnoxiously rounded and made from hard plastic and the d-pad is certainly a step down from the Saturn's controller.The Dreamcast has a reletively small gaming library compared to other systems due to its short life-span, but you can double that if you get the converter software to play Japanese games (you may also need to learn a bit of Japanese for a lot of those non US-released imports). Either way, there are plenty of gems that make the Dreamcast well worth getting. I'm still in the process of building up my library and playing through the games, but here are my recommendations thus far...*Soul Calibur- simply a masterpiece, this game wowed gamers in 1999 and still looks and plays quite well by modern standards. It's also available on XBLA, but that version is missing the mission/ challenge mode.*Sonic Adventure 1 & 2- These were re-released with extra content on the GC, but for me the gameplay feels smoother on the Dreamcast.*Crazy Taxi 1 & 2- Great light-hearted arcade fun. The first one was re-released on PS2 & GC unaltered. Also released on XBLA in widescreen, but soundtrack was completely changed.*SFIII Double Impact & Third Strike- The gameplay is simply addictive despite the retro graphics. The backgrounds are static, but the sprites are fluidly animated. Third Strike was re-released on PS2 and Xbox, but Double Impact, which contains alternate backgrounds and cut-scenes from the first two SFIII incarnations, has yet to be re-released on any console.*Power Stone 1 & 2- Chaotic, goofy, and just plain fun and addicting. The fun factor is multiplied if you play multiplayer with your buddies as opposed to single player. Re-released on the PSP.*Marvel Vs Capcom 1 & 2- These have a completely different art style from MVC3. MVC1 is 2-on-2 with a 3rd character as assist only, while MVC2 is 3-on-3 and triple the primary characters' selection and 3D backgrounds. MVC2 was re-released on XBLA and PSN while a inferior version of MVC1 was released on the PSX.*Capcom vs SNK 1 & 2- Nearly identical gameplay, but #2 has more characters and 3D backgrounds. #1 was also released on PSX and #2 was re-released on PS2 and GC.*Dead or Alive 2- Another DC game that dropped jaws in the early days of the 6th gen systems. DOA2 Ultimate was released on the Xbox with improved graphics and gameplay, but the Dreamcast version is still a great collector's piece.*King of Fighters Evolution/ Dream Match '99- Updated graphics (for 1999, at least), and a couple of new characters. Choose a team of four, and one acts as an assist-type \"striker\" in Evolution. Nice 3D backgrounds in both games.*Dynamite Cop- If you're into retro fighting games, you're gonna love this one. Blending humor with traditional side-scrolling action-packed antics, this game is short but sweet.*Project Justice- This one is quite pricey (goes for the same as a new release), so only get it if you're a die-hard fighting game fan like me.*Fighting Vipers 2 (import)- This one was only released in Japan, so you will need a converter disc. The gameplay is essentially identical to the original Fighting Vipers game on the Saturn. A simplistic and shallow, yet enjoyable, fighter.So if you are a collector wanting to get yourself a piece of video game history, be ready to drop some serious money on Dreamcast games in good or new condition. The system itself is cheap enough to get yourself two (if you buy them used) and the controllers and VMUs are a dime a dozen. If you will only be satisfied with a brand new Dreamcast; caveat emptor, as there have been many reports of sellers refurbishing used Dreamcasts, repackaging and reselling them on eBay and Amazon as new.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2011"}

They were immediately smitten.  My husband loved the idea, as he was a Spyro fan from many years ago.  I loved the idea of a role playing game that was suitable for our younger boys.  We have teenagers, and because of their ages I am less strict as to what they are allowed to play, but I prefer the younger boys to play more age appropriate games.Skylanders fit the bill.  We bought the original the day it came out and haven't looked back.We bought Skylanders Giant and love it just as much!  The figures themselves are charming, and our four year old is happy to just play with them.  I enjoy looking at the figures just as much as the boys do!The game is a lot of fun, and easy to navigate.  There is some reading involved, but I don't think it is necessary to figure out the game as our 4 year old has no trouble figuring out the next move.Each figure comes with it's own powers and skills, and the boys enjoy upgrading them.  Our four year old actually loved to buy little hats for them and changes their looks constantly.  The package is easy to open and yet everything is well insulated for the most part, no random pieces flying around the box.  The starter pack comes with the game, the Portal of Power and three figures-Tree-REx (a giant tree!), Jet-Vac (an eagle) and Cynder (a small dragon).  Those three figures are certainly enough to get you started.The portal uses wireless technology and it's a battery drain-so invest in some rechargeables!  But set up is simple, so simple my 8 year old did it with me reading off the directions.  The original Skylander figures are compatible with this game, and I love that, since we have every single one.This is a great game for kids, but my older boys and my husband enjoy it as well.  I like that it is age appropriate, but I won't lie they get you with the 'extra' figures, so when we received this game I was fully prepared to purchase 'extras.'","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000488VP","description":"If you think it's hard to flag down a cab in a big city, try driving one in Sega's zany straight-from-the-arcade port ofCrazy Taxi. If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"Peace Daddy \"Eclectic ReflectionZ\"","summary":"Addictive.","reviewText":"Crazy Taxi is a highly entertaining and addictive game, which definitely qualifies as one of the DC's best.The graphics are stunning. Gameplay is fun and keeps you coming back for more. Sure, the car physics and other aspects of gameplay aren't realistic, but that's what video games are for: fulfilling fantasies. And while the Arcade course is easier and somewhat funner, the new and exclusive course offers a fresh challenge that will take some time and effort to master.Bottom line, this is a game every DC owner should have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2001"}

long range usually one hit will bring down a plane.XmaaXlaaAnti GroundUGBUGBL This is my favorite one since it can take out more than 4 targets at once.RCLNPBFREB Fuel Air Explosive This is another one of my favorites to use.This will take out multiple targets usually 4 or more and these frebs are better than the one on ace 4 as the explosions are much louder and looks better.You can see it ignite over the objects if you hold down the triangle button.BDSPSFFS New Bomblets spread out and take out multiple targetsGuided Anti GroundLAGM Just one of these missiles can take out 4 ground targets at once.XAGMGPBSODAnti ShipLASM These also work great on ground targets and are essential for battiling the biggest ships like the rimtaxie.They are long range.SpecialECMP New These can jam missile locks that a plane has on you and can get you out of a bind but you only get 5-6 of them.TLS Tactical Laser System  New This is only available on the Falkin plane.This laser will destroy anything air,ship and ground and very quickley.They will take out the Arkbird,Sinfaxi,Solg very quickley.Planes that are moving are a little hard to hit with this laser but you can if your careful and you can take out a lot of them.This laser is helpful and elimanating the Belkin Grabac Fighters which are the aces of your enemies.To get the falkin you must destroy certain hangers in mission 12a,12b,16a,16b and 27a.You can do this in free mission mode once you complete the game.Also the falkin has a 360 degree view if you fly it in cockpit mode and it has 84 missiles and is very fast.The X02 is easier to get in this game as well.All you have to do is get all 50 planes and you open it up.You can use free mode to fill up the kill meters on planes.The wingmen mode is very helpful.You can tell them to cover you if you get an enemie behind you,Disperse to take out multiple enemies,Attack if you run out of missiles and Special Weapons.Once you finish the game you open free mode and also you can fly anyplane you choose in free mode and for the most part in campain mode with the exception of just a few levels.Here is the pros and cons of this game.ProsFree Flight You can fly on any level without enemies once you complete the game.Free music Listen to any song from the game you want to hear.This is available once you complete the game.Painted enemy aircraft once you finish the

get to another level.The X02 is easier to get just by getting all 50 planes and on any difficulty.You don't have to get an S rating on every level to get the X02 like you did in ace 4 and the missile count in the X02 has incresed from 82 in ace 4 to 84 in ace 5.Flip a coin missions.Chopper will ask you certain questions and if you reply yes for example you will go to 11 a and no 11 b.Note all missions are available in free mode so you can play 11a and 11b if you want.Split missions are only on campain mode.Arcade Mode In this mode you are Mobius One and you must take out some resistant Eurusion fighters in the air,ground and sea.This has nothing to do with campain mode it is a totally different storyline.ConsYou can't go back and land when you want to reload your missiles and secondary weapons and fix damage like in ace4.Landings are only available in certain missions as well as takeoffs.You only get one secondary weapon per plane.On some missions you must fly reconnisence around radars without getting caught and take pictures.I hope xbox will get it's own version of an ace combat game with a different storyline since they have no flight similator games.Crimson Skies and Secret Weapons Over Normandy arn't really flight similator games with fighter jets.I can't wait to see Ace Combat 6 come out.I am already saving for a playstation 3 since that is what it will be

The technology has allowed for unparalleled levels of immersion for gamers in these virtual worlds, which in turn allows the stories in these games to come to life like they never have before.  Developers like Bioware, Irrational Games, Quantic Dream, Kojima Productions, and now Rockstar are elevating the status of video games as a storytelling medium in unprecedented ways.  Red Dead Redemption is another example of this, an American tale worthy of the cinematic and literary masterpieces of the Old West that came before.Rockstar's shining star in achieving this great feat is the world they have constructed, quite possibly the most authentic, vibrant world ever created in a video game.  From the snowy mountains of the northern regions, to the swamps of the east and down to the sandstone arches in the deserts of Mexico, their recreation of the southwestern USA and northern Mexico circa 1911 is a work of art.  The sounds of the insects, the rattles of rattlesnakes, the screeches of hawks, and the growls of stalking mountain lions are everywhere, as are the distant gunshots of outlaws and lawmen.  The different shades of the day/night cycles transform every inch of the world into something completely different as each hour ticks by.  Towns buzz with the anxiety of a rapidly changing world, and tension is palpable.The authenticity carries itself over to the fantastic story and the characters that populate it.  The slimy snake oil salesman, the corrupt government agents, the loving wife, the Mexican revolutionaries, and the old hands watching modernization slowly steal their world away...they give this world a genuineness that compliments the incredible landscapes.  And in the middle of it all is John Marston, a dangerously determined man who wants nothing more than to get back to his family and live an honest, noble life, but is unable to escape from the sins of his past.  One of the great, sympathetic characters in video game history, his story is one that you will never forget.The gameplay is your typical, enjoyable Rockstar fare.  As you advance through the plot, which involves John Marston hunting down former members of his outlaw posse at the request of blackmailing federal agents, you help folks out by doing tasks which helps you progress towards the freedom to be reunited with your family.  You can partake in a variety of side missions and mini-games.  You have the choice via your actions of whether you want to become a ruthless bandit or an honorable hero.  The formula isn't all that much different from the previous games Rockstar has developed in the past.  But again, the fact that all this takes place in this magnificent virtual world is what really elevates the game and makes it significantly different from other games that have come before.  Riding your horse through a canyon while the excellent, sparse soundtrack resonates through your speakers simultaneously fills you with both loneliness and valor.  The gunfights outside of gang hideouts, inside mines, off the back of stagecoach wagons, and everywhere else, are intense and adrenaline-pumping. My one complaint about the game is the movement control for the main character.  It doesn't feel like it's changed at all in the last decade since Grand Theft Auto III.  It still feels too loose and wobbly, and its surprising to me that Rockstar still hasn't remedied this after so much time, especially considering that this is a common complaint about their games.In the end, do yourself a favor and buy Red Dead Redemption, the finest American Western since Clint Eastwood's masterpiece \"Unforgiven\".  I'm sure you'll be stunned, just like I was, at this completely memorable, extremely enjoyable interactive tale set in one of the most brilliant fictional worlds ever created.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

There was enough gameplay to keep you hooked for days upon days... and then you have to learn how to use everything! Leveling up was difficult before, but now it is cleaner and more compact. Shooting is more clear with the Gears of War style. Your health regenerates (Blegh) and your ammo depletes (Double Blegh) but I will dismiss that. I just wish that combat was not the focus.This has so much more to it than the combat though. EA did a good job with this game, intergrating elements from the first games choices into this one. Things you did in the first game effect the entire world for the next game. Even your character's look transfers over!There are several things about this game warranting a purchase. It is an M rated game and you should be careful before buying it for your kid, there are romantic scenes that are sensored. It is deeper than Gears of War, but not as much as the first. Get it if you can handle it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

SO I DECIDED TO HEAD ON DOWN TO MY LOCAL GAMING STORE AND RESERVE ME A COPY OF RED DEAD REDEMPTION, YEEEHAAWWW!!!! ^*O*Single Player: the map is Very Large and takes time to travel between areas, which is a Plus. you will be attacked by Bears, Mountain Lions, Wolves and so on traveling through certain areas..and seeing other people being Attacked and having the option to Save Them or Not is always interesting. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE is a mode where other villians and gangs RANDOMLY Attacked Your City or Ranch...and you could defend it. also, this game is VERY IDENTICAL to GTA4...which is not necessarily a Bad Thing...but somewhat subtracts from its Originality. after an Hour of playing this, i popped in my GTA4 disc and had Slightly More Fun -_- kind of makes you appreciate THIS game LESS. also, its odd to me that you cant atleast have fun with the Prostitutes :l picky, i know, but it would have atleast been a good way to interact with the people around you...but instead, feels like a missed opportunity to interact.Multiplayer: the MP itself is ALRIGHT...riding around shooting at people and screaming RANDOM REDNECK OBSCENITIES is always fun...and the Gang Matches on Normal and Hard are Very Fun team based games...if there is ANY replay value to be found in this game, its in These Modes BUT THATS JUST MY OPINION...Overall, this game is very well put together but the single player gets old after a few days (maybe sooner)...plus it feels ALOT like GTA4 with a western theme. all i really do is the online Free Roam at this point..so i wouldnt suggest a PURCHASE...plus iv got Fallout 3 and Mass Effect 2 in my sights...as well as Mafia 2 in August...but this is DEFINITELY rent worthy...iLL .","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

Then give this 5 stars. Some pros and cons but over all very good, just not excellent.","reviewText":"The first thing to note is that orange box is more expensive on Steam than through Amazon. So in many ways at that price you can stock this review back up to 5 stars. However Steam does offer this product for $10 more (excluding tax). So its interesting that Valve cannot compete with Amazon (or doesn't want too) but I think to be fair in a review it would be best to give an overall review of this product rather than just the Amazon version.The orange box is a compilation. It contains five games. The games all have Valve's Source engine in common. These are Half-life 2, Half-life 2: Episode 1, Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Half-life 2: Episode 2.After the release of Half-Life 2 came Episode 1. It was an actual story continuation about a quarter of the size of the original game. Many people own HL2 and EP1 already. For most fans this means that Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Half-life 2: Episode 2 is what they are paying for. So to make amends Valve has decided to allow owners of HL2 and HL2:EP1 to get additional copies that they can share with others who do not have them over steam. Good idea.Portal is probably the most ingenious mod since counter-strike (note, Counter-strike: source is not included in orange box!). Using challenging level design and a gun that can open and close portals the player must navigate there way around rooms by using their brains in conjunction with the various apparatus and their portal gun. There are 18 levels that can get taxing and a final level that is good old fashioned `twist in the game' fun. The problem is you can finish portal in a few hours.Probably the most anticipated game is TF2. TF2 is fun but is also a little bit of a disappointment at the same time. The cartoon look may deter a lot of fans. I must admit that I prefer the look of TF1 which kept more in style with its Half-life roots. TF2 distances itself completely from anything that feels like HL (or HL2 for that matter) but in doing so has become a very different game to TF1 although the game play is the same. That is not to say that TF2 isn't a pile of fun. It is, but it will split fans. The maps are certainly better though however you can't help but feel that there are other multiplayer games out there that are much better than TF2... or that portal trumps it. TF2 is something that will grow and will probably always have fans but you can't help feeling that other multiplayer epics like Call of Duty 4 (which has blown away Counter-strike in terms of the leading FPS multiplayer) reduces TF2 to that game you play once in a blue moon.Now down to it. HL2: EP2. Is it any good? The answer is yes and here is why.In the Beginning... There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do... (1)Story,(2)Story and (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO buffs and the X-Files was to become mainstream family television viewing. Alien based entertainment media was a craze in the mid and late 1990's, unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came half-life where you get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researcher who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and you have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. EP2 hasn't thankfully left these roots and has instead expanded on the story, this time with deeper environments (running through landscapes rather than buildings all the time), improved textures (flowing hair) and more in game story action. You will get a solid few days gaming out of it, maybe more depending on how long you spend at it and the experience is very impressive, especially the story and feeling of being immersed in the half-life world of Gordon Freeman.So where does this leave us with Orange Box? Well although many of the single player games have multiplayer (such as HL2 multiplayer), TF2 is really the main multiplayer offering and it doesn't look like it can win the hearts and minds of the multiplayer community. In fact, Valve has now two causalities down (TF2 and CS:S) to COD4. It is loosing the multiplayer match.Portal is a stunning experience through and through. I can't underestimate how novel this experience was. Portal and EP2 are both truly rewarding games in every sense that we understand good gaming. However one is left thinking that while this is a great deal for those who haven't got HL2, you are actually just paying regular prices for good games. I feel they should have thrown in HL1: Source into the deal also.To this extent Orange Box depends on who you are. If you are new to anything HL2 then get it. If you are an experienced HL2 user then EP2 and Portal are where it is at. The TF2 hype is eclipsed by better games.Pros:- Portal- EP2.Cons:- TF2 is only just ok.- Better multiplayer elsewhere- No Counter-strike: Source- No Half-life 1: Source- Valve are loosing the multiplayer battle","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002ELCV00","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Not quite the SEALS feel","reviewText":"When I first saw this game, I was skeptical of purchasing it because I saw videos, which did not make me feel as if this was a true SOCOM Navy SEALS game. Not to mention, I saw videos, which had a lot of wide open combat, which is not SEAL-like. Their uniforms make them seem like they are a part of the regular Special Forces or something. Then, I played the beta and liked the potential of the game.GRAPHICS: The graphics on this game will put you in the mind frame of other Sony based PS3 games, such as Uncharted. That is enough said.UPDATED 5/11/11GAMEPLAY: The movements are not as fluid as a first person shooter, such as COD. However, the controls are responsive. Not to mention, the hit detection on this game is second to none. If you get a headshot, the enemy is going down. That is the bottom line. I like the sound of the headshots, which make a \"squishing\" sound. This is good to let the player know they have a headshot. If the enemy is hit with a leg shot, he'll stumble.CAMPAIGN: If you are expecting this game to be like the old Socom games, which calls for more stealth and a need to be tactical, this game is not for you. This game is more a shooter. Many times, you'll see a couple of patrols, which will call for a stealth kill. One missed shot, and the whole area is alerted. Then, all heck breaks loose. Most of the time, it is virtually impossible to go even a 1/4 of a mission, without a massive firefight. Not SEAL-like at all. The enemies are a little smarter than you may think. The enemies start out by engaging directly. Then, they will eventually flank you. Your team's (SEALS, S. Koreans) AI is pretty good, but not over the top. The SEALS are more for wide open combat. The S. Koreans are more for stealth kills, if that makes sense. Anyhow, they do move, where you tell them. One cool feature is how you can command them to shoot at a particular enemy, quietly. This is similar to RB6V  Just place the crosshairs above the enemies head and give the command. Still, this method only works a few times in each mission. You are still going to get into massive firefights.45 MISSIONS: These are where the pure stealth missions come in, which are carried out by female South Korean officer 45 aka White Tiger. She works alone on these missions, which means stealth is a must. There is no other way around it. In fact, the experience will kind of make a player feel as if they are playing Splinter Cell because of the suppressed weapons, stealth melee kills, and disposal of wasted enemies. Not to mention, detection is measured by a detection bar. The bar goes from low (undetected) to high (fully detected). The only thing that disappoints me is on these missions is the actual SEALS are not involved in these missions. Why? That is what SEALS DO.CUSTOM MISSSIONS: This mode allows players to customize various campaign missions to their liking. For example, you can re-play the original campaign missions, except you can determine the difficulty, number of enemies, and the objective, which can be either Takedown or Espionage. Takedown objectives are to locate and terminate the leader of the forces. Espionage objectives are to locate and secure intelligence. Caution! These missions can be VERY challenging, especially the Takedown missions. Many times, you will not be able to see certain enemies on the map. One time, there was an enemy, who was waiting on a train car, wielding a shotgun. Fortunately, I saw him and shot him in the face. Also, the missions will not have the enemies located in the same places. Therefore, you will not be able to engage the enemy the same on repeat custom missions.MULTIPLAYER: All COD run and gunners need not apply. Multiplayer requires patience and the need to be tactical. Teamwork is needed, as well. The best part about multiplayer is the shots are very responsive, like I mentioned before. I also like that you have two primary weapons to use. There are no pistols in this game. Some people complained about that, but who really wants to use pistols, anyway? Many weapons and upgrades can be obtained by gaining points. However, you must have success with the same weapon, in order to get upgrades for that particular weapon. There is only ONE killstreak, which is an air strike. The worst part about this is if you are killed, prior to using it, you lose that killstreak. COD fans will NOT like that.Though this game does not totally feel like a Navy SEAL experience, it is fun. The graphics are great. Plus, the multiplayer can be a gratifying experience, once you learn to play. Still, the lack of true SEAL missions, which should call for stealth and the ability to be tactical is what made me not want this game in the first place. Not to mention, it is why I am trying to get rid of this game. If you want a game, which has the SEAL-like feel, play the older SOCOM games orTom Clancy's Rainbow Six VegasandRainbow Six Vegas 2. If you are looking for another shooter, this game is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

You can do an Action Race battle where four sonic-like characters (each with their own strengths and weaknesses) get to race along tracks. There are treasure-hunt races, and shooting battles.For some, the best part are the Chao parts of the game. A chao is a little creature you raise from an egg.

Oshel \"grikdog\"","summary":"A rainy afternoon in your pocket","reviewText":"Some people have said that Go, the Japanese board game, is included here.  I haven't seen it, if it is.  The Japanese kids game, Go Moku (\"Connect Five\"), is played on a Go board with Go stones (well-implemented by Club House Games, I might add!) but the rules are humongously different.  Go is vastly more complex than chess, and some would say deeper.  Is there a way to unlock Go on the Go Moku game, maybe in WiFi mode?  A nice addition that would require no AI (other than score counting, maybe), or maybe they can cram GNU Go in there somehow.  A feature request for the next version!  Whatever, I have to say, I've never seen a real game of Go Moku peddled to gaijin before; this one is very well done!I was pleased to see backgammon.  In multi-game mode, this game does support both doubling and the Crawford rule, but the AI is not very tough even in hard mode.  The stylus can easily slide a stone past it's target, which can make the controls seem a bit touchy.  Every time you play and win 5 games, you unlock another of the three extra board styles - the \"Paper\" style (could be renamed \"Sketch\") is my favorite!  Board styles are a feature of other games, too, not just backgammon.You need to play Stamp Mode through to Level 5 at least once in order to unlock all the games.  This can be tedious on unfamiliar or boring games, but you can always get another stamp (you only need 3) by playing the game and losing.  After all 42 games are available, Stamp Mode lets you replay them all again in Easy, Normal or Hard variants.  I don't know what that unlocks, if anything.A word about difficulty:  At first, these games are heavily skewed toward \"Easy\".  Kids can play AND WIN chess or checkers, for example, which is not a bad way to learn a new game. Even \"Escape\" is a dead-easy version of a nifty Japanese sliding block puzzle game called Hakoiri Musume (\"The daughter in a box puzzle\").  However, that is still the most difficult game in the Club House Games, and should be a stumper for most people at the end of the Stamp Mode march.  Persist, the puzzle eventually yields to a determined attack.  After you've unlocked it, you get to chose your own poison - there are twenty different starting positions!  If even that is too easy for you, you can buy or build a wooden version at eBay (probably), but Club House Games is for fun, not for pumping mental iron.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2009"}

For those who have read my reviews, they are sure to know that I am an outspoken PS3 gamer. I have played closed to a 100 games on that console and it has worked flawlessly for me for the full 2 years that I have had it. That being said, I picked up an Xbox about a year ago. Played four or five games and realized about 2 months later that I had not even turned it on for nearly a month. Sold it to a friend at work.Then Mass Effect 2 came out. Oddly enough, despite the fact that I loved Mass Effect 1, this was not enough to get me to get another Xbox. It was this game, Metro 2033 that finally brought me back to the XBox fold. I will be the first to say that I am a first person game lover. From Resistance, to Modern Warfare, to Killzone to Fallout 3, FEAR and Far Cry 2--let's please not forget the Orange Box. I love FPS's and it nearly broke my heart when I found out that Metro was not coming out for the PS3(2 years ago they were saying this was a PS3 exclusive--whatever)Needless to say I loved this game from start to finish. Gorgeous(albeit dark) visuals which are striking and detailed to the extreme. IF there was ever a game to argue that the Xbox can definitely handle the visuals of game found on the PS3, this would be the one(Gear of War 2 or course as well but that one uses the Unreal Engine so would look identical if put on the PS3) This game used its own engine as far as a know and looks and runs awsome.That being said, all the critiques of this game are correct. Objectives are not always entirely clear, bullets are hard to come by without constant searching and looting, the map sucks, the guns do not feel powerful(at least for the first 2/3s of the game--you get a pretty decent sniping machine gun near the end) There are some glitches with guys hard to kill for no apparent reason.Despite all of this, I recommend this game. The story is very interesting(with a pretty strange twist at the end) there is plenty of action, and despite a pretty steep difficulty curve, I never got frustrated enough to quit on this game. There were some areas where I died DOZENS of times. I played on normal and never felt tempted to switch back to easy(I am really not sure there is a way to reduce difficulty mid game.) It really had a half life feel to it that I absolutely loved. You were always moving forward without a chance to catch your breath.I hope when they make the sequel(Metro 2034) that they bring this to the PS3 as well!! Yes I am keeping my Xbox--playing Crackdown 2 right now and will be playing Alan Wake eventually.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

I'm not normally one who rents games.  I'm all about purchasing them.  However, here is a game that I've wanted to play really badly and yet didn't want to buy it and last night proved it a worthy rental but lousy (for me, at least) purchase.  Throwing away the presentation from the previous House of Dead games and upping the b-grade feel to epic proportions, Overkill apes the Grindhouse (as presented by Tarantino and Rodriguez, but mostly Rodriguez) films and does almost everything Planet Terror does, only in virtual form and not as well.There's the lines through the screen, the cheesy 70s \"enjoy the movie\" screen, a completely non sequitur stripper sequence, missing reels, cheesy dialogue, scenes that abruptly end and more cursing than you'll know how to deal with.  In fact, according the Guinness Book of World Records, Overkill comes in as the \"most profane game\" with a recorded 189 counts of the \"F word,\" which doesn't take into account the other multitude of swear words available.  It's not so much as they curse as there's really not much to the dialogue without the cursing.  There's a lot of cussing, I guess is the take away from this.It's a bit gratuitous, even for a \"grindhouse\" game. That said, the game is very entertaining from the story perspective in that it makes as little sense as other House of the Dead games.  It's obviously not supposed to and the grindhouse theme is endearing, if sometimes off-putting.  However, from a gameplay perspective, Overkill is just okay.  It's a fairly standard on rails shooter that doesn't really offer much new.  In between levels you can purchase new weapons or upgrades to existing weapons, if you die during a level you can spend some of your points you've racked up that level to get another life and there's items in the environment you can shoot for power-ups (slow-mo-fo, life, grenades).  Bosses, in traditional House of the Dead fashion, have weak spots that are shown to you prior to your fight.The thing is, Overkill is too easy.  It wasn't until the last few levels that we even upgraded our weapons, we never purchased a new weapon and we only died a handful of times.  I think the biggest problem with Overkill is that there's no sense of escalating difficulty or tension.  It's as easy by the end of the game as it is in the beginning.  In fact, the hardest boss for us was actually the first one, followed by the two before the final boss, but even then they weren't that difficult...by difficult, I mean we died once or twice fighting them.On one hand I appreciated this, since I played it with a casual gamer who wasn't used to these types of games and we managed to get through it.  But, on the other, it really lessens the feeling of accomplishment and the whole thing becomes rather repetitive.  Further exasperating the repetitive nature of Overkill is the use of repeated enemies.  About 99% of the enemies you'll fight are of the mutant (because the zombie word is verboten) variety, but there's only three real types: males ones, fat male ones and female ones.  Each level, these three types get reskinned so that the fat one will move from wearing hickish farming clothes to operating clothes to chef clothes.  The women will go from strippers to nurses and beyond.  But it's really the same three enemy types, dressed up like Barbie and Ken dolls, but not really different.Once in awhile, Overkill spruces things up with a couple different enemy types but for almost the entire game you're fighting the same three enemies, which adds to the repetition.  Doesn't help that the game's graphics look really bland.  I've seen graphics of better caliber on the last generation's gaming system.  And there's slowdown!  It's not game-breaking but there's constantly pauses and stutters as the game loads.  It's very noticeable.In the end, Overkill is an enjoyable game that's made so more because of the presentation than the actual gameplay, slightly bringing the rating up.  Oh, did I mention it took about 2.5 hours or so to complete?  Yeah.  Sure, finishing it opens up a few different modes like a four player multiplayer game, a \"director's cut\" mode that ups the difficulty and supposedly adds a bit of length to the game and a handful of minigames.  But it's really short, even for a on rails game and you'd get better bang for  your buck with Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles.Started it last night and finished it last night...I think that's the definition of a perfect rental for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2009"}

Lohrke","summary":"an absolutely massive learning curve...","reviewText":"like most other people here, i found 'shift 2: unleashed' [S2U] to be unforgiveably bad.  at first.  most everything everyone has said is completely true - the physics are game-breaking, there absolutely IS input lag when playing through cockpit or helmet cam view, drifiting is beyond impossible, if you're behind at the first or second turn, forget it [you may as well start over as it's impossible to catch up], and the voice overs are annoying at best ['nice driving, man!!].  and don't get me started on the soundtrack.  ugh. why do developers all seem to think gamers like bands like linkin park and nickleback? only smooth jazz is worse.however, once i finally got it somewhat figured out, i have to admit i'm having a really good time with this game.  the only problem is that i had to set my level to 'easy' and my driving to 'novice' just to keep the car on the track. that's not an exaggeration - these cars do slide everywhere.  it's unfortunate that i feel like i have to dumb down just to enjoy the game. 'easy' is shift 1's 'normal.'having said that, S2U does have some very nice features.  the autolog is great [my friend and i had some great back-and-forth battles on 'hot pursuit' that gave that game much more longevity and replayability]; the night racing certainly ups the ante, though at times it feels like a bit of a gimmick.  there is a nice selection of cars, but the mods, updgrades and tweaks pale in comparison to GT5.the new tracks are great. i really love dubai and miami.  speaking of tracks, mastering corners is a bit easier than the original Shift, which is a nice change.  you can kick your back end out and still get credit for mastering it.  the graphics are essentially the same as Shift1, which is a bit of a disappointment.i've dropped about 9 hours into so far and i'm 25% through the career, so you can use that as your gauge.  i've not tried the online component, so i can't speak to that.  i also don't use a wheel. my experience is solely with a controller/joystick.in short - it's a game that could've been great had it better physics and were it less punishing and unforgiving.  there were many times i just threw my hands up in the air and said, 'why am i even trying?'  but if you're willing to invest a good 6-8 hours getting familiar with the handling, i think you'll find S2U to be a rewarding and enjoyable experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"Most Unbalanced CoD Yet.","reviewText":"THIS REVIEW IS MEANT TO BE READ BY AVERAGE FPS PLAYERS.My FPS history with consoles started with Black Ops and although that game infuriated me, it was mostly due to me playing on a PS3 lol. Black Ops was pretty good, in my opinion. Most of the maps were pretty good (except Jungle), the perks system worked well (except Second Chance), and most of the guns were well balanced (except Famas). If you were new to Call of Duty, but have delved into FPS' before, you could play Black Ops for about a week and start to get the hang of it. However, this game, is by far the hardest CoD I have played. Most of the maps suck crap (Yemen, Aftermath, Turbine, Cargo, and Carrier are especially my favorites *sarcasm*), the perk system is ridiculous (up to 6 perks, good players just take the biggest shats on average players), some of the killstreaks are stupidly OP'ed (Lightning Strike & Guardian are honorable mentions), the guns are ridiculous (don't even get me started on the Remington & Chicom...), the spawn system is the worst yet, the most camper-friendly CoD yet, and at the end of it, this game just makes good players better and mediocre players worse. I don't care about my K/D, but when I'm trying to grab the objective and I NEED to take out some people, it gets quite frustrating. So frustrating to the point that I now don't even use a gun. I mob with a combat knife and RPG and usually end up top 3 on my team and top 5 of the lobby with an average of 0.6 K/D. Basically, if you're an average player, either don't buy this game, or do what I do and troll with the knife and launcher. Trust me, it's your best bet. Oh and with Black Ops and MW3, I had no problem playing Multiplayer by myself for hours on end trying to Prestige. This is the first time I don't like playing Multiplayer by myself and this is the first time, I could care less about ranking up fast, etc. I'll literally play 15 games and only one of those games, I get into a lobby with nooby noobians. The other 14 games, I get utterly destroyed. It's just not fun enough to grind it out.If you're a zombies player, it's a hit or miss. The maps are a lot smaller than before so rape-training is not as easy as it used to be. Still possible and probable, just more difficult. There are also new modes, which I think is a nice change of pace. But if all you do is play zombies, than it's really just a gamble whether or not you will end up enjoying zombies for $60+ (assuming you're going to buy the map packs for the zombie maps). My advice, mooch off a friend to see if you like it.Campaign has a lot more now, which I don't really like because I just play it to get the achievements. However, the story is pretty interesting and there are different endings depending on what you do during the storyline. But I don't find myself having a lot of fun playing the campaign.So in conclusion, I'm pretty disappointed. Multiplayer is atrocious, zombies is whatevers, and campaign is campaign (lol). My concluding advice, buy a better game (like Borderlands 2). You'll rage less and find yourself admiring all the awesome artwork and staring at Foxxi Moxxi (even if you're a girl).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A great launch title for Vita, and a capable entry in the Uncharted series","reviewText":"With the release of the PlayStation Vita, Sony really needed something big for its killer app.  Well, there's no bigger franchise for Sony nowadays than Uncharted, so now we have Uncharted: Golden Abyss.  This is actually pretty great for early Vita adopters...a game like Uncharted on day one of a console launch is nothing to scoff at.  So, is it a good game?Uncharted: Golden Abyss is not developed by Naughty Dog, but instead by Bend Studio.  These are the developers responsible for the successful Syphon Filter series and the incredible Resistance: Retribution on PSP.  No strangers to Sony's portable platforms, Bend Studio does an admirable job doing justice to Naughty Dog's signature franchise, although not as great a job as they did with Resistance.  Golden Abyss definitely has its stumbles.The game puts you in control of Nathan Drake while he scours jungles and ruins in Central America.  The story in this game is, sadly, rather forgettable.  Truth be told, I was pretty confused by it and eventually only barely paid attention.  Pretty disappointing considering that storytelling is what makes the PS3 Uncharted games so phenomenal.  Fortunately, the characters themselves make up for the lackluster story.  The voice acting is top notch, as expected, and you genuinely end up caring about our heroes and absolutely hating the villains.  The gameplay is about what you'd expect from the series, with solid platforming and tight gunplay.  Controlling Drake is a breeze, thanks to the Vita's dual analog layout.  And speaking of the Vita's features, just about everything is controllable with the touchscreen and/or rear touchpad.  However, for purists (like myself) who prefer more standard controls, you can ignore those completely and play with the analog sticks and face buttons.  Still, it's worth trying the alternate controls at least once.  They're responsive and accurate.  Aiming works flawlessly...it's amazing what the addition of a right analog stick can do to gameplay!  I will say that controlling Drake on the Vita is much more fluid and responsive than the muddled controls on the PS3's Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception!Most unfortunately, not all touch controls are ignorable.  Golden Abyss will frequently throw in segments where you have to use the touchscreens or the Vita's Sixaxis motion controls.  This isn't a problem in and of itself...those controls are just as responsive as ever.  It's the fact that Sony Bend implemented them into the game so poorly!  These segments serve more as a gross interruption of the game and less as an engaging moment.  For example, Drake will frequently have to cross a narrow bridge or log.  When he nearly reaches the end (the same point in every bridge/log you come across), Drake pauses and begins to teeter.  You must tilt the Vita left and right to keep him from falling.  It's a jarring transition, and when it happens during a fast-paced chase sequence it feels REALLY out of place.  Other times, you're walking along and with no warning Drake picks up a random item.  The game stops while you use the touchscreen to wipe the dirt off the object, which has zero bearing on the plot.  Even worse are jigsaw puzzle-type moments that take a little too long to solve with no way of bypassing.  Finally, Sony Bend were apparently very proud of the ability to take charcoal rubbings...it's used so frequently it just gets stupid after the 50th time you do it.  I'll say again that most of these examples wouldn't really be a problem if it didn't halt the gameplay so completely.Another minor complaint is that the environments in this game are all the same.  Unlike the series' PS3 counterparts where Drake travels the world and visits many different areas, all you get in Golden Abyss is jungle and ruins.  It fits within the story, but it also results in a more bland experience.  The graphics in the game are excellent, but when everything starts looking the same you stop paying attention to that.  In contrast, Uncharted 2 and 3 in particular kept you in awe at the amazing setpieces throughout the entire game.Still, as a launch title for the Vita, Uncharted: Golden Abyss is a solid title and a must-own.  The game plays very well the majority of the time and the production value is high.  It's also a lengthy adventure, with 34 chapters and more hidden collectibles than I've ever seen in an Uncharted game.  Seriously, getting 100% will most definitely require multiple playthroughs.  You can also use the \"Black Market\" feature to solicit treasure from other gamers using the PS Vita's Near app.  It's actually a pretty neat feature, and really shows possibilities with future titles.  Oh, and as is usual for all Vita titles, you get trophy support too!While I wouldn't go and call this a console-type experience, this is a much deeper experience than you'd normally get on a handheld game of this genre.  It's not comparable to the PS3 games, but it's a great start to the PlayStation Vita library!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"J \"James\"","summary":"Addicting","reviewText":"I'm not going to give the game a indepth review because a lot of people have already done that.  I'm just going to point out my like and dislikes.The story line is really really good.  I think its the best one i have seen.  If you fix up michael abit with a new hair cut and facial, he kind of looks like the guy in gta 3.  Also, you remember the kid from bully named Jimmy?  Michael's son is also named Jimmy and he sort of looks like him.As for game play, they brought back purchasing properties except this time you can own business.  I don't have enough money yet to own one but i'm curious. You can also buy stocks and make money that way.  I haven't played around with it a lot yet though.You can also mod cars and make them stronger and faster depending on the vehicle.  The only thing i dont understand is when you repaint a old car with a bad paint job and you try to repaint, it doesn't really give it a new car look.  It still looks terrible.  Well i customized one any way and it didnt turn out to bad if you go with the metallic paint.  I customized everything such as new tires, headlights, tinted windows, turbo, transmission, and brakes.  Some things wont improve, like this car, there wasn't much improvement on the brakes.One thing i was worried about though is driving the car and then getting pulled into a mission and having to abandon my custom car.  Well it turns out that if you lose the car, the police will impound it and you can go pick it up.  You have to pay to get it out though.  I'm not sure if this works when just messing around and you lose the car.As for the enviroment, the city people are still rude just like any other gta game.  If you stand in someones bubble, they either run or pick a fight with you, including cops.  The cop tried to arrest me but i just ran.  Also, the other day, i beat some one up in the road, a car pulls up behind me, instead of doing anything, he just honks and tells me to get out of the way not caring there is a body in the road.  That's GTA logic for you.Cops in this game are pretty aggressive on trying to stop you.  I was in a car chase and turn off on a road that goes up a country hill.  Well they kept following me, so i went off road down the hill and next thing i know, there is a cop car flying over me.  They will do anything to try to stop you.  Its not difficult to lose the cops though, if you get out of the car and hide in an alley.  But when you're on a mission, you cant leave your car or you may lose the mission.I'm not sure why some reviews are complaining about physics.  For example, i had a grenade launcher, and i started shooting at oncoming traffic.  Well i hit an rv and it blew up and the rv flew at me and hit me and killed me.One more thing i like about this game over the other ones. When doing missions and you cant get passed it.  Well if you die 3 times, you can choose to skip that part of the mission. I only did it once because it was hard for me and i got tired of dying.Overall, this game is definitely worth getting.  You'll be missing out if you don't atleast try it, maybe rent or something.  I can see why this game got a 10/10 on ign.  It's awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2013"}

Maybe it's the tactile sensation of the stylus based control.  Maybe it's just fun to launch things into the sky.  Whatever the reason, this game is very, very fun.  Essentially, meteors are raining from the sky in the shape of squares, and you use the stylus to align them into groups of three vertically of horizontally.  Once they're aligned, they ignite and launch upwards, taking with them all the other Meteos on top.  The twist is that every planet has a different gravity.  Some favor horizontal launches, some favor vertical.  Some make you start other ignitions while the Meteos are mid-air.  The stylus controls are very good, and it seldom moves the wrong block.  The game is surprisingly deep, and adds a layer of replay value in that you unlock other planets by buying them with Meteos you've launched.  You can use these new planets to play a single player game to earn more Meteos or to play wireless multiplayer.  Both of which are very fun.  Basically, Meteos is a very solid puzzle game that'll leave you addicted, and has great replay value.  Give it a try.

The GamePad is used for sorting items and navigation, and also for scanning the environment similar to \"Metroid Prime.\" What makes \"ZombiU\" special is the intense pacing and atmosphere it creates. Like the \"Souls\" games, patience is a virtue. Death looms around every corner. Zombies may be of the walking sort, but once they start at you, be ready. Slowly creeping your way through the dark halls, or tunnels, or streets with a flashlight that's slowly depleting in power and only three bullets left creates a sense of dread not found in other games. \"ZombiU\" does not feel like a launch game, but a game made by people passionate about creating a great horror title.

Fantastic artwork and animation, good action","reviewText":"This game seems to have disappointed some folks.  I guess they were expecting too much.  It is a shooter plain and simple.  Cool weapons (except the rail gun, slowest video game weapon ever), amazing scenery and artwork, great details, decent voice acting.  Nope, its story is not academy award worthy, but it is a state of the art shooter with nothing to apologize for, except maybe the price.  Its biggest drawback is in fact an un-engrossing story.  In many games, you just can't wait till the end to see what happens.  In this one, the same stuff kept happening, but it wasn't bad stuff.It does have substantial operational and gameplay similarities to Doom 3.  I presume this is because it uses many of the same internals and core software.  But the story and artwork are much different, and the characters are as well.  The human characters are far more detailed, seem to have personalities, and have great animation, especially on higher end machines.  The story is similar in certain ways, but hey, its an \"alien race bent on killing humans\" story line, so how much variety is there.Overall, this is a great title.

I am about halfway or more through the game as I write this review, and I'm here to tell you that the game itself has been beautiful and intense!  There have been a  & puzzles, but with new elements and weapons & magics & such.  The upgrade system is good too.  Looking forward to getting through the rest of it!  I have been an avid fan of God of War games for quite some time, and I have in no way been disappointed by Ascension!As for the collector's edition contents, what you get is more than reasonable for the extra $20.  The statue of Kratos is really cool...it seemed a tad on the flimsy side as far as putting together, but overall the statue is durable enough and adorns the top of my book case nicely!  The steelbook case the game comes in is particularly cool, I love it!  The dynamic theme that you get is really neat, containing changing pictures of concept art for the game.  The soundtrack is enjoyable too, quality epic God of War tunes.  The PSN Greek mythological heroes avatar pack is pretty sweet too.  It's all worth the extra $20 in my opinion.This review will not contain a review of any online multiplayer, as I have not really played any of it.  It's possible I will try it eventually, but I have always been more of a solo campaign/story mode player than anything else, though I will play something cooperative every once in a while.  If you want to know about multiplayer, you'll have to read a different review.  Overall though, as far as story mode play and collectibles, this is worthwhile for the price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2013"}

During a private screening of the game with my friend I soon realized this game would be more then just another racing game. Through all aspects the quality is flawless. When first playing the game I expected the same old racing game but mostly I was in touch with the old Gran Turismo's which I adore as well. Nevertheless the game had a much wider span of world to cover then the previous Gran Turismos. The gameplay and graphics are untouchable and the networking is a sight to be looking foward to. Unlike other racing games Gran Turismo 4 gives you full realism and for future playing a prototype racing pit is being made. The cars themselves are fantastic. The huge array of different cars is eye boggling and almost made me crap in my pants. The turth of the matter is, is that this game puts the racer into the car. Unlike Need For Speed (Any title including underground 2) which did not incorporate realism Gran Turismo 4 passes even the previous Gran Turismo's. The Customizable solutions a player could come up with are almost uncountable. You can change up to anything and makes you feel as if you are actually the owner of a Mitsubishi Eclipse (Personal fav) or Nissan Skyline. The wheels and rims are also customizable. Just as in GT 3 but about 100X more advanced. This game is extremly beyond its time. All racing fanatics and or GT fanatics should grab this game ASAP. I know I have it on my Wish List and already have it pre-ordered here in J-Land! Just wait until the release and you'll know what I am talking about.

When you put a pre-existing Game Boy game into Game Boy Color, you will be able to choose from one of twelve default color palettes on the Game Boy Color start-up screen.

Besides the main feature of processing 32,000 colors with specially designed games, the GBC is backwards compatible with classic monochrome Game Boy titles, though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears.  Also, though the system's slimmed-down design is pretty convenient for pocket games, it's a bit too narrow for big hands.  It offers no shortage in battery power, and the AC outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter.  The biggest oddity on the handheld (for me) is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up.  As for the GBC's less-than-stellar resolution, after discovering the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, there's no excuse for having to find a proper light source.This system is recommended for players over 7.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

It's a LOVE or HATE game...","reviewText":"Never have I read so many 5-STAR reviews for a game that was such a disappointment! Perhaps if you play it online you'll get more out of it, but mine's already back in the case and ready to sell after the first day. I honestly don't understand all of the hype and \"this is just the best game\" stuff written about this lame game. If you want a REAL racing/driving game, get Burnout Paradise instead...These two games are so far apart in quality and gameplay, it's not even a contest. What's not to like specifically about Pacific Rift?1) First, the vehicle controls suck. It's like they respond in slow motion or after a 1-2 second delay. It is a RACE, so you have to go fast. When you do go fast, if your tire simply touches a rock or a tire/obstacle randomly placed around the track, then you either flip over and your vehicle disintegrates or you don't flip over and your vehicle just explodes...Wow...Great fun, huh?2) Second, since you're going fast over jumps and hills, your vehicle spends most of its time in the air. When you're in the air, you can't steer and you can only watch helplessly as your vehicle lands on a rock and explodes or in a lava field and explodes or sails over a cliff and explodes...Well if you just look at the vehicle the wrong way, it explodes.3) After your vehicle explodes once or twice in a 2 or 3 lap race, your chances of winning are slim to none. If you don't WIN, as in come in first place out of 16 racers, you don't progress to new race tracks. This was not a fun feedback loop for me.Now I appreciate some degree of difficulty in a video game...But this \"race\" was incredibly HARD right out of the box in race #1 on EASY level. Why is it necessary to make a game so difficult for a player's introduction to a new game? And as far as \"awesome graphics\", again Burnout Paradise puts this one to shame. This game's graphics are painfully slow and look like the PS3 is doing all it can to just grind them out, like something you'd find on a console 2 generations ago. Burnout's graphics are so smooth even when traveling at incredible speeds...Just as different as day and night.You'll either love or hate Pacific Rift...So I suggest renting to find out which camp you fall into. If you do buy it, make sure you play it before Burnout Paradise because if you play PR after BP, you'll quickly see and feel how inferior it really is...And that just sucks any potential fun factor right out of it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME7X","description":"Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System,Dragon  Warrior IIIis a Game Boy Color port of one of the all-time classic  role-playing games. The game reunites two of Japan's greatest RPG talents in Yuji  Horii (story and game) and Akira Toriyama (character design). Toriyama is also  known as the creator of the immensely popular Dragon Ball cartoons and comics. A  prequel to the first two games in the series,DWIIIcasts you as the  child of a great hero who must defeat an evil demon. New additions to the port  include improved graphics, new minigames, new items, and a better translation of  the original Japanese dialogue.The game starts off with a personality test that loosely determines how other  characters will react to you. Gameplay is standard RPG fare: exploring, building  experience levels, acquiring allies, gaining weapons, and ultimately going after  a large monster. There are some interesting minigames to mix things up. The  Monster Medals feature adds a collectible aspect to the game. Monsters may leave  medals behind after you defeat them. Some monsters only appear during certain  times of the day. Getting all the medals unlocks a secret dungeon. You can trade  medals via link cable to make things easier. Most RPG fans will love this game,  but those raised on modern RPGs might find its combat a bit tedious. This game  is compatible with Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance only.--Raymond M.

I vividly remember playing it on Nintendo many years ago and was surprised by the enhancement they managed to fit into.  And you might ask 'why play outdated game again on GameBoyColor?'  And you will only know the answer if you have played original Dragon Warrior 3.  Of course, there's no question about it when it comes to Dragon Warrior series, which has been my favorite RPG franchise, even topping Final Fantasy.There's something about this series.  It doesn't boast any flash graphic, well presented summoning, special effect filled magics.. like Final Fantasy, or even like a recent game Golden Sun.  However, it does a very, very faithful job, which is the heart of RPG; Role Playing.  It doesn't really play out the main character's role in dramatic/thematic way like Final Fantasy does with its immersive story, but its game play, the balance of game play is much better than any other RPG out there.  Seriously, whenever I hear that sound, which let you know one of your character's level has been raised, the feeling you get from it is totally different from rasing a level of a character from other games.  Dragon Warrior 3 seeks to give you the pleasure of playing RPG not through flash graphic or melodrama-like plot, but rather from very simple aspect, like your health/magic point being raised by few points when you've gained enough experience points, or obtaining that weapon/armor through numerous battles in a dungeon, or finding that essential item to move on with the story.  This RPG doesn't flood the world with countless weapon/armor/item like other RPGS (and you get desensitized with so many weapons/armors and items), but it really gives that joy to finding one very good weapon/armor because you stick to it for awhile.Its enhancement from original Dragon Warrior 3 over graphic with more details and animation of enemies, save system which let you save wherever you are and let you come back later, finding out Ortega's whereabout toward the end of game, and finding out the foundation of plot of Dragon Warrior 1 and 2,,  Man, really, if you are not 'too' spoiled with Final Fantasy's graphic and well developed characters, then you have a one of the best RPG you can find in the market.  Experience why Dragon Warrior series (Dragon Quest in Japan) is ONLY RPG franchise, capable of topping Final Fantasy in sale record in Japan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2002"}

Yeah, I gave it three stars.  If it were another developer it might have received four.  Is that fair?  I think so.  It is impossible not to compare a game to its predecessors, and sights were set so high by both Bioshock and Bioshock 2 that this game feels a bit flat.The good is the story.  The story is good, but not the revelation it was made out to be.  The ending is certainly better than the disappointing end of the first Bioshock, but Ken Levine said as much before this was released.  We were expecting that.The fantastic is the graphics.  Even on PS3, this game runs smoothly, was bug free during my play-through, and is gorgeous.  The first person battles are extremely frenetic and fun.The bad, and yes this was enough to knock of two full stars for me, is the surprising linearity of the game.  It is way to linear for a game in this series.  If this was an effort to attract more gamers, then I hope it worked.  What it did for me was discourage me from pre-ordering whatever game will be its follow up.  From now on, a &#34;wait-and-see&#34; approach is what I will use for future titles from Levine and company.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm glad I played it.

End result: very satisfied!Review:Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is amazing. I just bought this game not knowing much about it, only watching videos and reviews of it, so I was a bit scared buying this game. But I was wrong, i became addicted to it so quickly and i love just about everything about it!First off, the story is pretty interesting, no spoilers though, i could expect a little more however. 4/5The sound/music in KoA:R is brilliant, especially when running through the Faelands to your next objective. The sounds of the monsters, voice acting hits on spot, and is entertaining. 5/5Next, the enviroment/graphics are not the best for an rpg, but it has reminded me of several other game enviroments , which filled me with nostalgia. 4.5/5Ok, the best part of the game is gameplay. What makes this game so appealing is that it is more of a hack n slash rpg, rather one of stategy, like dark souls. Ive heard people comparing the combat to God of War, which i could relate to, as there are many combos to pull of with various weapons. 5/5For additional details, this game is huge. I am currently 51 hours in, with almost all of the main  quest done, about 40 side quests on standby, and maybe another 20 side quests still yet to find.This game has a great leveling system and a very helpful feature where you can reset your charcter's skills and abilities, although it costs money. Also, in my opinion, as you level up, you actually feel stronger, and find much better weapons, which should be key for all RPGs.Lastly i have to say that this game is very fun and long, so it will keep you entertained for a while.Note: the only flaw with this game is that if you are in a large group of enemies, you have a pretty good chance to be continuously hit and get chain-stunned, which gives you no control whatsoever and whittles away your health, but there are abilities that help you overcome that. Great game either way, and i hope theres a sequel soon! Great job EA/Big Huge Games!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2013"}

A co-op game where your help actually 'helps'.","reviewText":"There were two reasons as to why I was initially drawn to War for Cybertron. The first reason was that I was in the market for a decent 3rd person shooter, and the other reason being that I was a huge Transformers' fan as a kid. I was satisfied on both accounts...Regardless of what you may read on some of these reviews, WFC is a third person shooter, not a hack and slash. You have the choice between several Autobots/Decepticons throughout the game. The campaign is broken down into halves; Autobot campaign, and Decepticon campaign. Combat is pretty straight forward, you come equipped with one type of gun, depending on who you pick, and you can pick up various weaponry throughout. There are several types of guns, grenades, mines, launchers, etc. If you can dream it up, it's probably here. Although this is primarily a third person shooter, you do have an option to perform a melee attack, which kills most enemies with 1 or 2 blows. But be careful, because there's a good chance that you'll get shot up before you're close enough to engage in hand to hand combat. When transformed to a vehicle, you'll be equipped with a gun, or you can just drive over your enemies, which is a blast!There's not a ton of different enemy types, but that's ok because you'll never get tired of the ones you fight.They range from pretty easy, to extremely difficult! This is not a game where you can just run out in the open and start firing away. The A.I. is pretty smart in my opinion, and you'll have to use strategy in order to beat many of them. As my title suggests, you'll have two other Autobots/Deceptions fighting along side of you, and they'll do more than hold their own. This is one of the few co-op games that I've played where your A.I. help actually kills enemies as opposed to just standing around watching *coughs Ultimate Alliance 2 coughs* The Boss battles are where this games really shines. To get right to the point, they're both hard and memorable. It's not the kind of battle where you can take cover and shoot until the boss is dead, you'll have to plan out what you're going to do. Many reviewers complain about lack of ammo in the game. Ammo really isn't a problem, you just have to know where to find it, and get to it before you die, which can be exhilarating in itself.This is not a terribly long game to finish, I would estimate somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 15 hours. But it's 10 to 15 hours of legit combat, you won't have to look for many items, solve puzzles, etc. The only puzzle will be figuring out how to beat certain enemies. Although you will be able to transform to a car, truck, tank, plane, etc, there really isn't much need for it. This is a linear game that really doesn't give you the space to drive/fly around freely, I just transform from time to time because it looks cool, or just to run someone over lol.I honestly don't have any negative comments because I absolutely love this game. If someone twisted my arm and forced me to say something negative, I would probably say the game can be confusing from time to time. Every now and then during a boss battle, you may not be sure what to do. Someone on your team will yell out something, but in the heat of battle, you probably won't catch it. I ended up dying several times before I figured out what needed to be done. It really didn't bother me that much because if you die, you re-spawn in the same location for the most part, so no worries. This was not a big enough issue, so I didn't deduct a star.If you're looking for a challenging futuristic 3rd person shooter, you can't go wrong with War for Cybertron; especially for the price ;)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Brady","summary":"Really quality system","reviewText":"You can read all of the specs yourself, but I am really impressed with how the Vita turned out. Here is the gist of my overall experience:Unboxing: Great layout, easy to access everything. 8GB memory card comes in the retail packaging, which is great for reselling it (I purchased a 32 GB card so didn't need it). I was able to get $25 on Craigslist for it, so that's a winner. The easy start guide unfolds nicely, everything is packed well. Warning: there are instructions for putting in the SIM card. I freaked out for a bit because I could not find it, but apparently some of them come with the SIM preloaded.Startup: This was easily the most frustrating part of the experience. When prompted to set up the data plan initially, the browser was so slow and crashed so much that I couldn't do it, so I decided to just wait and do it through the AT&T; setup app. Then it asked for my PSN info. I put that I already had an account, but then it wouldn't take it because there was a software update required. There was no way to get to where you update the software though without putting in a PSN account. So kind of a vicious cycle. Finally I had to create a trial PSN account, run a software update, then put in my real PSN account. So I kind of got the runaround on that. After I finally got it working and updated, everything worked like a charm. So I would say wait and just breeze through the inital setup and get the software updated, otherwise it just gets really frustrating.Features: Twitter, Netflix and Facebook on day one, really pumped about this. The OS runs like a dream and is really intuitive, but I'm not a fan of the appearance. Everything is smooth and quick. No real gripes at all. I like how games stay on your home page even if the card isn't loaded in the system. Maps works great, better than on my iPhone 4. Near, Party and Chat seems like they should have all been combined into one app, but the features are great individually.AT&T;: I live in downtown Dallas, and service is great here. No complaints there. The data speed after the software update was much, much better than before as well, and the browser more stable. You get a month free after you pay for a month, which has been well disclosed, but I am disappointed that you have to wait 30 days for the game. From all accounts that game will be SuperStardust Delta, which I'm excited about considering the positive reviews its gotten.Gameplay: I have really only spent quality time with FIFA because of the setup frustration, but it looks and plays great. Graphics are on par with the PS3, and the control scheme is identical. I know a lot of people really don't like some of the rear touchpad implementations, but luckily you can turn that off in pretty much all games if you don't like it. I'm a fan though.Battery life: Pretty good thus far. With the amount of downloads and gameplay usage I've done I've got about 50% battery left after 2.5 hours of use. Looks like the 5 hour quote is pretty accurate.All in all its a great system. You can't go wrong getting one. I have less complaints about this system than any other launch item I've bought.

Not that games like Call of Duty are bad, but Deus Ex is fantastic in that it provides something unique and pushes the FPS genre forward. Fans of games like Mass Effect 2 and the original Deus Ex should feel right at home with this purchase.The controls work well, the ability to direct the narrative and various ways to approach a level are thoroughly enjoyable, the augmentation system works well and fits multiple play-styles comfortably, the story-line is serviceable(though at times confusing), there's plenty of content to enjoy giving you great bang for your buck and while not quite as ground-breaking or immersive as the first Deus Ex, Human Revolution is still a worthy successor to the original.On the downside, the game's information is incredibly difficult to digest as multiple notifications flash on your screen simultaneously(e.g. XP points gained, credits gained, quest completed, pixaxis point added and other information can all pop up at the same time), the menu screens are clunky, un-intuitive and washed out with cyber-yellow/orange color and the inventory system is an archaic holdover from a prior era of gaming. Streamlining these aspects would've gone a long way to lessening your worry about inventory management and increasing the amount of time spent playing around in an incredibly vibrant and encompassing world. Another let-down is the lack of a New Game+ as its always enjoyable to play through the story-line a second-time as an overpowered juggernaut, but that's certainly no deal-breaker.In all, if you're looking for a game that's different and sophisticated with a solid emphasis on choice then definitely give this game a go as the sum of its parts outshine the few odd quirks you'll encounter during your playing experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Decent action game, terrible survival horror game","reviewText":"Not every game can be a paradigm-shifting masterpiece. After years of trying to perfect Resident Evil 4 (including at least two completely scrapped attempts), it hit the Gamecube like a storm and completely changed how people viewed the venerable survival horror series. It was as perfect a game as I've seen recently, with amazing pacing, the perfect meaty length, intense action sequences and enough horror to still call it a horror game. In an ironic twist, Gears of War took inspiration from Resident Evil 4 and now Capcom returns the favor by taking some inspiration from Gears of War for Resident Evil 5. Unfortunately, they didn't take it far enough.If I had to sum up my Resident Evil 5 experience in a few words, I'd say it was frustrating, exciting, annoying, action-packed, thrilling and ultimately a little bit unsatisfying. If RE4 threw out the entire kitchen but kept the sink (the horror), RE5 ditches the sink entirely. And that's where my problems come in.Before I get too far ahead, the story is probably the weakest part, unfortunately. As convoluted and B-grade as it is, part of my love for the RE series stems from the stories. Here we have Chris Redford and his partner Sheva, members of the BSAA, who are in Africa trying to track down a man named Irving. Of course, the area they go into is swarming with a new form of Plagas-infected townspeople and Chris has ulterior motives in going to Africa that ties into his backstory. The story is kind of a mess and is easily the weakest in the series. The best part comes at the end as it brings closure to some story fragments started way back in 1998.A lot of people complain about the controls. While the emphasis on action seems counter-balanced by the stiff controls, its the same control scheme used in RE4. And that's fine with me, for the most part. The further reliance on action does tend to add some aggravating moments but I honestly didn't realize there was a control problem through most of the game. The action sequences run from very good to just decent, with a few set pieces that really deserve attention. And of course the boss fights are hugely over-the-top and add some of the best moments of the game in terms of variety.No, my biggest grief with the game is that it feels like a strange alien copy of a series I've loved for over 10 years. Where's the horror, I kept asking myself. Where are the scares? I would have been satisifed with a cheap window-shattering scare by the time the game was over. Everything just felt so...run of the mill. Most of the great parts of Resident Evil 4 were recycled. The beginning sequence where you're chased around for a time, moving quietly to avoid detection, QTEs, fights against giant rejects from Lord of the Rings...it all felt so familiar. And it doesn't do much much to push the genre forward.If anything, it takes a few steps back. I love co-op as much as the next gamer, but horror is based about feelings of isolation and it's hard to have that feeling when not only is there another person with you, but it seems as if at any time, the cavalry can arrive to shoot missiles and provide backup. Playing through the game with a real person is a fine and fun experience, but a lot of people will be forced to play with the sometimes good A.I. partner and that's a shame.Sheva, as controlled by the computer, does an adequate job most of the time. She's a rapid healer and isn't selfish with ammo. But she also is guided by AI principles and does some absolutely stupid things at the worst possible time. Like jumping off a cliff and running back, through the final boss who insta-kills her (and ends your game). Try having that happen to you three or four times. I have never been so frustrated at a game, but when death is sometimes predetermined based on the whims of your partner and not actual skill, my frustration meter goes through the roof.Overall, I enjoyed my ten (definitely not the 17 of RE4) hours spent in Resident Evil 5's twisted world. It provided enough variety and fun to warrant a couple play throughs, especially with a human partner. However, I never got the giddy feeling I felt playing Resident Evil, RE2 or RE4. I'd definitely recommend giving it a go because it does offer some great moments toward the end of the story and surprised me with how it ended, but don't go in with the same expectations of RE4. Here's hoping that Resident Evil 6, with its proposed \"complete reboot,\" puts the kitchen sink back in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004RIACMW","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fact Paced Combat","reviewText":"A beat-em-up game starring the famous star-spangled hero, \"Captain America: Super Soldier\" pits the Cap against the evil forces of HYDRA during World War 2.\"Captain America: Super Soldier\" covers the titular Captain's efforts to take down a HYDRA-held castle in Bavaria. The entire game takes place in the castle, which is fairly well-realized in terms of size and content. The Captain's enemies will range from HYDRA minions armed with stun-rods to mechanical monstrosities with futuristic weapons. The game does a great job getting to the heart of the comic-book aesthetic while still using a very grounded and \"realistic\" version of World War 2 as its backdrop - in essence pulling off exactly what its movie equivalent managed to do.The game's fighting is undoubtedly its strongest and most enjoyable point. The Cap uses both his body and his special shield to defeat foes. The square button delivers punches and kicks, the triangle button grabs foes, and the circle button is used for timed counterattacks. The R2 button throws Cap's shield, which can be useful for puzzles as well as combat. Pressing the \"X\" button in conjunction with a direction sends Cap flipping, rolling, or cartwheeling off in that direction. This is a necessity during battles, as HYDRA's minions have no concept of chivalry (unlike games like Assassin's Creed). As such, constant movement and evasion is necessary to win battles, and the game is particularly responsive in that regard. Cap will flip over enemies, and his throws and grapples reflect his location when he initiates them (so a grab from behind will look different from a grab from the front).In addition to his normal attacks and maneuvers, Captain America also has a range of special maneuvers that can have greater effects. There's a four-bar \"special\" meter that fills up as enemies are defeated, and Cap's different powers use up different amounts of that meter. The basic \"critical strike\" delivers a powerful attack (in slow motion) that can take down most basic foes with one hit. The second special ability - taking up two bars - is \"Weaponize\", which turns the enemy's weapons against themselves or their allies. Enemies wielding large missile weapons, for example, are grappled so that the Cap can use their guns against their comrades. The third special ability is \"Super Soldier\", which takes up four bars, and simply makes the Cap much faster and stronger than he normally is for a brief period of time. Captain America can also target multiple enemies with his shield in a single ricocheting throw, which uses up one bar per enemy.The combat in \"CA:SS\" is enjoyable for multiple reasons. From a gameplay standpoint, it's very well put together and rewards gamers with good reflexes instead of bogging them down with bad mechanics. From a visual standpoint, the impact of punches and kicks and shield-bashes are all very satisfying, and the slow-mo attacks don't get old or repetitive like they do in a lot of games because they're relatively limited in terms of their usage. The weakest aspect of the game is the Quick-Time Events that accompany most bosses; these tend to be more frustrating than engaging. For example, a boss will grapple you and you'll have to mash a random button to get out - but if you accidentally hit the wrong button, you automatically lose. In some cases this is necessary to finish off a boss, who will regain health if you manage to mess up. Yet despite this the game's core gameplay remains engaging and interesting in and of itself.While the game's graphics and sound are weak individually, they work acceptably as part of the game. The lip-sync in cutscenes isn't the best, and faces look kind of unreal, but those are things that are barely noticeable once the game is actually in motion. The music ought to be better - it's not so much \"bad\" as it is \"slow and plodding\", a stark contrast to the fast-paced combat. Overall, though, \"Captain America: Super Soldier\" is a good game for anyone who wants well-executed comic book action.Rating: 8/10.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00009ZVHU","reviewerName":"Markus Egger \"www.MarkusEgger.com/blog\"","summary":"Possibly one of the best games ever...","reviewText":"This game is nothing short of amazing. I wouldn't say that this falls in my favorite genre, yet this is probably my all-time-favorite game.The game looks great! Not just are the graphics very good, but UbiSoft is also introducing a new way of presenting a jump-and-run game to the player. While most of the time the camara is behind the player as in most other jump-and-runs, it also moves around whenever something special happens. Example: When the prince runs up and along a wall, the camera moves to the side to show the best possible perspective for the action. This is more like a movie than a game as far as the presentation goes. And the most amazing part is that this does NOT interfere with the gameplay. One would think that all this moving around would confuse the player, but it does not, because it is done very well. To me, this is a major advance in gameplay. Many player may not even notice the effect or think it is a small issue, but it is really a major leap forward towards providing a much more immersive experience.Luckily, this game has more going for it than just visuals. The best part is probably the gameplay. The prince can do things that are breath taking, yet they are easy to pull of. This makes the game a lot of fun, because it makes the player feel good about him or herself. At the same time, the game is not too easy. In fact, the game has a number of difficult parts, although asides from one battle, I didn't find anything that is really frustrating.So is there anything I do not like about the game? Well, the camera could be a bit better at times, although it has been majorly improved over the demo versions that were available before the game shipped. Also, the game says it is Xbox Live enabled. This is true, but it only means that your friends can see when you are online. There is no online playing or even special content (at least not at this point). I do no expect this game to have an online mode, nor is there any major need for other online services (although additional downloadable levels would be nice :-)  ). But I always think it is borderline false advertising when a game claims to be live enabled, yet once one logs on, nothing more happens.If you are thinking about buying this game: Go ahead! You will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2004"}

EPIC WIN.Before I even try to review these games or this disc, it should be noted that these were the very first games I played on a PS3, and the first video games I played on a home console in over 10 years since I last played Forsaken 64 on the Nintendo 64. Needless to say, God Of War 1 and 2, being as good as they are and considering what I just mentioned, this disc holds a special place in my collection and in my heart. So with that out of the way ...THE GOOD :  Just about everything. It can't be overstated that getting both of these incredible games on one disc is a bargain that's unparalleled in gaming. Considering the price the disc currently goes for, the fact it comes with 2 full length games w/ all the extras and that the quality of the games is so remarkably high, you just can't beat this disc. I challenge you to find a better deal than what's offered by the God Of War Collection. Aside from the fantastic deal that this disc is, the games themselves are, as anyone who has been a PSx gamer since 2005 knows by now, fantastic, unparalleled, industry-standard games. Considering God Of War 1 and 2 have been out since 2005 & 2007, respectively, there isn't much I can say in 2010 by way of a review that hasn't already been said, so I'm not going to go too deep. Needless to say, these games are insanely brutal, testosterone-driven monster (and button) mashes based in Greek mythology. It's incredible fun to wield Kratos' chain blades in varying powerful combos along with certain magic abilities in order to absolutely crush, demolish and obliterate the various beasts and Gods of Greek mythology in a rage-induced fury. Ripping a gorgons' head off or yanking a cyclops' eye right out of the socket has never been so much fun. And where God Of War serves as a baseline, God Of War 2 ups the ante in every meaningful way with additional abilities, weapons, magic and settings.  Both of these games have great balance between furious action, tricky, timing-oriented jumps or moves and mind-bending puzzles (and of course each has the requisite sex mini-game - too funny!)  Overall just a well-balanced, incredibly immersive, undeniably fun collection of amazing games.THE BAD : Not very much at all. There are really only a few minor things about both these games that I have a gripe with. The first is that when you execute a combo attack, you're committed to it. In other words, you could be in the middle performing an attack, and either what you're attacking or another on-screen opponent could go to attack you. And though you may try to dodge or roll out of the way of the incoming attack, it's not going to happen until you've finished your combo, which always results in taking the incoming damage. In this regard, All 3 God Of War games (and the ones on the PSP) could take a cue from the unbelievably good BAYONETTA. Something else that proved to be a bit annoying at times was the camera's lack of `intuitiveness'. IE, it doesn't always position itself for the best view of what you're fighting. You could get stuck behind a large mass of enemies or just positioned the wrong way against a large one and find yourself flailing away hoping for the best. This doesn't happen a lot, but just enough that it bears mentioning. Also, and this is really a very minor nitpick, as many other reviewers have noted, the cut-scene graphics are noticeably `dirtier' than the gameplay graphics. Which makes you wonder, if the developer took time to clean up the graphics throughout the game, why not clean up the cut scenes? Not that they look horrible, but they definitely look a step below the gameplay graphics.THE BOTTOM LINE:  Two industry-standard, unbelievably fun, incredibly addictive games all on one disc complete with all their extras and a trophy system for the PS3 at an average price of $30 or so is simply an unparalleled and unbeatable deal. Even if you played them on the PS2, do yourself a favor and rediscover them on the PS3. And if you haven't played them before, it's near impossible to describe how much fun you're missing. It's akin to being a parent; everyone can tell you what it's like, but until you actually experience it, you just don't have a clue. Do yourself the favor and add this to your collection!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

I see a lot of reviews getting slammed because they were expecting a single-player or cooperative campaign, and didn't read the fine print. I, on the other hand, knew that going in and I'm saying that what they released isn't nearly enough to warrant a five star review.The game is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Resolution and graphics are solid, gameplay is smooth, frantic and fast paced. In short, it is a wonderful multiplayer experience--but so are plenty of other games. There is a lot you'll be familiar with here if you are a fan of multiplayer games. You have a character--you play and get kills--you get to level up and thus, get new stuff. Nothing new there. Now in this case, you have your mech, and depending on how you use him, he is either a vehicle (If you are inside) or an AI controlled squaddie (If he's following you around.) Is that new? Maybe, I mean who doesn't like having a 20 foot tall mech at his back. But revolutionary, absolutely not. There were articles out there saying this was the \"first true next gen title.\" I don't see it. It's good. It's solid, and it's a great multiplayer experience, but the lack of a cooperative or single player experience makes me feel like they released half a game. It would certainly be worth $40, but $60 is a little steep.They tried to weave a story into the multiplayer experience, but there's nothing there that is going to leave you feeling overly satisfied, or at least it hasn't with me.This is a great multiplayer game. But a great multiplayer game, by itself, is not worth $60. I knew that going in and I bought it anyway. I make a good living and don't care about spending an extra $60 to play with my friends, but a lot of people don't have that luxury. And if you're like me, you expect more out of \"Next Gen\" games--not less. And this game just shows the disappointing trend of continuing to cater to the multiplayer crowd and neglect everyone else. Sad, but true.EDIT*** I'm surprised at how few people are willing to throw their money into a game that is so lacking. I wanted to add a little to my review to give it more context. Titanfall is a shooter. Here is how you build a five star shooter, folks. I'll use one of my favorites as an example. Gears of War 3. A fantastic campaign, competitive multiplayer with far more options than Titanfall offers. Still not enough? No problem, then you can play cooperative multiplayer with your friends against bots, for those times when you aren't in the mood for playing with a bunch of bratty twelve year olds. Still not enough? No problem! Hop over and play the fantastic Horde Mode for even more fun. THAT is a fully fledged shooter worth $60. In fact, after having the discussions, I think I will probably end up knocking Titanfall down to two stars. When you have a company try to sell a game like this for the same price as a shooter that offers much, much more, Titanfall really shows its lack of polish. As a gamer and consumer, it should be insulting. As consumers we vote with our dollars. And every copy of this game that sells is a vote that says--We as consumers accept games that lack features. I say think hard before you do that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BQI3UQG","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Welcome Back to the Jungle","reviewText":"In 1994, Rare developed a little game called Donkey Kong Country that became a huge smash on the Super Nintendo. It went on to sell millions of copies and was even followed up by two sequels. After the Donkey Kong Country trilogy came we were subjected to Donkey Kong 64 and then numerous strange games that seemed to feature Donkey Kong, but not exactly play like Donkey Kong. Thus, when Donkey Kong Country Returns first came out, it was easy to be excited. Because it was the first time in a over a decade that we got the chance to play a traditional Donkey Kong Country game and the results are fantastic.  When it was released on the Wii in 2010 it was hailed as an instant classic.  Now the game is getting a 3DS port and it's still pretty good.The original game followed the tale of Donkey Kong. His bananas were taken by King K. Rool and Donkey Kong had to go out, along with Diddy Kong, to get them back. Donkey Kong Country Returns goes back to that. But instead of King K. Rool and Kremlings it's a bunch of Tiki's that have done this. It's actually very hard NOT to miss the Kremlings. Especially in a Donkey Kong game that's supposed to be a return to things. But you won't mind too much because the level designs and the challenge this game evokes is absolutely fantastic.You'll go by on a world map from one level to the next completing them in an effort to get back your bananas from those Tiki's. They all start off rather easy at first, teaching you basic things and hoping you can keep up with all you've been taught. The first two worlds in particular are cake walks but once you get to world 3 things really pick up and start to become challenging. The gameplay is extremely familiar to anyone who played the original Donkey Kong Country games from a long time ago. You'll run and jump on your enemies, and you'll find hidden barrels and passages that'll take you to bonus rooms where you can reap the rewards. Every level also has puzzle pieces that you'll want to collect.There are a few things that have changed, however. The first is how your partner works. In the original games you could switch between Donkey and Diddy. And when one took a hit, he immediately ran away and the partner picked up the slack. After that one more hit meant the loss of a life. Here, both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have hearts. And Diddy will always be on Donkey Kong's back. Always. You won't be able to switch to him at all. But he will allow you to hover for a short period of time. Once you lose your first two hearts you lose Diddy and your ability to hover briefly. Until you find a DK barrel and get him back. Donkey Kong also has two hearts, and once lost the level ends. The level design here has made Donkey Kong Country Returns quite difficult, but fun and manageable. You'll find some moments of trial and error. But they're some well crafted levels that never throw the same thing at you twice. Even familiar levels will always have new tweaks. The first mine car level is basic. But there's one down the line that has you having to stay inside a giant while until it crumbles away. It is AMAZING stuff. The boss battles are also amazing and require a lot of pattern recognition. There's a lot of variety to each level. Couple that with the fact that some levels have you going into the background and foreground and there's a lot to do and explore in just about every level (not to mention this aspect looks pretty good in 3D). The game provides a challenge, but like so many of Nintendo's games that do in this day and age, it makes sure that extra lives are scattered everywhere. Just in case. Even if you ARE having problems, you're still not likely to see a game over screen any time soon based on the abundance lives.There are other moments that breathe of Donkey Kong Country. A lot of the music you here is simply remixed from the original Donkey Kong Country and it sounds brilliant and sometimes even sets the atmosphere. It's likely to fill long time fans with nostalgia.That's not to say it's all nostalgic though. There are some things that were either left on the cutting room floor. For instance, there are no real animal buddies here and that's a shame. You won't find some of your favorites like Rambi the Rhino or anything like that. For the most part Donkey Kong Country Returns doesn't really feature them. The other thing is that a lot of the Kong family isn't really there either. Part of the fun and charm of some of the other games was running into some of the ohter Kong's such as Wrinkly or Funky or Cranky. And while Cranky Kong returns, it's not with some of his clever fourth wall breaking \"we know we're in a video game,\" banter that he used to always have that made him such a comical character in the Super Nintendo classics.The Wii version of Donkey Kong Country Returns didn't have the best control scheme.  Thanks to making you waggle the Wii Remote to perform certain actions (like rolling) it was a little too sensitive and sometimes caused the player to perform actions they didn't want to.  Here, everything is mapped to a button.  And in a game this challenging you'll definitely appreciate it.Donkey Kong Country Returns also has a multiplayer function similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii. One player controls Donkey Kong and the other controls Diddy Kong. It's the only time you really can control Diddy manually. You'll have to work together, but unlike New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there isn't much fun in messing around with your friends. The focus here is strictly teamwork and it holds to that. The game is a challenge and the last thing you'd want to do is mess up your partner who could potentially be carrying you through a level anyway.Apparently many a gamer must've thought the Wii version was too much of a challenge.  Indeed, there is an option here to make the game easier for players just jumping in.  True enough, Donkey Kong Country Returns actually is quite the challenge.  It takes a lot to really master a certain level.  You can make the game easier, and it'll give you some additional hearts as well as some new items available to you.  Make no mistake, Donkey Kong Country Returns lives up to its reputation of being a challenging game, but it's a good challenge.  If you do mess up too many times, however, the game will play through the level for you (although it will not grab any bonuses throughout).The other big question is always whether or not there's something new when a port comes around.  Donkey Kong Country Returns has a whole new world you can through on the the 3D release.  It's just barely enough of a curiosity to Wii Owners to make it worth trying, but it might not be enough to make it worth picking up just yet.  Aside from that the game is primarily the same.  The only real problem with 3DS port is that the game doesn't seem like it was made to be experienced on the small screen.  Sometimes it's hard to see just what hit you in some instance.  Eventually you'll get the gist, but you might suffer unnecessarily as a result.Visually Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D is a very pretty game.  Mostly the environments and the backgrounds.  The ability to go into the background or (sometimes) foreground is certainly not bad either.  The 3D is actually good for moments like these.  On the other hand, there's nothing the 3D will add to the gameplay.  You could just as easily do well with it off.  Despite that the game looks good in 3D there's nothing about it that will wholly immerse you in the experience.  Like many 3DS games you'll probably turn the 3D off after a while.There's always a wonder about whether or not to get the older version or the new.  The new world is certainly a curious thing and Wii Owners may like the idea of a more classic control scheme, but I'm finding it hard to say you'd need this version if you've already played the Wii version.  There are new levels but there aren't exactly a lot of new levels.  There isn't much you'll experience here that you didn't experience before.  On the other hand, if you've never played Donkey Kong Country Returns and you're curious, it's probably better to go with the 3DS variant.  The choice is yours.If you were a fan of the original Donkey Kong Country games then by all means play Donkey Kong Country Returns. If you never played them before and you just want to jump in, there's nothing to stop you this time around. It's a fun game, just one that can be pretty difficult. But that's not such a bad thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2013"}

And I played the N64 greats like No Mercy and Wrestlemania 2000 (as well as some of those NWO games). I had the most fun with the older games. I don't think it's nostalgia, it's just fun factor. Admittingly, I don't give in much to the story mode in this game. I played some of the attitude era mode and it was a cool extra in the game over previous ones but it just didn't feel right. So online is where I spent most of my time. Character creation is pretty amazing, and customizations are also amazing.What ruins this game for me is the community. People always find 'cheap' ways of playing and ruining the online experience. The kickout system in this game is so flawed. Finisher after finisher, full body damage, and over 20 minutes of playing, and the the person can still kick out in just a second. On the flip side, sometimes you're caught off guard and can't even kick out at a very simple attack.Seems like when you're knocked down in this game, you stay down for a very long time. There are other flaws too. Other than all that, it's still the same WWE formula we all know. I don't need to list all the good stuff to convince you. It's definitely worth playing. I got this on black friday for $25. I would never spend anything over $35 (new) for this game. It's just not worth it.Unfortunately, these WWE games are losing their value. It's becoming more of a Call of Duty thing where it's the same thing shoved down our throats every year (although WWE 13 has some of the best improvements of any wrestling game).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Entertaining, but repetitive and buggy","reviewText":"Having played the original Dead Space on Xbox 360, I knew I had to play this, if only to fill-in the back story. In terms of story, this game delivers. The characters are well-defined and have a lot of personality. I enjoyed the voice-acting and thought some of the odd twists thrown into the story were interesting. This type of game is similar to interacting with a live movie -- there are no cutscenes; everything happens as you are playing.The game's graphics are good for Wii, but keep in mind that this is a on-rails shooter, which means you can't choose where to go (although sometimes you can choose your next path), so nothing in the game is really rendered in 3D. At times I feel like this game is a full-motion-video game -- the graphics could have been rendered and filmed on a PC and then downgraded to video for the Wii. The characters' animations are clearly 2-dimensional, jagged, and not fluid. This is not A++ CGI.However, if you played the first Dead Space, you'll enjoy visiting the same areas presented in that game. The sounds, animations, and ambiance is exactly the same. Playing this will make you want to play the original.The controls are tight. The motion controls are very accurate, and the cursors do not \"jump\" as they sometimes do in other Wii titles. I really feel like I'm in control while playing this game. I often forget that I can shake the Wiimote for light in dark places, however, although the game does remind you occasionally to do that. It's sometimes hard to line-up shots on distant objects, but you can turn on a feature that makes the reticle \"red\" when you are over something such as a target or a pick-up item.One thing about the controls -- it's really difficult to hold the Wiimote twisted 90-degrees for extended periods of time. This is not just a natural position. This is used to enable the secondary firing mode for the weapons. I would have preferred a different way of engaging these modes.I thought the camera work was really good, and the camera shake never bothered me.This is a really easy game to play unfortunately. Most of the weapons are over-powered for the types of enemies you usually encounter. More advanced weapons, such as the line gun, will take out a bunch of enemies in one shot. The rivet gun, surprisingly, is quite effective in most cases, and since it never runs out of ammo -- I found myself using it most of the time. The bosses are not particularly difficult, and once you figure out the mechanic for defeating them, you can usually disperse with them really quickly.The spaces however, even the more \"open\" rooms where you will encounter the bosses, just seem small and claustrophobic.I thought the game was particularly buggy. It's important to note that you can't save your progress within a level, and the game only automatically saves at the end of a level. Since you don't know how long a level is or how long it's going to take to complete it, it can be extremely frustrating if you need to stop playing or the game crashes. The game crashed twice on me. The screen froze, and I had to reset the console. On one level, I was literally 2 minutes from the end of the level when the game crashed -- but I had to replay the entire level again, losing 30 minutes of progress. A different level crashed in the middle, but I still lost about 20 minutes of progress. It seems in both instances, the crash occurred during the transition from \"video\" to \"gameplay\". The game also causes my Wii's drive to chatter constantly, so it's obviously pulling a lot of data off the disc in real-time. Video segments were sometimes choppy, with low framerates or stuttering audio.From a replay perspective, I wouldn't replay this game. It's a good experience, and I think anybody who played the original Dead Space should play this if they have a Wii. It's fun and has a great story, but it's really repetitive and not entirely challenging. Although you could play on higher difficulties, there's no reward system for doing do. Nobody cares (or knows) if you play on \"normal\" or \"impossible\". The gameplay gets quite repetitive by the time you're 50-60% done.If it weren't for the story, it would just barely hold my interest as a shooter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}

Red Army troops are pouring across the borders of Mexico and Canada shortly after a nuclear missile is unleashed on Washington D.C. Chaos sets in when breaking news informs Americans that their President has been killed and the Russians have invaded the country.Players take on the role of a blue-collar worker who evolves into a charismatic and fearless freedom fighter obsessed with finding and freeing his brother, who has been taken hostage along with other New Yorkers by the Soviets. You must recruit and lead an army of urban guerillas to take on the Soviet threat in the streets of New York City.Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Islandprovides two layers of gameplay: A strategic turn-based mode that centers on base operations in an underground sewer system and an action mode that unfolds in the streets where fierce battles are won or lost and resources are captured.","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"One of the Best Games of 2003!!!","reviewText":"There are few games that I'd use the term &quot;great&quot; while describing them. Freedom Fighters is such a game. Though released to critical acclaim in the fall of 2003, the game became a &quot;sleeper&quot; with higher profile titles being released around the same time. That critical acclaim was well deserved, because this is one game that has managed to surpass every one of my expectations.Freedom Fighters takes place in what is described as an &quot;alternate reality&quot;. In this timeline, the Soviet Union was the first to develop the Atom Bomb and bring and end to World War II. The game is prefaced by a brief rundown of events leading up to the present day. When the game begins, you find the game's hero, a New York plumber by the name of Chris Stone, is going about his daily route. When he and his brother stop to fix a clogged sink of a prominent anti-Soviet activist, he finds himself smack in the middle of the Red Army invasion. He's then thrust into the role of guerilla fighter.The gameplay is what makes Freedom Fighters such an outstanding game. The game is a third person shooter. As you progress in the game and accomplish certain objectives, you gain &quot;Charisma Points&quot; which elevates your status eventually to where you can command fellow soldiers. You can recruit and command up to twelve freedom fighters with a very basic command interface, using the controller buttons, that works surprisingly well. Your troops will take cover and fight independantly when they need to, so you won't have to worry about them getting picked off one by one. The enemy A.I. is also very sophisticated. The Red Army will fight just as fiercely as your troops and will often try to pull and &quot;end around&quot;, trying to sneak up on you and take you by surprise. The only thing that I didn't like about the controls was the precise aiming. It tended to be a bit of a pain to hold down the L3 button. The gameplay is structured so that whatever you accomplish in one mission ultimately affects another. For instance, if you blow up a helipad there will be no attack helicopters in another level. There is also an off-line multiplayer mode, which players engage in split screen action and co-op mode.The graphics on this game are excellent, while other games may boast more photo realistic character models, the emphasis here placed on making the player feel like he was actually fighting on the streets of New York. Streets, street lights, snow, and even elevated train platforms have a very &quot;New York&quot; feel to them. One of the more intersting graphical features is what's called &quot;rag doll&quot; physics. When a parked car explodes it sends whoever is standing next to it flying into the air. Which makes for some pretty cool visuals. The sounds are also exceptional. Soldiers speak Russian, explosions rock the dual shock controller, tanks rumble through the streets. This game sounds as great as it looks and plays.The story is moved along through the use of fake newscasts from the Soviet Armed Forces Network. This is a technique that was used in another game, Splinter Cell, earlier in 2003. But here the newscasts do a much better job at moving the story along. The obvious difference is that in Splinter Cell, the hero was operation covertly, but the newscasts did little to shed any light on the story and often felt like they were not interwoven into the fabric of the game. Here the newsbroadcasts feel like they are part of the game and help to immerse you further into the game.Freedom Fighters is without a doubt one of the best games of 2003. If you're not playing it, you're really missing out on one of those really special games that makes you glad you own a Playstation 2. I HIGHLY recomend this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2004"}

Buy this game.The slightly longer version.South Park for almost 20 years has been a consistent purveyor of pop culture since it first aired. Offering up a dose of comedy via cardboard cut out cartoon characters that have found a way to tackle every issue imaginable in a funny and sometimes perverse way without overreaching it's boundaries of leaning one way or another to poke fun at both sides.Since that time there have been many video games that have tried to capture the essence of the show to allow fans another way to connect, and each one has failed miserably being nothing more then a cheap nod to the show we've come to love. Until now.South Park: The Stick of Truth has managed to pull off the miracle of presenting a game so rich in South Park lore that at times you will forget you are playing a game and truly feel like you are part of an episode which is exactly what Trey and Matt had wanted from the get go. Every aspect of the games artistic design screams classic South Park and there is not one point in the game where you are taken out of that experience. It's the little things that matter.The amount of nods to past episodes is going to please even the most die hard fan and will still provide hours of entertainment to anyone who is just along for the ride to watch someone else play the game for the sheer comedy value it provides.Gameplay wise this is a standard meat and potatoes turned based RPG game on the surface that allows you to rank up your character and last about 14 hours give or take. The most pointed reference I can give you as to how this plays out are two games - Earthbound and Paper Mario. If you were to combine those two games but make it all based in a South Park universe I think that pretty much hits as close to the mark as you are going to get as to how it all works.There are four classes to choose to from you can be a Fighter, a Mage, a Thief, or a Jew. The latter providing some additional comedy jabs from Cartman for obvious reasons if you are a fan of the show.For those who are looking for a long deep RPG though you may want to look elsewhere and know what you are getting here. South Park: The Stick of Truth never tries to extend it's hand past the point of being what it was intended to be - a light RPG geared towards a hardcore fan base of the show knowing that not everyone who plays games plays RPGs but also trying to carefully balance itself for those who are hardcore gamers that will get some occasional laughs at it's nod to the genre.It is simply a great ride that provides hours and hours of entertainment for anyone who has been a life long fan of the show by doing exactly what it was set out to do, entertain you and make you double over in laughter by providing the ultimate South Park experience.Excellent job Matt, Trey and the entire Ubisoft team for finally giving the fan service we deserve and doing it right!

But it is depressingly sad to watch it do so in this condition.KANE IN DISNEYLAND?The graphics are laughable. True, EA has been steering the C&C; franchise towards the ...cartoon direction ever since the RED ALERT 3 installment. But the RED ALERT series had always been more playful. Even so, what was barely palatable for a RED ALERT game is outright insulting for a TIBERIUM one.If his tanks could still run-over infantry units, have no doubt, he would hunt down whoever did this to him.Because, you cannot mock Kane and avoid having your lungs infused with Tiberium fumes!MORE UNITS? PLEASE WAIT BEHIND THE YELLOW LINE. FOREVER.One of the most annoying features of the new C&C4; is the units cap. You cannot produce more units above a (very low) number. Upgrading your tech-tree with such a unit cap in place means you have to kill and replace most of your units - and make painful decisions as some units are more equal than others. It feels like having to deal with a (small) Diablo-like inventory: whatever does not fit within the grid must be left behind to rot.And to add insult to injury, extra units are bestowed with a dropper. A tiny one.This cap reeks of one thing: an attempt to turn this series into a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (fewer units means less lag). And no one seems to care that this took away one of the most fun tactics in a C&C; game: tank rushing.SORRY, ALL OF OUR TIBERIUM-HARVESTERS HAVE BEEN RECALLED. WOULD YOU CARE FOR A SENSIBLE COMPACT?A COMMAND & CONQUER game without harvesting? It could be an RTS game of any name (and there have been baseless RTS games before), why did it have to be a C&C; game? Because, once again, EA proves to have no respect for this beautiful art-form. If it means exploiting a classic title in its swan song to sell a few more units, so be it.Moreover, game publishers seem to have an ever declining expectation of their targeted customer IQ. Hence the ever simplified games released. So, yes, this feels like C&C-for-Dummies.;BATTLEFIELD CONTROLS OFFLINE? YOU'RE SCREWED COMMANDER!Yes, this must be the most inconvenient DRM scheme ever.If you hate STEAM for requiring endless updates, this is worse.If you hate games that require online activation because they never actually become yours, yes, this is worse.And if you hate games that come with Limited Activations and become worthless the moment you pop the box, well yes, this is worse.This inconceivable scheme demands for the owner of this game to always be online to verify that the copy he payed for is legitimate. That's right, not just activation, ALWAYS ONLINE. Yes, even for a single player game.Will it deter piracy? No, pirates will be playing the game without all those DRM hassles. Legitimate gamers are left complaining - and, once more, EA will turn a deaf ear.All in all, C&C4; will not appeal neither to old friends of the series nor younger gamers. And (for as long as it will keep working), it will have you jumping through hoops for the privilege of having ...bought it. And I thought it was the other way around.This Tiberium field has been depleted long ago.Move along Commanders.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SVGW8","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Classic Fun - Great for Multiplayer","reviewText":"A return to classic Kirby gameplay, \"Kirby's Return to Dreamland\" should make any fan of the series happy with its cooperative-centric gameplay.The Kirby series is a side-scrolling platformer based on a simple principle: Kirby is a little pink puffball with the power to vacuum enemies into his mouth. If he eats them, he gains their power. \"Kirby's Return to Dreamland\" doesn't differentiate from this model in that respect. In fact, in most respects it's intentionally designed to be like previous Kirby games, most notably Kirby Super Star. The game's main new content is its four-player mode, where the other three players can either play as Kirbies of their own (with different colors, naturally), or special characters King Dedede, Meta-Knight, or Waddle Dee.The powers in Kirby are naturally one of the main attractions. Powers in \"Return to Dreamland\" work like they did in Kirby Super Star: rather than \"one power = one ability\", each power you get represents a larger moveset. If Kirby swallows a fire enemy, he'll get the fire power, which includes breathing fire, turning into a fireball, and so on. While many of the powers are reused from older games, there are a few new ones, such as \"Leaf\", \"Water\", and \"Whip\" for players to experiment with. Special characters cannot absorb powers, but have their own sets of combat abilities. King Dedede has a hammer, Meta-Knight has a sword and flight powers, and Waddle Dee carries a spear. Their abilities are not necessarily unique, and they can't switch like the Kirbies can, but they also can't lose their powers like Kirby either.The game's levels are diverse and interesting, with lots of little gimmicks and gameplay changes to keep players on their toes. In some spots the game is honestly harder in co-op, because there's so much going on the screen and things are so frantic - yet that, in some cases, is the appeal of playing co-op in the first place. There's also two unlockable mini-games, a shooting game and a darts-style shuriken game. The shooting game is kind of boring, but the shuriken game was lots of fun with multiple people.Overall, \"Kirby's Return to Dreamland\" was a great return to form for the series. It includes all the elements that people liked about older games while making good use of the Wii's capabilities and four-player options. Anyone who liked the older games, or anyone who can get four people together to play, owes it to themselves to get this game.Rating: 9/10We purchased this game with our own funds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}

TimeShift is just as good as those games and perhaps even exceeds them in some respects...It takes a little getting used to initially and until you get your time-warping super powers, it's purely a shoot-em up show.  In a way I think this was probably BY DESIGN.  First you get to go through the \"normal\" experience usually associated with a shooter...Then the developers take you to a \"hole nother level\" by giving you the power to pause, slow down or reverse time (your choice) to battle your way through the rest of the game.

Finish this game and you'll really get your money's worth!Want some specific reasons why this game is so much FUN?1) You can carry more than one primary weapon (actually 3) and choose what you want to use when you need it.  I still don't understand why some SHOOTER game developers stick to only ONE primary weapon...I mean, it IS a shooter game so give the player some things to shoot with why don't you?2) The graphics are just plain out wicked GOOD!  For example, there's a scene in the Munitions Factory when you're searching for the core and there are enemy soldiers being \"manufactured\", complete with LASERS being used in the process...It's just DAZZLING to stand there and watch.  It's like being on a factory tour inside a video game!  I appreciate such attention to detail when something like this could've just been glossed over.  Again, BRAVO SIERRA!3) The controls are just so natural and once you get used to the time shifting controls and how to use them in conjunction with your primary weapons, you are a force to be reckoned with!  Unlike Kill Zone 2, these controls were well thought out and TESTED before this game went to market.4) Not much else matters if gameplay sucks...But TimeShift just has EXTRAORDINARY GAMEPLAY overflowing!  There are puzzles to break the monotony of just always shooting.  The AI is pretty good ON BOTH SIDES...The enemies will take you out if you're sloppy and your buddies are pretty good at taking them out.  This is really HOW IT SHOULD BE!  There are BOSS battles that are pretty challenging.  But like most games, if you choose the wrong weapon or wrong course of action, then you're DEAD MEAT.  There's a variety of scenery, for example, going from New York City to Alaska.  The voices are good and the storyline falls a couple of steps shy of \"compelling\"...But it's UNIQUE and easy enough to follow with help from the cut scenes.  The music is really good and there's one song that sounds like it's straight off the Orange Box soundtrack.  Ammo is PLENTIFUL and all of these things just come together so well in the finished product that you simply have to PLAY IT to BELIEVE IT!Like I said before, I'm pretty tough on game reviews so I'll throw out a few slight flaws in TimeShift.  First, once you acquire the Thunderbolt, you basically become UNTOUCHABLE for the rest of the game.  Defeating enemies becomes almost mundane with this exploding crossbow weapon.  You can't pin them to the wall like in Half-Life 2...But if you have Blood & Gore turned ON, then you can zoom in and watch your helpless victims literally EXPLODE right before your eyes...Including decapitations and limbs flying everywhere.  Just a DEVASTATING WEAPON when used with your time shifting powers.  Perhaps TOO devastating.  But this is really a minor \"flaw\", since you'll actually need this weapon's full power in some battles.Obviously I'm having trouble finding true flaws with this game.  But there were 2 glitches that did occur.  Twice the sound went out approx 25% through the game.  Easy enough to save and reboot the PS3, but a glitch nonetheless.  Near the end I also received a couple of messages indicating my hard drive was FULL and there was a problem \"saving user data\"...Well, my hard drive wasn't full and the data was saved anyway.  But those inconveniences are in no way \"deal breakers\" and they went away as quickly as they appeared.  Near the end some weird stuff happened that I guess was by design.  The cut scenes were like \"flashbacks\" that were quick and odd.  Also, you'd sometimes \"wake up\" and be doing something like manning a gun in the middle of a high speed pursuit...But there's not much time to question why since you'd soon get your head blown off.I'm just AMAZED that TimeShift has sort of slipped under the radar when it is such a COMPLETE GAME!  So, if you love shooters, then do yourself a solid one and get TimeShift...You'll thank yourself later, or maybe earlier if you reverse time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2009"}

Roman","summary":"The fun got unleashed and never came back.","reviewText":"My Star Wars geek days are long gone, so this review isn't from someone who praises anything with Stormtroopers or references to the original trilogy. To be blunt, The Force Unleashed 2 is one of the most boring games I've played in the last 5 years. You'd think that with a game like this, one about a Jedi/Sith who uses the Force in ways that we never saw in any of the movies, there'd be tons of fun. All I see here is a God of War clone with Star Wars characters tacked onto it. And as someone who didn't care much for God of War 3, that's not a good thing. The Force Unleashed 2 can be summed up best as this: push square a lot, Force Push, Force Push, square, Force Push, cutscene, square some more, cutscene, QTE event where Starkiller does most of the work for you after you press just two buttons, repeat. There's nothing I liked about this game, and the only reason I went on as long as I did was to get some easy trophies. I won't lie. But even then, I feel dirty knowing that this thing will show up on my PSN account.If you didn't play the first game, go do so because it was a little better than this one. But after the events of the first Force Unleashed, Starkiller died, but it turns out that Vader made a bunch of clones of him in case he died, or wanted to have a perfect apprentice. You play as one of those clones, complete with memories from the first game, and tons of Force powers. Granted, you can only really do a few- Force Push, Force Lightning, Force Grip and some other standard fare like throwing your lightsabers (is this even really a 'power'?), air-dashes and more. But Starkiller doesn't want to obey Vader, and breaks out of the cloning room on Kamino, and goes off to discover his identity and find out where his love interest, Juno Eclipse, is. You'll go from level to level, trashing the Empire's troops and ships, and be bored in the process over the span of roughly 6 hours.Yes, this game can be completed in 6 hours or less. The funny thing is that God of War 3 was the same way, which is just one of the many similarities the two games have. I never thought I'd be defending GoW3, but I have to say, that game was certainly better than this, even with its laughable \"REVENGE!\" lines every 20 minutes. Starkiller's clone is a pretty boring protagonist, and doesn't do nearly as many interesting things or have as many good fights as he did in the first game. The whole game feels rushed, and I knew things were only going to be going downhill after the first 5 minutes when Darth Vader appeared and has one of the worst James Earl Jones impressions ever. I would've taken will.i.am, complete with auto-tune, over this guy. Combat got repetitive fast, and I was using the same two combos over and over to take out most of the enemies in the first few levels and the last ones. A giant ship or walker's launching missiles at you? Deflect them with your lightsaber, as stupid as that might sound. A big armored droid with a shield giving you trouble? Use the Force to take off his shield, hit him with it, then hit him over and over until a QTE pops up where you'll press X, square, and then watch as Starkiller does a 5 second combo all by himself and takes out the droid. You'll fight a lot of these droids, and it's always the same combo. In an action game, the combat should never be boring, and it shouldn't get so bad to the point where I'm praying that I can just Force Push one of these things off a ledge so I can save some time and move on to the next area. There wasn't any challenge with the enemies or bosses. In fact, just like in GoW3, I had more problems with platforming and being able to tell if I was going to make a jump or not. On the harder difficulties, I was already used to playing the game so that the 'improved AI' and more damage didn't affect gameplay much. Heck, you might as well set it to Hard right from the get-go since Normal's so easy. And for anyone wondering about the other God of War similarities, you can click both analog sticks in to go into this crazy attack mode and dish out tons more damage (you'll rarely use this, trust me), there are falling stages just like GoW3's, and the QTEs try so hard to be cool but fall flat each and every time. Again, don't think I loved GoW3 by any means, as I gave it a 3 out of 5, but at least the presentation there worked for its theme. With a Star Wars game, a lot of what's here felt out of place.I didn't care about the story one bit, and the funny thing is that there's not really any option in going light or dark side until the end, where you can pick one of two options and get either a light or dark ending. Both endings are pretty lame, and I felt ripped off by the story in the end. TFU2 doesn't have much going for it unless you're a die-hard Star Wars fan. It has fairly good graphics, though some of the character models in cutscenes look really weird. The music is the same Star Wars-esque stuff any other SW game gets, and is hardly memorable. There's some DLC for the game now, which adds a tiny bit of time to the 6 hours it takes to beat, but even then, you have to pay for that separately. I can't believe this thing is still selling for full price most of the time, and that anyone bothered with what's easily the worst collector's edition of a game this console generation. If you're really curious about this game, just borrow it from someone who was already suckered into buying it. For the trophy hunters out there, there are a lot of easy ones to get with this game, but your time is best spent elsewhere.So why the 2 out of 5 if I hated so much about it? Well, the game got so boring for me that it came to a point where I was laughing at how dull it was. It's like that scene near the end of The Protector with Tony Jaa, where more and more thugs are sent to beat him up, eventhough he clearly goes through all of them in a matter of seconds. The same was happening here with Stormtroopers.Edit: I totally forgot to mention this, and I have no idea how- there's a game-breaking glitch towards the end of the game where you have to remove a battery from a turret. By the time you reach it, there's a 99.99999% chance it'll be destroyed by outside interference from a TIE Fighter. MANY other people have the same problem, and as a result, a lot of people still haven't been able to complete the game. Good luck with that, as there isn't even a patch to fix it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2011"}

Soatthiamroong","summary":"VERY Unforgiving, yet VERY Addictive","reviewText":"I just got the game yesterday. After about 4 hours, the only progress I made so far is just past the tutorial. And I beat Ninja Gaiden Sigma on Normal difficulty for crying out loud!!! This is the game that tutorial stage could kill you!!!This game is very unforgiving, so casual player be warned. There's no checkpoint and save point. When you die, you start at Nexus (the hub), you dropped all your souls at the place you died and reborn in soul-form, and if you die again, all the souls you dropped are lost. So, you'll most likely go through you first hours getting nowhere.But, oddly enough, the game keeps you coming back. It's strangely and highly addictive in nature for those who prepared to accept frequent deaths and be patient with it. You'll learn little by little, use less and less time in each fight, and lose less and less health each time.It's like those NES games (Ninja Gaiden, Megaman, Castlevania, etc.) that you keep dying and dying and dying and dying...and dying until you learn the patterns of enemies and traps by heart. It's frustrating, but satisfying as hell when you finally rise above the challenge.Even so, I still prefer the game to have difficulty settings or save options for single player. People pay the same money, so they should be able to enjoy the game as they feel comfortable. Developers could reward them differently rather than leaving the casual players out of the circle entirely. And it'd be better for marketing too.One flaw that I don't see the point why should this happen is that you can't pause the game in single-player. Why !?!? I know that adds realism to the game, but hey... players have to pee sometimes :PCombat feels responsive and highly TACTICAL. This is by no means a hack-and-slash game, so bashing frenzy won't do you any good here. I'd call the melee combat in this game a fencing simulation. You're no God of War. You're just a person with a sword. You stab them, they die. They stab you, you die. So, be very cautious.Graphics looks decent enough, not exactly PS3, but more like a PS2.5 game. The game looks better with low brightness, but that makes it harder to see enemies and traps. Though it's understandable that this game is not from a giant team like Square-Enix, but still, I believe they could do better with normal maps and texture details. Also, the character face looks hideous. Making the game looks Western doesn't mean they have to give up the pretty-face trend of the JRPGs. People still love looking at pretty people.Also, the physics engine is a bit weird here. Pieces are flying around low-gravity-like when props are broken. Enemy corpses are rolling along when you walk over them, and their heads are twitching as if they're listening to iPod while lying dead XDIn conclusion:I took one star off for the extreme unforgiving nature of the saving system, the lack of choice in difficulty, the no-restroom-break policy, and the less-than-impressive graphics. Other than that, the game is great.Casual player who doesn't want any frustration should avoid this game at all cost. The game has gained its reputation for being very unforgiving since its first Asian release. You've been warned, and I'm warning you again.If you can't take it easy when you die once and lose almost all your hours of progress, then DON'T listen to the hype of hardcore players. There's nothing wrong with liking easy games. Because even the greatest game of all eternity doesn't serve its purpose if it doesn't entertain you.But if you feel up to the challenge, go for it. The game WILL forge you into a real warrior. I'm not there yet. But I'm having a lot of fun dying on the way there. I'm still halfway through Uncharted 2, but all I'm wanting to play now is this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

It's got that difficult-to-define quality that keeps me interested in a game. We can talk about high production quality all day long, or about games that don't have it, but one element in a game that doesn't get mentioned much is SOUL. Or perhaps CHARACTER would be a better word. A certain artistic vision or creative tweak that makes a game shine from the inside. It has nothing to do with production quality, but rather with a unity of vision. It can redeem a game that is otherwise poorly made. Lords of Shadow has that quality. There's a spirit inside it that charms you, even when you're getting your butt kicked by a giant lycan.Not that Lords of Shadow lacks production quality: it has plenty of it. The combat system is very well done, the graphics and animations are gorgeous, the story is intriguing and the controls work beautifully. The one element in the game that, in my opinion, does not mesh with the rest is Patrick Stuart's narratives at the beginning of each level. The narratives don't make a whole lot of sense, and Patrick Stuart does a rather lackluster job of reading the lines. In fact, that's the problem: you can tell he's reading from a script. It doesn't sound like narration. He doesn't breathe any life into the lines. This was surprising, as I would have assumed he would be up to the task. But what does an uppity British actor who has done Shakespear care about the narrative for some stupid video game about werewolves? Apparently not much. And I wouldn't want to be the voice director that has to tell such a distinguished actor that he's doing a poor job. But enough of that drivel.Lords of Shadow borrows from games like God of War and Dante's Inferno, but it does it very well and adds its own unique style to the sub-genre, which keeps the player from having that \"been there done that\" feeling. Whereas Dante's Inferno was an uninspired, frustrating mess, Lords of Shadow is a thing of grace and beauty that you appreciate even when you're getting the snot beat out of you. There was actually one point in the game where, to all appearances, Gabriel does something very bad, and a very angry creature intends to make him pay for it. I actually sided with the angry creature and was hoping he would beat the living snot out of Gabriel. I just sat there and let the dude wail on me because I felt it was completely justified. How many games can you think of that allow you to identify with the enemy so profoundly? I felt sorry for this dude, and I wanted him to kick my butt, but alas, the game didn't allow me to take that route. This is just one of the game's subtle ways of showing the player that not all is as it seems. This isn't just a simple quest of revenge and rescue. There are deeper, more complicated forces at work here.You can get Lords of Shadow pretty cheap now, so there's absolutely no reason not to buy it. I give it a big thumbs up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

It has a very Indiana Jones/National Treasure kind of feel to it. The scenery is beautiful, with everything being something you can climb up or jump from.While the shooting of guns in the game is not the same as in a typical war simulation game (i.e. Call of Duty), they have made the scenes where shooting is part of the mission, play very well and is a lot of fun.Some missions are far more challenging than others. There were a few that definitely took me some time to complete, and others that I could get through on the first try. It's a nice mix of missions, without anything ever getting too repetitive.There are tons of hidden things to collect in this game, so even after you have completed the storyline, it will take you several more run throughs of the game to find them all.Definitely a must have game for the PS3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2011"}

It has a nostalgic feel of the old SNES mario games but with extra things such as the helicopter hat and co-op etc. After playing a few levels I found that it did start to get a bit more difficult over time and that it would be much more fun with co-op. Unfortunately not having any good friends around to play it with me kinda makes the game less interesting.

Only on the Wii I can play many games with my wife.  She uses it a lot more than I do.  We primarily use the Wii to play casual games together.  The graphics don't measure up at all to XBox 360 or Playstation 3, but can still be plenty of fun for games where graphics are not important.I use the Wii for Wii Sports, Wii Fit, Boom Blox, Mario Party, etc.  I find myself using the Wii less and less and my XBox 360 much more now since I more often want to play some deeper, more graphically intensive games.  There far fewer Wii games I am interested than those for other consoles, but the other consoles do not yet have the unique casual game experience that my wife and friends are excited to play.I still recommend and like the Wii, but it isn't trying to compete with Xbox 360 or Playstation 3 which are entirely different kinds of gaming experiences.  You either want to play some of the casual games with motion controls or you don't.  If you aren't a big fan of Wii Sports, then there is probably little reason to buy a Wii.Adult friends and family have bought the Wii that would have never bought or played games anymore.  So it definitely has opened games up to them again.  However most of them have significantly decreased their usage of the Wii after the first few months or year, haven't bought new games, or have stopped playing all-together.  So if you don't play and are wondering how long lasting it will be, you probably will not play forever.  But if you want something fun that you can do in a group setting, it is a nice option.I consider a Wii a replacement for board games.  It is fresher and more exiciting ina group setting than board games for many and can be used once in a while when you want a casual game like that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}

Despite being a little older than Grand Theft Auto 4, Fallout 3, Left4Dead, Halo 2, etc., it has at least as good (or better) graphics, sounds, game design, and story line as the best of them, plus better in-game help and maps and other features that would take too long to describe. This is a must-have.Update:I have now played it 3 times and it was equally fun each time because there is so much variety in how you can do things. In most other shooter games, you are pretty limited in which weapons you have to use to take down a big foe (such as a charging Super Mutant in Fallout 3). But in Bioshock, there are numerous weapons and strategies you can try to kill a tough enemy such as a Big Daddy or one of the Bosses. So if you die, you don't have to just keep trying the same approach until you get lucky, and when you replay, ditto.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2009"}

Then BAMN!  4 hours into it, you fall into the \"broken recored syndrome\". Everything begins repeating itself and the games' flaws start to surface.The Good-Graphics, no pop in what so ever and a very loooooooooong drawl distance, impressive.  Small particals float in the air in dusty rooms.-Climbing buildings seems oddly natural, and ofcourse, the time period and setting are very nicely done.-Voice work is well done.  Dark and foreboding.-Actually got horse riding in a game where it's fun and looks natural.The Bad-Character movements are a mixed bag.  Climbing and jumping looks good, but fighting and dialogue scenes seem choppy and look very unnatural.-Why must i climb all the freakin look outs to continue with missions?  Climbing aspect of the game is fun when you don't have to do it, but sucks when you constantly do.-Characters movements almost seem to slow.  There were countless times when i was running from the enemy trying to escape to the rooftops when my character seemed to slow going up the side of a house, or got stuck at an awkward place, giving the enemy time to shoot arrows or throw rocks to knock me down.  Kind of annoying.The Ugly-Why at the beginning of every mission do i have to run through an entire level to get to a horse?-Lack of variety-There is a certain surprise in the game that you find out shortly after playing, this actually took away from the experience i thought.  Why couldn't the game just be what the trailers made it out to be???If this was out of ten i would give assissins creed a 7 out of 10.  By no means is this game crap, you can tell many talented people spent long hours on this, so many things are done right it's a shame that crucial areas were over looked, like keeping the gamer interested, switching up the missions, throwing in a boss fight or two to give you a sense of progress.

The game features an excellent storyline with the top notch acting we have come to expect. The characters are all deep and well written. If you enjoy spending hours listening to dialogue and immerse background you'll be right at home. It's one of the best story lines in recent games. Unfortunately the game play and graphics are not up to par. The environments and cut scenes are not very polished. The character models look good but beyond that the graphics fall short. The combat gameplay is this games true shortcoming. The games nearly impossible on higher difficulties and barely beatable on normal. The reason for this is that in many areas you are swarmed with enemies. The tactics and way the skills are set up don't seem to work very well. Eventually you will get a grasp on it but the system isn't real good. My biggest complaint is that you cant create a tactic to revive characters on the console so you will need to micromanage your team a lot. The game allows for friendly fire and the way enemies swarm you in most areas it renders most of your mages spells to uselessness. Many spells require a cool down time and many times within seconds your team can be wiped out. Healing items are also scarce at merchants so this may make many players play on the easy setting which is no challenge at all. The story and sidequests and character background are the reason to play the game There are multiple beginnings endings and choices to be made. You can even have some PG romance along the way. If your not careful you can lose party members based on choices you make. Despite the weak combat I still recommend the game simply because the story is excellent and each choice affects the outcomes and ways characters interact with you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"Flippin' Awesome!","reviewText":"Super Paper Mario, like the Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess, was originally a Gamecube game that was moved on over to the Wii. Still, it's definitely a game we've been waiting for and definitely a game worth getting a hold of. Simply put, this is one of the games Wii owners ought to want.The storyline in Super Paper Mario isn't really anything special, but it's certainly one to honor for its fine script and clever writing. An evil magician named Count Bleck plans on taking over the world, and as Mario you'll need to stop him by finding the pieces of the purity heart that'll allow you to do so. In truth, the storyline is actually really crazy, but I'd rather not give too much away. It's actually a really enjoyable story Mario fans will love in the long run.The game is very dialogue heavy but at least its creative. Much of it is very humorous and will have you laughing quite a bit. But when I say dialog heavy, I'm not kidding. You'll be mashing on the 2 button a lot. It wouldn't be so bad if characters didn't go on to explain such things that were useless.Super Paper Mario is truly something remarkable in terms of its gameplay. It mixes Platforming and RPG elements. There's still a need to level up and Mario has his set of HP but all the way, this is a platformer. It plays very similar to Super Mario Brothers on the NES. However, a slight problem with this kind of gameplay, is that those who were really addicted to side scrolling Mario games and were used to holding down a button to run will be surprised to learn there is no button to run! It's no big deal, but if you're feeling nostalgic (as you probably will playing this game) it's actually something long time Mario fans may have to get used to, especially because Mario doesn't move very fast.During the game you can press the A button and flip the screen from the 2D world to the 3D world any time you want. Most of the time you'll be playing the game in the 2D realm, but there's plenty to be done in 3D too. It's a necessity to getting past some of the games puzzles. If you're ever stuck on puzzle just try flipping. It's also used to get past environmental objects. If a pipe is too tall for Mario to jump over, for example, then you can switch the game to the 3D view and simply walk around it. You can't stay in 3D forever. If you stay in 3D for too long Mario will take damage.The problem with the gameplay is that the game is far too easy. Most enemies are easily dispatched and don't do much damage to you anyway. Even boss battles are of little challenge. The boss fights are fun, at least, requiring you to fight them in interesting ways, but they're still on the easy side. If you're an expert gamer, I don't predict you'll die anytime soon throughout your adventure.Mario also isn't alone. He'll be joined by Peach, Luigi and Bowser throughout his travels, and each of them has an ability they can do. Peach can float, Luigi has a high jump and Bowser can spit fire. You can switch between them at any time, and there are moments when you'll actually need a certain character to do things. However, the game relies heavily on the mechanic of going from 2D to 3D and only Mario can actually do this. Despite that you've got other characters, you'll still play through most of the game as Mario.Throughout your adventures you'll also collect Pixls. Little fairy like creatures that give Mario and company other abilities he can use. For example, early on in the game he meets a pixl that allows him to grab enemies and other objects and throw them. There are plenty of other powers. Needless to say, Super Paper Mario is filled with secrets.The wii remote works well with this game. As noted you'll hold it like an NES controller and play the game in basically the same style you played the original Super Mario Brothers. The Wii controls, however, feel a little tacked on. You can point the remote to search for hidden doors or scan enemies. You can also shake when you jump off an enemy to get more points. The wii remote doesn't have a big impact on the gameplay, though.Visually, of course, the game looks like a late generation Gamecube game. However, the games unique style alone warrants its beauty. The 2D landscape is far better looking than the 3D landscape, though. The 2D backgrounds are beautiful, and the background environments really shower a lot of detail. 3D doesn't look as good, though because it's just not as pretty and filled with life.  Most of the level designs themselves are also pretty plain. As far as platforming goes, there's nothing too intuitively designed either. The levels also aren't filled to the brim with enemies. There's a lot of jumping, but not a lot of obstacles in your way.The game also sounds really good. There's no voice acting to speak of, really. Which sucks for a game as text heavy as this, but most gamers who've been gaming for well over a decade probably won't care about this, anyway.On the whole, Super Paper Mario is a must own title for the Wii.

Not only is it more comfortable than the dualshock, but its also wireless AND it still works just as precisly as it did when i first took it out of the package. No joke. My only stipulation is that this D-pad may not be as effecient as the regular d-pad when it comes to fighting games, but thats very subjective. If your ps2 is still running strong, buy this NOW.

Berntsen","summary":"Promising controller, but the buttons are crap!","reviewText":"A few years ago, when I had just recently gotten a PS2, I was super pumped when I got this controller. It was getting great reviews, I found it to be more comfortable than the official Sony controllers, and mine was working flawlessly-- for a few months. The rubber contacts on the buttons are made out of some ridiculously cheap rubber that even the Chinese knockoff makers would probably laugh at, and it was not long before my X button started sticking when it was depressed. For fighting games like Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deception, you NEED lightning fast response from the buttons. One sticky button completely ruins this controller, and eventually all of them will wear out due to the terrible material Logitech uses.I actually considered picking up a Logitech wireless PS3 controller at one point since it uses the same form factor, and hoping that Logitech finally learned their lesson about the crappy material, I figured it would be easy to swap out the rubber contacts from the PS3 controller to restore my PS2 controller better-than-new. However, I learned ahead of time that Logitech uses the same crappy material in the PS3 controllers, and the buttons wear out just as quickly! I will probably never buy a Logitech controller again. My official PS2 controllers still work just fine after many years of making Jak and Daxter jump platforms and doing kombos and fatalities in Mortal Kombat, and that durability is worth putting up with wires for. Logitech's terrible neglect for quality materials ruined what would have otherwise been the ultimate controller for PS2 owners.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2011"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

Borderlands is a polish, well-designer RPG/FPS hybrid with a unique art style.  I was expecting to have a great gameplay experience when I fired up Borderlands, but I wasn't expecting my girlfriend to want in on the action.It's hard to say what did it exactly, but I think it was a combination of things.  My fiancee likes to play games, but typically sticks to stuff likePuzzle Quest: Challenge of the WarlordsandProfessor Layton and the Curious Village.  \"Hardcore\" games like Borderlands are typically too difficult for her, and just become a frustrating experience.  I think I can boil her interest down to three major components: art style, cooperation, and progression.The art style of Borderlands really appealed to her, and she constantly commented about how cool everything looked.  This shouldn't be a big surprise, the art style of Borderlands is very highly regarded.  Moving onto actual gameplay, she loves games that we can play together.  Any game with a local coop mode scores big points in her book.  In addition to this, the RPG elements of Borderlands turned out to be key to our enjoyment of the game.  If she was having difficulty with an area, then we'd just level up a bit in order to power up our characters and make things a little easier for her.  This didn't happen too often, but there were a few points in the game where it prevented major frustration.All in all I had a great experience with Borderlands.  If you have a significant other right on the edge of being a \"core gamer\", then Borderlands may be able to pull them over - if only just for a while.  Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}

The first time I just figured it was self explanatory, because it seemed like the tutorial and game itself was for small children. I was wrong.__________________________________________________________________________________________________What to do to start enjoying Walk it Out:The first tip I'd give is to go into settings, and adjust the miss penalty to none. With the factory settings you are penalized for missing a beat.Secondly, wait until you get enough points to buy something. For instance, if you want a palm tree, wait until you receive 100 points (upper left corner on screen), and then point to the palm tree.Third of all, always pay attention to stepping to the beat as indicated on the top left side of your screen.Once you understand these basics, the game and exercise routine should be a lot more fun.After this beginners routine, you'll realize that you can pre-purchase (the lower portion of the orange circle will be green once you've gained enough money on your pre-purchased items to purchase) etc., but I'd say start with the basics to begin.

The base feel of the game hasn't changed in years.Most of what I could say has already been covered, so I'll just summarize my opinion:Pros:-I swear this edition of Call of Duty is less laggy than the last one in multiplayer...I've yet to have a \"but I shot him first!\" moment, at least not anything near as bad as the ones I had in \"Modern Warfare 2\".-There seem to be a lot more environmental effects, e.g. heat vapors, better weather, etc. This may have come at a cost (see cons)-The multiplayer weapon upgrade system is much better than in prior editions, in that now you must spend points and choose your upgrades, rather than just have everything handed to you. This seems to result in a lot more in-match weapon variety.-Rocket launchers no longer fire projectiles in a laser-beam straight line, which eliminates a lot of \"noobish\" behavior online.-From a production standpoint, they capture the atmosphere of the Cold War very well...older gamers will get a kick out of it-So far, the single player storyline is pretty cool. The inclusion and references to real life historical figures is great.-Some new toys to play with unlike anything from the prior CoD games. Plus, flamethrowers make their triumphant return.-We now have a replay mode to playback matches, which is a nice touch.-The online map voting system is FINALLY up to snuff. Players actively vote FOR maps, from multiple options (including a \"random\" option), and not simply AGAINST playing a single map. If just one player has an opinion, his/her opinion is the one that counts. Small detail, but HUGE improvement.Cons:-Graphics haven't really progressed at all...in fact sometimes they seem to have regressed very slightly in some areas, at least in multiplayer. This may have been a price the developers had to pay to get the additional effects in (see pros). You won't notice it for long though.-Sounds aren't as punchy as they were in Modern Warfare 2.-I wish that multiplayer forced era-based weapon sets. It feels weird to be fighting in a mid-Cold War battle in an Asian jungle with a laser scope that has no right to be there.-I also wish that spy planes (i.e. UAVs in the last game) and the explosive RC cars were harder to obtainAll in all, if you like Call of Duty, absolutely pick this up. The selection of mid-Cold War era weapons (e.g. the original M-16) is a refreshing change from all the WW2 and modern combat games. There are some issues that I had with the past games that they chose not to address, but those are more personal preference items.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
