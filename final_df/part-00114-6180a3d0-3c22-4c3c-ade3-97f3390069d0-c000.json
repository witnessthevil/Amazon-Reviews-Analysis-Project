{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"Wisdom","summary":"Offline Review....... See Update Scroll down","reviewText":"After a 2 full weeks with Madden,(Demo and Rented Retail) I can finally share my experience.Pro's:Gameplay: Fun Factor, Finally. Every game is competitive and close, but of course certain teams you open up on(dominate) later on in the game or vice versa. Passing was finally focused on. Feels good to see that the WR is respected as far as route running and that the LB can't intercept every pass in the passing lane especially when beaten by the WR. Basically I can finally eat up the zone defense.Presentation: commentary during games. Not always right, but it just has that football sound. They do say your the Superbowl champions once you win. ( more on this, but as a con later)Music: Had to seperate this because I had to review this part alone, but I'm so glad that this game was just focused on Football sounds. Yes I appreciate underground music as well as known artists in games, but sometimes, just let a game be a game.IE: (yes players bend and limbs twist up at times, but realistic stuff happens now)ex. Quick toss to the right to my HB, my RG falls in my open lane after blocking the DT, I'm thinking I'm seeing daylight still, and boom, my guy stumbles and trips and I'm down. Thats what I'm talking about. Previous Maddens, that didn't happen.Connected Carrers Coach mode: I like that you can still play for like 32 seasons. It is only one team controlled, but honestly I'm not the one that needs to control 20 teams at once. Only time I controlled more than one, which was only 2, I did that to get the losing team with the number one draft pick so I could make a trade to my main team.(It was my created player lol.) I also liked to switch teams to be a different GM so I could build up other teams, but I know you can't do that on this one, no biggie for me.Connected Player mode: I like the the game face aspect and that whatever position you create, you have to earn your way up to the depth chart. If anything, I could only see myself doing offense positions, mainly the QB because you will get the most action, well RB too, but didn't try that yet.Crowd: Its louder, they react better especially to your performance.Cons:REPLAY VALUE:  As much as I love the fun factor the gameplay gives as well as the games being competitive,and that I can pass now(that's all I really wanted), the lack of presentation gets stale. Twitter feeds idea was cute but its scripted. It doesn't really focus on what you do, I mean its cool to have league news and maybe the first few tweets may mention your performance of your team in coach mode, and player in player mode, when starting, but it doesn't bulid up or seem flexible thru seasons as you progress. No mention of you defending your title, nothing talking about rivarlies or what teams are dominating. Just no real feeling to keep me interested. Yes I can try to go for records and HOF stuff, but other Maddens you can do that too. Madden 06 I believe had the news feeds for each local team as well. That would've been cool.And where is all the tickers, the buildup of playoffs, highlights about your game and other games. I'm so glad I rented it. Got my Madden itch, itched. I'm sure I will come back later on, but then again, NBA 2k13 will be here next month.Overall, yes I gave it a 4 because of the Pro's but what's lacking is that football completeness of a game. I tried that 2k5 for the first time this year, and you add that presentation in M13, then without hesitation, I would've bought the game. I like feeling like I'm in my own football world.Online for sports games, fun to play quick matches, thats it. The reviews I read were very entertaining to say the least, and I do agree that offline Co-op shouldn't have been taken out. Not that I need it, but as an offline player when it comes to sports games, I feel creators of games should respect that everyone doesn't play online all the time and that you should still keep online and offline balanced.Peace and thanks for reading-------- Sept 10th Update-------Well actually I went ahead and bought the game. I couldn't get past the gameplay and how much fun it actually is. I was more on the side of better gameplay and passing might I add, and M13 has it, so why wouldn't I buy it. I realized I was being too nit picky on a \"video game\" and yes it was because of the lack of presentation as far as highlights like key plays at half time, the twitter feed truly focusing on your Coach or player career mode, the commentary on your season as well as your progression of each seasons you play in connectted careers. I still leave my rating a 4 because of those things I just mentioned, but the game has replay value. What I learned within the last few days since my last review, the news feeds/twitter feeds actually can focus on your team. I didn't know you just have to look at the \"my stories\" section under the news feeds area. It shows top stories, my stories, and something else but I can't remember, so if you want to just enjoy reading twitter feeds about your career, just look at the my stories. Sort of like the old madden that had \"local news\" for your team. I think that was M06.So do I get lost in my own football world, on a scale of 1-10, I will give it a 4 to which my rating is still 4 overall. Twitter feeds are scripted and no matter what you do during the season, you may get that one about your previous performance, but that is it. Still no true presentation of rivarly games, or division battles, or the commentary doing simple things like comparing your last game performance. Even in year 2015, playing the Giants, they still talked about the last year's NFC game against my 49ers. So that shows you how NOt in-tune the presentation is. Even with all that, the game was still worth a purchase.Oh when playing as a player in connected careers, and WANT to start right away, choose the team that has that position at need, that way your not riding the bench for several seasons, unless you actually do the practices and pre season and earn your XP and thats the other reason why I like M13, it involves you as far as a reason to keep playing it, so that crashes that replay value comment I made earlier. Thanks for reading again----UPDATE SEPT 14TH---EA has added in player editing, Fantansy Draft and also a feature that would allow you to start right away in your connected career of choice no matter what your rating is.None of those features really bothered me when they were gone but I guess its cool to have them. Still having fun...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Siege","summary":"Austin Powers meets Devil May Cry","reviewText":"Bayonetta is one of the most interesting 3rd person action titles in a long time.  The game throws you into the role of Bayonetta, a witch with a british accent and an attitude like Austin Powers.  It is a welcome change of pace to see a female lead character.  Your character is a witch who uses her hair and lots of guns to battle wave after wave of angels.  Yes, her hair is a weapon.  Bayonetta's hair finishers remind me a little of Marvel Comics' Venom when it slides off of her to form a demonic beast.This is a game that does not take itself too seriously.  It is meant to be a litte raunchy and filled with adult language.You start with four guns, one for each hand and one for each heel. Killing angels, rewards you with halos (the in-game currency).  Collecting halos remind me strongly of collecting rings in Sonic the Hedgehog.  Later you earn new weapons to add to the fun.  Bayonetta uses all of the weapons in new and exciting ways while always keeping the over the top presentation the game is aiming for.  The gameplay is solid and different action sequences break up the flow nicely.Any one who has played previous Devil May Cry games will be right at home with Bayonetta.The graphics are good and animations are wide and varied.  However, some of the cut scenes are nothing more than a series of still images and sometimes repeat.It is the level of technical polish which holds Bayonetta back from being one of the best games on Playstation 3.  Loading screens happen quite frequently and are unbearably long.  You visit the in-game merchant, a loading screen.  Try to save, a loading screen.  Even pausing the game requires a loading screen.  Most gamers will find their patience wearing thin from all of the loading screns about half way through Bayonetta.  But, please do not miss this funny and original game because the develops got a little sloppy.If the technical presentation was up to par, then Bayonetta would get a 9 of 10.  But, thanks to the numerous loading screens, it gets an 8 of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005BJ9G","description":"Konami's Simon Belmont started hunting vampires back in 1987, and he hasn't quit yet. Now he's chasing them across the Game Boy Advance inCastlevania: Circle of the Moon. He'll use his trusty whip, as well as a few magical items, to combat Dracula and more than just a few foul minions. The game takes advantage of the GBA's rich color palette to create detailed, moody environments and intricate spell effects.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"It's not Symphony, but its almost just as good","reviewText":"Two things I hate with the Castlevania series, its refusal to allow a multi-directional whip (like they did in part 4) and when you have a lead character that does not have the last name of Belmont or Tepes (Alucard). Usually when you have a whip tottin' character without the Belmont name the game is bound to not live up to CV expectations, but then again the Castlevania series needs to be revitalized, and desperately. The gameplay has gotten stale over the years, and thier venture into 3D didn't work so well, not because it can't be done, just because it could have been a lot better. Symphony of the Night for Playstation was that revolution, and I got it late because I had my N64 well before I bought a PS1 and so I didn't find out about SOTN until much later. The formula combines the traditional CV atmosphere with gameplay elements of Super Metroid, and it worked beautifully. The same can almost be said of Circle of the moon, but COTM is not without its flaws.I had hoped that the tunes would be better, don't get me wrong they're great, but I was expecting more and was dissapointed when I booted the game up only to hear midi music. I got spoiled by the orchistrated soundtrack of SOTN, and I realize there are probably some technical limitations here to consider. I had also hoped that there would be voice acting. I know that GBA isn't exactly loud, but come on!The real problem is that the Super Metroid style Castlevania could get old fast. Its not that this isn't a good game, its great, but I'm worried that this will become a stagnate formula to these games. Konami needs to bring Castlevania back into the 3D realm, but do it right this time, it can be done. This game isn't the game revolution that its predassessor was, but it is still a lot of fun. Now that the price has been slashed if you haven't picked this one up yet do it. Lets just hope that Konami realizes that revolution is necissary to keep the games selling. This gameplay style could get stagnate. It isn't yet, but I think they could only get away with this gameplay style one more time before they need to completely revamp the style.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005ATSN","description":"One of the most highly esteemed digital adventures is back on your Game Boy Color console in two new games:Oracle of AgesandOracle of Seasons. Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.","reviewerName":"Hongster","summary":"Oracle of Ages Review","reviewText":"This is possibly one of the hardest Zelda games you will ever come across (of course Legend of Zelda and Link's Awakening are the other 2 Zelda's that are more difficult).  The game is part of a 2 part game where you will need Oracles of Season to *complete* the game (you will get a ending for beating either Oracle of Ages or Oracle of Season by itself but you will not get the best ending without having both games).  Also, unlike the pokemon series (which had Red and Blue versions which was the exact game but different pokemon included), the Oracle series are 2 completely different games.  Oracle of Ages has a lot more puzzles and requires you to think a lot more in the dungeons.  If you are not very familiar with RPG or Adventure games you will be stuck in a lot of spots (Oracle of Season is more action based and features less mind throbbing dungeons).  Overall, Oracle of Ages is a great addition to the Zelda series (though I prefer Oracle of Season simply because I played that game before this game and had a more enjoyable time playing).I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Legend of Zelda series as it is simply too good to pass.Note: This game is no longer produced and very rarely sold in Mint Condition so be prepared to pay a lot for it, otherwise be wary of used copies as this game was released around 2000 and the battery might be dying on some of the used copies.2nd Note: This game can only be played on Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Game Boy SP (Game Boy Micro and DS cannot play this game)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2008"}

Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene.

Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out?

The graphics are old, dated, and painful in the year 2011 where Dead Island and Dead Rising 2 are the dominant Zombie games. But it looks well enough to play for days and months on end. The gameplay is clunky and clumsy, but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into. The story is Sci-Fi Originals bad and in hard to understand, but that was what they were going for.Honestly, everything about the game should not work. It does alot wrong, but it does MORE right. Yes, it all meshes together into a really good game. Yes, in a few years it will be a painful to play as, say, Pitfall for the Atari, but even when it is thriteen years old it is still F-U-N to play.I played it non-stop when I had my PS1, continued to play it with my PS2, and even now, after I got an Xbox 360 and play other games, I still plug up my PS2 and play some RE2 once and awhile.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"I had to put in another 5-star review: possibly the best video game ever!","reviewText":"I have to rank this among the best video games ever made.  Yes, it is a specific kind of gameplay that take some getting used to for those not accustomed to it, but the payoff is huge: incredibly rich combat that can be affected in a thousands of ways from choices you make in regards to character creation and development, inventory management, party configuration, tactics...I could go on-- but I'm telling you it is the coolest thing ever to know and experience that bad choices made at the beginning and middle of the game, can have a huge impact on how combat goes right through to the end.  As you rack up the play-throughs, it is so satisfying to play the game more strategically, to develop your party's skills and abilities and manage your inventory with a view toward what will happen later in the game.  As you get to understand the characters, understanding how to combine their skills is like an endless puzzle that can be put together in an infinite variety of ways.In one play-through, I focused on purchasing only the very most expensive items in the game, scrimping and saving and never spending on any minor items, selling everything I could do without.  I was able to purchase a handful of truly powerful items with some massive stats.  This produced very different results than the first time I played, in which I quickly spent my money buying skill and ability \"tomes\" that allowed my character to advance more rapidly through the skill sets and stat progressions.In yet another playthrough, I challenged myself at many points to use unlikely combinations of party members: all fighters, for example, or multiple mages, or multiple rouges--- rather than a balanced party, I had fun with creating imbalance.Knowing that your success and failure in the game is almost purely mental-- that it is your intellectual choices in strategizing, planning, prioritizing, allocating resources, and making tactical decisions, is so much more satisfying than your average button-masher, where all that counts is quick reflexes and hand-eye coordination.And all that would really be something, even if it were the only dimension of the game, but on top of that, you have an amazing story, which can take so many different turns based on how you play!  The story is fully acted out, with amazing voices and real moments of drama, tension, and heartbreak.  For example, in one game I had a lesbian relationship, in another my female character had a romance with a male, in another my male character had relations with three other characters--- each of whom demanded exclusivity, and I was forced to choose between them.  In one playthrough, a particular character end up coldly betraying and trying to kill me, and in another, the same character sided with me and refused to betray me!  This \"choice\" on his part was influenced by the loyalty I created with him through dialog and finding items in the game that were meaningful to his personal story.So many things in this game can be different each time you play though, it is simply mind boggling.  In my third play, I was still hearing tons and tons of dialog I had not experienced before.  My party characters were having conversations that were related to choices I made that were completely different in one game than another.  For example, in one playthrough, Morrigan (female mage) and Sten (male fighter) had an ongoing sexual banter with each other.  This was completely absent in another playthrough!All of the above fully explains why this game is a little lacking in the graphical detail.  They simply couldn't fit it all in...there's no way to cram this much onto one disc.  That being said, the overall art direction, and the direction of the scenes and whatnot is fantastic.  It is just the textures and some of the dialogs that look a bit clumsy.Wow, I could write about this game all day long.  This is just the best.  I'm so happy that Bioware continues to push the envelope with games that go way beyond the usual shoot-em/beat-em-ups.  I'm also happy that this game is fully supported with dowloadable content and future expansion modules.  Let me say: DO get the dowloadable modules Soldiers Peak, Stone Prisoner, and Return to Osatagar-- they make a huge campaign into a true epic, and they are fairly priced.  And there's an full expansion module coming out in March 2010!  I cannot wait!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2010"}

As a First Encounter Assault Recon member, you're sent in to investigate a man named Paxton Fettel who has a taste akin to Hannibal Lector. Since you've got reflexes that are \"off the charts\" you can employ a SlowMo bullet time power to help you get the drop on enemies that will cause you great headaches. This thin premise for having superpowers also provides reason to send you in alone. As is the case in these games, things don't go smoothly once you're on your own. You quickly jump into a paranormal quest to learn what exactly led to this strange turn of events and how you can put a stop to it.The story comes to you mainly through searching through the various buildings and offices for blinking lights on phones or laptop computers. Accessing these will fill you in on some of the details, but it is entirely auditory and oftentimes you'll merely get fluff for your exploratory efforts. One of the real strengths F.E.A.R. has is that it is genuinely scary, something you won't often find even in the so-called \"survival horror\" games. Whether the scare tactic is the classic startling image quickly popping up, grotesque dismembering of unfortunate souls, or lights being played with just to mess with you, you'll find your fight or flight response at full tilt.The fantastic AI present in the PC version has made its way over to the console world intact. Enemies come in squads and react to their environment, your actions and each other. They'll advance when they have numbers, kicking over bookshelves to create their own cover along the way. Kill a couple of them and they'll pull back and call for backup. Try to hide in a corner while your SlowMo gauge refills and you'll find a grenade bouncing to your feet. On the other hand, rushing out into the open will cause the entire squad to stand up and start firing away with their automatic weaponry. This AI provides for some seriously intense battles where you'll be relying on your SlowMo reflexes in a desperate hope for survival. To fight back, you're given a nice selection of weapons that each behave differently and enable you to approach battles with the right tools for your playing style.F.E.A.R.'s multiplayer is fun and has some excellent options for tweaking the game, but it has a serious hiccup in the lobby. That being the lack of a post-game lobby. As soon as you finish a game, you'll be kicked back out to the menu screen without so much as a chance to say goodbye. This happens even on unranked matches where you are presumably playing with friends making it more than a little frustrating to get into an extended online session with some buddies.F.E.A.R. has made it from the PC to 360 with everything that made it an outstanding experience along with a few new additions including the fantastic Instant Action mode, making it hard to lodge any huge complaints against the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

Albeit this game is not as vast content-wise as some other open world games, but there's still a good amount of stuff to do.  Even though the last two chapters felt a little rushed and ended a little too abruptly, 90% of the main story line is very well done and kept me thoroughly entertained.

{"product_name":"B0085L2T14","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Not the Greatest Wrestling Title Out There","reviewText":"I don't understand why people are saying that WWE '13 is the greatest WWE title to date.  It's not.  Now, I haven't played WWE '12, and a lot of people are saying that '13 is an improvement over that game, but I just can't agree that it's an exceptional wrestling title.For one thing, what's up with the roster?  Where are the real legends like Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant, Sgt. Slaughter, Mr. Perfect, etc.?  There are some really notable exclusions from the game.  The Attitude Era campaign is fairly decent, as it brings back great memories from when I really used to watching wrestling (throughout the 1990's).  My only gripe with the campaign is that some of those historical objectives are next to impossible to complete (i.e. hitting the ref with a title belt in time before he wakes up).  Completing those objectives are critical to unlocking extra features (wrestlers, matches, arenas, etc.).  When you can't accomplish those objectives, things get uber frustrating.  I guess it's a good thing that the WWE Shop has a fan axxess pass that you can purchase to unlock all the wrestlers, but still...you gotta pay money for that.  Not too swift, THQ.  Then when you're done with the Attitude Campaign, what else is left?  I wish you can play through a whole campaign season mode that changes constantly with new cutscenes, stories, etc.  That's nowhere to be found in this game.As for the online multiplayer component, I haven't tried that since I'm more interested in the single player aspect of the game.I'm also not interested in the create-a-wrestler/story/arena feature either, which is a huge component of the game.  For those of you who like to create stuff to your heart's content, you'll have orgasms over that mode!  Not for me.And what's with WWE Universe?  I don't quite understand that mode at all.  You're given a bunch of pre-set scheduled events (which you can modify yourself however you please), but what's the point?  I feel like that this Universe Mode is there in case you want to see CPU opponents battle it out.  You can simulate the matches, too (which doesn't help).  And where are the story cutscenes that are supposed to occur in Universe?  I never saw one.  I was literally watching every match for a whole month's worth of events and nothing spectacular happened.  From what I gathered, Universe Mode is completely pointless.Overall, you should rent this game first rather than purchase it.  It's a great rental, that's for sure.  Gone are the days of WCW vs. NWO World Tour and the great N64 wrestling titles.  WWE '13 is most likely the last wrestling game I'll ever play.PERSONAL NOTE:  Looking back at my reviews, I haven't given a five-star review for a video game since I reviewed Sonic Generations in January of this year (2012).  What's going on?  I guess this year just isn't a good one as far as video games go (so far).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Very Nice","reviewText":"First of all, I don't mind the space already being taken by people who think the game will be good. There were demos of this released and plenty of preview to form an opinion on the game before its release...besides those who are always posting saying \"This game isn't out yet so how can you review it?\" What's gonna happen when the game IS out such as now and they're still there saying it isn't? Something to ponder no doubt.Anyway, I don't play that many XBOX games (Halo didn't even please me) so surprisingly enough I found myself picking up the controller to this game and trying it out. I was intrigued by the fact that I couldn't put the controller down! It was actually an amazing game. What was even more surprising is that I don't tend to like Star Wars games.Let's start off with the eye-candy, or \"graphics\" so to say.  Not quite as good as some other XBOX games. In fact it looks like a rejected PS2 game. In other words there are a lot of blocky and tarnished images. The graphics aren't nearly as smooth as other games. BUT the enviroments are very nicely laid out and done and they are smooth. It's the character graphics that need the work.The game is very wide and while the path is very linear there are plenty of side-quests along the way.  Also, your actions depend on whether or not you'll be on the light side of the force (a good guy) or the dark side of the force (a bad guy). So it's a pretty free RPG but that also means you'll get asked A LOT of questions.  Depending on what side of the force you're on and what decisions you make alter the games ending and dialogue. Also keep in mind that just because there is a decision that seems like the right thing to do, doesn't mean you'll go closer to the light side. You may actually go closer to the dark because of it. Not only that, but just because something is bad doesn't mean you can go closer to the light side of the force. For example I chose to take a bounty on someone near the beginning of the game only to end up saving that person and gaining light force points. Remember, when you make a decision you have to also think of the consequences. It's all cause and effect.While I do not usually like RPGs that have a lot of voice overs and tend to be like movies, I made an exception for this one.  This is because the voice acting is actually GOOD (unlike FFX) and I can actually SKIP the dialogue (unlike most of it in FFX).Choosing a character is different to me. I'd been playing console RPG's my entire life and never once did I play any D&D; games at all so the thrill of getting to choose my own character class and stats made the game much more engaging for me.If there were any cons I'd have to say that its the battle engine. It feels a lot like playing Chrono Trigger in the aspect that when you run into enemies you don't see any special scene changes (such as the swirl that FF7 does or the zoom-in zoom-out thing that FF6 and FF4 do), instead you \"engage\" in a battle righ ton the spot. What makes this bad? When you are \"engaged\" in a battle the game tends to run a tad bit slower and when you select an attack it takes a long time before the attack is excecuted. Also, you need to choose attacks quickly because unless you were to pause the battle action to select an attack, your character may attack on his or her own free will without you giving them a command to do so.The game has a nice learning curve of about a half an hour or so to master everything it has to offer.  Also, depending on whether or not you chose a female character or a male character also makes a difference in a sort of \"Romance\" the game has. Thus, the game is different with each play through!The game also has very nice sound quality that only the movies can best and that makes the game pretty damn thrilling if you ask me.  So this is this game worth it? Well, I'd say so. I haven't quite beaten the game yet (it just came out today where I live) but when I do I'll tell you more about it's replay value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2003"}

As a game this is a classic and for me a great addition to the series with amazing new and classic moments, but again the always on DRM is it's ruination.  Due to DRM In a few years when this is no longer profitable to Blizzard and they shut down the servers you can never play your game again which is total BS and a waste of money, if they are doing that crap the game should be free and pay monthly to play it not pay 60 dollars to have a limited play time.  I heard they will be releasing an expansion which is sorly needed as the game is kind of short and afterwards there isn't much to do other than log in from time to time to slay demons and play through the game again which is fun in itself but gets boring.  DRM is disgusting and we as players need to let the game industry know with our wallets that DRM like this is not acceptable.  Fix you lag plagued servers or give us offline mode.Update:Now the servers a re even laggier, more disconnects, more rubber banding and blizzard does nothing....also we get the pleasure of having 15+ gold spam request a day in our inbox when we log in....again reported over and over, on the forums...blizzard does nothing.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"What's the problem?","reviewText":"I've been a fan of Diablo since the first one came out.  Diablo III has been on my wish-list since shortly after part 2 was released.  Quite frankly, this game is exactly what I'd expect, and then some.  When I play a Diablo game, I expect \"click-and-loot.\"  Anything else is extra!  On the previous titles, I'd make a character, finish the game and maybe tool around for a bit longer.  Then I'd put the game down for a few months, only to come back and do it all over again.  This is crypt-crawler!  Not a big RPG or MMORPG.  Granted, Blizzard has implemented many of those features into the game, and I'm grateful, as I like RPG's.  Here's a rundown of certain features and my impressions on them:Sound and Graphics:They're great!  The music is exactly what I'd expect from the series; creepy and atmospheric.  Very well done!  The graphics are perfectly fine for a crypt-crawler.  I really like what Blizzard did with the physics.  The particles with the fog and what not are also very nice (the other \"most recent\" title that I've played on my PC was WoW...)  No complaints here!Story:The game is slightly more involved than the previous installments.  I like how they gave more quests this time through, and a few more characters as well.  I also really like how they keep Cain through out the series!  Again, I think they've improved on this area.The Auction House:I don't use it and don't care.  I'm not at all surprised or offended that Blizzard decided to go with it, either.  I remember that people were buying gear for Diablo 2 on eBay, and let's not forget about the gold-farmers in WoW.  The \"pay-to-win\" mentality isn't Blizzard's original evil idea.  It's been going on for ages, and the fact that they're just now cashing in on it shouldn't be a shock to anyone.  This feature is there for those who don't want to wait for the good stuff, and I'm fine with that.  In fact, it's a little better in the sense that people won't be getting robbed when they make a purchase on eBay (provided that's still possible...)Long-term Play Value and the Challenge of Inferno Mode:As I said, these games come in bursts for me.  I'll expect to play through it multiple times, though these times will be spaced out.  Quite frankly, I don't have the time to level each class to 60 and complete the game on \"Inferno\" with each one. In fact, I've never cared much for the super-hard modes in any video game.  They're exactly what they claim to be!  HARD!  If you're a die-hard gamer and need that insane challenge, then you have it.  Me?  I just like the story.  I'll play it on the other modes, and be quite content.  The number of complaints on this topic really surprises me.  Especially when they're from people who claim that they're old-school Diablo fans.  Remember the ladder mode on Diablo 2?  You get exactly one life.  If you die, that character is gone.  For good.  But, regardless of what I think, Blizzard seems to be listening to the complaints, and easing up on it.  Before long, the Inferno mode will be a moderate increase in challenge when compared to the mode before it, and those who managed to complete the game in Inferno pre-nerf will be awarded with some special achievement.  Folks should keep in mind that all Blizzard titles are a work-in-progress, through the duration of their life.  I think I last tried Diablo 2 back around 2008, and it even had some fairly recent work done on it.  This game will be around for a while, and will probably keep changing.  Pick it back up in a month or two, and I bet things will be different!Required Internet Connection:This was kinda dumb.  Though it doesn't affect me, I don't like the idea in principle.  This is the opposite of what I'd expect from Blizzard.  I might actually knock off a star in the review, but I feel enough people have been unduly harsh.Overall Verdict:I really enjoy the game, and I'm glad that I finally got the opportunity to play it!  For those who are fans of the dungeon-crawling genre, this should please you.  For those who are expecting something else, well...  you'll be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"The best RPG on the Playstation 2","reviewText":"There's a whole lot of RPGs for the PS2, and I doubt many have played them all, or even come close. I sure haven't. But I have played a lot. From Kingdom Hearts to Rogue Galaxy, from Dragon Quest VIII to Final Fantasy XII. And I am here to tell that Xenosaga is the best one I've ever played. Not perfect, but definitely the best.First of all, there is the cut-scenes. Start a game and watch a cinema, play for five minutes and watch another, play ten minutes and watch another. I'm not clocking it but by hour three I must have watched at least and hour and half of cinemas. Heck, in this game there are cinemas so long that the game asks you if you want to save before it shows you ANOTHER cinema. Yeah, EAT YOUR HEART OUT METAL GEAR SOLID! At any rate, all of the cinemas are rendered in-game, with full voice acting by REAL voice actors who've been in quality anime. Quite frankly, those in-game cinemas are the best I had ever seen in a game until Final Fantasy XII. There is one terrible flaw with them. The lip synching. Is WAY off. To the point of distraction. Get used to it. Sometimes you'll feel like you're watching a really long cool anime rather than playing a game with this one.The story is awesome, but quite incomprehensible. While many games attempt to tell you an incredibly long and complex story with massively long explanations, with this game it's like they gave up on that idea and just threw you into the story with no explanation of anything. What exactly are the Gnosis? What is the significance of the artifact? Why is there a serial number on one of the character's hands? What happened to Ziggy's family? Will Shion ever love again? Darned if I know. But the story that is there is incredibly absorbing and rich, and that's thanks to the fantastic characters.You'll start the game and be a little bored with the spartan sci-fi trappings, right until the alien Gnosis-killer android KOS-MOS wakes up. Then, as the aliens blow away a battle fleet and eat all the people, you'll witness one of the coolest entrances in video game history as the android cuts through the aliens like  a hot knife through warm butter. Later on you'll meet a cyborg who wants to discard his humanity, and feel your cold heart touched like his when he decides to care about a cute (but artificial) little girl. You'll love to hate the psycho freak Albedo, and smile when junior attacks with action-movie-esque quotes. And of course you'll see some weird wacked-out stuff that you have absolutely no idea what it's getting at, but that's anime for ya.There's also some really great music to be found, fully orchestral stuff reminiscent of the very best scores in movie history. Unfortunately in the musical department also lies another bad flaw. For most of the game there is only one battle music theme. It's really good so that won't bother you much, but there's also pretty much one frantic dungeon/battle theme that plays in battle areas. And it's really stressful, high-strung music that gets old after about 2 minutes. If you are stuck in a dungeon for hours, you'll have to turn the sound OFF, and play some other music, or risk losing your sanity. And then there's long sections that have no music at all making it kind of creepy and lonely. Considering the awesome music that plays during the cinematics and some of the boss battles, this was just a bad design choice.It's a good thing that the general gameplay is so darn good. Like most J-RPGs, there are a ton of battles, which take you to a separate battle area for the duration. Fortunately they are not random, you walk into the enemies to start them (or they walk into you). The fight systems is a modified version of the Xenogears system, which is a good and a bad thing. It's a good thing because Xenogears had the best battle system in any RPG save perhaps Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VII, and it's a bad thing because some of the changes were not so good. I like have high and low frequency attacks, which allow you to wait and power up devastating attacks or unleash combos. I LOVE hitting the square, circle, and triangle buttons to unleash combos. But I hate the boost system to switch characters, as I've never really gotten the hang of it and it's just kind of awkward. Fortunately, the speed and graphical flare of the fights (cinematic camera angles go a long, long way), and KOS-MOS' AWESOME attacks make battles incredibly fun for the most part.People hearing about the AGWS robots may have hoped for a Xenogears-type giant robot series of battles. Without the fuel management and devastatingly awesome attacks from Xenogears, they lack most of the punch of the mech battles from Xenogears. The card game built into Xenosaga however, is not. I think the first time I played this game I must have spent 10 hours playing the card game that's built in. Basically it's a CCG like Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel Vs, Pokemon, ect. But all the irritating management has been totally automated. I've played electronic version of other card games, but strangely, even on the ones which were stand-alone games, I never played one as addictive as this. Weird huh?And speaking of weird, there are some other game design choices to be found in this game which are questionable to say the least. Besides the incredibly enigmatic cut-scenes, there are also crazy weird borderline psychotic ones, which again, are never explained. And while the dungeon-crawling in this game is about as good as it gets (no random battles!) for a game of this type, part way into the game you lose the best, most interesting, most POWERFUL character while you quest INSIDE OF HER MIND (spoiler alert, level everyone up, not just KOS-MOS, or you'll be in for a world of hurt when you can no longer play as her for a long stretch), just takes things to a new level of weirdness, and not in a good way. Then there are a few puzzles later on that you probably will NEVER figure out without a walk-through (I think I would have gotten permanently stuck on the crate elevator puzzle if it weren't for that).For all of its flaws, Xenosaga still comes out on top. The level of story-telling in this game, the supreme quality of the voice-acting (we're talking voice talents for Ghost in the Shell and The Big O here!), the fantastically huge cinemas, the addictive battle system (only the very very long time spent leveling up could possibly make it get old), the great characters and fascinating back-story (Ziggy in particular is a character you will never forget, KOS-MOS is so cool she could freeze Africa, and Albedo could give the Joker lessons on psycho evil), excellent graphics, and sweeping orchestral score make this (here it comes...) the best RPG on the PlayStation 2. Sure, Final Fantasy has the name, but Xenosaga delivers the goods. The only Final Fantasy game that compares is VII. If you only play one RPG for the system, don't play FF XII, play this game. You'll thank me later.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2009"}

Its also important that any choice you make, isnt necessarily the wrong one. There are almost infinite ways to reach your goal. There are no load points, until you reach your mission objective (21 mission objectives in all with about 7 check-points each), which means you can go from one end of the island to the other (and ajoining isles) without a single load. Dont feel like hiking it, take a truck, boat or even a hang glider. Which ever way you choose, be ready for the enemy. They will try to flank you, they will sound alarms, they will call for reinforcements. Its your choice whether to run around guns blazing or take your time finding the best way to defeat them. This game simply molds to your playing style... your not forced to mold your playing style to the game. You dont have to shoot the enemy to kill them either.... hit them with a truck, shoot the chain on a hanging crate to crush them, shoot explosive barrels to blow them up, cut the ropes on a wood bridge to watch them fall to their death, or my personal favorite.... speed up to them in your truck aiming for an explosive barrel and bail out at the last minute to watch them fly in a blaze fire and shrapnel.Lets now talk about graphics and sound. This is the first game ever to succede in creating a lush jungle enviornment to play in. The trees sway in the wind and the water looks so real youll want to take a swim with the fish. Dragonflies buzz close by as beatifully rendered birds fly overhead. The lighting and shadows are amazing. When indoors, shoot a hanging light and watch the lighting spray across the walls and floor... youll be amazad. If you take a few moments while in the middle of the jungle to just sit still... you can hear the wildlife all around... you might just forget youre playing a game. You'll be awestruck by the outdoors, and when playing indoors you may get a little creeped out, especially with some of the scripted events (ie Aliens -vs- Predator and Halflife style). I got so used to playing on the island, that when I had to play indoors... it felt very claustraphobic. An excellent mix of enviornments, however... the indoor missions are a bit more linear than the outdoor missions.There are a few cons to this game, but dont let them discourage you. This is a MUST BUY game.First, vehicle control can be aggrivating. Its damn near impossible to drive and shoot the mounted gun at the same time. I finally gave up and just started running people over, or jumping out of the vehicle when I met alot of resistance.Secondly are some bugs which have been encountered, mostly having to do with video card and driver problems. This can cause your frame rate to drop drastically in the middle of gameplay. this is addressed and remedied by the free patch which ubisoft released for the game on their website. I suggest downloading it. You may also encounter imperfections in the video, like blocking or seeing grids within the map. If you encounter this problem, turn your shadow detail to medium and it will go away. Lastly is the game shutting down in the middle of gameplay. This has happend to me only three times... and I put in over 30 hours of gametime, perhaps not that big of a deal. At the moment, There is no known fix for this.Vehicle control and video bugs caused some annoyances which is the only reason this game didnt get a 5 star rating. I still highly recommend this game to any fan of the genra. It will definitly hold you over until HALF LIFE 2 and DOOM 3 arrive.I would like to finish by stating that I played the game the first time on a TI4400 128 NVIDIA card (a bit outdated). In order for smooth gameplay... everything had to be set on medium. I recently purchased a 5900 FX card and can play with everything set on HIGH to EXTRA HIGH (aside from shadow detail because of bug). It is definitly more enjoyable with a high end card, but can still be played and enjoyed with mid range cards too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005NCAK","description":"Harvest Moon: Save the Homelandtakes the Harvest Moon series in a new direction by offering a deeper and more robust role-playing experience than past titles. It might be best described as a life simulation. The object is to successfully save the village from turning into a resort. Construction begins in a year, so you must find a way to rescue your homeland within that time frame.Harvest Moon: Save the Homelandwill offer nine unique ways in which to complete your task, and focuses more attention on relationships over profit. Befriending the people in town is the key to successfully completing your task. This is the first Harvest Moon title to be in a true 3-D environment. It looks much more realistic without losing the cute animation style for which the series is known.There are 20 new characters--each with his or her own unique personality--richly detailed 3-D environments, and enhanced interaction with animals, including dog training and horse racing. Other compelling details include the ability to collect and cook recipes, real-time character movement, and the capacity to obtain helpful objects by doing part-time jobs.","reviewerName":"xboxfan2001","summary":"Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland: A Big Disappointment","reviewText":"If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games, you can expect a similar experience in this version.The storyline is very simple: You have to save the town (farm) from being turned into a theme park.This game has not one...not two...not even three...but 9 ENDINGS, Each one being different. Why so many, you may be asking? I have no clue. The problem is that if you don't use a stradegy guide and/or an Action Replay/Gameshark, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to unlock all 9 endings because you have to do specific things (ie 1st, give a tomato to ???, then go see the Harvest goddess, etc.)Like I said before, If you have played with the previous Harvest Moon games, you can expect a similar experience in this version. You get to raise cows, chicken, horses, dog, etc. You can even upgrade your house. There are lots of shops in the game (maybe too many) and lots of people to talk to.It takes FOREVER to save up money in this game. The day you get 1 Million (whatever currency the game uses), pigs can most probably fly.Unfortunately, YOU CANNOT GET MARRIED! In every other Harvest Moon game, you can get married, even in the Super Nintendo version. This is a big disappointment.The graphics are cell-shaded. This game  would have looked great in regular 3-D. Why couldn't they make this game regular 3-D? Once again, I have no clue.Also, when it is nighttime in the game, it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to see.Overall: This game is only for hardcore Harvest Moon gamers and PS2 game collectors (this game can be hard to find). Even if you like Harvest Moon but are not a hardcore Harvest Moon gamer, don't even rent this game. I like Harvest Moon, but this is a huge disappointment. Unfortunately, this is the only Harvest Moon game available for PS2. I give this game a 2 out of 5.Second Opinion: 3/5 stars: This game is a disappointment to the Harvest Moon series, however nonetheless it is a lot of fun.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas A. Knisely","summary":"Obviously rushed","reviewText":"The title of my review says it all.  At every turn this game was obviously rushed and not polished due to Call of Duty launching on November the 9th.  And no, I'm not a COD fanboy, I just know how the system works.  A huge title that will draw a crowd is a daunting foe in the gaming world.  DICE knew that, and rushed this game to get the maximum amount of sales.The good about the campaign: The campaign is fun and creative.  The visuals for night vision were impressive and realistic.The bad about the campaign: The campaign was incredibly short and at times very aggravating.  There were times where someone shouted directions at me and I could not hear them over the gunfire.  Then I'm left wondering if I should move up, flank, follow a comrade, or stay put and defend.  With the lack of good waypoints there are times where you are left confused and frustrated.  Maybe they were going for the realism of warfare?The good about the multiplayer: I have yet to find one redeeming quality in the multiplayer.  Getting lots of pointless and well designed awards is kinda cool?The bad about the multiplayer: I will sum up probably 80% of my online experience in this game with two words: Spawn Trap.  This game is so horribly put together for the online gameplay that it makes my head hurt.  All of the maps, with the exception of maybe 2, are so small that you simply need to post up around the other teams spawn to win.  Most of the spawns are in the corner of a map, so you come around a building to mortar fire and sniper bullets.  This means you have 2 choices.  1. Stay put and do nothing but periodically die from mortar and rocket strikes. 2. Attempt to run out in the mass confusion with your other team mates while you get mowed down time after time after time.  The only time I had fun (if you can call it that) and racked up kills was when my team and I returned the favor and spawn trapped the other team.  So you have 2 choices, play like a jerk or get played like a jerk.Avoid this game, unless you want to rent it and enjoy a fun, fast campaign. Other than that wait for Battlefield Vietnam or Call of Duty if you want a real game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2010"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"steve","summary":"Burnout Paradise is a great Arcade Racer","reviewText":"Normally, I play games like Grand Theft Auto IV, Saints Row 2 and first and third-person shooters, so you could say I'm not an avid race-game fan.  But, I like the occasional racer, provided it's not too hard to play or control and has decent replay value.  Burnout: Paradise is that game.The controls aren't too realistic but allows for you to be racing at over 100 mph and not spin out, flipping  your car entirely.  There are different race types, from just a standard race, to stunt races, time trials, and \"marked man\" missions (where you run from two fully-blacked out charger-like cars and try to make it from one point to another without getting totally destroyed).  The soundtrack has some good rock on it, and the premise as a whole is fast-paced and user friendly.  The controls are easy to master, even just picking up the game, and in-game voice tutorials walk you through certain game features and even offer advice after losses.  Regularly throughout the game there are different vehicles that are \"now roaming Paradise City\", and you basically make them wreck to get that car added to your roster.  With a boost feature on every car (though on some it is a one-shot deal until it recharges), jumping ramps and flying down straightaways at close to 200 mph comes with ease.I'm not too much of a racecar fan but the first night I put this game in my Playstation around 8 pm and couldn't put the controller down until almost 2 am.  Very addictive and a great game for both video gamers and the occasional gamer.  I would recommend this game to most, but for gamers who want a realistic racing sim, rent this game first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2011"}

I can say that this is a very entertaining game in the single player mode, quite creative and interactive with various weapons and vehicles depending on what stage you're in. Graphics were good, the xBox version would probably be a lot sharper. I dig vehicles, so I was happy that you have to fly a helicopter, drive a Cayenne and the good ol' Aston Martin as well as a SWEET crotch rocket during the course of the game. Too bad there was no water action, but i'm not picky :)There are a wide range of weapons for you to choose from, as well as a lot of cool gadgets to play with.

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall.

Nevertheless, the guilty pleasures from the arcades always find a unique way of creeping into some great games, especially from pinball. That has been the case with Nintendo during the past year. For Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, they really hit it big with the success of Mario Pinball Land. It just really brought to life the adventure pinball franchises again. That has also been the case recently with Nintendo's DS system. They had to find a great way to conjure that pinball action again, and it is right here from the brinks of Samus.Metroid Prime Pinball for the Nintendo DS brings out all the action of the Metroid series, and the uniqueness of pinball. The game offers all sorts of great action with unique different tables that range from traditional, to battle-style matches. The graphics in the game are truly remarkable, and absolutely bring out some of the most remakrable gameplay for a video pinball game ever. The controls for the game also are very simple and easy to operate. While there happens to be little to nothing with the stylus attachment that can be of use here, it doesn't change the fun. The game also makes full use of the Nintendo DS rumble pak, which is also featured as a attachment with the game, by bringing all the action with each motion of the bumpers.  While you sometimes lose some motions when you lose sight of the Samus ball, especially for when it turns back into Samus, especially for the boss battle tables. Although it is on some, but not all the tables, it can be a bit of a hinderence.Nevertheless, many times when it comes to video pinball games, Metroid Prime Pinball for the Nintendo DS is a great buy, and a must have for anyone who is into the need for a classic case of pinball mania. I loved playing this in Toys R' Us, and I can't wait to own it soon.

In this sequel to Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga, the brothers travel back in time to retrieve Princess Peach, only to come face to face with baby versions of themselves, the princess and Bowser. They'll team up with their younger selves for a quest of lunatic proportions!","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"The power of plumbers","reviewText":"In 2003, Nintendo's Mario Bros. escalated their positions from platforming icons to RPG heroes. Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga for the Game Boy Advance marked Mario and Luigi's first venture into the role-playing genre. The game did exceptionally well, and left many fans clamouring for a sequel. The sequel has arrived, although on another platform, in the form of Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time. Engaging a similar formula, Partners in Time obviously tries to build on the things that made Superstar Saga great. And to a certain extent, it does, thanks to the unique idea that forms the basis of this game - babies.The plot of the game doesn't spring any surprises - the Mushroom Kingdom is under siege, Princess Peach is captured, and the plumbing pair has to engage in an adventure to save the day. This is the premise that many Mario Bros. games are based upon, and Nintendo are not going to mess with it. The villain this time is a certain Princess Shroob, ruler of a world known as the, er, Shroobs (full marks for creativity!). Hell bent on conquering the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Shroob leads her army of Shroobs into an all-out invasion, and (more or less) did her stuff. The only thing that she didn't count on is the intervention of the Mario Brothers. The thing that sets this normal routine apart from past Mario games is that Shroob's invasion didn't actually happen in the present. Instead, the events were unfolded from years past. The present day Mario and Luigi will therefore have to travel between present and past to stop the Shroobs' evil plans. Warrior Within, anyone?The time travelling idea is not something that is totally new to Nintendo. Some years ago, they experimented on it to great effects for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. That too, is by no means the only occasion that time travel happens in a Nintendo game. The highlights of Partners in Time, however, are the appearances of Baby Mario and Baby Luigi. Princess Shroob's invasion has conveniently happened at a time when Mario and Luigi were just toddlers, and it's no surprise that the brothers have to come face to face with (literally) their former selves. What happens next is a double team of the double team, making it quite a ride for the player of this game.The gameplay of Partners in Time is clearly the thing that makes it enjoyable. Like a standard platformer, Mario and Luigi will spend a lot of time exploring different locations on the Mushroom Kingdom's map, which includes such familiar places like Bower's Castle and Yoshi's Island. The concept of having different sizes of the brothers also makes the usual puzzle-solving a little more inventive. For example, the smaller brothers can reach areas that the older ones can't. Similarly, the babies can ride on their older selves to cross larger gaps that they can't jump over.Now, did I just say \"jump\"? Well, jumping is basically what the Mario Brothers do, really. The four round buttons of the DS (A, B, X and Y) are used to perform the jumping action for the four characters, so you'll get to control Mario using A, Luigi using B, and so on. The combat system also uses these respective buttons extensively. Like conventional RPGs, the battles are turn-based, and the first move is always given to the character (or enemy) with the fastest recovery speed. Combat actions are issued in the form of commands, and guess what, the first move that all four brothers begin with is \"jump\". There's a twist to the rather simplistic jump attack though. When you jump at an enemy, you can jump again when you're about to reach him to incur additional damage. This is a bit like the \"jump\" command that Kain uses in Final Fantasy IV Advance, and it's definitely useful during the early moments of the game.The brothers will learn new commands as the game progresses, including the use of \"Brother Items\", a synonym for weapons. Brother items are very useful tools that can cause a large amount of damage to your enemies. For example, you can use shells during attacks, which allow a brother to roll a shell to an enemy, and then have the other catch and roll the rebound back to the same enemy, and then have the first brother do the same... until you can't catch up with the increased speed each time the shell gets rebounded. Much like playing squash, actually, but nonetheless very useful if you want to end a fight quickly. The baby versions of the brothers will also lend a hand during combat, which can lead to some devastating combo moves. If, for example, you use a shell on an enemy while piggybacking the babies, you can unleash a four-character combo that dishes out some major pain to the enemies. If this sound like ass-kicking to you, well, it is.The game, though relatively easy, does present some nasty challenges along the way. The boss fights, for instance, could take you some time to clear. Thankfully, most of the enemies have their individual attacking patterns, and if you get used to how they attack, you should find yourself dodging these attacks comfortably. And if you time it right after dodging an attack successfully, you can even dish out a counter-attack, which makes the going a little easier. Of course, as a RPG, you'll also earn experience points when you fight, and you'll get to level up when you hit the required points for upgrading. Apart from this, you can also upgrade your gear with the use of clothings and badges. These, like armoury items in most RPGs, help to build up your defence, or increase your attack prowess.Partners in Time utilizes some features of the DS for the gameplay as well. The dual screen, for example, is used to perfection most of the time as a map. If you happen to get the babies characters into an area where the older brothers can't access, the top screen will switch to show the babies exploring this area. If you're learning a move, the top screen will even show you, in a rather comical step-by-step fashion, how to execute it. The use of the dual screens is definitely interesting, making the experience very much richer. You'll also use the touch screen on certain occasions, usually to wipe a dirty portrait to find out what's on it - this works too much like Trace Memory for my liking, though.Apart from the gameplay, the presentation of Partners in Time is also pretty good. Some may question as to why Nintendo are still using GBA-style graphics for a DS game, but the answer is obvious - they still look great. The characters have some nice animated movement apart from the usual jumping action. For example, after a very tough fight, you may find Mario expressing a sigh of relief. This could be what you're thinking at that moment as well, so it appears entirely appropriate. The music is also superb, with a mixture of classic and new scores making the game feel less like a typical Mario game. The voice-overs, if minimal, are also pretty spot on. It doesn't fail to amuse me when Mario spouts some Italian gibberish to Luigi, only for the latter to respond with a typical \"oh yeah!\". Priceless!All in all, Partners in Time lives up to its hype as a worthy successor to Superstar Saga. More importantly, it presents to the DS an enriching RPG experience not commonly found in its current library. My only gripe with the game is that at times, it plays more like a platformer than a RPG. Maybe the jumping has taken its toll, but this doesn't make the game any worse. In a nutshell, whether you enjoy the Mario Bros. as a platformer or a RPG, you'll find yourself quickly immerse in the world of Partners in Time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2006"}

As always my reviews will center around in order of importance, story, characters, and gameplay.Story: 9/10The story is one of the strongest aspects to this game. The story is way out there but it keeps you interested. Has a good but surreal ending and stays true to the great FF's when it comes to story. Leaves you wanting more but definitely ends it well. It does get confusing sometimes especially if you put the game down for any amount of time and then come back to it. It's hard to keep track who the bad guys are in this game but all in all the story is greatCharacters: 8.5/10This probably has one of the better casts in all of final fantasy with one major exception. You easily become attached to the characters and the back development of each character is great. Each character evolves as the story goes and really keeps you into the story and game. One major exception to this is Snow. Snow is one of the most annoying and useless characters in the game. It got to the point that I cringed whenever I heard his voice. Hope is extremely annoying in the beginning but keep going he gets better.Gameplay 7/10Gameplay has some of the strongest points in the game right along with some of the weakest. First the good. The battle system is awesome. Keeps your fingers moving and keeps your brain ticking. Absolutely loved the battle system. Completely new to the series and I can't say enough good things about it. A lot of people don't like it because you are no longer able to control the other characters in your party but instead assign roles to them. I will admit that at times that does get annoying when I'm wanting my synergist to cast haste on a certain character but instead he casts shell on someone else. However, the slight shortcomings don't hold the battle system back anyNow the bad..I personally don't like Eidolons or any of the FF's that have them. To me they just aren't that great and I have been less than impressed with the most recent FF's and their summonings/eidolons...but that's very small and largely chalked up to personal preference.Now the really bad...LINEARITY. The game does hand hold you through the first 10 chapters and it does get annoying. But my main linearity complaint is the lack of depth when it comes to sidequests. There just aren't any sidequests besides mark hunting. FF XII's hunting was good but it also had other sidequests to go along with it. FFXIII pretty much just ignores sidequesting completely unless you want to hunt stuff....I will also say that the majority of the game is like walking down one large hallway that has a few twists and turns. It is very linear and many people absolutely hate it. That aspect didn't bother me as much but I will admit that it does take away from the game. I do not like completely open world games but I also hate running down the same hallway for 3 screens. I loved FFX and if FF is going to do linear games it should go back to that type.Overall 8.5/10All in all this game is a great game. The story is top notch, the characters one some of the best and the gameplay is still great even with a few noted blemishes. If you are a fan of FF and are considering playing this game, do yourself a favor and pick it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

Hope is a little B**** if I've ever seen one and I cannot believe the unrealistic grudge he has on another character who is one of the nicest personalities in the whole game. Oh and he likes to mumble about things like \"there is no hope for us (no pun intended....)\" or \"only thing awaiting us is quick death\" what the hell? really this kid is messed up on so many levels and his mom must have not liked him either because she abandoned him to go join a dumb fight that ended up killing her.Vanille is apparently a \"kid\" as she is referred that way by another character many times but she looks adult, and acts like a 7 year old would. She is brainless and I believe she suffers from a congenital defect that has impaired her intelligence level quite a bit.All these characters have no real objectives, bicker all the time (just so that they can have cut-scenes every 5 minutes) and they change their views, goals, and whatever all the time that it is best to disregard anything that come out of their stupid mouths because they don't make much sense.Lightning is like \"I am going to save Serah\" and then when Snow says \"I am going to save Serah\", she is like \"that's impossible.\" and then when Lightning is left with Hope, she is like \"Snow is going to save Serah\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ONVanille is like \"Let's go Hope, you have something to say to Snow.\" so they follow Snow, and then when they meet him, neither of them mention why they are here, so Snow disregards them.

And then tells Snow, \"please take care of him\" and Snow is left puzzled \"save WHO?\" Really? Obviously her son you idiot..... And when Hope reveals his grudge Snow is shocked \"OMG now it all makes sense to me\"So in a nutshell, horrible story matched by an equally unappealing gameplay involving HOURS of a very narrow linear path following involving different, but equally dumb charactersEdit:I forgot to mention what is actually good about this shining piece of turd.- Graphically, and aesthetically, simply a stunning work of art- Some memorable tunes- Snow and Fang were somewhat likeable","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}

Those long years gave us some of the best portable games ever made and the first true attempt at a portable console experience. Unfortunately the system was doomed from the start with proprietary disc media, no second analog nub, and a slew of other things, but the system was a powerhouse at the time and had a lot of potential. The Vita is Sony's second calling and it fixed all the issues of the PSP plus some, and one of those is noticeable as soon as you pull the shiny new device out of the box.A second analog stick. An honest-to-God stick and not a nub or pad. These things feel like they moved straight from the DualShock controller and just shrunk a little. They feel great, even in-game, and I couldn't believe that the second stick was there it was like a wish came true from God himself! This opens up the Vita to a whole slew of games that couldn't be done on the PSP just because of this one little piece of hardware. While playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss I actually forgot the second stick was there a few times because I'm so used to the single nub on the PSP. It may take some PSP vets some getting used to before truly adapting to it. The next big thing that Sony fixed was no disc media! Thank you very much! Those UMDs were irritating and sucked up precious battery life as well as limiting the memory size. Now we get nice little carts, like the DS, or you can download the game digitally via the PlayStation Store.Sony made one fatal flaw with the Vita and that is the proprietary memory cards. What in God's name was Sony thinking?  Everyone thought the memory stick pro-duos for bad for the PSP, but at least those were regular memory sticks. These tiny little things only work in the Vita and cost a fortune. A 32GB will run you $100 which is a complete rip-off, but guess what? You don't have a choice! Thanks a lot jerks!The next big thing Sony did was add a touch screen. Copied the DS you say? Not exactly, its more like it copied smartphones, but flip this guy over and you have a touchpad on the back which is Sony's little way of saying, \"Hey we're trying to be original too\". It's an odd thing to have and not many games use it yet, but it adds a whole new dimension to touchscreen gaming, and it's just as responsive as the touchscreen so it doesn't feel like a dead limb. However, it's up to game developers to use this odd mechanic but only time will tell.The screen is one of the best things of the device because its OLED (Organic Light Emitting Display) so you're looking at some of the best display technology out. Now you don't have to worry about dead pixels! Yeah...remember that launch fiasco Sony? The screen is 5' which is the biggest portable gaming screen ever made and even tops the PSP's 4.3' screen. This allows for lots of detail in your face and tons of room for touching things on the screen.Once you get over how gorgeous the screen (I can't stop staring at it!) you will start hitting those buttons on the device. Sure they don't do anything unless your in-game (the Live Area is all touchscreen based, but more on that later) but the button layout here could have been a disaster. Sony had to be really careful because of those new sticks so the D-pad and face buttons shrunk about half their size and got moved up. Blasphemy! Actually no. Despite the higher placement and smaller size I still hit them accurately like the PSP even with my really big thumbs. The D-pad is way better than the PSPs and works well with fighting games (yes relax!) so no worries there. But...there is one problem with these buttons. The start and select buttons are way too small and are level with the system instead of sticking out. What! Did Sony fall asleep at the drawing board here? They are also placed all the way at the bottom of the right side so you have to move your hand down. C'mon...what happened there? Other than that the L and R buttons are nice and huge and you get a nice big PlayStation Home button the size of Venus on the left side, but hey it glows!Anyways, the buttons are just fine so how about everything else visually? Sony made the little \"compartments\" more subtle this time around so the memory slit is hidden at the bottom as well as the game card slot on top so the whole system just looks like a big oval. Don't be worried about the size of the thing either. Sure it's big and not exactly pocket-sized, but for what is under the hood this thing is compact and pretty light.Now that the visual stuff is out of the way lets talk about under the hood. This thing is the most powerful handheld on the market only being rivaled by devices powered by the Tegra 3 processor. The thing has a quad-core Arm-9 Cortex CPU which is freaking powerful. This allows for PS3 quality visuals that no other portable device on the market has. It also has a quad-core GPU which is over 4 times as powerful as the iPhone 4S's GPU. The system also packs 512 MB of system memory and 128 MB of VRAM (Video memory) which is astounding (the Xbox 360 has 512 MB of memory for comparison). We also get two cameras that are front and back facing which can track head movement, six-axis gyroscope, bluetooth, a microphone, and 3G wireless card. Holy crap that's a lot of stuff. This is one powerful device, but have yet to see what it is fully capable of.Now let's get down to software and how the thing plays. Every PlayStation fan by now is used to the XMB (Cross Media Bar) thanks to the PSP and PS3. Get ready for change because the new Live Area is made of bubbles. You like bubbles right? This is to make use of the touchscreen and takes awhile to get used to. You can rearrange these bubbles to your liking kind of like on a smartphone and even change the background for each \"page\". The Vita can multitask which is something the PS3 can't even do. You can play a game, hit the home button, go online and look up a FAQ, then flip back to your game without having to quit. Why can't you do that on the PS3? Someone at Sony was dropped on their head as a baby one to many times, but its nice to have it here.Once you start playing with the Welcome Park which gets you used to the Vita's new features, play around with Near which is like the 3DS's streetpass, but worse and more confusing, you will really start liking this guy. The browser works like the PS3, but has fewer features for some reason, but we get trophies! Oh my God trophies! These are also great for games that are cross platform so you can start working on a trophy on Marvel vs Capcom 3 then pick it right up on the Vita and finish unlocking that trophy.The Vita uses remote play  a lot better than the PSP mainly because its more powerful and can do what the PS3 can do. Right now the remote play is still pretty weak, but the potential is there. Right now only 3 games support cross play (MvC3, MLB 2K12, and Hustle Kings) but I'm excited for what this can bring. Overall the Vita has a lot of software potential, but is lacking a lot and feels kind of thin. Sony's attempt at augmented reality comes to life with the Vita with AR cards (yes they ripped off the 3DS) and it works really well thanks to the systems more powerful hardware and gyroscope.Overall, is the system worth $250? Yes it is if you are a hardcore portable fan or console fan. This is the first real console experience in portable form and Sony nailed it perfectly. The other big issue I forgot to mention is battery life. You get about 3-4 hours on a powerful game, 9 hours for music, 4-5 for video, so don't expect huge play sessions like on the DS. The battery lasts forever in sleep mode though! Sure, what good does that do you? For what this system does the battery life is actually pretty long because you're running a mini supercomputer off of it. Cut it some slack! The games for the system right now are OK, but not as awesome as the PSP launch (considered the best launch ever), but the games are reviewed separately. I would pick one up if you love portable consoles because this thing has so much potential. It just has a few major flaws and is quite lacking software wise, but Sony will probably pick up the pace over the next year.Over the next 5 years I see the Vita as the model for portable games. We'll start seeing games push the system graphically like God of War did for the PSP. I think we'll see games that give us more than just touchscreen smartphone games thanks to the rear touchpad. In 5 years I expect the library to grow beyond ports and we'll probably see the Vita's first killer app by the end of this year that redefines portable gaming kind of like Syphon Filter and God of War did for the PSP. Those games showed that even with major flaws the system can be something incredible and helped people look past them all. Something like that will pop up for the Vita in the next year or two and then we can start talking about moving forward in the portable market.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Wow I would have loved that. Instead it became a Londonesque late 1800s kind of place. Personally it was too dark for me but I suppose that's the vibe they were going for. Gameplay is pretty cool. You can strategize in many ways in how to get around your enemy NPCs. You can beat the whole game without killing a single enemy. How awesome is that? Even though let's face it, nobody is going to pull that off. There are a lot of strategic options making each level worth playing through more than once. I didn't finish the game because I started feeling a bit depressed from the sad and lonely dark vibe. But in terms of gameplay this to me beats Bioshock infinite hands down.

{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"Everything the first was,  times 10!!!","reviewText":"The first Splinter Cell was just...stunning.  It changed the spy genre forever.  It took a fairly small genre, and turned it into one of the biggest.  Splinter Cell changed gaming forever, and sold millions upon millions of copies in the process.  It won dozens of awards, was hailed as one of the top 5 games of 2003, or even one of the best games of all time.  All that is to give you an idea of how good the first Splinter Cell really was.  Well, Splinter Cell #2, Pandora Tomorrow, is everything the first one was.  And much much more!1) Gameplay~ Most of the controls in this game are exactly the same as the first.  A few things have been changed.  For example, the black button is now the &quot;whistle&quot; button.  You can do a half jump in a smaller hallway, and of course the full split jump in the larger hallway.  They also changed a few buttons.  When hanging from a ledge, the B button is now the button that drops.  You can also do a Swat Turn when having your back against a wall and pushing A.  All this and more have been changed from the original.  And in my opinion, it's an improvement.This game has about a dozen levels, and yet again, an amazing story.  There are many more cinematics, bringing the story closer to home.  The levels look amazing, and are a blast to play.  Each level is fairly large, and every section requires a new talent and skill to beat.  It is so much fun to play, and each thrilling minute will keep you coming back for more.  The gameplay is amazing, and ups in every way on the first.2) Graphics: The graphics are, yet again, jaw dropping.  The shadows, lighting, texture!  It's like REALLY being a spy.  It looks so real!  The grass blades blow as the wind blows, everything, even the wires on a fence, have a shadow.  All of Sam Fisher's moves look cooler, yet more realistic, then before.  It just looks amazing, pushing the limit for even the mighty XBOX.  Using every last ounce of power to provide that last detail of the crack in the wall, or the crawling of a bug.  It really brings this amazing game to life!3) Online: This is where this game really shines.  Once online, you start off as a level one.  You can join any number of games (there are always several dozen to join at any moment).  There are about 8 maps, and 3 gametypes.  Each gametype is a little different.  Once in a game, you are either a spy or a mercenary.  The spies try to either A) Neutralize console (or extract a tube from it), usually of these consoles.  The mercenaries try to prevent the spies from doing this, and protect the target for the set time limit (usually 10 minutes).  Also, each team has a certain number of lives.  Mercs have 3, and Spies have 4.  Each has their own gadgets and moves unique to them.  The spies are fast, versatile, and can go anywhere.  They can also sneak up behind a merc and grab him.  From here, the spy can either hold the merc until he dies (usually 10 seconds), or break his neck. They also see in 3rd person.  Mercenaries on the other hand have a deadly gun, mines, grenades, and the ability to kill from a distance.  They see in first person.Overall the online game balances out, and both sides have their disadvantages and advantages.  Yet, the talent really shows in a good player, as a good player will always beat a bad player, and the best spies and mercs almost never lose.  This game does take a lot of teamwork as well, perfect for friends wanting a game to dominate...together.  There is an amazing ranking system, as for every few dozen points, there is a level.  Everyone starts at Level 1, and at 0 points.  Once they earn 100 points, they increase to Level 2.  The rankings work like this, and you can perhaps someday become the best player in the world! (the stats don't reset also).So as you can see, this game is everything the first one was, and more.  It was worth every penny in my book, and is addicting (both offline and on).  It is the most popular XBOX Live game right now, and there are always a lot of games to join.  It's addicting, fantastic, and overall just a great game.  One of those classics that you'll be talking about even years after you beat it.  And of course, the game never ends with XBOX Live.  A great game, I recommend it 100%!  It won't disappoint!Thx!obryanstars*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

The voice overs are probably the weakest point but that is a trivial argument compared to everything else. The music and sounds are great and the graphics are fantastic. The developers really knew how to push the limits of the Dreamcast considering this game looks better than alot of X-box games. Anyways I would recommend this to people who want to experience a truly incredible game. Although newcomers should keep in mind that this game is not for those who are lacking in patience and this game requires backtracking and talking to lots of city folk.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"goldentoaster \"goldentoaster\"","summary":"PSP- Not Ideal for Portable Gaming","reviewText":"I am just a casual gamer who likes to play games. I bought the PSP with big expectations, and I am a little dissapointed. There is no denying that the PSP is a beautiful and powerful peice of work, but I am not sure that is enough to warrant a purchase.I got this system, and I found out that it was great for watching movies and listening to music. It has an amazing picture quality, and I was blown away at the crispness of the visuals. I found that the interface was accessable and easy to use, and I was perfectly content with using it for non-interactive media.But then I tried to play the games. I was impressed with the graphics (PS2 quality) but the way thet the psp is set up, it is a little difficult to play the games that it is trying to sell. There is only one set of shoulder buttons, and the analog nub is very uncomfortable and not effective to use. This is a problem because most games these days rely on 2 functioning analog sticks, and the PSP just can't do that. Also, I found that almost all the games on the PSP were just bad remakes of better PS2 games. But that is just what the PSP promises: a PS2 you can fit in your hand. But I'd much rather be playing these games on a PS2 with a comfortable controller and a big screen.Another problem is that the PSP is extremely delicate, and scratches really easily. This is a really bad thing, considering its meant to be portable. I found myself not wanting to pull out my PSP and use it just for fear of scratching it. You don't have that feeling with a Gameboy or a DS.But this is still a good system for some games, and is still a great media player to show off to friends, but this isn't really the ideal portable gaming system, and that's what I came for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Alabaster Jones \"perpenhopher\"","summary":"A pretty big disappointment for me.","reviewText":"As a huge fan of both Star Trek and video games, I have been looking forward to trying this game for years.  Trek and an MMO really seem like the perfect marriage, if you think about it.  There's a whole galaxy of content and 40+ years worth of stories to draw on.  This game was really a no-brainer.  Or so one would think.I had the opportunity to play in Open Beta, through the Head Start, and now I'm about a week into release.  So, I've been playing this game fairly consistently for close to a month.  I play games a lot, and I have played nothing but this game since beta, and I think I've got a pretty good handle on most of what it offers, so I feel like I have more than enough information to write an informed review.I bet if you were to ask any Trek fan who had never heard of this game (hypothetically) what a Star Trek MMO would be like, you would get a huge amount of great, creative, fun ideas for a truly massive game that encompasses the vast and noble feeling of Star Trek.The one thing a Trek fan would NOT tell you is that they would expect ANYTHING like what this game is.What Cryptic has done here is taken all the 40+ years of lore, all the potential for a massive and engaging game, all the many varied aspects of Star Trek, and they distilled it to a very, very simplistic space shooter that feels about as massive as a shoebox.All that talk of diplomacy from the TV series?  Forget it.  This is Trek for the ADD crowd.  It's all phasers and photon torpedoes.  It's all out war all the time, and you won't stop until every ship in every system is reduced to a pile of floating debris.Exploring the galaxy?  Seeking out new worlds and new civilizations?  Hardly.  The galaxy is represented by the \"sector map\" which is a ridiculous looking neon grid where you'll see your ship, and the ships of other players, floating around heading for various neon icons of planetary systems. Notice I said \"planetary systems\" and not \"solar systems?\"  That's because they only bothered to make one planet for each system.. and with very few exceptions, you can't even go to that one planet unless you've been told to go there by your Starfleet contacts.  And when you DO get to beam down to a planet?  Each planet consists of a tiny patch of land with nothing but the objectives for the one mission that allows you to go there.  I'm talking very very small here.  I think the largest one I've seen so far was an indoor environment about a quarter of the size of an old Doom level.  You scan your five \"whatevers\", vaporize a few dozen baddies with a ground combat system that's as bland and boring as they come, beam back up to the ship and then do it all over again in another \"system\"  Wash, rinse, repeat.One more thing that needs to be mentioned about the \"Sector Space\" is that each sector is divided into several \"blocks\" of systems, and in order to get to the next block, you have to go through a loading screen.  Not only that, but each block is divided into a bunch of \"instances\", to keep the server from overloading.  What this means is that, when you go to Earth Spacedock for example, 20 of you will go in to Earth instance A, 20 of you will go into Earth instance B, and so on.  So, not only do you not get the feeling of a massive galaxy to explore, but you also don't even get to see everyone who's there!  Just 20 random people.  Even if you are in a group with your buddies and go to Earth, you will almost certainly not end up in the same instance.This causes the game to suffer in a number of ways.  They have a few space stations set up here and there, like Earth spacedock, Deep Space Nine, etc.. and they are clearly meant to serve as social spaces.  They have a bar and an observation lounge.. heck.. at DS9 you can even go to Quark's, but there's nothing to do, nobody there, and as a result, nobody socializes.  Quark's (which is itself a seperate instance from DS9) is always totally devoid of human players.  It's depressing to walk around these places and notice how empty they feel.So.. the majority of your time, you're going to be floating on the neon grid of Sector Space, flying towards your next boring shoot-em-up mission that's just a reskin of the last one you did, and most of the time, you'll be doing it all by yourself.To be fair, they do have what they call \"exploration missions.\"  What that means is that you're directed to another block of the Sector Space grid.  Only, instead of seeing icons of planet systems in the distance, you'll see a pink haze and the same blue grid, with the occasional \"anomaly\" for you to scan.  This will sometimes take you to a random mission in an \"unexplored system\".  But, you'll quickly find that these missions are just like the others, and you'll often be doing the exact same one two or three times in a row as you go from anomaly to anomaly.All of this exploration stuff takes place in a block smaller than any of the other blocks, and you'll usually see another 15 or 20 people there waiting for these \"anomalies\" to spawn.  When they do, it's a race to get to them, because once a system has been explored, it disappears and pops back up in another spot at another time.  Imagine floating in a blue boxed grid with pink fog with 20 other people waiting for these systems to appear.  That's what they call exploration in this game.  Where no one has gone before?  Indeed not.So.. with all that negativity out of the way, there are some things that I DO like about Star Trek Online.  Mainly the space combat.  The best part of this game to me is that, as you work your way through the ranks from Lieutenant to Admiral, you will get to control more and more powerful ships at each step.  The ships can be equipped with a wide variety of weapons and stat enhancing consoles which you will also upgrade along the way.  You also get to commission Bridge Officers, who each bring different abilities to the table.  In your first ship, you are allowed to have one Tactical Bridge officer, one Engineering officer, and one Science officer.  At first, only one of their abilities will be available to you in space.  You may have a Tactical officer with the \"High Yield Torpedo\" ability, which allows you to fire 2 torpedoes instead of the usual one, or a Science officer with a \"Sensor Jam\" which will remove the enemy's ability to target you for a short time.The way you can mix and match your weapons, equipment, and Bridge Officers is very well done.  It's obvious that this is where Cryptic spent most of their development time, and I think most players will at least agree that the space combat is fun.  It starts off very easy, but as your level increases, your combat options and the enemy difficulty increase quite a bit.  Taking down 3 Romulan Birds of Prey with nothing but your quick fingers and wits, escaping by the skin of your teeth.. it's really quite awesome.. and as out of place as it feels to be constantly blowing up ships in a Trek MMO, you never really get tired of it.So, to sum up.. this is an extremely unfinished game.  It's very light on content right now, does not feel anything like an MMO, and needs a HELL of a lot of work before it should even be considered as a serious contender to the other MMOs on the market.  That said, I want and hope to see the game grow, so I have decided to subscribe for a few months and see how it goes.Is it worth it for you?  Well, all I can say is read these reviews, watch some gameplay videos, and read up on Cryptic's plans for expanding the game.  If you believe they will make good on their promise to make this game better, then give it a shot.  It's going to be the only Star Trek MMO that we have for quite a while.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"Victor Mariscal \"Roguemaster83\"","summary":"X-factor","reviewText":"After all the hype, all the anticipation, the rumors, the bits and pieces of information, the desire to own it, and most importantly, the hype, the greatest game ever released for the X-Box has arrived, Halo 2. Even newbies to the Halo universe will get a kick out of this and much more. Truly a worthy successor to Halo: Combat Evolved and setting a whole new standard.The story goes like this (I'll try not to spoil anything). Master Chief (otherwise known as John 117) returns to battle the alien Covenant, a group of religious fanatics bent on wiping out humanity because they see humans as an affront to their gods. When they launch an attack on Earth, Master Chief takes the fight to them. While the situation is already bad, there's more going on than meets the eye. Another Halo ring, the Delta Halo, is discovered, and this is when things get even more interesting. We learn more about our antagonists, the Covenant, and get a little insight into their motives, such as a look into the Covenant hierarchy. What they, along with the Master Chief will discover, will shock you. As for how it ends, well, let's just say you'll love it or hate it. Simply put, the single-player/cooperative campaign alone is worth the buy.In addition to an amazing single-player mode, the multiplayer experience (which includes LAN support) will rock us all. This game can also be played on X-Box Live, and even there are many options where that's concerned. Also, the addition of dual-wielding, which is the ability to fire two weapons simultaneusly is very appealing. Almost all the weapons from the first game are back, along with new ones (some of them are weapons you couldn't use in Halo). There are new vehicles you can pilot, new enemies, and all new surprises. Your own armor is much improved as well, in the sense that they recharge much faster. It's also possible to \"jack\" other vehicles. It takes a little practice, but if you can pull it off, you can steal someone else's ride. Also, you encounter new enemies, among them, the Brutes. If you thought the Flood from the first game was bad, the Brutes will knock them outta the park.Graphically speaking, this game is beautiful. Even after you've beaten the game, there's still a lot you can do, many more possibilities even in the single-player/co-op campaign. The areas you wander around in are so big it's a wonder how Bungie pulled it off.This game is not without at least one shortcoming, however it's are not worth getting angry about. Whenever the cut-scenes play, there tends to be some texture pop-in, as in some things in the cut-scene just pop in after it starts playing. It may also happen when a mission loads, but chances are it's not even noticeable. It's not something that will ruin the game in any sense of the word.Those who buy the Limited Edition get two discs, the actual game itself, and the second disc is a DVD loaded with bonus features, mostly documentaries detailing the making of the game, deleted material, and much more.We've waited three years, so let's lock and load!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2004"}

The storywas pitiful, the controls oft-times frustrating and the motivation to carry on was often lacking.The leveling system was also frustrating, making players play for hours upon hours before theygot the strength necessary to use the superpowers demonstrated in the trailers and on the package.Ruffian Games heard the complaints, and listened. This time around, everything works the way itought to. No more finagling with the controls to execute a simple jump, and more grinding toget stronger and more agile. Within an hour and a half, you'll be jumping 20 to 25 into theair and throwing cars at hapless gang members with ease.The plot is a welcome improvement from the nonexistent one in the debut entry. While not reaching thelevel of something like, say, \"Alan Wake\" or \"Deadly Premonition\", it provides a satisfying gangs vszombies vs military plot, backed by \"Army of Two: 40th Day\"-style audio logs which provide furtherinsight into just what went wrong with the city you're now fighting so desperately to save. Again,it breaks no new ground, but it's better than not having a plot, right?Graphics are interesting, but a bit rough around the edges. It seems like the developers couldn'tdecide whether or not they wanted to be totally realistic or totally cel-shaded, and insteadcompromised with a look that, while interesting, isn't very aesthetically pleasing. Not that thegraphics are bad; they just feel unpolished.The tagline on this game's box sums it up: \"Blow up the city. Blow up the city with your friends. Blowup your friends.\" If you're the kind of person who likes blowing stuff up, slaying massive amounts ofzombies/gangbangers, or just acting like a fool with the powers you've been given, \"Crackdown 2\" isthe game for you. It may not be the best exploration of having massive amounts of power (that honorbelongs to \"InFamous\", and possibly \"Prototype\"), but it's a blast nonetheless.

Though the boys don't even come close to some of things the girls are seen to wear, but you can ignore them.The gameplay is smooth.

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Sam The Alligator","summary":"Nintendo's first really graphically awesome system but...","reviewText":"Im glad I waited until someone sold me the N64  for 30 dollars instead of buying it when it came out for 200 dollars.The reason I gave it 5 stars is because it has 4 stone cold classics(Super Mario 64,Ocarina Of Time,Majora's Mask and Banjo Kazooie) but Im glad I waited until someone sold it to me for 30 bucks.Ill tell you why-there arent enough excellent games for it.When it first came out I was discouraged by the unusual controller and Mario 64 was obviously something that is great but no other games to back the system up as far as I could see.Plus I was happy with the Genesis cause I was still on my Toe Jam and Earl  and Sonic The Hedgehog thing. Then the Dreamcast came out it had an amazing game(Sonic Adventure) but for some reason it got a bug or something and stopped working.Then in 2001 I was looking for a new system.I thought to myself what company has characters that are equals to Sonic and TJ&E;?Why Nintendo of course.I remember the original NES had great games like the Mario series,Metroid,The Legend Of Zelda and Double Dragon.And Game Cube was clearly new generation the graphics and sound are magnificent and glorious.Plus Sonic is on the Nintendo list now,as well as Namco.And Super Mario Sunshine is a fine sequel to Mario 64 and Super Smash Bros Melee is obviously one of the best games of all time and the system has enough power so classics like the Sonic series can be emulated onto one disc although when I first bought the system those games were never gonna be rereleased and put onto the system.Hopefully Nintendo itself will follow in Sonic Teams footsteps and emulate classics like the Mario Series,The Legend Of Zelda,Metroid and F - Zero onto a disc or two.I think maybe Sonic Team and Nintendo actually do read what people put on Amazon.com so they get new ideas to please their fans.Its a possibility.Anyways Ocarina Of Time,Perfect Dark,Super Mario 64 and Majoras Mask plus Banjo Kazooie are all classics even though I cant stand Pokemon at all.Pokemon sucks.How Pokemon got so famous is beyond me.Its way too crass and commercial and easy and boring.I cant stand Pokemon in the least.But the other games like Mario 64 more than make up for a miserable waste like Pokemon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2002"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Chad E. Munn","summary":"The best RTS on any console. A must for Halo fans to boot.","reviewText":"This'll be a fairly short review- there are others that can and have said it better and in more depth that I could. The short of it is that IF you're a Halo fan or know one- this is a must. Granted, I'm not speaking of the brainless trigger finger kids that feel that Halo is their outlet for shooting other mindless morons in the face and gloating non-stop about it- I'm talking about the Halo fans that love the game only as much as they love the fiction and the universe Bungie created. Halo Wars not only tells a great story (an original story) with stunning, top of the line CGI, but it also has a LOT of answers to many questions most Halo fans have been asking for years.And to the NON-Halo fan, if you're looking for a console RTS that works amazingly well for the medium, this is IT. I've played EVERY RTS on EVERY Console, this is the ONLY one that I would recommend. Because we lack the Keyboard and Mouse set up of PC gamers, we need an RTS that works with a controller... and that's what Ensemble gave us. This is fast, easy and becomes second nature almost immediately. The fun of an RTS is being in control of a large army and watching the controlled chaos unfold. PC gamers would argue that it's about setting up the micro management aspects of RTS's and that may be true for some, but the action of Halo Wars is perfect for sitting on the couch and getting the action started in 20 seconds versus 20 minutes.Give Halo Wars a shot with the demo that's available on XBL, but know that it truly only scratches the surface of the entire game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}

As usual, those industrious Nazis are trying to exploit any edge they can get, and they certainly aren't thinking inside the box.  Very quickly in the game you learn that the Nazis have discovered an interesting and questionable source of, well, interesting and questionable power.  You, as BJ, spend this game getting to the bottom of this and attempting to thwart these new efforts.There is a short list of \"modern\" ideas in this game...  a centralized map with a very light RPGish quest style method of breaking up the basically linear game play.  There is an upgrade system, and of course, some \"special powers\" you obtain along the way.  Besides that, the game is very much a nod to Return to Castle Wolfenstein style run and gun play.  The game play is outdated in that regard, but that doesn't necessarily detract from the fun in the game.  There are a few different weapons in the game, but you get them as time goes on...  so there isn't a huge variety, effectively.  Also, not all weapons are useful (or even feasible) given different conditions.  Towards the last part of the game you end up using whatever you have ammo for.The story isn't bad, but it is nothing earth shattering.  You fight Nazis, you discover Nazis are doing strange stuff, and you try to stop them.  There are a few cinematic moments, and some very light character dialog.  Other than that:  killing, killing, killing.  Not a problem, just don't expect much in the story line area.  Nothing like cinematics that bluntly explain what is happening in case you can't be bothered to actually pay attention to the game.  :)I did everything I could and I completed the game in under 12 hours -- as evidenced by the Achievement \"Blitzkrieg\".  I didn't feel it was that long of a game, but it certainly wasn't the shortest game I've played.  I haven't even bothered with the multiplayer as I haven't been interested.  I played uncountable hours of RTCW: Enemy Territory, but for some reason this game doesn't inspire me to even try.To summarize:  Old school run and gun linear action with good graphics and a vaguely entertaining plot.  Nothing ground breaking, but I don't think it was intended to be.  It's a good game, and I enjoyed playing it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2009"}

I was ready not to enjoy it, and I almost stopped playing the game early on. For some reason they had a really difficult section where you're on a slow moving elevator being attacked by a bunch of the giant aliens. I died over and over, until I finally got lucky and survived just by running back and forth and firing some shots. The funny thing is, I didn't really have much trouble with any other part of the game, overall it's relatively easy. I'm not sure why they had such a difficult section so early in the game.I really grew to enjoy this game, I mean it's not without problems and annoyances, but the destruction, badass weapons, and big enemies were awesome. The game is a little claustrophobic, especially after the previous games, but I felt that it worked. The story is decent, although I felt it was a little unnecessary how they killed the one character off. One of the best parts of the game has to be the pacing. It moves along very well, with fun and varying mech levels, interspersed with repairing things, destroying things, and killing monsters. Also, while I didn't mind too much the repairing of things, the tech was completely unbelievable and I fell through the floors multiple times while fighting, though thankfully it didn't usually result in death except in the lava levels.So overall, you could do a lot worse than this game, it's a relatively long campaign with lots of excitement, at the current price I consider it a 5 star game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard C. Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","summary":"What happened to Dead Space? Isaac is now the Jar Jar Binks of Deadspace!","reviewText":"Dead Space is my #2 favorite game series (Bioshock is #1) so I was thrilled when DS3 was announced. Isaac was back.  Pre-Ordered and waited. When It arrived I installed immediately and started gameplay. The \"feel\" of DS 1 & 2 is not there. The haunting voices in the background, subdued creepy music, jump out of your chair shocks - all gone. Now it's overdone, overly dramatic music, none of the subtle sound effects or creepy voices. A big let down there. Then came the gameplay. Totally Mass Effect 3. The weapons crafting is cool, but again, like ME3, you have to purchase DLC kits for the good stuff or wait several chapters for the bots and hope they collect enough credits to buy stuff. That's a huge rip-off.  The Necro's are OK, but the \"boss\" battles are unoriginal and often idiotic. Run around in circles, turn, shoot, run in circles, turn shoot. Repeat endlessly.  Hunt and run-around endlessly for parts to fix stuff. You often find rooms and areas for optional missions or a different part of the chapter, but can't do anything. In most games if you find a puzzle-piece or something you need for a future mission, you can collect it. Not here.Is there a Necro in the area? You'll hear that tortured Whale-sound rooms away. Confusing and stupid. Is there a wall vent? Just stand and wait - they'll be out in a minute.  The series is out of ideas. Before it was doors and trains crushing you. Now it's pistons and machinery. Exact same puzzles, different look, identical solutions as in previous games. Does a door malfunction? Find cover and wait - you'll be attached shortly. You get to recognize the setup pretty quick.  \"Ah. OK. I'll be attacked from two corners and a ceiling vent. I better stand here. Rearrange stuff for a barricade. Wait and kill 'em all.\"  Seriously.Then there are the mini-games.  Boring and pointless.  It's an OK game, but honestly if it did not have the Dead Space franchise name on it, this game would have been a flop. I would not have purchased it.It's so darn predictable. It's not creepy nor scary. In short, this is not the Deadspace you want and expect. Anything Isaac touches breaks. You expect him to blurt \"Meeesa soo sorrie, Annie...\" Doors, ladders, aircraft, consoles - you name it, it malfunctions. What made DS stand out was it was realistic. Break a ship's window to create a vacuum. Shoot a moving target.  Now, unless the target is totally in the clear, you often can't hit it. Example - behind a railing? Just like full cover.  And what's with \"hunchback Isaac?\" Can't he stand up straight?  Why can't we switch shooting positions - shoot from the left or right?!? If I'm under cover on the left or right, I should be able to change position. Not here - I guess that's the game engine showing it's age.Sadly, I really do not like Isaac in this game. He has this cloud of angst and self pity. The tragic, determined, hidden-hero is gone. Now it's a self-pitying, \"why me\" annoying dweeb you want to watch die.If you're a DS fan, you will find this final chapter in the series disappointing. It does wrap things up, poorly. There is too much influence from Mass Effect 3. The originality, humor and terror that made this such a stand out game franchise, well, it's not here anymore.  The ending reminded me too much of Mass Effect 3. What's with E.A. and BDO's (Big, Dumb Objects)?  Everything does not have to be the size of a moon!For DS 1 & 2 I played the first time through for fun, then went back and played on Hard core and collected the goodies. Not here. First time through was enough. I finished 91% of the game without really trying.One final complaint - you are REQUIRED to play co-op games to finish some of the optional missions and collect many of the awards.  Come on! I can see co-op being an added bonus, but to actually label doors with \"Co-Op Mission Only\" is ludicrous!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2013"}

This game had it all from comedy to action and some drama tossed in for fun.Sound 7/10 - the sound in Final Fantasy III was very good. I still hum some of the songs that I was able to hear in this game.Graphics 8/10 I only have one word for the graphics in this game \"WOW\", from stale, 2D sprites of the original Nintendo Famicom to spectacular 3D graphics on the Nintendo DS.Game play 8/10 - Was cool on the DS. Item of note, the remake takes advantage of the Wi-Fi hardware of the Nintendo DS in the form of a Mail/Mognet system. Various moogles in the game allow the player to send mail to others. Players are also able to send mail to various characters in the game, as well as to other players. Side quests can also be unlocked using this system, such as the quest to unlock the Onion Knight. The way my friend and I got around the 1 email per hour limit was to send a letter, open the letter save the game, turn off the system. Then turn it back on and change the day on your DS system then go back into the game and send another email. Do this about 8 times and you can start on the quest to gain the onion knights!Overall  7/10 - It took me over 70+ hours to beat this game and most of that time was spent leveling up my onion knights. Any Final Fantasy fan would love this game. If only for the fact that it is a great game and this is the first time that this game has seen our shores. PLAY THIS GAME!P.S.

It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.Graphics: You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area. It's a fairly early N64 game. In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality, Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom. But if you're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago, chances are you won't care about that.Sound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.There's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox, even after all this time. I rented it and progressed most of the ways you could progress back in the day, and I'm glad to own it for the system now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

Plus there are unlockables that can be used in this game.Speaking strictly about the differences with Diabolical Box, after the adventures in Curious Village, Layton receives a letter from an old friend who has made a startling discovery, but leaves an ominous message at the end.  Worried for his friend, Layton and his apprentice arrive to find his apartment in shambles, and him on the floor unresponsive.  The only evidence left behind are tickets on a train, but no clear information as to destination or why the tickets are there in the first place.  They decide to take a trip to find more information about what happened.I give Diabolical Box credit for one thing: the puzzles were often directly related to the basic story.  You'll still encounter patrons of the city you arrive at who need help with a puzzle in exchange for information or clues to solve the mystery.  However, the puzzles focused less on tripping you up with word trickery as seen in Curious Village.  There were a lot more actual puzzles time around, still some brain teasers.Where Diabolical Box broke down was with what I can only assume to be translation problems.  Some puzzles were worded so poorly as to almost guarantee a wrong answer.  There's one in particular - Google it - where it asks about the proper ratio of clouds to open sky.  Well, I assume they meant proportion, not ratio, because the correct answer (which I won't give) is a proportion...meaning a certain number vs. a certain number.  Mathematically, the ratio is the lowest possible, not the highest proportion.So for example, if I had an 8 slice pizza and I asked you how many slices 4 people can eat at the most, the answer is 8, obviously, because that's all you have.  In other words, 8:4...8 slices for four people.  Notice I didn't ask \"how many slices can EACH person eat\", nor did I ask \"how many slices are there for EACH person\".  I simply said, you have 8 slices and 4 people, so how much will those 4 people eat, which is 8.Now, calculate base ratio by breaking it down by halves.8:4 = 4:2 (four slices for every two people)4:2 = 2:1 (2 slices for every person)In that question - for an 8 slice pizza, how many slices 4 people can eat at the most - as asked, all three answers are essentially correct.  8:4, 4:2, or 2:1.In the sky/cloud puzzle in Diabolical Box, it wants the highest propotion only but asks for a ratio.  The way the question is asked, does not specify WHICH ratio.  In fact, based on the true answer, ratio is not the proper term that should have been used...because when calculating ratio, you always use the lowest possible.  In my pizza example, that's 2:1.  In the sky/cloud puzzle, the lowest ratio is counted wrong.I know I went on for a while with that example, but I wanted to adequately warn you about some of the wording of the puzzles this time around, and give you a specific example of the kinds of things to look out for.  Such is the problem with puzzle-heavy games.  The puzzle changes depending on how the writer words the question, and in some cases, you might give what is a right answer but be counted wrong if the game considers each puzzle to only have one right answer (which is another issue, but not nearly severe).You might mistake my review for disliking Diabolical Box.  In truth I didn't find it as compelling as Curious Village.  But it was a fun game in its own right.  I just felt that they got a little lazy on the puzzles and making sure that players could effectively answer them without having what are clearly iffy wording discrepancies.  You still should play this if you enjoyed Curious Village, and again, if you didn't play Curious Village, you really should before diving into this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2011"}

It was praised highly for it's unique level design, fantastic soundtrack, and it's genuine fun factor. 3 years later, we come to Super Mario Galaxy 2. It features great new changes to an already amazing formula, and is a blast to play.Super Mario Galaxy 2 completely forgets about what happened in SMG 1, ditching the old observatory story and starting fresh, with Mario on his way to the Star Festival. And guess who's back? Yes. Bowser. And guess what? He wants Peach. So he attacks the festival in enormous form and kidnaps Peach. Mario then meets a baby Luma, who fans will remember from the first game. He (she?) takes Mario to the sky, and he lands on a mini-hub world in the form of Starship Mario, a sort of Mario playground letting you take breaks from galaxies and have fun running around. From here, Mario meets a huge purple Luma named Lubba, and the game picks up.Like I said, the game ditches the hub world from the first game, and sticks to a traditional world map, like in side-scrolling Mario titles. This works great, and is much easier to navigate than the Comet Observatory. From here, Mario can enter galaxies. In each galaxy, there's about 3 levels, usually one from the start, one hidden one, and one level featuring a comet challenge. To get these comet challenges, one must collect the comet coins. There's one in each level, and once Mario has enough, the comet's randomly show up on the galaxies.Now onto the gameplay. Superb. If you thought the original SMG was good, think again. The sequel features not only 3-D levels, but a host of classic 2-D levels, reminiscing of the old Mario games. These are fantastic, and every level features intuitive level design, and each offers a new different twist. Mario's got a feast of new power-ups as well. Including Rock Mario, and with a shake of the Wiimote, curls Mario into a ball, letting him flatten and break anything he touches. Also new is Cloud Mario, my personal favorite, which lets Mario create 3 clouds which act as platforms, letting him reach new heights. Nintendo's also brought back Bee Mario, Boo Mario, and Spring Mario. Did I mention Yoshi? He's back as well, and he's got a few tricks of his own. He can swing off of flowers, and eat enemies and spit them out. He's got 3 power-ups, including a Blimp Yoshi, a Dash Pepper, and a Light Yoshi, each offering unique things to the prized gameplay. There are also new gameplay mechanics such as flying with a bird, using a drill to drill through planets, and back from the original is the big rolling ball, and these are all welcome additions.This game is very tough, and I found myself dying multiple times. Thankfully, the game scatters Hint TVs around levels, and you can watch them and learn hints from them. I didn't use them much at all, but for new players it's great. Also, if you die a lot in a level (and trust me, you will), Rosalina will show up and she'll show you how to get through the level, similar to the Super Guide in NSMB Wii. This is a massive game, spanning 6 worlds with about 8 galaxies in each. Once you have 120 stars, you might think you're done. But no, you must collect 120 green stars, offering a challenging way to keep you back for more.The controls are pretty much the same as the first game, and they work even better. In the original Galaxy, there was sometimes an awkward camera system, and this sometimes led to frustration. Thankfully, it's all been fixed in the sequel, and it never gets in the way of awesome gameplay. The graphics see a bit of an update from the original, but they're still not earth-shattering. The soundtrack is incredible, but not as good as the first game. These tunes will be stuck in your head for days, and that's not a bad thing.Galaxy 2 is incredible. The best Wii game to date. A must-have for any Wii owner, casual or hardcore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2010"}

I recognize the warts on the series (and there are some pretty big ones), but I still enjoy it anyway.  I won't try to tell you that this is a flawless game, because it certainly isn't, just as Final Fantasy 7 and 8 were neither of them flawless, but I will tell you that it's the best the series had done to date.First off, the good, and there's a considerable amount of it.  Again, Final Fantasy 9 is a technical revelation.  The graphics are amazing--I've frankly never seen better on the original Playstation console, and this is arguably better than most of the computer games out there today.  The regular game screens are colorful, well illustrated, easy to navigate (a big problem with Final Fantasy 7), and just generally aesthetically pleasing, while the FMV sequences are better described with a series of primal grunts of satisfaction than words.Also as usual, the sound is excellent, though some fans of the series may be a little disappointed with it.  Indeed, a great deal of the music in this game was borrowed from previous entries in the series and refitted for this one.  Personally, I've got no problem with it, but then I also don't put much into a game's soundtrack.The story has always been where the biggest problems have occured for the Final Fantasy series, and 9 will serve as a pleasant surprise for gamers in this regard.  I can't think of a Final Fantasy game that better told or adhered to its story, and the secret to the game's success on this point is its simplicity.  There are no cute plot gimmicks here as there were in the previous two entries (the pointlessly complex story of 7 and the poor reconciliation between the personal story and save-the-world theme in 8), and that allows the story to be direct, easy to understand, and charming.Of course, there are still problems with the game.  In terms of plotting, minor characters seem to show up and drop off the map an awful lot for a game as story based as this one.  Just trace Sir Fratley's course through the story and tell me that's not the case.  Square also falls into an old pit trap in their writing as the story itself seems to spiral wildly out of control in the last hour or two of the game.  I had never even heard of the final boss before I fought him, and the story element that the game itself references on the back cover (the crystal) doesn't even enter the plot until the end.Taken on the whole, however, this has to be considered the best game in the series to date.  The many (and there are a lot of them) references to past games will provide long-time fans of the series with an entertaining Easter Egg chase, while the well developed and unique characters and well told story should speak to any neophyte.  The character advancement scheme is arguably the best in the series to date, combining individual skill customization with equippability with exceptional talent, and with all the various mini-games and sidequests, you can easily spend sixty hours playing through this deceptively deep game.  This truly is a must-have for any Playstation role player, and probably for any gamer at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2002"}

If you want a really accurate viewpoint of this game just check out Scott Robert Ganz's review. He pretty much nailed it IMO. One thing I have to comment on though is the fact that the online community for SOCOM is one of the worst I have seen. I really don't know why they included a headset. Nobody uses it except to badmouth the other players on their own team!Because of the fact that the majority spend most of the game in spectator mode (because they've been shot) most of the players are very angry and frustrated and tend to take it out on each other. You basically get a 360 view of whichever teammate you decide to watch play after you die. This means that if you get two kills but are shot from behind towards the end of the game you will get badmouthed and ridiculed by a bunch of guys that made zero kills. Your \"team\".This is supposed to be a team game, but it's far from it. This isn't the game designers fault, but the online community in general. Some players are positive and forgiving of the others mistakes, but the majority are just rude and obnoxious. It's really a downer playing this game because of all the bad attitudes. It all stems from the fact that too many players spend a vast percentage of the game \"on the bench\" and aren't really enjoying it at all.Finally, I know you don't want to hear it, but COD 4 and 5 are much better games. I know they are supposedly a \"simpleton's\" shooter and SOCOM is the \"thinking man's\" shooter and yada yada yada, but if you're actually looking to have FUN then you should go for COD. After all, they are just video games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2008"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Mediocre, shallow, uninspiring","reviewText":"Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter with a sprinkling of horror added to it to be able to use the Resident Evil name.  The game takes place in Africa where a pair of protagonists are attempting to stop some kind of sinister scheme that involves turning people into ultra-violent zombie-like creatures.  You'll battle a few different kinds of enemies using a wide variety of mostly the same feeling guns.  You'll also battle awkward controls, a limiting inventory, a crappy checkpoint/save system, and boredom.  Lastly, you'll run into too many \"boss\" fights that are exercises in repetition and frustration.  The entire game is a battle, but not in the sense that many are probably expecting.Resident Evil 5 takes some of the elements of horror-survival such as: crappy inventory management and awkward controls, and integrates them with nearly endless ammo supply (conveniently dropped by most bad guys) and a weapon upgrade system.  Sounds like a weird combination, and it is.Early on the game feels sort of horror-y as you don't really know what is happening, your weapons are weak, and the environments are claustrophobic.  As the game progresses you'll quickly realize that the variety in enemies is not that great and that you can upgrade your weapons, fairly rapidly, to substantial levels.  Yes, you do feel horror when dealing with certain enemies -- because some are ridiculously tough (like the dogs or the lickers) and can be a pain to contend with as your controls are not overly conducive to coping with anything near and not directly in front of you.Later on in the game it becomes a really poorly designed third person shooter with an irritatingly lame attempt at a cover system.  Nothing like zombie soldiers with guns.  Lame.  I won't even get started on the absurdly monotonous \"quicktime\" button mashing sequences.  Who thought this garbage was good, and why is there so much of it in this game?  Those sequences remind me of Jericho...  and that was probably the worst game I've ever played on the 360.As the game progresses you will gain access to a wide variety of weapons.  If you have been upgrading you won't see much point in switching over to a new weapon which is not upgraded.  Most of the guns feel basically the same, with minor differences.  Grenades are kind of a hassle, the proximity mines are cool if you don't mind lots of running around, the grenade launcher isn't bad (but strangely flies really slowly), but mostly it all feels the same.  I found no reason to switch to a \"new\" version of a weapon I currently had because my upgraded one wailed on the new version.The inventory system is quirky, and clunky.  I couldn't find a way to remove ammo from a weapon (if you want to empty one to switch to another) and I couldn't find a way to split up stacked items.  Let's say you have five grenades, and you want to split them between you and Sheva (who doesn't seem to use them, anyhow) -- you can't.  You can only move five at a time.  Same thing with ammo.Some maps are interesting and seem to have a lot of space to move around, and others are dull and very rail like.  At first I was wooed by the shanty towns of Africa, but once you get indoors the maps just kind of fall flat.  The factory maps are just plain irritating -- I won't ruin it for you, I'll let you experience those gems for yourself.The story itself is very trite and generic.  The plot \"twists\" are so cliche that they don't even surprise you.  The cinematics (acting, and animations) are something that you have to suffer through -- perhaps that is why they call it a horror game.  I dread when I have to watch a cut scene and groan at the stale lines and over the top delivery.All in all, I'd say that this game is a dud.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good.  It was just kind of...  ehh...  I say this being a fan of the originals, but also judging the game based on its own merits.  With the exception of certain characters and little bits and pieces, this is hardly a Resident Evil game.  It could have been named something else, with the characters named something else, and nobody would have thought it was related at all.  Normally if a game is good I feel compelled to play it through like some ravenous cookie monster tearing into a box of cookies...  not so with this.  I can barely suppress the apathy long enough to play through until the next stage so I can actually save my progress.Another unfortunate flop in a lengthening series of lackluster $59.99 games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}

But no I can't play it because of EA's backwards thinking always online DRM garbage they forced in which only causes problems for their paying customers. Anyone who pirated this game has cracked it and happily been playing it while people who paid for it are stuck with intrusive DRM that messes up our ability to use the product we paid for.Personally from what I was able to play I did not like it much at all. In fact I went over to gog.com (I love those guys) and I got sim city 4 instead and I am sending sim city 5 back for a refund and probably will never buy it again.Sim city 5 first of all felt incomplete, a lot of things seemed missing like I dont like how the city size is limited as I remember EA saying they had much larger cities running themselves but scaled them back for the final product, you can't teraform like in past games, no subways, no farmlands, no power lines, no water lines and so on. A lot of little things are absent from the game which I fear means they will be sold to us later through microtransactions or DLC packs. Because EA has a nasty habit of nickel and diming their customers to death with over priced DLC and they love to force microtransactions into every game they make, even the ones where it makes no sense like dead space 3. Like the sims 3 for instance is not a new game, its many years old but yet if you want to buy it and all the content (including packs with pets, furniture and other such trivial things) you would spend upwards of 400 bucks or maybe more.I hate the fact everything is stored on Cloud. I don't actually have anything saved that I do on my pc. I dependant on having to access their servers to play the game even by myself.Multiplayer. While a interesting idea is being shoe horned into the game whether you want it or not. Personally I feel it is just an excuse to use always on DRM and force players to play their games and save content on their servers. I don't like it myself but others might. I want to sit, plot, plan and build my cities how I want with no interference from others. I don't want to play sim city to be social.It requires Origin which I still dislike for numerous reasons. I don't even care for Steam really but I use steam and one digital service is enough for me. I don't want to spread my games out on multiple online services.It has the look and feel of the sims, which I don't care for. It feels too cartoony, too unrealistic and it just feels like I am playing a sims game.It also doesn't spark my creativity and desire to articulate every little thing in my head. I don't want to go into great detail and consideration when building. I found myself trying to very hard, but not actually \"feeling it\" so to speak. I was trying to force myself to enjoy it like I did previous games but it wasn't happening. But as soon as I loaded up sim city 4 it all came flooding back to me.My recommendation is don't waste 60 bucks on this. It's a 20 dollar game at best.On a side not, it seems EA and MAxis have decided to put advertising for Nissan in your game that you had to pay for [...]","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

Here's the breakdown:The BAD-BLAND story. I mean seriously, how more cliche can you get than \"Aliens try to take over the planet\"?Multiplayer bugs, glitches, hacks, and more hacks. The Conduit WiFi is fun, but it can sometimes be difficult to get a good, fair match going. A glitch known as the \"wall glitch\" occassionally occurs which prevents you from entering the match until it ends. Also, hackers can create automatic rocket launchers, and the score in team deathmatch is easily hacked (a hack that I have only recently noticed).The GOOD-Amazing graphics. I'm not going to say \"for Wii,\" because really, these wouldn't look out of place in a low-budget PS360 title. However, the artistic direction is lacking.Online play (when it works). I've invested about 50 hours into this game so far, and that's only because the online is sooo fun.

{"product_name":"B00319DX4M","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A brief, yet beautiful and grasping post-apocalyptic adventure","reviewText":"This game takes place about 150 years in yet another post-apocalyptic future where apparently a nasty war occurred that decimated the human population to the point where they now only number in the thousands. Also left behind after the war are deadly mechs who scour what's left of the earth for any surviving humans, capture them as slaves, and send them west to a place simply known as Pyramid. A man known as Monkey and a girl named Trip are two recently captured humans that are aboard a slave ship on its way to Pyramid, but before they get there Trip uses her knowledge of computers and technology to escape from her cell and sabotage the ship, sending it on a collision course with the ground. Thanks to Trip's sabotage, Monkey is also able to escape from his cell, and after fighting his way through the ship's mechs and barely making it (sort of) to the same escape pod Trip goes into, Monkey wakes up in the ruins of what was once New York City. Trip is there too and informs him that she fitted him with the same kind of slave headband the mechs put on their slaves that administer debilitating or even lethal jolts to their brains should they get out of line or disobey orders. Trip tinkered with the headband so that it would cause Monkey pain if he doesn't listen to her, and if he lets her die the headband will liquefy his brains.All Monkey has to do is guide Trip back to her settlement in one piece and then she will release him from his enslavement, and while he is initially pissed at the unfavorable situation he has been put into, Monkey rather quickly agrees to the terms and begins leading Trip home since he doesn't really have any other choice. The story is a rather loose reinterpretation of the Japanese novel Journey to the West with Monkey as the game's version of the monkey king (like Goku from Dragon Ball) and Trip as the monkey king's companion of the same name (Trip is short for Tripitaka). From the beginning the game's story instantly grabs you and doesn't let go, and not by throwing countless cutscenes at the player. Instead, it throws a few cutscenes here and there that actually don't last very long but only draw you in more as the strained relationship between Monkey and Trip grows and changes. Even though Monkey is on the surface a strong and grizzled survivor type, you eventually see that he's not simply some uncaring brute, but a rather determined and honorable individual. Trip is also not some controlling dominatrix who gets her kicks out of enslaving Monkey, instead she's scared and aware that she will die without him, and she begins to rely on him for more than just survival.The characters are just so real and believable, thanks in no small part to the incredibly realistic motion capture and believable voice acting. The way these characters  interact with each other makes them seem real; every word, every smile, every sad frown, every exasperated wave of the arm is just so convincing, you'll believe they have souls. The story and its characters are definitely the strongest points of this game. That's not to say the rest this game has to offer isn't great, because it is. The duo will have to journey through the remains of New York City and other locations such as an enormous junkyard filled with the remains of giant mechs from the earth shattering wars, a factory, and a mech facility. Standing in their way are many mechs of different shapes and sizes: combat mechs armed with razor sharp blades, mechs with gatling gun attachments, big mechs with wrecking balls for hands, and the very deadly Dog mechs that relentlessly hunt down their prey with incredible speed and ferocious power (not to mention huge gnashing teeth). The game is split into fourteen chapters with Monkey and Trip navigating through these different areas and basically going from point A to point B. In a nod to Prince of Persia, the game gives the player a quick layout each time you enter a new area by having Trip send out an electronic dragonfly that scouts out the area and points out any objects of interest, traps, or tougher enemies.In another nod to Prince of Persia, Monkey will be living up to his namesake by jumping and leaping from ledge to ledge or grabbing onto every available handhold, making use of his incredible agility to climb up and down many walls to reach the next point. Unlike Prince of Persia, it's impossible to miss a jump, misjudge the next available grab point, or even fall over a ledge. The game kind of holds your hand in the climbing aspect and even highlights the next grab point you have to jump to next. At least other climbing set-pieces actually do offer dangers to bypass, such as carrying Trip up walkways that crumble beneath you or timing your jump to the next grab point after obstructions like large moving gears or panels move out of the way. Other times, Monkey and Trip will have to work together to pull a combination of levers that will do things like activate bridges or other machinery allowing the duo to reach their next goal. These make up many of the game's puzzles, and while most of them aren't too challenging, a couple will require careful planning and timing.When not climbing, the levels appear deceptively wide and open but they're actually very linear and confining, offering only one or maybe two paths to your goal, and they're normally littered with dangers like proximity mines, robotic gun turrets, and of course mechs. Monkey's headband allows him to see these traps and marks them with icons, and it also lets him see the sensor range of inactive mechs so he can stay out of their \"view\". Again, due to the confining level design, the game doesn't really offer much in terms of choices for you to slip by these inactive mechs unnoticed; you'll almost always have to fight it out at some point. Many times, Monkey and Trip will have to run from cover to cover in order to avoid being taken out from a distance by gun turrets and mechs armed with gatling guns. This usually entails Monkey yelling out or Trip using her decoy hologram projector to distract the mechs so that one of them can run from one cover point to the other without being pumped full of lead. Trip has an EMP device that can temporarily disable nearby mechs if they manage to get to her, but Monkey will have to take them out quickly after she uses it since it takes a couple of minutes to recharge, leaving Trip very vulnerable. It may sound frustrating having to babysit a rather weak AI partner, but it's actually not. Chances are that Monkey will be killed more often by mechs directly as opposed to his headband killing him when Trip gets killed by a mech, since Trip is smarter than other AI partners and knows when it's time to duck behind cover and not throw herself into a hail of bullets.Thankfully, Monkey is more than capable of protecting Trip from groups of mechs. He has an energy shield that automatically protects him from gunfire when he has to go from cover to cover under enemy fire, but it can only take so much punishment before it goes down (after a few seconds, the shield will regenerate). Monkey's main offensive weapon is his extendable staff which he can use to bash his enemies into scrap metal with a combination of light and heavy attacks; the number of attack combos is extremely limited and you'll see Monkey performing pretty much the same moves over and over again, but at least they're effective. He can even weaken certain enemies, rip off their gun attachments, and use them for a bit to shoot other enemies, but this doesn't happen as much as I would have liked it to. Monkey's staff can also fire stun blasts that temporarily deactivate enemies (like Trip's EMP), as well as plasma blasts that can destroy most enemies in a single shot. Unfortunately, ammunition for both of these ranged weapons is normally pretty limited, so you have to make each shot count and try to save them mostly for ranged enemies. Monkey can use the staff in conjunction with his shield to block a few physical attacks before they break through, but Monkey can also dodge roll out of the way if his guard is about to falter. Collecting scrap metal orbs scattered around the levels and dropped by fallen enemies allows Monkey to upgrade his health, combat moves, and equipment: increasing shield integrity, learning more damaging melee attacks, increasing overall health, etc.There are a few set pieces where Monkey will use his \"Cloud\", which is a device that opens up into a floating disc of energy that allows him to hover over water or other areas he can't set foot on. The Cloud will even let him stay out of reach of a couple of the game's faster and more dangerous mechs, or keep up with them in a couple of chase sequences. The game should have had more moments with Monkey using the Cloud to navigate the more hugely wide areas he and Trip go through. About halfway through the game, Monkey and Trip will come across a short, morbidly obese guy aptly named Pigsy who joins the duo on their quest, making them a trio. At times he'll assist Monkey in battling mechs by using his gun to shoot them from a safe vantage point, but Monkey will of course remain as the team's primary muscle. Pigsy is kind of the run of the mill, wannabe ladies man whose mouth is as quick as his gun and serves as the obvious yet still effective comic relief. After performing certain indiscretions that will make you question his loyalties and motives, you'll eventually see a redeeming quality in Pigsy that will make up for them. Plus, a couple of the scenes where Monkey and Pigsy shoot the breeze and mess with each other are simply hilarious and make the characters even more endearing and realistic.The game's downloadable content called Pigsy's Perfect 10 puts you in control of Pigsy in an adventure he undertakes before his appearance in the main game. Basically, he wants to build himself a friend to keep him company in his empty home, since he's bored and has absolutely nothing else to do. Much like the story of the main game, Pigsy's Perfect 10 turns into something more profound as it gets near the end and you feel yourself getting drawn in all over again. Like you see him do in the main game, Pigsy makes his way around by shooting his grappling arm at a grab point and swinging or zip-lining his way to the next area. Pigsy has to mostly rely on slipping past enemy mechs by using gadgets like his own (amusing) Pigsy decoy or a device that temporarily makes an enemy mech into an ally. Unlike Monkey, he'll have to do his best to keep his enemies at bay with his rifle, because allowing more than one mech to get close to Pigsy usually leads to him quickly getting killed, however he can temporarily stun mechs up close with a taser attack, and he gains a couple of more useful gadgets along the way to help him deal with mechs. Due to Pigsy being a more vulnerable character than Monkey, Pigsy's Perfect 10 is considerably more challenging than the main game, but still manageable. Both games have BEAUTIFUL graphics. The environments all look fantastic, colorful, and detailed, but the ruins of New York City with all the vegetation and other plant life enveloping almost every ruined building is simply breathtaking. The characters all look incredible, as lifelike as you can get in a video game. If the main game wasn't so short and the gameplay offered more freedom and options with regards to slipping by or destroying enemies, as well as more numerous routes with different challenges in each, then this game would have been perfect. As it stands, this game is almost perfect and still worthy of being played, if not for a purchase then at least for a weekend rental. Besides, the main game's ending alone is enough to leave you in awe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2011"}

I must say that the mixes actually sound very good and scratching actually made me feel like a real DJ.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Rockstar's Wrong Turn","reviewText":"It's obvious that a large amount of work went into producing this game, and that a lot of highly talented (and probably highly paid) people were involved in its production, but that doesn't change the fact that it just isn't fun to play. It's more like watching a bad movie, with the useless punching of a few buttons now and then serving to advance the action a little. Very boring. And especially irksome is spending the majority of the game supposedly \"closing\" cases only to find out in the end that everything your character has done in his investigations has been wrong, that he has helped imprison innocent people, because the correct solutions to the puzzles were not available to the player. To quote Tom Hanks's character in Big: \"What's fun about that?\" Driving around town is a pointless exercise, as well. You'll soon come to realize that the only reason to keep doing it is to trigger the dialogue lines between Cole and whoever his partner is at the time. Yes, the city looks good, and the acting is superb, and faces look like real faces, etc., but so what? None of this serves a point unless the gameplay is good, and here it isn't.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

I prefer the Red Dead series over the GTA series mainly because I feel the Red Dead series has a more compelling story and better world to explore.  I purchased L.A. Noire because I live in the L.A. area and it was an interesting change from the typical New York focus.The game deals with post-WWII Los Angeles and adjusting to life in this new era of American history.  The visuals are stunning and it is very cool to see the city recreated as it was in the 1940s.  In one of the cases you see a banner over the street for a Nixon campaign and you can wander around Union Station as you please.  The cases are interesting, the characters are compelling, and it is a very cool period of Los Angeles history.My complaints: I don't like the walking around mechanics.  It is awkward to navigate the character through the levels and I often find myself walking into walls and turning around before I get to where I need to go.  This might be a personal problem, but I found myself having similar issues in GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption.  Also, the truth, doubt, and lie system is slightly confusing.  I understand you choose lie if you have hard evidence to show that it's a lie, but the problem, for me at least, is often between doubt and truth.  I find myself restarting some cases because I blow a couple questions that seem relatively easy.  I will say that I've improved as I get further into the game, so it may just be a matter of getting used to it.Overall, this isn't the crown jewel in the Rockstar library, but it is a very solid game and good addition to the Rockstar family.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Cartman \"Cartman\"","summary":"Anyone will love this game","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 is a  good time!

{"product_name":"B009B1D7JK","description":"The popular fantasy action franchise Monster Hunter is now one of the most iconic gaming series in the world selling over 21 million copies worldwide since the series began in 2004. Players take on the role of a hunter and are sent to explore a settlement within the Monster Hunter universe, completing quests on their journey to seek and slay monsters whilst improving their skills and earning equipment upgrades. With many challenging monsters and over 200 quests the latest edition to the series is set to be the most expansive offering to date. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate utilizes the functionalities of the Nintendo 3DS system to provide players with a truly intuitive hunting experience. The touch screen feature allows players to quickly access in-game books, weapons, field maps and mini games whilst the high quality graphics 3D visuals of Nintendo 3DS powered by the latest iteration of Capcom's MT Framework deliver a unique and stunning world for players to explore. Taking advantage of the portability of Nintendo 3DS, players can exchange their guild card that contains all their hunter's information with other players via StreetPass. Players can experience the world of Monster Hunter alone or in four player local play using Nintendo 3DS. Finding nearby hunters to adventure on quests with is now even easier via the local Nintendo 3DS search feature. Wii U players will be able to enjoy the hunt with Nintendo 3DS players via a local wireless connection. Gamers that own both a Wii U and Nintendo 3DS can take advantage of the inter compatibility of save data between the two consoles, taking the hunt from the living room wherever they go.","reviewerName":"RPGee Wiz \"MondoJohnny\"","summary":"If at first you don't succeed...","reviewText":"Try Tri again! (That was literally the best title I've ever come up with... everyone pause for a few lines and reflect on it... I'll skip a few lines now. Just glance over the blank lines like you are reading while you think about it.Ok, ok Let's just get this started...What is Monster Hunter 3 ultimate? Well basically its an expanded upon monster hunter Tri which some may be familiar with as a release on the Nintendo Wii. What you get is basically the entire game Tri, with loads of new stuff to boot. It is good! Like all Monster Hunter games it has a high level of entry, and you'll feel like you should receive a diploma after learning all the various things you need to know, but the level of satisfaction this game delivers? Seldom matched by a game.Its a meaty monster of a game. Sometimes you may feel like your biggest opponent is yourself. Maybe you feel like you are just banging your head against a big proverbial brick wall but when you break through with the scars to prove it and start wearing that brick wall it makes it all worth it...Graphics and SoundJust about anyone will agree that monster hunter looks great. It always does seem to look great and really pulls the most out of each system it has appeared on in the past. This is no exception, and with the addition of 3D its upping the ante. Looks great. Among the trifling issues are some awkwardly blurry, and or small, and or mind meltingly odd colored text. It can make some things hard to read, but I like to think that's all there to simulate your being a barely literate dirty caveman of a monster hunter. Basically what I'm saying is it barely matters. Besides everyone is always cryin about having to read anyway. Just skip through it. It doesn't help much anyway usually!The sound is good stuff. Each monster has their own signature calls, and growls, and screams, and sound can be a very important part of fighting monsters. You may even find that you can translate some monsterish after awhile. For instance GRAEEEEAAAAAAAUUUUWWWW means \"Im going to eat your dead body sucker!\" and there is SKREEEEAAAAAAAUUUUU which roughly translates to \"I'm definitely gonna eat you dead body sucker!\". The music is good. It ramps up appropriately during tense moments, and adds to the overall atmosphere well.Story and dialogMonsters! Attack!!Ok, ok there is more to the single player stuff. Its basically this: Monsters! Save village!! Attack!!!The dialog is often silly, and peppered with self awareness. It helps lighten the mood in what could otherwise be a really tense game. the juxtaposition is welcome after a particularly brutal mission. You know that you have a warm meal of miracle milk, and dragon eyeballs waiting for you when you return home and that's ...comforting?CharacterIts pretty much you against the monster world in this game. You have some compatriots but they are mostly there to sell you things, make you food, run your farm etc. Its not really an RPG technically, and the story just presents a loose framework for the missions, as are the characters. Its totally fine like this. The game play is the main feature, and the game knows it and doesn't try to bog you down with too much extraneous plot.GameplayThe basic idea is that you (and your friends) are monster hunters in a guild. And you accept quests to hunt specific monsters from your guild hq. Then you go out to whatever location, find the monster and basically beat it down. From the monsters parts you can make new weapons and armor, or various hunter items like traps, bombs, potions, and any other tool you can imagine. This is a sever oversimplification but since this is the boring part of this section, and there is just too much to say, I'll leave the general description at that.Monster hunter is full of little quirks and idiosyncrasies some of which can be frustrating when you are just starting out, and maybe don't really know what the hell is going on. There are just lots of things that are not explained. The game really emphasizes learning through trial and error. It may be quite a shocker to those more used to contemporary games with built in tutorials and very gradual grades of difficulty.Speaking of difficulty, this game is very challenging. Brutal at times. Think Dark Souls and you are sort of in the right ballpark. You can't just button mash. The game is designed in such a way that the player themselves must level up in order to do better at the game. You can't rely on high stats to get you through especially later on when even the best armors only afford you a few mistakes. Its not a casual game. All this adds up to a very intense addictive game for those that can clear the admittedly high hurdles in the beginning.This unforgiving game play could be a recipe for disaster if it weren't for how tight everything is. The hit detection, the weapon mechanics, the monster moves... it all just feels right. None of it is scripted. When you narrowly dodge out of the way of a charging dragon and then spin around and slice its tail off and it goes plowing into the dirt like a sack of crap you feel like yelling out something! Its a great feeling. Not only that but everything feels hefty! Play a game like Ragnarok odyssey and you will see what im talking about. This is a ... eh I hate to say more realistic game but from a physics standpoint it really is. Weapons feel heavy, and whats more when you smash a monster in the face with a sword the size of your body, he aint gonna just move right through it! The monster flinch, stagger, get knocked over, get knocked out, and its super tactile. You aren't flying around just slashing the crap out of a monster that doesn't react to anything you do with a sword that feels more like a big shiny feather than a heavy weapon.Apart from that the two major facets of mastering the game are learning your weapon(s) of choice, and learning each monster's behavior. Each weapon plays differently and has its own unique strategies, and each monster has its own set of moves, and tells which you must learn to successfully battle them. This level of nuance keeps the game exciting and mastering the weapon you choose feels exciting.MultiplayerPerhaps where the game shines brightest, is as a multiplayer experience. It is first and foremost a game meant to be played with friends. The 3DS version of the game supports ad hoc only however, so its best if you have some friends with the game as well. Honestly its the ideal way to play anyway, as being able to be in the same room and feed off everyone's excitement or call out for help, or hash out a tactic on the fly are all big elements of the game that contribute to the enjoyment. Playing online while fun, and possibly necessary depending on your situation is a privileged reserved for those who own a Wii U.Sum up pros and consThere is much to say about this game and the biggest challenge in reviewing it is figuring out how to sum up everything there is to say about the game without writing a small book on the subject. My best advice to anyone looking for a tight meaty game that will last them is to just pick it up and be persistent. Especially if you are the kind of person who enjoys high challenge games such as dark souls. There is a lot to love here.Pros:Great multiplayerSharp game mechanicsGreat graphicsGood looking 3DTight controlsmassive re-playabilityhigh challenge levelCool looking weapons and armorReally fun modes of playCons:no online multi at this time.Extreme difficulty (which may or may not be a con for you)Some text issuesHigh level of entry for a new player with very little in the way of explanation to helpand one more which deserves a little bit of explanation.There is an accessory which is almost necessary to play this game well. The circle pad pro. This item was bundled with the game in Japan, but unfortunately the American release not only didn't see this bundle, but the circle pad pro for the 3ds XL has not even come out here! This means that if you have an XL and you want the pad (and you will want the pad) you have to import it from Japan and pay much more for it! This would not be such a problem if it weren't almost necessary to have in order to do well. Major oversight on someone's part. The game is still playable without, and they have added in a sort of lock on system (clearly because they realized how impossible it would be otherwise without the accessory.) Quite frankly being able to control your camera effectively and keep your eye on the monster dynamically whether running away or charging is one of the biggest secrets to success in the game, and it can be frustration particularly in some fights such as underwater ones, to have to remove your hands from the controls to move the camera. Locking on is great and all but there are many times when its the last thing you want to do. Not to put too fine a point on it but I would highly suggest getting a circle pad pro some way some how if you intend to get into the game. You will be amazed at the difference it makes. This lack of an inclusion is what tipped the balance for it being a 4 star. My reasoning is that its practically needed to play the 3DS version well, and yet not only is it not included with the game, but it isn't even available in the US unless you have a regular 3DS. Ended up having to pay 50 dollars for mine when it was all said and done, and it should only cost about half that since all it is, is an extra analog stick basically. What a shame. Just about every other flaw I can look past easily.In the end its a terrific game with a lot of passion behind it, and for those who get into it,  its true love. The game has its share of little frustrations and weird quirks, and its definitely not for everyone, but for what it does well we are talking top in class.Update:I don't usually do updates because even I get tired of the sound of my own... type. However this game is too good, and I've been having some serious pangs over the 4 stars I gave it! Why oh why couldn't they have released the Circle pad for the xl..... waaaait a minute whaaazat? They did release it?? Well ok... should have done it before but... Aw hell let's bump er back up to 5 shall we?

Gears Of War uses Xbox 360's full potential of graphics and gameplay. Humans are fighting against an alien race called the \"Locust\". Your in a team with 3 other people that help you throughout the game.The graphics in this game are about amazing in all the areas. Detailed character models, really detailed enviroments that bring the game to life. If your a fan of graphics this game will not dissapoint you at all.The sound in this game is also great, fits the theme of the game. The sound is also accompanied by members you fight with to your enemies yelling stuff back and forth throughout battles.The controls in this game are quite easy. Learning the controls shouldnt take the average gamer long at all. Some people get frusturated about the leaning and crouch up and against objects saying it isnt responsive. But it is, the controls are perfectly controlled and set during the game in my opinion. You can crouch behind/against an object while sending blind fire and peeking up every other second to fire at the enemy(A good feature the game possesses).The fun factor of this game is very high, the single player campaign is fun and keeps you interested in the story the whole time. Even though its fun, I think the storyline should have been a little more fleshed out than it actually is. The game was in the making for a long time and the story just didnt seem ALL there. But the story is good enough. Multi-Player is also a good aspect of the game. Good game types, and no flaws really that I can see in it. The choice of weapons is great also, a good variety. Boom shot, a automatic rifle with a chainsaw, shotgun, pistol, torque bow (good weapon if you get good at it).Overall, this game is REALLY good, hardly any flaws and great solid gameplay. Its definately one of the best shooters out on Xbox 360 right now. I highly recommend it to the FPS fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

As your Sims move away or die or something, their kids will grow up and continue to live in your city so you can have multi-generation families living in your city.This game is much more complex than even Sim City 3000.  The RCI meter is replaced with a meter with about 12 different things.  The programmers have updated the game with even more complex algorithms for city growth and etc.From the looks of the amazing graphics and other things I have heard about this game, I imagine it will have pretty steep PC requirements, but I can assure you, this game will be the most amazing Sim City game to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2002"}

With that out of the way I will admit that they had a rough start.Even when the 3DS went through a drought I still turned it on almost every day to play. Lots of built in software and a great streetpass feature.The WiiU has been a different story. The web browser is by far my most used feature as of today.The browser is top notch and faster than my phone, computer and maybe even a tablet. It's smooth and just a great experience plus it plays Youtube bids and you can put them on the tv while you surf the net on the pad.The Wii backwards compatibility is mostly great with some bad.Most games look better than they ever have before. Nintendo says they aren't upscaled but the fact that the signal is going through HDMI means that you get the imagine digital not analog.No loss of quality, plus it's not stretched to fit a fake widescreen and the colors just pop off the screen. Mario Galaxy has a almost HD look on the WiiU with it's amazing colors, sharpness and clarity.On the bad side most game don't fit the widescreen completely and a few games have weird scan lines or just don't show any improvement at all.Another great feature is Miiverse. It's Nintendos version of facebook. It's a really cool feature. Each game has it's own section and even communities for games like Zelda and Mario. Lots of great fan art and comments and it's pretty well monitored as well. Once it's available on the computer and phone i'll be even better.Face chat is neat but less useful for me at least. Google maps and neat and fun to play around with.It comes with Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube. Netflix is actually great. A resent update did wonders for the black and whites and colors. It doesn't look wash out like it did at launch. Plus the WiiU is super quite. My PS3 sounds like a jet engine which is really really annoying.Amazon Video has great picture quality but it's really really slow to move around using the pad since it loads all the info on the pad and there is a delay. netflix does this as well but it's much faster.Youtube app sucks. Luckily you can use youtube on the browser and works great.The Nitendo shop is great. Loads fast, background loading and so far the shop has a lot of hidden gems that just aren't getting enough attention. Demos are starting to roll in at a nice clip too. Big big big improvement from the wiiware stuff. Lots of sales too. Virtual console games like Fzero and punchout for 30 cents lately. Good stuff.Menus are painfully slow but will be updated. The 3DS was slow too and the xbox blades at launch were terrible as well. Who remembers that now? So yes its a negative and yes i'm going through it right now but in a years time no one will care once it's updated.The biggest issue right now is just the lack of games.Technically it has great games. Batman, Assassins creed, Mass Effect, Call of Duty*, Need for Speed, Mario U, ZombieU, etc.I mean the system has games but the problem is most of those games are ports. I had already bought them on the 360 or they can be found cheaper there. If you never owned a 360/PS3 or got around to buying them then it's great for you.The system it's a lot of fun and packed with potential but games is the gas that makes it go and right now it's on E.

What I don't understand, is why it has such a reputation for being \"addictive\".  It's fun for a while, but boy is it ever monotonous!The dungeons are randomly generated, which gives you the idea that the game has some replayability, but they are so bland and featureless that it doesn't really make a difference.  Each area is a plain-looking labyrinth with a few features that start repeating themselves after you have been playing for five minutes.  Each level is filled with hordes of the same 2 or 3 enemies that you clean out by furiously clicking the mouse buttons and tapping your hot keys.  When you advance to a new level, the same 2 or 3 enemies are there, but they are a different color, and they have a few more hit points, or they do a bit more damage.The game never really challenges you until you face a big boss.  Fighting the bosses is the most fun (and the only really challenging) part of the game.  The bosses require resourcefulness to defeat.  The rest of it can be won by repeating the same set of simple tactics over and over again.The complete lack of a storyline in this game doesn't help.  It is about as interesting as \"Space Invaders\".  It's too bad, because a good story could have made each level more rewarding.To make matters worse, this game has no quick save key.  You actually have to quit this game to save it.  If you do this, then you start off back in town, and the monsters in every area are resurrected.  You have to find a waypoint in order to save the game, unless you feel like cleaning out the same portion of dungeon again to get back to where you were.And what do you do if your computer crashes after 45 minutes of unsaved playing?[stinks] to be you I guess.I don't want to be all negative about this game.  It has an excellent interface, which has been copied in some way so many times that it's hard to keep track.  You can customize this interface and set up hot keys however you like.  The character trait and skill point system is a great way to advance levels.  I especially like the skill trees.  Each character class has its own unique skill tree, which allows you to develop spells and other special abilities.  A character starts off learning the simpler skills, and progresses gradually to learn more powerful skills.  The graphics and animation are pretty good, but the spell effects are the best part of the game.  The game is long and has a lot of different classes to play with, which means that if you enjoy it you will find this set to be great value.It's kind of a downer jumping over to \"Diablo 2\" from brilliant and rich games like \"Planescape:Torment\" and \"Baldurs Gate 2\".  \"Diablo 2\" is sort an arcade game on the PC.  I guess that everyone has their own preference.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2002"}

Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"The Way Malls Ought to Be","reviewText":"Frank West, freelance photojournalist, opts to hitch a ride into a mysterious little town and finds this little encounter basically handing him a story beyond his wildest dreams. The problem is that the story has teeth and a population count of about 52,000 - give or take a few undead.While Dead Rising is initially set-up as a game where you have 72 hours to get \"the scoop\" and get out, it doesn't really limit you to that type of gameplay. If you like saving people you can do it, if you like watching people die while you take nice picture of it you can do that, and if you like going into restaurants and blending up exotic drinks you can do that as well. The game has a format that it wants you to play out and it rewards you with achievement points, but some of those achievements are rather odd - and rather off the beaten path. This leads to some of the best gameplay out there if you are in the mood to slap around some zombies BUT anyone, even the most diehard fans, can point out some of the failings in the game.Of all the flaws in the game, the worst has to be the AI of the survivors. When you find someone and you want to save them, you basically have to beg the gaming gods for a break because those people simply want to die. It isn't because they aren't armed (you can give them weapons) and it isn't because they don't have a nice support system (you become a one-man army). They are simply terrible at plotting anything save their own demise.The second terror the game gives you is a terrible aiming system, and that's kind of bad when you're talking survival. You'll be aiming at something and you'll swing the wrong way or you'll be punching at one thing and find yourself stuck in a meaningless combo, pressing buttons and hoping this hell will end.How I hate that stuff.Of the great things in the game, there are the variety of weapons, the way you can level up, and the fact that the game is one big Dawn of the Dead playpen with a camera attached. You can pick up compact discs and throw them (I like to pretend that the zombies suffer audio shock like I do when they get hit with a bad shiny pile of sonnets from artist I don't want to hear), find swords and knives and guns a-plenty, and you can get your hands on garden utensils and lawnmowers and all types of other equipment. Along the way, you pick up points for a variety of things (taking pictures, killing, saving people, kicking a new move in just the right way) and find yourself leveling up. This means that you get more powerful, get more life, and so on.There are a lot more facets to this game, some good and some bad, but the end result is a great play where you get to play undead tag. It has a plot to play out, some really interesting features, and makes for great play for the pricetag that the 360 now has on it. Combining that with a love for horror games and the need to run rampant in a mall full of zombies and you have something that I absolutely love BUT can see people seeing problems with.All of that said, if it seems fun to you it probably will be and I can't fault it for having faults of its own because it was one of the first (and possibly best) release titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"The Best","reviewText":"Unquestionbly the best RPG ever, and a strong candidate for the best game ever, Square's Playstation-debut 'Final Fantasy 7' still stands the test of time today as one of their strongest titles in recent memory, and a sort of 'How-To' guide to getting computer games right.Released in 1997 on a tidal wave of publicity, rumours (remember the memory card debate??) and expectations, Final fantasy 7 took people's preconceptions of the genre and utterly redefined them. Gone were the traditional top-down viewpoints, the 1-dimensional characters, and the boring spell effects, and we watched in amazement at hitherto-unparalleled graphics and a completely revolutionary storyline showed us exactly how good a RPG could be. Winning legions of new fans over to the genre, FF 7 fully deserved it's blockbusting, best-selling status.FF 7 follows the story of Cloud Strife, a young mercenary-for-hire, and his attempts to stop his ex-colleague and nemesis Sephiroth from destroying the world. Along the way he meets some memorable characters, makes friends and discovers who he truly is.The strongest selling point of FF 7 at the time of it's release was the graphics, which today, understandably, have been surpassed several times over. However, some moments in the game still hold their own against the modern consoles, and for a seven year-old game, that's no small feat. What remains today is one of the best storylines ever, coupled with some of the smoothest game mechanics in videogaming history.The emotion behind the characters of Aeris, Cloud, Sephiroth etc., is something which games developers have only recently started to latch on to - for example, 'Silent Hill 2' and 'Fatal Frame' go deep into the psychology of emotion - but in a character and story-driven game like FF 7, the depth of attachment we form with the characters is simply amazing. It's impossible to treat FF 7 as a piece of retro-gaming, such is the depth of development behind the storyline. It tackles subjects like political upheaval, religion, self-worth - and does it all in such a way as to force us to mentally attach ourselves to the little people running about on the screen.The gameplay, too, is superb, with an easy menu system and full in-game tutorials being accessible at pretty much any point in the game. The difficulty level is pitched exactly right, there's a steady learning curve and monsters and battles become significantly harder as you progress, but not so hard as to be prohibitive. Puzzles and secrets abound, and each time you play (and you WILL play it multiple times) you discover several new features that you didn't see before. With typical Square finnesse, the game options are customisable so battles and cut-scenes don;t have to take up too much time, and the whole game moves at a speed which you, the player, dictate.I can't rave enough. Possibly equalled in terms of absorbing entertainment only by it's own sequels, FF 7 is still a rewarding, hugely entertaining, and very special game. Totally recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2004"}

We have finally received a sequel to JK!!! JK2 is a good game. It has the features of JK, and brings them up to the max!To start, JK2's graphics are EXTREMELY improved! It uses the Quake 3 Graphics engines to utilize the best graphics in games today! It has BEAUTIFUL landscapes, and character details are AMAZING! Kyle Katarn has never looked so good!The gameplay is nothing to scream about. It is exactly like JK's. That's probably a good thing. I found a few probs with gameplay tho. I realized that the aiming mechanism is somewhat inaccurate at times. Because the aimer always stays in the same position, you should always have the same accurate aiming. Although, this game doesn't have that. This is definetely not a game for Tactical Shooters fans.I also found that replay value is OK. There are 4 difficulty levels at which you can beat the game at, but I don't think that is enough. I mean, can't we atleast get a few alternative paths or SOMETHING??? It's the same game played over and over again, but at harder levels. Some people may find this cheap, but I think it's OK if you just start at the medium or hardest difficulty level. I started at Padawan (the first difficulty), and it's still pretty challenging. Expect to be infront of you computer a lot frusterated about a puzzle you must solve.In general, this is a MUST for all JK fans. Tactical shooters fans may find this game a bit annoying, and people that are not fans of the first person shooter genre should not think about getting this game. FPS fans should consider buying the game, and may want to play the demo before purchasing. All in all, this is a game for the JK fans and FPS fans. I'm out now, so PEACE.

I barely knew of the Fallout games even existing.I heard alot of love going around for Fallout 3 so I decided to try it out for myself. I was expecting, like a post 6 Final Fantasy game to be severely let down wondering what kind of drugs people must have been taking to have enjoyed it so much.I was nothing of the sort. Mass Effect had become my Gold Standard for what I want out of an RPG game, Fallout 3, I think has just trumped it in all departments but one.As far as sucking you into the game world goes, despite it being a post apocalyptic world you find yourself pausing to admire scenery, and just roaming about for the hell of it. You'll actually -enjoy- exploring this world and boy is there alot to explore. You almost feel as if you had been living in a Vault all of your life, and then having left it seeing the world for the first time.A game is nothing without Rock Solid gameplay, and Fallout 3 doesn't fail to deliver at all. Grant it I would have liked to have more special abilities, (you know things like psychic powers and what not but whatever) but there's alot of ways to make differing characters and not just from the looks department.Fallout 3 does what games like Final Fantasy have Failed to do, for Six games now, it has no classes. And yet, each character that you make can be wildly different from another. Even with overlap. Infact it is quite likely that is going to happen unless you strictly plan out each character to be identical! There are enough skills in the game and not enough points to max them out.You read that? You don't Max out. (I am told you can, but it requires effort for the 360)Controls are tight, though they could use some work in Non Vats Mode as far as movement goes. The controls work, and really don't get in the way. Makes for good gameplay and it delivers here too.There's tons and tons of side quests. Infact, if you so chose I believe you'd get 70 hours out of -one- character if you did all of the side quests and it actually seems to affect the game world! I like all of the little side stories... so it's hard to pace yourself to save some for your next character.There's no real loading times so no issue there either.Okay so what's the big problems?I have two and only two. One of which appears to be somewhat random in if it will affect you or not.Glitchy game... very glitchy. My friend's had a great many glitches with this game getting stuck on invisible rocks, or holes and cant' move etc disappearing people that sort of thing. I have yet to have this issue but I have heard it more than often enough about this game that it's probably a matter of time before it gets me too.And the main story, is kind of a let down and predictable.Unlike Fable II, I hear it's post game content is actually good (once you get Broken Steel you can play it after you beat it). I'm not quite there yet, but I'm far enough along that I was disappointed with the story.If there is to ever be another Fallout, I hope they work on the story they've still got a 5 star product on their hands even with a mediocre story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"An improvement on an already-great game","reviewText":"When I first reviewed Demon's Souls, way back when, I was somewhat flabbergasted by the heaping praise it received. Yes, I liked the game very much (more for the SP experience than the MP one), but there were things that bothered me (and bother me still).Dark Souls, in SP, improves in every conceivable way, from the huge, open (if restricted) environment, to the towering bosses, to the much-improved story delivery. There are still a couple of complaints, but all in all, Dark Souls reminds me that yes, Japanese role-players do have the ability to evolve and thrive in the west, despite their sinking fortunes.The idea of Dark Souls is similar to Demon's souls, in that you are a lone individual trying to make his (or her) way in a harsh world not of your choosing. In this incarnation, you are \"Undead\", which means that after death, you will be revived, again and again. It also means that at some point, you will lose your mind and become a shell of a being (cleverly called a \"Hollow\"). The undead are now a nuisance in the world, and and thus herded into a sanctuary in the unforgiving land of Lordran. Within Lordran roam horrible demons and hollow uncountable, and your quest is to make your way in this world, acquiring power, souls and \"Humanity\", which I will describe later. Ultimately, you will make decisions which will shape the world itself.After a nifty opening sequence, you are thrust into this world with only the barest of weapons. From there, it is up to you to make your way. You can move in many directions (after an initial tutorial stage), some harder than others. Some directions will lead to story arcs that will never be known if you follow the beaten path. However, those directions are often much more difficult, particularly for a first-time adventurer. The game is long (expect to put 50 hours into an initial playthrough), but it never feels long. Death is expected (the game advertised that you should \"Prepare to Die\"), but it rarely feels undeserved (although it often feels unfair). After each death, you are returned to the last checkpoint you encountered (which appear as bonfires, which are good and bad). Combat is stellar, with many different play styles allowed. For first-timers, I find that playing a mage is easiest (though harder than playing a mage in Demon's Souls), but I find that melee is much more rewarding, particularly against the bosses.The bosses are a varied lot, and for the most part, are stellar. There is one clear misstep (the Bed of Chaos is little more than cheap nonsense meant only to frustrate the gamer, much like the Dragon God in Demon's Souls), but the other bosses stand out. Even bosses that seem to repeat will have new attacks, or new wrinkles. For example, you'll encounter enemies like the Asylum Demon in the tutorial twice more, but his later incarnations will have gained new magic abilities, or AoE attacks, which will have you throwing your controller. Some of the final bosses (such as the 4 Kings, or Gwyn) are just stellar battles.Normal enemies can be brutally dangerous. In one section, you will fight the lower halves of multiple dragon zombies, while walking through lava which damages you over time. In another, you'll fight ghosts which can only be harmed if you are cursed, either temporarily or permanently. And, like ghosts often do, they can pass through walls, or ceilings, and gang up on you when you least expect it.If the battles get too intense, you can always take some time to summon someone to help (provided that you have regained your human form, which is not always easy). Up to three people can help you. On the flip side, when you are human, you may also be invaded by other players who want your humanity. These battles are often difficult, so be cautious (or play offline).The story of this game is great. However, the player has to work to learn it. Story is given in small amounts, from item descriptions, to conversations that will change over time, often for subtle reasons. For example, that cleric you meet at the beginning of the game might be hiding a deadly secret, which can only be learned if you pay a murderous knight a huge bounty of souls. I love the way the story is delivered, but others may not.If I had one gripe with this game, it is the notion of humanity. In Demon's Souls, there were clear benefits and detriments to being in human form, as opposed to soul form. In human form, your HP doubled (at least), but you could be invaded by phantoms. In soul form, you suffered fewer hit points (and often other penalties, depending on how you played the game), but you were guaranteed completely silent movement. In Dark Souls, the only real difference in being pre-hollowed and being human was the fact that you could not be invaded. You suffered no other real penalties (yes, you can't kindle bonfires, but that's not such a big deal, since many of them are kindled for you already). So, what's the point in gathering all of this humanity? Yes, humanity is useful in certain covenants, but outside of trophy-hunting, the rewards were less than stellar. In the SP experience, there is no good reason not to play in your hollowed form for the entire game.But that's a minor quibble. In short, I love Dark Souls, having played through it no fewer than 10 times across three accounts. I find that it is both more difficult than Demon's Souls, and more fun. If this is your cup of tea, you can't go wrong, particularly for twenty bucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"takethekman","summary":"Fun Video Game Art","reviewText":"No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay.

But, you do not need to play the original to enjoy this game.The story of FEAR 2 is dovetailed into the ending of FEAR 1.  The opening level is rocked by a large explosion that marked the conclusion of FEAR 1.  This is a nice touch.  It ties the second game into the first one without beating you over the head with it.You play Sgt. Beckett.  A generic military soldier type of hero who's back story is largely forgettable.  Your squad mates are equally a \"cut and paste\" kind of group.  You are tasked with arresting a CEO of an evil corporation bent on bringing clone troopers to a military near you.  The operation goes south when the explosion, I mentioned earlier, interrupts you.  Oh, and those clone troopers are lead by psychic commanders that have a tendency to go psycho.  This is due to their mother being locked in a dark room when she was a kid and suffered all kinds of physical and mental abuses at the hands of her father who turned her into a supernatural force to be reckoned with.  And when the evil company  tried to pull the plug on the whole operation, Alma (the aforementioned girl) breaks out to exact her revenge on the world.This back story is the set up for FEAR 2.  The game takes a little bit of time to get going. But, once it does, I found it interesting enough to see it through to the end.  I like the \"horror\" elements the designers worked into the story.  Seeing fleeting glimpses of a ghostly Alma walking across your vision can raise the hairs on the back of your neck.  Speaking of Alma...  The story never explains why Alma is a child in the first game and a woman in the sequel.  I mean the sequel happens immediately after the first game, so why is she so much older?  Kind of a major hole in the back story.  But, I'm not going to lose any sleep over this.As the story plays out, you encounter ghosts and flesh eating ghouls.  The ghosts are not really enemies but the restless souls of the victims of Alma's rage or the explosion at the beginning of the story.  The ghouls are rejects of the clone trooper program.  Nice touches to the storyline.  And to be sure you do not miss this, there are various documents littering the ground to give you little nuggets of information about the story.  All of this doesn't save FEAR 2 from all the usual short fallings of the FPS genre.The single player campaign is woefully short.  And the multiplayer half is more of an afterthought.  The graphics look a bit dated.  I mean FEAR 2 looks like a FPS from around 2001 running on a high end PC.  Complete with all the bump mapping and pixelization you would expect from a game from that year.  This dated look pulls down the entire presentation.  Plus, you are bound to get nauseated from the overly exaggerated bobbing back and forth motion of your character's head when he walks.  I wish there was some way of turning this off.The vehicle sequences are sorely lacking as well.  Mostly due to you piloting a mech that is capable of raining down death on the multiple waves of enemies.  It is a little pedestrian of a plot device to stretch out the story.Some of the more specialized weapons of the game give you little reason to use them once you realize how useful your ability to slow down time really is.  It is that \"bullet time ability\" that helps you survive against overwhelming odds.  And some of those specialized weapons just are not fun to use in bullet time.  Plus, ammo for these weapons is very limited.In the end, FEAR 2 is a worthwhile rental at best.  I enjoyed it as such.  I doubt many people would find it worth $60.  The story is what carries the game.  Not the graphics or the depth of game play.  There are so many better FPS titles available on the Playstation 3 (like Killzone 2 or Call of Duty 4) that are worth your time.I prefer to rate games on a scale of 10. So FEAR 2 earns a 7.5 out of 10 in my book.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Resistance Has Never Been So Sweet...","reviewText":"With the 3rd installment of Resistance we are introduced to a new protagonist, Joseph Capelli.  With the ending to Resistance 2 showing that the war has only just begun, does Resistance 3 have the muscle to make it a notable title?  In short, Yes!!GAMEPLAYThis is where Resistance has always shined, and the 3rd installment does not disappoint.  There were plenty of tweaks done to the game design that I feel improves the game over the previous title (Resistance 2).  Returning is the weapon wheel as well as my personal favorite, health packs!  That's right, no more regenerating health (except if you enable it via cheats).  This gives Resistance 3 a bit of an old school feel to it that I enjoyed.  Resistance 3 will take you through the campaign at a steady pace, throwing you against a variety of Chimera, including some pretty awesome boss encounters.  There is plenty of action to go around with some encounters giving you a sense of being overwhelmed.  On easier difficulties this isn't to bad, but I could easily see harder difficulties making spots like these put up a big fight; a big plus for those who enjoy some challenge.Weapons have also undergone some improvements, having an upgrade system built into them.  More you use a weapon, the better you become with it essentially.  With each tier upgrade the weapon becomes vastly more effective and by the time you are making that final push to the end, these upgrades will come in handy.  Controls feel very responsive and weapons feel like the pack a good punch.  Overall Resistance 3 feels like a hybrid of Resistance 1 and 2.  What didn't work in either game has been removed, or polished up to fit beautifully into Resistance 3.  It makes for some seriously enjoyable gameplay.** I Do not have MOVE so I was unable to test the MOVE features **GRAPHICSWhen it comes to graphics, Resistance 3 felt a little lacking; especially when compared to other PS3 exclusives.  I wouldn't call the graphics \"dated\", in fact they are pretty good, but there are areas where you can tell some more polishing might of been necessary.  Facial animations seem a bit rigid at times, and the environments themselves feel lacking for some reason.  I think this had a lot to do with the art style and color pallet the game chose in various areas.  Some come across very bland and dry, while others can feel very vibrant and crisp.  Overall, graphics is not the strong point of Resistance 3, but still does more than enough to give some visual appeal.** Due to lack of a 3D TV I was unable to test how good the 3D is for this game **SOUND/STORYWhen it comes to audio I was very impressed.  Voice acting was above average, and sound effects were top notch. Weapons sounded great, explosions.. chimera..  it all sounds really good, and helps to immerse you into the gameplay.  Story wise I'd say it was okay.  Unlike Resistance 1 and 2, where there were some shocking twists and turns of events, Resistance 3 doesn't have that shock factor this time around (in my opinion).  Still the game has a solid enough storyline that will keep you very interested as you follow Joseph Capelli 4 years after the events of Resistance 2.REPLAY/LENGTHThe campaign for Resistance 3 runs around 6-9 hours depending on skill and difficulty.  I went through the game in about 7 hours, but I also was playing on Easy.  The campaign length feels appropriate plus there are plenty of reasons to revisit the SP campaign.  Unlockable cheats can make the game easier/harder depending on which cheats you activate; and there is online/split-screen Co-Op campaign.  Adding to the replay value of the game is the MP element, which sadly is scaled down compared to Resistance 2.  Despite scaled down map size, the MP element is still fun, although fairly standard to what is out there today.  You gain experience and level up the more you play.  Gain perks and upgrades which you use to better your play.  It feels generic but it can be a lot of fun!  Overall there is plenty of replay value here from Co-Op to cheats to Multi-player .OVERALL 90% (9.0 ...  A-)Overall Resistance 3 is a quality title.  It brings the entire package to create an enjoyable title, while satisfying the Resistance fans.  The game mechanics feel well polished and focused, as if the developer took the time to note what players liked and didn't like.  Some areas of the game took a hit; mainly that the graphics aren't top notch, and the MP is clearly scaled back compared to Resistance 2.If I were to rate Resistance 2 vs Resistance 3, I would say Resistance 3 is the superior title despite the MP scale back.  In fact, Resistance 3 is my favorite of the 3 games to date (with Resistance 2 being my least favorite actually).  Resistance 3 is a solid game all around in the end.  It is worth the price of admission for Resistance fans and console shooter fans alike, and will keep you entertained for quite some time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0000488VP","description":"If you think it's hard to flag down a cab in a big city, try driving one in Sega's zany straight-from-the-arcade port ofCrazy Taxi. If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"Jon Mcfly","summary":"Ok, here is what I have to say","reviewText":"Crazy taxi is a great game, with great graphics, sound, and gameplay.  But of course the game has some, well.... alot of flaws.  The game was designed from the very popalare aracde game called, &quot;Crazy Taxi.&quot;(Of course)  The game does feature this aracade verison along with a new verison for dreamcast.  The game clevery mixed in humor, a some what different type of gameplay, and of course good plain fun.  Before I go into the basics I must clear up something, this is not a racing game.I'll start with the gameplay.  In Crazy Taxi you must pick-up persons and bring them to different areas.(Like the airport)  This is were the fun factor comes in.  There is 2 courses and a mini game area called crazy box.  The game also has 4 different drives, each with there own car and strenghts.  I must say Crazy Taxi does hold impressive gameplay.Next is the sound and the graphics.  The graphics are good, they are very smooth, clean, ect.  Yes, there is a small flaw in the graphics, a very unstable framerate.  In very dense areas of the game it feels like time stops, cause' of how slow it gets.  The sound is crisp, lots of different voice samples.  But in the sound comes another flaw, it's the soundtrack.  The soundtrack features; offspring and bad reiligon. This wouldn't be a problem if they had a bigger selection, there's only like four songs of the game.(This is the biggest drawback)Overall the game is worth ten bucks.

What a name. I wont waste time with telling the story. All you need to know is that this is an arcade game at heart and was made for multiple playthroughs. If you were a child of the arcade era, (like me) you owe it to yourself to play this piece of greatness.The graphics are almost comic book like ( like darkness 2). The dialogue is hilarious between the main character (Juliet) and her boyfriend. And the enemies and bosses are just as wild. You can thank suda 51 and grasshopper manufacturer for that.Combat consists of you against hordes of zombies, some are stronger than others and they give a cue when they are about to attack so you can dodge and pull off awesome combos. When you dismember zombies, rainbows shoot out of there severed body parts and you get big shiny coins to spend for upgrading juliet's health, moves, etc...You can use your quick pom pom attacks to daze zombies which makes them easier to kill with your heavy chainsaw attacks. And if you manage to kill 3 or more zombies while they are stunned, you get major coinage and a higher score.This game has ALOT of heart put into it. It is a gamers game. And i love how crazy and different this game is. This game ranks up there with Vanquish as one of my favorite \"arcade\" type games in this modern era of gaming. I wish there were more games like this out there. If you want wacky beat'em up fun with a focus on fun and some hilarious and sometimes profane dialogue, look no further than Lollipop Chainsaw.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Michael Anthony \"Hybridblues\"","summary":"fun but annoying","reviewText":"as alot of other reviewers stated this game has very annoying checkpoints in single player mode (especially the elevator level).

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"As close to perfect as a game can get","reviewText":"Before I played Mass Effect, I had no idea what type of game it was. As I loved Bioshock due to its Karma system, a friend of mine recommended me Mass Effect and now that I have played through Mass Effect 2, boy am I glad that I was recommended this game. So what is so special about Mass Effect.....CHOICES/KARMA SYSTEM: In this game, you will have to make so many at many different levels and each choice you make will give you positive, negative or neutral karma and will have MAJOR impact on the game's story, missions and gameplay experience. You can be a paragon of justice or a renegade who gets the job done with whatever means necessary. Best part, you don't have to be either good or evil throughout the game, should you choose you can make both positive and negative karmic choices throughout the game. A lot of these choices will be made by simply having conversion with plethora of people in the game; however, you will also make choices by your action and type of character you choose.MAKING YOUR OWN CHARACTER: In Mass Effect, you can be male or female of any ethnicity or color. In a lot of games you are stuck playing a character that you may not like. Not in this game. In this game, you can be any type of character you want to be. Furthermore, you can also choose class of your liking for your character. For example if you love different types of weapons, you can be a soldier. If you like sci-fi psychological powers, you can be biotic. You are a hacker, then you can be tech. And again, what you become will have great impact on your gameplay experience.CREATE YOUR OWN TEAM: Along with your main character, you can also controller two other characters. Again, you can choose who those two characters can be. You can have a good looking female soldier, a tech specialist quarian, a violent krogan, a tactical turian, a biotic asari or a cyborg. Again who you have on your team will greatly affect how much you get out of your mission and outcome of your mission.WEAPONS AND POWERS: As mention in above section, yourself and your allies can be from various classes and each weapon, armor and power you can use is upgradable. Throughout the game you will come across plenty of variety of weapons and armors (depending on how much you explore), each with their unique advantages.OPEN WORLD GAMEPLAY: In this game, you have plenty of galaxies to explore. You can travel from galaxy to galaxy, landing on different planets as you wish. Plenty of missions and exploration. Just loved it.VEHICLES: You have a vehicle for different planet exploration. So along with third person shooter gameplay, you also have access to this vehicles to search different planets for resources and blow your enemies into bits.GREAT RPG EXPERIENCE: Leveling up can become addicting, especially since you have control over what particular traits you want your character or allies to have improved.AMAZING STORY: It is possible to get side tracked by side missions, but the main story is freaking awesome and somewhat suspenseful.GREAT REPLAYABILITY: The game was about 50-60hr long the first time around for me. If you play as paragon, you would want to play it again to experience the story as a renegade and vice versa. Especially if you decide to go after the achievements, you will be playing this game over and over again.As for cons, the game does have some glitches and combat doesn't feel as smooth as I would like, but that will not bother you as this game has so much fun to offer you. If you like RPG, star wars and shooters, this is the game for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000WCE9XK","description":"Uncover all the mysteries of Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword as you fight enemy ninjas and battle various fiends while taking on the role of Master Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, in an all new storyline for the Nintendo DS.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"An original entry in the modern day Ninja Gaiden series","reviewText":"While the Nintendo Wii will never see any of the modern day reboot Ninja Gaiden games, the Nintendo DS got lucky. In 2008, Tecmo released Ninja Gaiden: Demon Sword and is an original entry that takes place alongside the Xbox 360/PS3 titles. It was bold, different and a great game to boot. No other DS game looks like this one and that's saying something.You control Ryu Hayabusa, the main character of all of the NG games as he protects his village from evil people who want to use the Demon Sword to unleash chaos throughout the world. You hold the DS like the book to see the screens and eventually play and you use the stylus to control all of your character's movements. Choose a difficulty level and get ready to be treated to cut scenes, interact with NPC's, use magic spells to enhance your attacks, battle huge bosses and see how long it takes you to complete the game. Your progress can be saved onto the cart directly and you can upload your progress online and see how you stack up against other players' stats.The PROS: This game looks great. The graphics aren't typical of your average DS game and that's a good thing. The presentation is very well done while the music and sound effects draw you in as you control Ryu and fight against the enemies. It's one of the few games you hold the DS like a book but it doesn't deter you from playing at all. And the fact that you can check out other players stats online is nice. Don't think because it's on the DS it's an easy game because it is not. It starts out easy but once you're in the middle, the difficulty picks up and it challenges you to fight well. The puzzles let you take a break from the action and aren't too tough to figure out.Since the camera sits behind you, it pans in and out depending on the view so you will always see where the enemies are.The CONS: You can't do much with the online connection since it's only used to upload your overall game stats (the time it took for you to beat it, your karma score, etc.) Also, this game relies heavily on using the stylus so it will take a bit to get the hang of it. This may turn off some gamers who prefer to use the directional pad but if you are patient, you will learn how to play with it.Games like Ninja Gaiden Demon Sword don't come out too often for the Nintendo DS. And while the direction and use of stylus only controls may deter gamers and fans of the Ninja Gaiden series, there is a game there worthy to be seen and played. Tecmo did a good job bringing one of their most popular franchises to the DS so more people should check it out. Give it a go but if you're still not convinced, get a used copy or see if someone you know has it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

This game has so many puzzles and quite a few of those puzzles were just too frustrating to solve. I was nearing the end before I had to face another puzzle. It would take a very long time to solve it even if I would follow the online walkthrough. In the end I just gave up. There were too many of those frustrating puzzles.

It is still pretty unclear whether this game will be like GTAIII, or take a different path. From the 3 screenshots released, the graphics look to be about the same, while the style looks a bit differnet. Obviously, GTASanAn is going for a more modern look. The rumor is early 1990s, but the gangs, [prostitutes, and corruption still reign supreme. Expect for this to still be bloody and corrupt! But there is one subtle difference. While not completely obvious, it looks as if you will play as a gangsta, a street hustler, or a mean 50 Cent-type guy. From the screens, you appear to play as a black male this time around, complete with a gangsta entourage and lots of bling and guns.(And hopefully rap music!!)I was ecstatic to see this, because I love the whole gangsta image and rap music. The plot seems a bit more complex too. You play as a gangsta, who goes back to his hometown to find it lying in ruin. With a corrupt cop on your back,you set off to set things straight. This premise seems interseting, except that the game is set in a place that is a combination between L.A. and San Fran. I was REALLY mad to hear this, because god knows that Cali is everywhere in our culture these days, and I am sick of games like True Crime trying to constantly duplicate the Weast Coast. Besides, New York rules both of those towns! Anyway, I am very excited to hear about the new GTA, and judging from what I saw, this game looks to be everything that the old GTAs were, and much, much more. 50 Cent wannabes, this could be the answer you have been waiting for!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2004"}

VF 2 brought us texture mapping, VF 3 brought the addition of a fourth button (Evade) as well as uneven terrain which  played a factor in damage/blocking, and 4 brings us back to level playing areas and takes away the evade button bringing us back to the familar 3 button set up.  It's as if they wanted to make VF appeal more to the masses as with 3 it started to become a little too complex/hardcore.The graphics are amazing, easily topping even the XBox's Dead or Alive 3.  Those who nitpick will notice the differences between the PS2 and the arcade, however most will not even notice.  They are that good.  Control is spot on, music and sound effects are excellent, and the game retains it's polished feel.  The animation is as fluid as ever with the characters performing moves as if they were real martial arts masters performing their moves in an exhibition.  The game seems easier to play than 3, as the game was tweaked for  moves being easier to do and perform.  VF4 brings two new characters to the mix , Vanessa Lewis, and Lei Fei,  while Takarashi is absent leaving us with 13 fighters.Many extras abound with numerous training modes and extra costumes and accessories waiting to be unlocked.

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"S. Kennedy","summary":"Good PRequel to the series... but also the most frustrating","reviewText":"I have been playing the zelda series since the Super Nintendo. Although it wasn't until Ocarina of Time that I really became a fan. I have beaten every zelda game to date (except oracle of ages). Each has its pros and cons, with an exception of OoT which is arguably the best game of all time. Skyward Sword however is one of my least favorites of the series. It is obvious Nintendo was trying to find a happy medium between the Dark serious world in Twilight Princess, and the bright, happy, and cartoon world of wind waker. The graphics are by far some of the best in the series. But the game play had me practically throwing the controller at the wall in frustration.I had the remote plus add-ons when I first started the game, and was having trouble getting Link to aim properly using the sail. So I assumed maybe with a remote with \"plus\" built in it would work better. It did to some extent, but it is still far from perfect. I think it is amazing that sword strokes can be performed differently with your arm movements, this tends to work a majority of the time. However having each monster killed with a different sword stroke is more annoying than enjoyable. Instead of the fun of running around the temple massacring enemies as you search for treasure chests, you must spend a minute or more on each enemy to figure out where and how to strike. While I'll admit this is more \"realistic\" to random slashing, it doesn't make for a fun puzzle adventure game. For example, Skultalas, usually one of the easiest enemies in the series, take timing and luck to kill, and that's after you finally figure out how to spin them around.If you are a fan of the series, the storyline is very well done. The use of a hub world also makes getting around a lot faster. Overall it is still a good game, but the controls really killed it for me. Trying to beat the first temple was unbearable. Not because it was hard to figure out (it was one of the easiest temples to solve out of any zelda game), but because you had to get passed a few skultalas which was time consuming and irritating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2012"}

It gets decent throughput, and saves some energy over an external adapter, because it only uses power when you have the Xbox 360 on.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Pure brilliance","reviewText":"It's finally here.  After what has seemed like an eternity of waiting, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is here, and not only is it a stunning achievement in terms of technical aspects (this game utilizes what the PS3 is capable of like nothing you have ever seen before), but it also conveys one of the deepest and most engrossing storylines that you will ever come across in a video game.  Yes, as you have no doubt heard by now, the game features some quite lengthy cut-scenes that seemingly pop up out of nowhere in the middle of gameplay.  While this can get annoying, nearly everything else about Metal Gear Solid 4 is simply flawless.  The storyline, what little can be mentioned without giving away a barrage of spoilers, finds an aging Snake in the middle of Liquid Ocelot's new, destructive plans.  Familiar faces are abound as well, which will lead to many surprises and shocks, even for the most hardcore of Metal Gear Solid fans.  As said before, Metal Gear Solid 4 boasts the best audio and visual presentation you will ever see in a video game.  Quite frankly, this game is a gorgeous sight to behold.  Gameplay wise, the game offers up some equally impressive shooting and stealth mechanics, while the boss fights are nothing short of epic.  Online multiplayer modes seem to be the only aspect of MGS4 that don't conjure up the awe-inspiring moments that the rest of the game does, but they are fun on their own regardless.  Words alone can't do this game justice though.  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is by far and large the best game to come out on the PS3 thus far, and without a doubt is one of the finest video games to ever see the light of day.  Yes, it really is that good, and if you have been waiting for that PS3 \"killer app\", your wait is over.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"Decent Game Marred By Over-Production, Complicated Controls & Menu, Repetitious Gameplay","reviewText":"MGS4 suffers from a hideous and non-apologetic over-production boss that took this game over and turned it into a Blu-Ray movie that periodically requires user input...There should be a WARNING on the label. And while MGS4 is still a decent game, especially at the $29.99 price point, I've played at least 10 BETTER shooter-type games on the PS3, some even less than $20 now (Dark Sector, TimeShift, HAZE). Also, how anyone who has played this game could even remotely claim, \"MGS4 is not a shooter\" is beyond me. There are guns, MANY guns, correct? Your character can't survive without SHOOTING these guns, correct? MGS4 is a shooter just as much as a \"stealth game\", the degree of each depends on how you choose to play through...And that's one of the game's STRENGTHS, even though some people cringe at the thought for some unknown reason.The basic problem with this game is the things that should be EASY are needlessly COMPLICATED and things that should be INTERESTING are absolutely BORING.  You can spend nearly half the game (which is not very long in gameplay time) just trying to figure out how to consistently target and shoot someone with any accuracy. For example, until you learn to use the first person view of the gunsight (triangle) to target someone, sometimes Snake is just staring at the wall while being pumped full of lead or you're staring at the back of his head while trying to shoot someone right in front of him (when you only use L1 to target). Of course using the sights while moving and trying to shoot an enemy means you have to 1) toggle the L stick to move while 2) toggling the R stick to use the \"floating camera\" to see around you as you move then 3) press triangle to pull up a gunsight and 4) push and hold L1 to target the enemy and FINALLY 5) push and hold R1 to actually SHOOT someone...Honestly, this is just about as ridiculously difficult as one could possibly make it to target and shoot a bad guy in a simple video game!The learning curve is further complicated by a Menu Interface that must be pulled up (and gameplay STOPPED) if you want to do anything other than walk, stealth, \"jump-roll\", aim, fire and reload. For goodness sake, you can't even switch to a different weapon without interrupting gameplay! And if you want a weapon that's not in your \"immediate\" inventory, well, you've got to toggle through the Pause Menu to find it and switch it out with something else. In fact, you'll find yourself constantly pulling up a menu and L1ing and L2ing and toggling and toggling and Xing, ad nauseam...Another WARNING: Get killed before a checkpoint and lose everything you just spent the past 20-min doing, including any weapon upgrades. Boy, that sure makes things fun, huh? Just to frustrate you some more, when you kill a bad guy you can't just walk over him and collect his inventory like you can when you walk over his weapon or like 95% of other games...You have to press triangle and Snake physically picks him up and gives him a Heimlich Maneuver to make him puke out his prize...Just see how annoying this becomes after about the 20th time or 50th time or 100th time...It's still unclear to me why a guy must crap his pants under fire and then walk around with brown stains on them. Is that some kind of Japanese toilet humor? Seems like he'd have enough sense (or shame) to strip the pants off a dead guy and clean himself up instead of walking around his squad smelling like a turd rassler for the rest of the Act. Perhaps that's part of the \"Epic\" story here? Let's see...How about this one...Page 53, guy craps in a barrel, runs off butt-naked then finishes it off by soiling himself while avoiding enemy gunfire. YES...An integral part of the storyline...I'm a GENIUS! Woo-hoo!And the developers did a fine job of effectively limiting player involvement during the 2 most important scenes of this \"Epic\" story: 1) Snake going through the microwave corridors to reach and shutdown \"GH\" and 2) the final battle between Snake and Liquid. If EVER there was an appropriate time to ask, \"WTH were they thinking?\", it's in both of these scenes...Consider that in arguably the MOST IMPORTANT EVENT in the entire game (Snake going through the microwave corridors to \"GH\"), your (his) success is simply based on HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN PRESS TRIANGLE in about 2 or 3 minutes...That's IT!! Press it fast enough (maybe 400-500 times) and Snake is THE HERO! But fall short and you'll soon see every one of your remaining MGS beloved characters OFF'D in rather spectacular fashion. I'm sure Kojima forever endeared himself to his loyal throng of MetalGearHeads with that visual treat!!After this, Snake is basically D-E-A-D...I mean, he pukes up lunch and falls face first right into it (what a way to treat the HERO of your game series, huh?) and Naomi is beckoning him from beyond the grave. His syringes no longer work and Otacon is of little help since he can't stop crying into his MacBook like a teenage girl who didn't get asked to the Prom. So Liquid strolls onto the scene and pumps Snake and himself with \"the good stuff\" syringes and Snake and he square off like kids in a schoolyard brawl. The problem is first you're just watching them fight, then you're somewhat in control of Snake, then you're watching them again, then you're pushing buttons again, rinse & repeat every few seconds. So not only did the developers feel no shame about constantly inserting cutscenes during gameplay throughout THE GAME, but they also did it liberally throughout the Final Battle itself...Simply SHAMELESS!! You basically get to press R1 to attack, then triangle to get Liquid on the ground (by video), then R1 again (to watch another video with Snake choking Liquid), then triangle again (to watch another video of Snake smackin the bejeezus out of Liquid)...Then Liquid stands up (in yet another video) and exclaims, \"Splendid, Brother!\" (which is actually pretty cool the 1st couple of times, then it loses its effect), and you're like, \"OK...So am I supposed to start fighting again, now?\" Just BIZARRE for a player to be put through something like this in the climactic fight scene of a SERIES...It reeks of CONTEMPT for the player on the part of the developers.There's also a terrible problem that the developers have just letting someone friggin die in this game...You kill a boss, then they transform into another boss that you kill again...Then they play this cutscene that's 3 or 4 min long of them FINALLY dying! Then Drebin has to come in and tell you the SAME STORY again and again about how they were abused children who watched their familiy members die and were taken away by the Army and trained to be who they were before you just killed them...It's like you Tivo'd a show and just watch it again and again after you kill each boss (twice)...PURE FILLER!  And just think...You get to do this FOUR times!!Or Snake has a Bowie Knife stuck 8 inches into his chest and the next scene he's good as new again...Or Raiden or Vamp \"dies\", then you see them again a couple of scenes later, then they \"die\" again. This became more like a PARODY of an action game and we even laughed hysterically when Raiden shows up near the end WITH NO FREAKIN' ARMS AND A SWORD IN HIS MOUTH ready to take on a couple dozen Baddies (who, oddly enough, are armed to the teeth but just stand there and stare at Snake and Raiden for several minutes instead of attacking)...Snake even has to take the sword and put it back in Raiden's mouth when he's through talking...Are you kidding me??? LOL...Then after this he even shows up AGAIN in a hospital room all put back together. This is just too much!!  And another person decides she can't take it anymore (can't say I blame her) so she hits herself in the neck with the \"Death Syringe\" not once, not twice but unbelievably THREE TIMES before she finally shuts the hell up and dies! In fact, I think she was still mumbling something incoherently when Snake just turned around, got in the mech and left her babbling on and on while the bldg was collapsing...These are NOT the things of an \"Epic\" story. They're more along the lines of a \"Kentucky Fried Videogame\". A parody. I wouldn't be surprised if Kojima laughs so hard he pees his pants when he reads some of the 5-star falling-all-over-themselves SERIOUS reviews of this game given the pure absurdity of a hero with no arms showing up for a sword-fight! (Maybe \"it's just a flesh wound\"?)You've probably heard about the cutscenes and their insane lengths by now. It's no lie. Kudos to anyone who can actually sit through every minute of watching Sunny try to cook a couple of freakin' eggs and get Snake or Otacon to chance eating one (and she's the \"brains\" of the operation?!?). BORE ME TO TEARS, why don't you...Maybe there are a couple of eggs waiting to ambush me in the next level? Add to that the fact that you get to WATCH SNAKE CHAIN-SMOKE FOR NEARLY NINE MINUTES when the game first loads...Another 4 minutes of this when Act II loads. In fact, you're treated to this chain-smoking show EVERY TIME an Act loads...Just UNBELIEVABLE!! With all of the slick cutscenes to repeatedly interrupt gameplay and THIS is the BEST YOU GOT to show us while the game loads, Konami?Now I realize there are a few hundred people here on Amazon that had some sort of \"spiritual experience\" when they played this game, but to be sure, not everyone is going to fall in love with MGS4 when they play it...And even though I feel BETRAYED by 339 5-Star glowing reviews (out of a total of 455), I'm still not trying to completely trash the game and everything I've stated in this review is TRUE. For me, these things keep MGS4 from being anywhere near \"the best PS3 game ever\" or \"the reason to go out and buy a PS3\"...Give me a break! This actually COULD'VE BEEN a 5-star game IF 90% of the cutscene lengths were left out AND easier target/shoot controls were employed AND more gameplay was added that wasn't as repetitive AND less complicated inventory acquisition and control were added.As it stands, this is a game with needlessly complicated controls that substitutes repetitious gameplay and excessively boring cure-for-insomnia cutscene lengths in the place of both QUALITY and QUANTITY of gameplay.  Furthermore, this \"movie\" is clearly a victim of over-production. Imagine a 2-hr summer blockbuster where almost nothing is edited out...Much of all the raw footage is included and it's now ballooned to an agonizing 8 hours long. That's what happened to MGS4. Only the most devoted fans are left in the theater when the credits roll...Everyone else left a long time ago.Instead of being subjected to 9 minutes of chain-smoking Snake while the game initially loads, a brief \"narrative\" could have been shown to get EVERYONE up to speed with the background story. This is basically what happens in the beginning of Killzone 2 with a roughly 3 or 4-min movie and it's quite effective even if you missed the original Killzone. Once the story is set up, it's time to get in the game and not look back. The problem with MGS4 is it CONSTANTLY LOOKS BACK...In fact, nearly every new character brings with them a GAMEPLAY STOPPAGE and a BORE-ME-TO-SLEEP STORY that can go half an hour and only provide a couple more pieces of the main plot (if you can stay awake and not click \"SKIP\"). Of course this absolutely DESTROYS any continuity to gameplay and results in a more forced storyline that soon falls on deaf ears because nearly everyone has already left the theater. While they were SMART to include a \"skip\" option whenever a cutscene appears, it was a strategic error to not tell the background story while the game initially loads...What follows is a soap opera feel where every character is compelled to hit a 10.0 on the Drama-Meter while telling their story that is 98% fluff material or repetition. It's a true over-production tragedy...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2009"}

I don't know but I just couldn't get into it. If you have an Xbox 360 then you've already played Bejeweled Twist as it's almost exactly the same as Hexic that comes free with every Microsoft console.

{"product_name":"B0050SW8OS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason the rational Sony fan \"Dark Overlord of...","summary":"Good, but not perfect...","reviewText":"I agree that Uncharted: Golden Abyss raises the bar for action games on handheld systems. However, I do believe that there are a few annoying aspects that bring the title a bit short of \"perfection.\"You get lots to do and it will probably take you a few playthroughs to find everything. Lots of areas that you need to take photos of and lots of hidden treasures and items to find. The game is very beautiful and I even found a few areas that were so pretty I stopped to take a photo with the in-game camera. The voice acting is really good, the story engaging and some awesome action sequences. Hanging from a chain while in a gun fight with a team of bad guys is really exciting!What brings this game down for me is how certain segments requiring alternate controls are forced on you. In Ocarina of Time on 3DS certain items like the bow could be aimed by moving the system around. That was a very intuitive way to aim the weapon and it fit well with the gameplay. In this game you'll be running along a log or thin bit of wood perfectly fine and for no reason your character loses his balance. You are forced to stop and tilt the Vita to the left and right to regain your balance. Ina  fight you may be required to swipe your finger across the screen once or twice which isn't too far removed from the Dragon Lair arcade games. I find this to be unsatisfying and just a way to show off the Vita's controls. To be fair, these segments are not too common and tasks like climbing a rope have multiple ways to complete them so you are free to do them as you see fit. it's just that the forced segments don't really work for me.There are lots of missions in this game but they are fairly short and the game auto-saves at different points in a mission. This lets you play for a few minutes here and there and make a bit of progress which is great for handheld games. Trophy collectors may be annoyed that you need to use the Vita's NEAR feature in order to earn every trophy in the game. This means that completionists will need to depend on other players to get rare items and share them over the black market.In short- awesome game with a few annoying elements. While I am not sure I would recommend it to my friends for $50 I am more than satisfied with my purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2012"}

This years version's presentation was much better though. The play by play is light years ahead of the awful guy last year.Gameplay wise I was a bit disappointed in the passing and return game. The players on kickoff return are way too slow, there is no way to get a touchdown return with Devin Hester the fastest player in the NFL. He is  always and I mean always caught. He's just too slow, I think they were trying to make up for last year, where it was way too easy to get a kickoff return TD. Well they did it they made it impossible.Likewise the passing game has become impossible to get a deep pass down the field, where in years past it was way too easy to get a bomb everytime. Now the defense can get an interception on any deep pass pattern way too easy, the frequent tipped pass interceptions are totally out of whack. Plus having no velocity on touch passes means it takes forever for the ball to get to any pattern where your trying to put the ball over the defenders head. Again totally out of whack. You only have a bullet pass that either  gets intercepted, or hits reciever in the head or defender.  Then the slow over the top touch  pass that will get knocked down or intercepted. there is absolutly no way to get the ball down field to an open reciever, it just never gets there. I had my reciever 5 to 8 yards down field for an easy touchdown, your QB can't get it to him.All this being said the game is still fun in the short passing and run game, and it looks beautiful. Still the game is broken, they failed this year. I'm still keeping mine in hopes of patch to fix some of this stuff but I won't hold my breath for EA. Disapponting. Of Course EA still wins the Superbowl, because ? You guessed it, it's the only game in town. I would say if you want this game, buy but  don't pay full price.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Saints Row sort of has the same type of gameplay. So for GTA players, you will know how to play this game already. Saints Row has a lot of the same types of concepts as GTA.Graphics, pretty good. Not amazing, but not decent, they are better than average. When the graphics look good, is when it rains. No blood, well there wasn't any when I played. Overall, this game has meets up to its standards in graphics. I was satisfied.Sound, the sound is mainly from the songs that play all the time. When you drive, there is radio stations, just like on Grand Theft Auto. I always listened to Sizzurp 101.69 since they played Masta Killa and Mathematics haha. But the sound does good.Controls, I was satisfied with it. But sometimes the controls could be quite frusterating. For instance, driving while having to shoot at another car and destory it or damage it etc. But thats the only thing. Moving the character around, driving, shooting all easy to get used to and control.Gameplay, this is where its good. The storyline, I was entertained and it kept me playing. Mainly the Saints Row is trying to take over territories and mainly the city. Which there are 3 gangs, Carnales, Vice Kings, and the gang your in, The Saints. The choices of guns are a plus, they got rifles, pistols, grenades, smg's, rocket launchers, knifes, bats anything you can think of. Sort of like the guns from GTA. One thing that I didnt like, was having to do Activites to gain enough respect to play the main missions. Some of them either werent good, or got to hard. But you have to do at least some to gain respect. You can buy clothes, chains, shoes etc, tattoos. So mainly your free to do anything. The length of the game was satisfying, not to short, but not really long but long enough. I beat it in about 3 days, but I played alot of the day though.So overall, if you like Grand Theft Auto then you will like this game. I can't think of a reason to tell you to not rent/buy the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2006"}

A Castlevania game where you go from a castle to a modern day city could have been very interesting done right, but the quality between the two settings is so different that I have a feeling they were developed by two different teams who didn't communicate through the development. The castle part of the game has probably some of the best level design I've seen in the entire generation, with interesting bosses, side characters and story. I wanted to explore every nook and cranny of the castle, as some parts of it felt so different from others, like an actual varied castlevania castle. But the modern day parts of the game are just so mediocre, everywhere from the environment, to the enemies (with the exception of a few cool bosses), and even the story. Puzzles are boring and laughably easy, random 'team up' segments of the game (trying to avoid any spoilers) feel extremely pointless (I can't help but think there was an actual purpose to the game, but due to slow development and an impending release they probably just cut it out). Do yourself a favor and by the artbook of this game instead (funnily enough, the art director of this game eventually left the company and is now working on a promising looking indie game called Rime). Overall, a disappoint compared to the previous castlevania games, including the first two Lords of Shadow games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2014"}

Nothing. Zilch. Zip. Nada. By and by its your standard FPS fare, where your main objective is to kill everything that moves and advance from stage to stage. Normally games like this would bore more to tears, prompting me to, as soon as possible, return it to the nearest used games store for a meager return. What sets Killzone 2 apart from the many faceless and bland shooters on the market is that it is so polished that it could shine in the dark. From the incredible graphics to the gameplay, Killzone 2 has the feel of a summer blockbuster Hollywood film.First off, the graphics: 5/5.While not the most important element in the constitution of a video game, graphics can really do wonders for a truly awesome video game experience. With the right amount of effects, detail and realism a video game can really draw you into its world. In this aspect Killzone 2 delivers in a most unprecedented way.Killzone 2 is literally the best looking FPS on the PS3, and probably one of the best looking games on the console market currently. Detail is abundant, from clothing to environments to facial expressions. The lighting and shadow effects are clearly the best I've ever seen in a video game. Particle effects are especially well done. Ash, fire and smoke permeate the air as explosions erupt all around you, choking your vision. The environments draw you in, and you really feel like you are taking part in a great war. From the bleak, war torn landscapes of Helghan to the extravagant Helghan palace interior, Killzone 2 looks phenomenal.Gameplay: 4/5.As noted, Killzone 2, while being incredibly fun, is still your run-of-the-mill FPS with one exception: the cover system. Using a 'lean-n-peak' variant you can take cover behind virtually any object. Its somewhat similar to the cover system in Rainbow Six Vegas, but you always maintain the First Person View, thus keeping you entrenched in the action. Its an inventive mechanic, though it looks rather funny seeing it in action; I would prefer it if the camera switched to a Third Person View during the cover animation. However you will certainly thank developer Guerrilla Games for including such a mechanic when you boot up the game. After a brief intro to the controls you are planted head first into a sort of Normandy Beach scenario, and you soon learn that the cover system will be your best friend in Killzone 2. The first battle you encounter is very intense and sets the pace for the majority of the game.Enemy A.I: 5/5The enemy A.I is super smart, especially on the harder difficulties. They, like you, can take cover, and they can also blind fire, which they will do often. They also flank, use melee attacks, dodge grenades (as well as throw them), and they generally act very smart. I was very impressed by the A.I, since in most shooters your enemies turn out to be rather bland cardboard cut-outs that run into your shots and jump onto your grenades. Boss battles are fun and equally as intense, yet they don't deviate from your typical 'figure out the pattern' style boss fights.Sound: 5/5In addition to the super polished graphics, Killzone 2 packs an awesome audio package. The musical score is engaging and very epic (almost Star Wars like at times, which really fits the theme), escalating at the right times and always fitting for each scene. Weapons sound very realistic, as do explosions. The voice work is top notch, save for a few throw away voices.With a 7.1 or even a 5.1 surround set-up Killzone 2 will blow you away. With a surround sound system Killzone 2 really comes to life, as bullets whiz by, explosions ring all around you, and the hateful cries of the Helghan mixed with the curse heavy mantras of your squad mates fill your living room.Multiplayer: 4/5Think Call of Duty 4 mixed with a little Battlefield: Bad Company, sort of. The online component of Killzone 2 is very addicting and very fun. So far my favorite game mode is Warzone, which is a very inventive game type. Essentially Warzone is a mixture of all your standard mulitplayer FPS game types rolled into one big match. Your team will receive orders, like 'assassinate a specific target', or 'planet C4', or  'defend an area' or 'body count'. Its really quite ingenious since it adds variety to each match.Killzone 2 also features the now standard XP system, in which you earn points per kill/win, which in turn advances you to the next army ranking. With each new ranking you unlock new weapons and classes. One of the really cool classes is the Medic, who can heal fallen allies. Killzone 2 also features a run AND a jump mechanic, which comes in handy during frenetic shootouts, however the cover system, for some odd reason did not make it into the online portion. Also missing are some of the campaign weapons, like the flamethrower, RPG, and a weapon that shoots lightning; I am hoping that with a future patch Guerrilla Games includes these cool weapons, as well as the cover system. What we are left with are different variations on the standard machine gun, as well as a pistol, shotgun and grenades.Killzone 2 is a welcome addition to the FPS genre, and provides PS3 owners with another reason to stay faithful to Sony (aside from the best Blu Ray player on the market, and Metal Gear Solid 4, of course).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}

The last one in the series (Conviction) was basically pure action and felt kind of out of place in the series. While it was still a great game on its own it just didn't feel like Splinter Cell...now Ubisoft is sort of rebooting the series with Blacklist and have found a happy medium between Conviction and the rest of the series. You can have your stealth or you can have your pure action...its up to you. Graphics are top notch and the intergration of the WiiU gamepad makes it the more difinitive version (though whatever system you have it will still be good on). The controls are easy to grasp and the story isn't overly convolted like some of these type of games get into. Only real downside i have with this game is the replacement fo Sam Fischer's original voice actor.

Portal 2 is every bit as fun, imaginative and challenging as the original Portal that came as part of The Orange Box.Portal 2 is a direct sequel to the first title and as such I highly advise any potential P2 players to pick up the original game and play though that first. The first few minutes in Portal 2 has you being woken from stasis-sleep by a little robot trying to help you escape the facility you're trapped in. Soon enough, however, you'll find yourself back in the testing chambers trusty portal gun at your side. To avoid spoilers I'll leave it there.However, I do have to say that Valve's writers are some of the best around. I constantly found myself chuckling or laughing at the commentary in the game. Several of the games characters, Cave Johnson, in particular could be spun off into their own titles. The hilarity had me looking forward to each new test chamber.Gameplay for those familiar with Portal is exactly the same. Think First Person perspective armed with a gun-type device that shoots \"portals\" one entry and one exit. This time Valve has mixed things up by adding different types of goo that has differing effects on the environment around you. Blue-goo will allow you to jump super-high, orange gives you super-fast sprinting capabilities and white-goo allows you to create portals on just about any surface.The level of puzzles here has been taken to the next level and truly offers a fantastic challenge. There were plenty of head scratching moments during my play-though. Though with a little perseverance and experimentation each can be solved without relying on looking up walkthru's or tips. In fact the sense of satisfaction is so high from solving a difficult test chamber that I would highly recommend skipping any type of guide to get the most from Portal 2.This time around there is a multiplayer aspect and it is superb. You and a friend assume the role of two test robots being guided by your overseer through five different groups of test chambers. Each group contains around 8 or so individual test chambers. This is where the challenge is really ramped up and many of the multiplayer test chambers offer quite a bit of challenge. While initially the multiplayer seems removed from the single player story as you progress further bits of the story are filled in. It's nice that the multiplayer isn't just treated as more test chambers but an actual part of the core game.On the PS3 Valve has also integrated their Steam service which grants you some very cool bonuses. First, PS3 owners can download a copy of Portal 2 to their PC for FREE! Second, PS3 owners can sign into Steam from their PS3 and play against their PC counterparts in P2!In closing the only negative thing I can say about Portal 2 is that eventually the game ends.

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

I'm about 30% done.The African setting is the real attraction of this game, it's beautiful and on my machine I can play it all on high and it looks almost photorealisic besides the humans. The visuals and details are just gorgeous, like a safari. A possible minigame could have been either a photo safari or a hunting safari depending on your tastes.There is just tons of area to go around and it is daunting as well as a pain to get around in, but I suppose that's what Africa is like, it doesn't have regular cities and highways and of course there is chaos there most of the time. Still the constant traveling up and down the map is tedious if you are interested in playing the story. There are the bus stations but they are few and mostly on the outskirts of the initial map, not sure about the second area but it seems about the same. The constant driving around large areas back and forth just kills the fun of the missions. In terms of game area per dollar this has to be the best value out there though, too bad they still keep thier heads in the ground with the DRM junk.The map system is flawed and a little too realistic, it makes the game less fun. The resolution is just completely wrong, I repeatedly have a hard time knowing which way to turn on the map since it doesn't represent your direction clearly and is a static map, not like the auto-zoom based on speed like in GTA. I want a HUD, not a map I have to constantly toggle on to find out where to turn to get to some distant objective especially when driving and being chased/shot at by everyone! You are using a GPS reciever anyways, give me the option to put a marker on the objective and have it guide me to it with either arrows or an overlay on my map sensitive to where I actually am on it, using either the available roads or the river I'm on. Use the rivers if you can't use the bus, they are both the easiest way to get around. Helicopters would be welcome.The constantly being attacked everywhere is also another downside, just driving around or walking you get shot at by everyone. I would not want to play this game without a trainer, it would be just too frustrating even with your buddy saving you. I can't and won't spend 3 hours per mission or hundreds of hours on a game. So the difficulty is a little much, if it's so realistic you would have to travel in a group of armed people all the time, not individually or you'd never make it,foreigners especially. The jamming weapons are fine, but why don't the enemies weapons ever jam? Why don't different groups fight each other and ignore you? Is every checkpoint the same group that never sees patrols of the other group? Come on think it through if you're trying to be so realistic. Real team play in the single player would be a welcome component. The bad guys seem to take a lot of damage as well before going down, even to the head with a light machine gun.Also the missions are the same kind of GTA type as well, go here kill or destroy this with a buddy in the middle most times. Though you have to admit that the first game wasn't much different, it was just a true sandbox with outstanding visuals in a time when they weren't prevalent like now, there's actually more missions and more freedom in this game. You can approach them differently though, either stealthy with silenced weapons, afar with a sniper rifle or rambo style, one way or another you'll have to do it rambo style in some part of the mission though. Also I would like the option when driving to have a third person view, it would make it easier on the eyes and not give me a headache with all the gunfire while trying to watch the road, this is a game after all!  The combat is pretty straightforward, no cover system or prone/sneak modes, which is disappointing if you played Rainbow Six Vegas, Gears of War or the latest Brothers in Arms games, using cover can make combat so much more real and rewarding.This game has none of the Sci-Fi themes like the first one did, not a problem though, the African setting and story are fine if pretty downbeat. The different characters seem to be a good look into places like Somalia, Congo or Rwanda: lawless places where life is cheap and warlords are constantly fighting over fleeting resources and power before their own inglorious deaths so the next one can come along. Your role is a pretty bad one as well in real terms beside the initial mission of killing an arms dealer, seems like they'll just be another to take his place once you finish anyways. You end of being more of an assassin for hire all the time available to everyone. But it's a nice break from the military tacticals out there.The lost piracy revenue would probably be much smaller than the peeved fans who won't buy this until it's fifteen dollars, just see the other reviews! So why not make this a rental online for $25 a play through or some other creative way of making it a pleasant experience for those of us who prefer to do things legally, the police don't just bug all of us in advance as potential criminals why should this be different?But if you are looking to buy one game at release this season this should be it, no major bugs or crashes and the number of missions and area are HUGE. At this point most of the big games have DRM anyways so that being equal get this one.WinXPIntel Core Duo E52004GB RAM8800GT","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}

Twenty five or more hours into FONV, and I've experienced only two game-stopping crashes (both happened after three or more hours of play).  I took off two stars due to the multitude of bugs.Problems I've experienced so far: NPC humans and enemies, both alive and dead, falling and disappearing into the ground; NPC's and creatures getting stuck in walls and rocks; constant stuttering while simply walking around the Mojave Wasteland; NPC's talking, but no sound coming out of their mouths; getting stuck on rocks and obstacles and not being able to move, which forces me to reboot; supposedly friendly factions attacking me for no discernible reason; the occasional odd and inexplicable explosion sound; while in third person over the shoulder view, my character has somehow slipped too far to the side and I was not able to fix his position, even after reboot (it bothered the hell out of me, as I was used to him being in a certain position after 50 hours of play); traveling companions getting stuck on the terrain and disappearing for awhile while my main character, who needs backup, is getting killed by a bunch of enemies.I've experienced many other bugs, like gear disappearing from my inventory (but usually reappearing later).  One time, the game went into a slow-motion crawl during a shootout involving only four characters in a small room at Gomorrah Casino.  Another issue: for a few minutes, I thought this one female character, a possible companion, was a midget, but I realized upon reloading that her legs from the knees down were buried in the ground.  I've seen moonwalking NPC's stuck together, like conjoined twins.  I've also seen dead bodies flying around the screen for no reason (odd, but unintentionally funny).FONV, although deeply flawed, is an immersive, involving experience with so many interesting and varied quests.  I can't emphasize enough that you'd better have multiple saves from different locations and from different times of play (an hour or so apart so you don't experience a game-stopping dead end that you can't escape from).  There is one bug I actually appreciate...the conversation level up cheat...I leveled up to 30 with this glitch.Update:  Finished the game after about 70 hours of play, because I wanted to complete as many side quests as possible.  As I played, I saved every 5 minutes because I was afraid it would crash.  The game crashed at least once, sometimes twice an hour, even after the first patch.  It crashed constantly in certain geographical areas and this forced me to avoid certain locations.  Not exactly an optimal playing experience.  If this game had been QA'd properly, I would have given it 5 stars.  A few bugs are excusable, but not dozens of bugs.  Luckily, I didn't experience a game-breaking bug, one that wouldn't allow me to proceed through the main mission.  But some of the side missions were screwed up.  It took me out of the game and had me thinking about what the NPC's were actually supposed to do if they had behaved appropriately.  The story is compelling and the gameplay, when it works properly, is quite fun.  However, due to the company releasing the most buggy game I have ever played on a console, I won't purchase any expansion packs until they are bundled and discounted heavily.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHJ8C","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Tekken 5 (PS2)","reviewText":"Let's be honest, Tekken 4 was a let down. The environment caused all sorts of nightmares got in the way with what Tekken is all about, fighting. Tekken 5 has thrown out all the flawed concepts in Tekken 4 (though some parts of the landscape are destructible), and delivers what fans have been dying for, an amazing fighter with their favorite Tekken characters.The new fighting and graphics engines are the heart and soul of Tekken 5. The game is an exact port of the Arcade version, and will easily give anything on Xbox a run for its money. To be honest, I was surprised a PS2 game could look this good, it sweeps the feet from under any of the other PS2 games currently out there. The fighting system maintains the four button control scheme, and it still plays silky-smooth. Not only does it control well, but the visceral feeling of power is very much intact. When you hit someone in Tekken 5, it looks like it hurt. The moves, like most Tekken titles, are easy enough to master, but timing will determine how much punishment you'll dish out.Value is an understatement when it comes to this game. Not only do you get the full arcade versions of Tekken 1,2 and 3, but also a complete action game Tekken: Devil Within, which goes into some of the back-story Bering the Mishima clan. Throw in the fact that you can customize characters and earn countless rendered CG movies, and you've got hours of entertainment.

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Chewy and Pink...","reviewText":"Bioware, Blizzard, and Bethesda have been the Top 3 Western RPG makers for decades, so it's painful to see a Bioware RPG kicked out the door and served up like undercooked Chicken.EA needs to learn that they can't put everything on a 12 month Madden dev. cycle.  RPG's are the most difficult type of game to make.  There are complex stories, combat systems, 20-40 hours of unique gameplay, thousands of pages of dialogue, branching storylines, deep loot tables, crafting, etc...I enjoyed Dragon Age 1 and thought it laid a good foundation for a mature RPG franchise.I really enjoyed Mass Effect 1 and 2!With that said, I really can't recommend Dragon Age 2 to anybody unless you can get it for $20.Story:  6/10In Dragon Age 2, you play Hawke, a noble refugee, escaping Ferelden from the blight.  You escape across the sea to a new land and try to regain your noble status.  Once you succeed, you spend your time trying to prevent civil wars between the rival groups in the city.  The dialogue is funny at times, but there aren't enough meaningful decisions in the game.  Also, the story lacks an epic feel because you just keep getting caught between squabbles of rival factions.  What is exciting about that?  I don't feel like hero... more like a guy who gets headaches and ulcers.  There really isn't a strong main quest that spans the entire game.  Instead, the quests are broken up into three distinct acts.  Because of this, the entire game feels like a collection of DLC side quests.Graphics:  4/10In some areas, the graphics are better than Dragon Age 1.  The character's faces look and animate very well.  The fact that they have a system where a player can create unique faces, and the faces convey emotion while speaking is impressive.  However, there seems to be a serious lack of art direction.  It's all buckles these days.  Every character seems to have at least 10 buckles on their outfits.  It becomes laughable...  In the first game, the Darkspawn looked like undead demonic soldiers, now they look like lizard men in drag / the Reptilian Cult of Liza Minelli.  The levels look like bland versions of the cities used in Final Fantasy XII for the PS2!Levels:  FAILSo, in the game, you talk to someone, get a quest, then go to a World Map.  On the map, there are links to the actual levels:  City Districts and Dungeons.  Click on an area to teleport to it after a 30 second load screen composed of B Rate High School Art.  When you get to the level, you will find that you can run from one end to the other in under a minute and it is typically linear.  There is a mini-map in the left corner of your screen that shows a gold arrow of where you need to go.  The gold arrow is also in the world over the person or object you need to activate.  So, run to the arrow.  The levels are poorly rendered and never feel like actual places.  More like dumps for cheap outsourced art.  The same 5 dungeons are reused for 80 quests, and the game occasionally tweaks them by blocking a path with an abandoned cart, a slab of grey concrete, or an invisible wall.  Yeah... invisible walls in 2011... sigh...  The levels make the game feel like a budget product and destroy any suspension of disbelief that you may have had.Gameplay:  5/10While you are walking through the levels, you get attacked by enemies.  So, in a typical encounter, you may come across 12 assassins.  As you are fighting them, the game starts spawning in more assassins and warriors all around you.  This feels cheap.  It also destroys \"tactics.\"  Because enemies just appear out of thin air, you can't really get into a battle formation.  (Fighters in front, mages in back)  In most cases the newly spawned waves of enemies are more powerful, so you can't budget your mana or potions.  In past Bioware games, your party encountered enemies with strong resistances, and the fun was figuring out how to defeat them.  Mind Flayers were almost completely immune to magic.  Unmberhulks were powerful and they could stun your fighters.  Trolls had to be finished off with acid or fire.  I almost shed a tear out of nostalgia there...  But in Dragon Age 2, there are only 3 tactics that you need to know.Tactic 1: vs. Mob of enemies.Just spam Area of Effect Spells like Fireball.  They die.Tactic 2: vs. BossesGet the boss to chase your fighter.  Run in circles while your party kills it with missile attacks.  It dies.Tactic 3:  Use your favorite technique, mash the attack button, when you can use your favorite technique again, repeat.That's pretty much it.  Run to Gold Arrow on maps, Apply Tactic 1, 2, or 3, and that's the whole game.Interface Screens:  5/10Bioware did streamline loot, by allowing you to tag usless items as \"JUNK\" and you can sell off all of your JUNK with the push of a button.Aside from that, the loot screens are convoluted and terrible.  Someone at Bioware needs to go back and Play Final Fantasy 2 on the NES or Phantasy Star 2 on the SEGA Genesis and copy that.  Those games are 20 years old!!!Basically, you can go to a store, browse the types of items, Weapons, Armor (only for your character), Accessories, Special Items for your Companions, Potions, Buy Back stuff you sold by accident.In most stores, almost all of these categories are completely empty.You still can't buy + equip an item or buy an item for a character that isn't with you at the store, or see what they have equipped.Also, if you see a sword and the condition to use it is:  Strength 42 / Constitution 42, you cannot see your character's stats without leaving the store and looking through stats screens.You also can't change your companions' armor.  You can only give them accessories, weapons, or rune bonuses, which seems pretty weak.Even though the stores have been streamlined, you still need to use the left and right triggers, the left and right buttons, the face buttons, and an analog stick to buy things.Sound:  6/10The sound effects are good, but the music is bland.  I guess they wanted a score to match the environments.  In Dragon Age 1, they had a musical score and a theme.  In Dragon Age 2, there really isn't any sort of consistent musical score for the game.Bugs:  9/10The game is broken.  There are stat bugs that weaken you.  There are stat bugs that make your companions invincible.  There are infinite dialog loops.  There are slight graphic glitches everywhere.  Occasionally, characters vanish off of the map.  Etc...  If Dragon Age 2 was a piece of chicken, it would need to be cooked for another 20 minutes.Maturity:  MBlood, violence, gore, and suggestive situations.The plot also deals with political intrigue and manipulation, which really isn't suited for kids either.Overall:  3/10Dragon Age 2 is a huge disappointment on just about every level.  The ONLY saving grace is the character dialogue.If you like Witty Banter and want to zip through an RPG that requires no thought, then you should buy this game.  But don't pay $60 for it!  Get it as cheap as you can!If you have 20-40 hours to complete it, then you could rent it.If you are a graphics snob, skip it.If you are an RPG tactics nut, skip it.If going through the same dungeons 20 or more times each would bother you, skip it.If you hated Jade Empire because the gameplay was repetitive, skip it.If you want his game to be Baldur's Gate 3, skip it.If Dragon Age 3 hits the stores before Christmas 2012, skip it!If you were disappointed with this game, it's ok.  SKYRIM is coming on 11/11/11!That will make everything all better!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2011"}

I enjoyed Horde mode on GOW2 and Beast mode on GOW3, so it was a little disappointing that they are gone, but the new survival mode is pretty fun in it's own right if you have decent squadmates who know what they're doing.  The campaign which is the basis for my review is actually better than I thought.  It took me a couple rounds to get used to the new controls, but after that I enjoyed the short romp through.  It is a bit more arcadey than past campaigns, and some sections are quite short, but I'm the type of gamer who prefers shorter campaigns (5-7 hrs) than ones that tend to drag on till the bitter end.  In terms of campaigns, I would rank them GOW1>GOW2>Judgment>GOW3.  If you liked past campaigns, I would guess you would like this one if you can get past the controls.  Now, as far as online goes, I do agree that they sped up the online modes much like the COD's and Halo's, so if that's not your deal, then definitely rent this as I did.  I'm waiting for a sub $20 price range so I can play the survival mode again.  Survival is a bit under-rated imho.  By now, I'm sure you know it's only 10 waves, but it is equally if not more challenging than 30+ waves of Horde, and definitely more challenging than Beast mode.

I still play it once in a while for nothing more than its all out gunning madness. It truely was a visceral experience from front to finish, which came all too soon. That is probaly my biggest gripe with Max Payne 2 is that it is also somewhat short. Though, there is greatness to be found in this game. The is depth to be found in it's simplicity. The run and gun tactics make for one intense experince that you will easily want to relive. Graphically, Max Payne 2 on the xbox is pretty sweet. There are no reflective effects such as the ones found on the PC and sacrifices have been made in the explosion department, but its likely you wont notice. The game looks and plays too good to complain. The story is deep and lost me on a couple occassions, still this made me want to replay those levels. No matter what your reason, you will want to revisit this game even after beating it quickly the first go around. Xbox shooter fans, do yourselves a favor and buy this game. It is one heck of an experience offering some of the best graphics, rag-doll physics, and gameplay around. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2006"}

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"hammodi","summary":"Praise the Sun! Once again.","reviewText":"*****No Spoilers. I don't like them. Nobody likes them****** ****** I will update this thread whenever possible******The original Dark Souls was my favorite have I've played over the years in my life. the feel to it was great and it was a unique game. now that Dark Souls II was about to come out. I couldn't let my self to let the chance of playing the sequel of my favorite game go away. I preordred it on Sept. 2013. I was so excited for the game itself And I couldn't wait. I got the game today morning. And I played it for few hours and here is what do I have to say- The game itself has a very different start from its prequel. although similar in the general goal of the game. I don't have a review for the story. because it would be considered a spoiler.Gameplay.- Gameplay is very smooth. very much enhanced from the original. if you think this would be easier than Dark Souls. I will disappoint you. It is not. as far as I've gotten now. this is harder than the Original. but they don't basically throw you into the fire just like they did in the original. there is a long prologue that will make you sure you get the game and its controls. but after that. playtime is over. the real Dark Souls starts. it will be very challenging. and Yes. you will die. A lot of times. am used to that personally. I've died probably around 1000 times in the first.- Graphics and frame ratewe all know that the original Dark Souls had some really good graphics. but also. its known for frame rate drops. really steep drops. especially in Blighttown and such places. but so far in the game. I haven't had any major frame rate drops. nothing that I noticed. The graphics are surprisingly better. way better. I liked how they had really nice contrast to them. texture quality is awesome. world details are great and I couldn't ask for more.- Controls and in-game itemsControls are same as the original for the most part. the only difference I noticed is that you use L3 to perform a running-jump instead of using the Circle Button. I really didn't have trouble with that. but the L3 button is hard to click while the Circle button is the button your already holding to spring. so its a better option. In game items are for the most part same as the originals. Alluring Skull. Cracked red eye orb. and of course Estus flask. and many others are present in this one as well. so. playing Dark Souls before this is a huge advantage. please note that moving the stick is more sensitive in DSII. the character will easily move quickly. causes me to fall a lot.- Character and game GUIthe way you build your character is same as the original DS for the most part. so I don't need to talk to you about it. however. There are 8 character classes in the game. Warrior, Knight, Swordsman, Bandit, Cleric, Sorcerer, Explorer, Deprived. you obviously notice that the Pyromancer class is missing. which is the only thing I am pissed about. Pyromancer class was the best for a start-up. and It was pretty unique and it fits the game very well. I hope they add that to the game later. but since that is too hard to do as the game is already finished. I doubt we're gonna see that happening. but there are still Pyromancies. which anybody can use them if you have the required item. which is the pyromancy hand. game GUI is significantly better than the original. very clean layout and easy to read text font. nice menu and generally the GUI itself is a nice upgrade .What I liked about it.- I liked how DSII is very similar to DS. many games screw up games but going off the topic and the layout of the original. but From Software has done it right. they stick to what people like. made the necessary upgrades and enhancements. but they didn't force any major changes as we usually see in video game sequels. for me. that's always a good thing.Enjoy the game. And I would get it right now. not in few years while multiplayer is pretty much dead. (even tho Dark Souls multiplayer is still very active). this one needs to be played early. and of course. Praise the Sun!***UPDATE***-You can change the running-jump control back to the Circle button from the game options. that's a good thing. And once again. I assure you that this game is harder than the original Dark Souls!. I have a weapon pack and it is still harder.****TIPS****- as a DS player. I would like to give you few tips on this game*First and most importantly. Scan your environment. there are alot of hidden items and walkways that you might miss for hours, days if you don't look. (I just missed the walkway to a place in DSII. went somewhere else that I shouldn't be at at my level. took me hours and I couldn't beat the hard enemies over there. Wondered why. apparently. I should be somewhere else).*Don't rush it. if you rush through Dark Souls II. you will not last few minutes in your run. eventually. you will either, Fall over a ledge. Get backstabbed from behind. or quite simply run into a herd of just too many enemies and get surrounded by them. do the game slowly.*Don't use flasks or any health healers during a close fight it DSII. in DS. if you get hit while drinking an estus flask. you get reduced damage. but in DSII. you get full damage anyways. so it makes it a waste of estus. get to a safe sport and stock on health.*Upgrade the crucial skills first. . I would personally upgrade my Dexterity and Vitality.Don't upgrade the intel or faith. do that later. (In DS. vitality increases Health, In DSII. it increases stamina.)I will add other tips when I get more experience in DSII. for now. this should be helpful if you don't already think about doing this. mostly logic.****Have something to say****when I say that this game is harder than Dark Souls. I mean its way way harder. imagine that Dark Souls is an easy mode of the game. and DSII is the hardest mode of the game. that might be even less of how hard the game is. its just unbelievable difficult. side stepping is useless. enemies will still lock on you and hit you. even if you side step while running. the AI is really high. it takes about 2 hits to die in the game. Just run past through enemies to find a bonfire. I did that few times. you only have 1 estus flask when you start. 2 when you upgrade for the first time(which you will be able to early). if you had trouble with DS and you hated it and you don't want to get stuck a lot. this is not for you. this game is extremely difficult. even harder than Demon's Souls. Personally. on DS. I've played 3 playthroughs. killed Smough and Ornstein by myself on all of these playthroughs. on the last one I did it on the first try. am not the best or even close to but I consider myself good. this is beyond you can imagine hard until you actually play it. don't invoke an enemy that you see if you don't have to fight him. just run through them. find a bonfire. and then go back and kill them. its nearly impossible to get to different places with killing all the enemies. your fancy footwork won't work here. the AI is high. very small chance it does. I have a weapon pack. which has a good shield and a good weapon. about 3 times better than the startup one. and am getting my but whopped basically. they basically through you into the lava. not the fire. this time****GLITCHES NOTICED****-Sound glitch noticed. you see picture before sound sometimes in this game. sometimes NPC's don't even speak even tho you see the subtitles.-The first boss. the last giant. is glitched. he has two attacks where range is not what you think it is. there is one attack where he would just try to crush you by falling on the ground. I was fifteen ft away behind him. AND I DIED. twice. the other attack is after he loses 50% of his health when he uses his other arm as a weapon. I was also behind him. he slammed the sword to his front. while I was behind him. and I died. I don't get that. they need to fix some things.*****UPDATE***So far. am kind of disappointed at few things'- so far. been through 7 areas. nothing large like Darkroot garden,Basin. ash lake. in DS2. its very compact and it feels like playing a generic RPG in terms of the world. that disappointed me a lot.- the game kind of lost its Dark Souls-ness feel. the game is harder than DS. but it is so different in terms of enemies. mechanics and how the game goes about the story. very different. you will notice that*****UPDATE. MULTIPLAYER and some other issues*******- I was able to reach areas where I can be invaded. and so far its a huge disappointment. Lag is unbearable. I slash the enemy with my sword. he was around for 10 seconds before he actually get staggered and lose damage. surprised because it should reduce lag due to the dedicated servers. horrible so far. needs a quick fix.- My second issue with MP is that. Invasions are so random. you can get invaded while hollow or human. and unlike dark souls. you see the \"You Got invaded\" message AFTER the enemy is in the map. few times i got surprised to see the enemy right next to me without a message. also. I've never seen a summon sign so far. Even in the 2011 Dark Souls. I still see people putting summon signs.- People have weapons that I don't even have. I killed 9 Bosses. And I only have about 10 unique weapons. and others have the weirdest weapons that don't exist so far in the game.- Hacking: yes. here we go again. game has some hackers. some naked guy running around and yet he receives less damage than me with a heavy armor with 700+ protection.- Another issue is that so far. I don't have any really good weapons or anything. In Dark Souls. you could obtain some really cool weapons early in the game. but so far. it doesn't seems like it in DS2.- Titanite anything. is freaking rare. as I said. am 9 bosses down. and Yet. I've never found anything but a titanite shard, large titanite shard. and both of these are very rare and limited.- Not as many merchants at all. only 3 merchants that have limited supply. and sell you the worst weapons and armors, items. in the game.- One positive thing I've noticed is that its harder to get a backstab. yes. believe it or not ladies and gentlemen. it is harder to get a backstab.- Again. one thing I didn't like so far is the lack of Mini-bosses. remember how many times you died against Havel the Rock in DS?. there aren't many Mini-bosses or really strong enemies so far. I will update more if that changes.I might need to reconsider my 5 star review. but I will do that when Am done with my first playthough.********UPDATE******- Even though a couple of areas in the beginning of the game weren't the best. there are really nice areas that are awesome. reminds me of DS. challenging areas with really strong enemies. falling of the ledge and all that is here. great. I was pissed off about some things. but this game keeps getting better and better. ****they released a second patch to fix PvP and summoning because it wasn't working**********UPDATE******- The world in this game has such great elements. there are some enemies and bosses that will make you wonder how great the designer was. few enemies are the best fighting and gamelooking ever. really great game design. level design. especially at about halfway to the end of the game. really great what DSII is bringing to the table.When I say that this game is brutally hard. I don't mean it in a bad way. no. the reason why mos of dark-a-holics play this game because it challenges you. that what this game does. no easy mode. no easy way out. this game will be painful in terms of how hard it is to beat. just like any souls game.******UPDATE.MP*********- as OP as magic was in the original DS. it is even more OP here. MP is basically ruled by hexes(which are Dark Magic. they're called a different name here). and regular magic. many of them just kill you in 1 hit. fast attacks. and too much speed and hard to avoid. I am personally terrible at MultiPlayer against magic or any of its categories. i usually win in physical fights. but other than that. magic is unbeatable for me. if you want to be good at MP. your only option is a magic/hex build. just too strong and am dissappointed. Pyro is as weak as it was in the original dark souls. miracles aren't really intended for PVP. so they're weak anyways. and thats it. Rolling is being made an essential part of this game. shielding with a good shield isn't enough. they made it even worse for me. i like dark souls because it has heavy equipment. but they're (once again). giving advantage to magic users and light armor runners.******Finished first Playthrough*********Played the whole game. and This game is really really good. I liked it tons. but this makes me think. is this better than the Original Dark Souls?. thats a good question. I will play more playthroughs. and we will see. so far. am really disappointed at how unfair and unbalanced multiplayer is. as i said. magic rules in MP (if you played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls. you probably already know that. its becoming a \"Souls\" game trend. OP magic). trust me. it is. the only way you think that magic is not OP. many say that its not because they're themselves magic users. and they basically don't want to say that they're good players because of the magic. for PvE. I'd have to say that Dark Souls is better. but not by much. Dark Souls II is still awesome. worth playing right now. but I liked the original DS. my personal opinion. I liked some elements in DS II over DS. weapons are way better in Dark Souls II. there are less weapons (I Believe). but the variety of move sets are way more. some of them are awful. halberds and spears have some really weird move sets that make no sense. Best thing about DS II. the Bosses. there are ** of them. few of them you don't need to kill at all. but they give you something. let me put it in this way. unique.(I bought the Black Armor Edition. that's why it doesn't say that I am a verified buyer. you can go and check my review in the PS3 Black Armor Edition to make sure)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Evan Eberhardt","summary":"Best of the Halo series","reviewText":"I was hesitant to buy Halo 3 because Halo 2 left me a bit disappointed (back in 2004), mainly because it wasn't any better than Halo 1 (only the dual weapon wield and getting rid of the annoying health bar were improvements that stood out).  But I now know that my fears were unfounded.  Halo 3 is much improved in several ways.  The biggest is simply the bump to HD.  The environment and enemies look better than ever and it really helps immerse you into the gameplay (assuming you own an HDTV, and if you don't, you are really missing out...HDTVs are worth the investment, the details really come to life).  There are many weapons available as well (a few new ones also), which adds new dimesion to the ways of killing the opponents.  The story is actually solid as well and doesn't disappoint.  The game really shines on the harder difficulty levels.  Easy is not very fun because it is not challenging.  Be sure you play the game again on Heroic to get a better experience.  And it gets even better on Legendary, but only if you are patient, as death will be visiting you a lot.  I am a harsh critic and this game did not disappoint me.

The game follows a hero named Welkin and his fellow soldiers of the Federation's 7th Platoon that are fighting against the Empire, who is intent on unifying the continent under its power. The Federation discovers that the Empire possesses a secret weapon, known as the &#xBF;Valkyria&#xBF;- an ancient race with special powers thought to exist only in legends. With this new discovery, the fate of the Federation&#xBF;s ability to win the war and a hope for a better future hangs in the balance.","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"One of the best SRPG's to date","reviewText":"Pros:- Very addicting strategic gameplay- Beautiful artistic visuals- Memorable characters- Spectacular presentation- Lots of varietyCons:- No unlockables or additional content- Many AI issuesGameplayValkyria Chronicles is a strategy RPG like never seen before. Traditionally, strategy RPG's have used geometrical grids in a 2D turn-based environment. Valkyria Chronicles is also turn-based, but functions in a 3D world using combat most similar to a third-person shooter. There are a range of different classes all with their own strengths and weaknesses including Lancers, Scouts, Stormtroopers, Snipers, Engineers and Tanks. Each class accommodates each-other and the abilities involved create tactics that mimic the qualities of chess. Thankfully, unlike other SRPG's, Valkyria Chronicles gives out a ranking at the end of every battle that rewards you for how well you did. This translates into not only experience points but currency as well. The experience points are then used to level up the different classes however you would like and prevents you from feeling like whatever characters you started with you are stuck with. On the other hand, the currency is used for research & development which means new weapons, armor and outfitting for your tanks.The game progresses through a series of chapters within a book, and each chapter includes at least 1 battle as well as several cutscenes. The story is very lighthearted and the character development is absolutely spectacular. It is a game that is very easy to pick-up and play and the introduction really helps ease even the newest newcomer into the gameplay mechanics and strategies involved. However, the story is very typical and features some personalities that can be annoying, but thankfully the voice acting is excellent.ControlsValkyria Chronicles is based on a 3D strategic plane, and the controls really accommodate the gameplay. Once a unit is selected from the tactical map, the camera is brought down to the player's level and you are free to move about. Movement distance is restricted on each turn based on the class of the character, and the movement is very tight and responsive. Once your character is in position for an attack, the press of R1 pauses the map and allows you to line up a shot. At this point the game turns into somewhat of a third-person shooter, which makes the game about as unique as any game in history. The menu also doesn't suffer from lag whatsoever and really helps make the experience smooth and intuitive.GraphicsOne of the most unique features of Valkyria Chronicles is the art style. Valkyria Chroncles features fully 3D cell-shaded graphics like never seen before. The game resembles a beautiful drawing and helps support the light-hearted atmosphere. Each unit, texture and background looks like it has been hand drawn and the presentation is absolutely magnificent. The palette used mimics that of an anime and really proves to be successful in every regard.SoundThe sound effects of Valkyria Chronicles are very basic but also very fitting. However, the real strength of the audio is in the original soundscore. Valkyria Chronicles quite simply has one of the better RPG music scores of this generation. The theme song is one of the best I've heard and really captures the mood of the game. To accompany that is a terrific voice cast featuring many successful actors and actresses from all over Hollywood. Every sound made by the game is deliberate and captivating.Lasting AppealWith a 40 hour campaign mode as well as some extras on the second playthrough, Valkyria Chronicles has plenty of replayability. The first playthrough is well-worth the purchase alone and once you've finished the game, your save file allows you to keep your character levels, and unlocks on your second playthrough. Also, on the second playthrough you're allows access to Hard mode on skirmishes which aren't just harder versions of their former selves, but rather a completely different battle on the same map. The lack of trophies is a serious bummer but with some great DLC on the way, Valkyria Chronicles has plenty of value.Rating:Story: 8.5Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 9.0Controls: 9.5Sound: 9.0Replay Value: 8.5Overall: 9.1Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: The overall value of Valkyria Chronicles is very high, and long story mode mixed with the fantastic gameplay makes this a definite must-have.Last Thoughts:Valkyria Chronicles is an incredible experience all wrapped up in rich gameplay. With a stunning look, sound and feel, Valkyria Chronicles is a game that will be memorable for many years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

First, I must say, I tend to like it a bit better than Resistance: Fall Of Man, mainly because it's a bit different with the overall features. You wear this nifty Time-Shifting type of suit that can enable you to manipulate time. Which, is a really cool idea, and it can be quite fun blasting bad guys when you're using these features. A LOT OF FUN!The graphics are awesome, it's really fast-paced, and is a blast to play.BUT, after some time of playing, I got a bit bored with it. Simply because it's constant shooting...shooting....and more shooting...which normally I wouldn't mind, but, I would like some other challenges, or other things to do besides just shooting, shooting, shooting, and dodging ballistic missiles & projectiles. Maybe that's what I'm not crazy about...I guess I like games a bit more on the slower-side. Things in this game get a bit to crazy, and hectic all at the same time, and sometimes you just don't know what to do, where to go, or what's going on, and 2 seconds later you're dead!I love SHOOTER-TYPE GAMES, but, I like them a bit slower, and with other kinds of challenges....What I mean by this is: In other Shooter type games (ala: Sniper Elite, or SOCOM series of games)...While they are all shooter games, you have to incorporate stealth, and other means of combat, to complete missions. I guess I like that stuff more than your more traditional kind of shooter game.I guess I just get bored shooting the same thing over & over again...  :) I guess I'd like to see more of that kind of thing in other shooter games.Conclusion: Don't take this review the wrong way....I really dig this game, and I think the replay value will hold up for me, I do however, appreciate other elements in a game to make a game more interesting.But, overall, on a scale from 1-10, I'd probably give it a solid \"7\".","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2007"}

Morales","summary":"A Mixed Bag: Great Nostalgia, Presentational Quirks","reviewText":"This Capcom collection brings together some of the greatest arcade classic that typically people in Generation Y will appreciate most (that is people born around the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s. These games encompass the arcade classics that were most popular in the arcades around this time. Myself being born in 1981 fit this category perfectly; I know this simply from the fact that I prefer this collection over the Namco or Atari collections that would appeal more to Generation X'ers, that is, those whose prime arcade era was the 1970s to early 80s.Keep in mind, this game contains the ARCADE versions of these classic games, NOT their home console counterparts. I realized this after popping this in and playing the original Ghost n' Goblins, and was wondering why it wasn't the same version I remember playing on my NES years ago, but instead a more enhanced version with slightly different sound and slightly better looking zombies. It was all good though, and enjoyed the games thoroughly.Now, even though these games are exact representations and ports of the arcade versions, that MAY turn some gamers off who were very accustomed to being able to set their own options when these games hit consoles. For example, in the Street Fighter games there is no option to change difficulty level, you just have to make do with what is there. You'll notice it is no walk in the park, either. So if it's hard (which it kind of is) you're just going to have to deal with it. Just be reminded that there are no difficulty level options for any of these games, thus if it's too hard, too bad. Lastly, just like their old school arcade counterparts, there are no save points; meaning that you cannot turn the game off, come back later and pick up where you left off of. While continues are infinite (just like if you kept popping in quarters), if you want to beat the game, you HAVE to do it in one sitting. Again, just like it was back in the day. I found Commando especially more difficult than the NES port I was more familiar with years ago.Next, I really was rather turned off by the game's presentation. Upon start-up you'll notice how bland things look, how there is no real effort made to present these games in the grand splendor that one would expect. I mean, considering what classics these games are you might think Capcom would make the start up screens and menus more colorful and audibly pleasing. Instead, all menu sound effects are directly ripped off from one of the Street Fighter games, making it seem like Street Fighter was the best Capcom game available which simply isn't true. It comes off as cheesy and rushed. Plus, menu's just look bland and options to pick your game are just plain and quite boring. Also, since these are supposed to be the arcade versions, little things seem to pop out and not really make sense, one being the fact that in Street Fighter, the 2nd player side has \"Press Start\" to join in. Would be nice for it to simply have said \"Insert Coin.\" Obviously as seasoned gamers we would know well enough that all we had to do was press start to join in. Still, there are other games that just look downright perfect. Super Ghouls n' Ghosts was exclusively a Super Nintendo release, and there is absolutely NO change there, thank goodness. If you own Playstation 2 component cables, things will look better, but the presentation overall is just lacking.So if you don't mind the bland presentation and quirky lack of options, but just want to sit back and enjoy the classics exactly (for the most part) how they were when you originally played them, this is a great collection to own. Obviously I won't review each game one by one but how this collection was put together as a whole. Although there are some games missing that were definitley more popular and I'm surprised they weren't added on here. I mean, Mega Man was one of Capcom's greatest efforts, and where is that? But I may just be being picky, since it wasn't originally an arcade game I guess it's no big deal. At a cheap bargin bin price you really can't go wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Unlike Anything I've Experienced Before","reviewText":"The Good:+A really compelling story with some really compelling characters+Gorgeous environments really bring the world to life+A great soundtrack+Fantastic voice acting+Often engaging gameplay that limits the player enough to make them consider their options, but provides enough that there are a variety of different ways to go about a situationThe Bad:-The Story will feel sluggish at timesNaughty Dog hit it out of the park with the Uncharted games.  They were good quality games that were not just great in cinematic quality, but also in interactive quality.  Beautifully bending the interactive touch of a video game with the cinematic trappings of a good adventure film.  Sure there were moments when it was over-the-top and surreal, but they were good fun and delivered interesting characters and stories.  The Last of Us strives to aim a lot higher than Uncharted, however. Instead of being an outright adventure, The Last of Us reaches a lot higher, is bolder and may be the best thing Naughty Dog has ever put out as a developer thus far.You play as Joel, a man who survived the end of the world.  Twenty years after a parasitic fungus turned the world into a wasteland, Joel and few other humans are out for survival.  And The Last of Us never lets you forget your goal is to survive.  Joel and his ally Tess spend a lot of time trading goods with survivors outside of the city to make a living and to survive.  Soon Joel is tasked with smuggling a teenage girl named Ellie to a band only known as The Fireflies.  Joel agrees and thus the adventure of The Last of Us truly begins.  The story is great, but only because the characters within it are great.  The Last of Us makes no bones about what it is.  It's a game that takes place in a dreary future where there is only one rule: To survive.  You don't know if you can trust the people you meet.  As the game is quick to point out that everyone is out to serve their own ends.  Small factions have formed among humans, but more than that, Joel and his allies (and enemies) must beware the infected who are also lurking around.The story may be a bit slow, but it wastes no time trying to really develop characters.  Like Uncharted many of the best moments are when the characters are simply having casual conversation amongst one another.  Unlike Uncharted, though, the tone is a lot more bleak.  It's a world that's been ravaged and ransacked and it shows.  There is still humor from time to time, but the game never lets you forget just how the world is.  The interactions between Joel and Ellie in particular are quite moving and telling of who they are.  It's very hard not to care about them and their struggles.  And The Last of Us has no issue pulling on your heart strings.  It sets the tone and press forward unapologetically.The Last of Us is a pretty big game in and of itself.  By comparison, the Uncharted games are a pretty linear affair.  You'll never get lost or never know where to go in those games.  The Last of Us isn't exactly non-linear, but there's a greater emphasis on exploring your environment for supplies, ammo and health.  You'll rarely be confused on where to go or what to do, but if you're not taking the time to properly explore your locale you may that The Last of Us can be a challenging experience nonetheless.  This is primarily because combat can (and often does) demand a lot of the player.  Survival is the name of the game and The Last of Us keeps this in mind.  Ammo is scarce a lot of the time.  Just because it seems like you're finding a lot, doesn't mean it can't all be depleted in the next encounter.  It's not unusual to use up entire ammo supplies in one encounter and be left to nothing but your supplies and fists in another.  If you aren't willing to balance some of it out, The Last of Us can be challenging.The good news is that checkpoints are quite frequent throughout the experience.  Should the worst befall you in any given situation you usually don't start too far from where it all happened.  This often times means that you can try other strategies without too much worry.Exploring the environments is much more important than the game itself is willing to let on.  While not every nook and cranny is actually crawling with infected or bad guys, you still need to search.  This is especially true because The Last of Us is very serious about it's survival instincts.  You'll find parts that can be used to create support weapons or items to heal you, but never both.  You also can't load up on stocks and constantly save them as the game only allows you to carry around a very limited quantity.  And everything the game wants you to do is done in real time.  You CAN pause the game, but none of your crafting or looking at artifacts you may find in this world or using health packs can be done from a pause menu.  Instead it's all done in real time, which puts a greater emphasis on finding safety when you can.  You'll have to craft while enemies could be bearing down on your or still be within the area.  You'll have to apply a health pack under the same circumstances.  This means in the midst of a firefight this is probably going to be difficult to do.  But when you have down time you'll relish the chance to prepare yourself for what may be lurking around the next corner.  This also means that when you can, you'll be more than tempted to explore each and every environment around you.The combat is often smooth and keeps you on your toes.  Many instances can feel overwhemling.  This is especially true if you are very reckless with your supplies and find yourself lacking them for the next encounter.  Enemies often rush you with reckless abandon.  There is time to think and react, but no doubt you'll bite the bullet more than enough times on your first play through.  Luckily the game gives you means by which to change or deepen the experience.  When crouching, Joel can increase his sense of hearing and plan accordingly.  You can often get an idea of where enemies this way.  Likewise, if enemies haven't noticed you, you can go for stealth kills or (if you're really bold) try to sneak by entirely.  The game encourages you to experiment, letting you know there isn't always a right way to go about anything.  Don't expect your downed enemies to be riddled with extra supplies, however.  They rarely (if ever) drop anything.  Again, there's a neat little dynamic about The Last of Us as a result of all of this.  Very few players will experience the game in the same way twice.  The way you utilize your supplies often results in different play styles and experiences.  Some players will find themselves forced into melee combat, while others will choose to do so in fear that they might not actually find supplies later.  And sure enough, no matter how much you comb over some environments, it's actually quite easy to miss items.If there's one thing that can almost always be said about Naughty Dog, it's that they certainly know how to make a good looking game.  The environments in The Last of Us look absolutely amazing.  The world has a pulse and comes to life like so few video game worlds do.  You'll find graffiti on walls that you can read, wanted poster, remnants of an old civilization are everywhere.  Ransacked homes, broken televisions, destroyed buildings.  The Last of Us is unapologetic about it's style and what it strives to convey.  Nothing showcases this better than the environments in which the game takes place in.  The world doesn't just look like a typical post apocalyptic world.  It actually looks like someone's living in it too.  In particular watching the prologue and then watching as it shifts showcases how much care and attention was actually put into each environments.  But perhaps the best part about The Last of Us, is that the atmosphere rarely drops.  The feeling of dread is surrounding the player much of the time.  Not just because of how it all looks, but because of how it also plays.  This idea that you might not have enough ammo for the next encounter.  There will be moments in which the player may be feeling anxious or even unprepared for certain situations as a result.  The end result is that you get a game where survival really is the root of it all as opposed to a game that often asks the player to run in guns blazing.  You CAN do this in The Last of Us if you so choose to, but it's quite clear there is something discouraging about doing so.The production values are good on another level as well.  The voice acting and sound are all phenomenal.  The sound effects are startlingly real.  The most rewarding part, however, is easily the soundtrack, which sounds nothing short of fantastic.  Often times it sets the mood perfectly, as well as provides a certain amount of comfort, dread and loneliness that some of the characters most certainly feel.  It's a well crafted and beautiful soundtrack overall.The Last of Us was a game that had high expectations upon it's announcement.  Not just coming out after Naughty Dog's success with Uncharted, but also at the onset of a new generation of consoles.  It delivers on multiple fronts.  If anything The Last of Us can feel a little sluggish at times.  This is especially true in the beginning when the game is teaching you how to play it and show you the ropes.  The Last of Us will take its sweet little time setting the stage for what is to unfold, and for some gamers it will undoubtedly test their patience.  Stick with it, however and the game comes to a point where it simply keeps getting bigger and better.Simply put, The Last of Us is a pretty bold game.  It's more than just another run of the mill shooter.  It's attention to detail and character make it a gaming experience worth having.  If you have a PS3 it is definitely worth a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

There seem to be two classes of shooter this generation: Battlefield, COD and then everything else - Medal of Honor, KZ3, Homefront, Crysis, etc.So the question for me is where does GR land? So far, firmly in the middle. I love the shooting mechanics, third person view and equipment. The semi-sci-fi environment is terrific and the future gear is terrific. The much touted gunsmith is okay - I have a ways to go before I can offer a firm judgement on it. You die quick when shot. Not one shot one kill, but quick. I like that a lot. I hate dumping clips into guys and seeing them run off or your kill stolen by a teamate. Teamwork is very important. Sort of like BF3, but in MUCH smaller environments. The modes are cool, but ultimately, they're varieties of domination, CTF or deathmatch.The graphics have their moments, but overall, not great. They are no where near Crysis, Killzone or even BF3. It's in the same league as Homefront or MoH. They ARE NOT photorealistic. In the campaign, the character facial animations are dreadful. The player movement is smooth though and your character looks pretty cool.The co-op is okay in horde mode, but it's not nearly as cool as Black Ops Zombies or CoD Spec Ops - not at all. Also, not being able to play the campaign with a buddy locally hurts. Considering how mediocre the graphics are, they should have done more.Ghost Recon does nothing to set itself apart from it's competitors. It has some cool mechanics and gear, but graphics, connectivity, co-op, campaign modes are all very middle road offerings. It's a game that will develope some hardcore fans, but I doubt it will appeal to the masses like BF or CoD. I guess that could be a good thing for some people, I prefer the games that will have a community more than 3 months from now.Finally - DAY ONE RANT - the online connectivity is sketchy. After entering my code, Uplay fails to recognize I've used it; that will result in a call to Ubisoft because I'm not paying for an online pass. The game is buggy. Online is buggy. There are hitches and quirks that will clearly be patched in both online and campaign modes. The combination of on disk DLC and games just not working is maddening.

And, as I wrote somewhere else here in this novel of a review, the PS3 is not a new system and has no good excuse for so many of the issues that were so prevalent in the 2 Slims I bought, albeit some of them now addressed.  Here ya go:\"Guys, even if I did not have the HDMI issue (or any of the issues I've had that the rest of you say never happens to you) there is still the download and install issues that is a real deal breaker for me. The PS3 requires so many downloads to be done NOT in the background. Even with my high-speed broadband that can still take over 10 minutes a game depending on the content. Then even after waiting for that download(s) the PS3 asks if you want to install the download. Really? I find that completely retarded. Why would I download something and then choose NOT to install? The PS3 should do the install and not make me wait through the download and then wait again through the install.There are very few downloads (and installs) that can be done in the background on the PS3. Most require you to wait and be able to do nothing else on your PS3 during this time. Perhaps for many of you that is just fine. I find it annoying and complete bs given that it is extremely rare for the 360 to require such. I can download games and game updates on my 360 and continue to play other games while the download is happening. Rarely ever does the 360 lock you out while it does downloads and installs.I had quit posting about the PS3 here because it became obvious that this is like debating religion. There are people who love their PS3 and those that love their 360 and there is little to nothing you can do to enlighten them. I never knew this until I posted my negative review of the PS3. I really don't care what any of you buy. It means nothing to me. And I don't even LOVE the 360. I just find it a much better system than the PS3. If my PS3 were to die, I would buy a new Blu-ray player. If my Elite 360 were to die I would buy another. I find the PS3 to be a real let down after having had a no-problem 360 (Elite) for the last couple of years. That's it. You do not have to agree. These are all opinions (reviews) and as such, there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\".Oh and as far as my 360 Elite being 100% problem free - it has been. What can I say? I just played an old Splinter Cell on my old white 360 and the console froze up where I had to do a power off reset. I took the game to my other tv with the black Elite 360 (w/ the 20 feet of HDMI) and as usual, not one single hiccup. I HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE ISSUE WITH MY BLACK 360 ELITE - NOT ONE. It has been 100% flawless. Not true of the old white 360 crap or either of the two PS3 Slims reviewed here.Believe me or not, I don't care. But those are the facts...\" ----and with that, will someone please turn out the lights.CHAPTER ONE-Oct. 26, 2010:  The PS3 is more \"glitchy\" than I would like (hence the 4 and not 5 stars) and the graphics during game play are just slightly less brilliant than what I get from my Elite 360.  It is the fastest Blu-ray player I've had, but has some issues maintaining a good connection.  If you wanna know more, read on...I have an older model 360, a newer model 360, a Wii and this newest version PS3.  Everything is hooked up in the best possible way that the device will allow - (HDMI, Toslink, Digital audio cable and / or component cables) - all depending on what the individual device will allow.  Everything is running into my 5.1 Dolby Digital / DTS stereo and into my 1080p HD projector throwing a 12 foot image.  Cables are the shortest runs possible in this set up, which happens to be about 20 feet.I consider the Wii in a totally different category than the 360 or the PS3.  The Wii is a family friendly, let's-all-get-in-to-the-action type console.  Fun for the entire family, but hardly a serious gamer's console.  And, with only component cables for video, it cannot be a serious contender for movies.  So, the following will be about the Elite 360 and this PS3.My favorite for gaming is hands down the newer 360.  I have the Elite 360 from about 2 - 3 years ago.  Like the PS3, it is hooked up with HDMI and Toslink outs.  The 360 has a slightly more saturated picture.  Yes, I have attempted multiple calibrations on both the 360 and the PS3 to try to get the most desirable image.  The 360 looks slightly better at times.  The sound is the same on both - excellent.  The real problem, if it really is one, is the the glitchiness of the PS3.  It has frozen up more than a couple of times, both on games and simply on the home menu screen.  The Elite 360 - never.  However, my older 360 (2004 model, I think) is crap.  It has locked up many times and was actually one of those that had the 3 rings of death and leaves marks on the discs.  But, it would appear that with the Elite, Microsoft finally got it right.That's not to say that the PS3 sucks.  No, it has some really nice features that are lacking on the 360.  Namely, a web browser, Blu-ray player and FREE on line gaming.  But, it also has some shortcomings that irritate.  They are:  glitchy graphics and operation that causes freeze-up or image artifacts, low power from the HDMI port that causes digital drop out know as sparklies, no infrared to make using a universal remote simple and easy and a controller that renders itself pretty much useless when the battery dies since you can't simply replace the batteries - you have to plug it in to recharge and now you either wait or continue playing tethered to the console via the charge cord - stupid.Do know that in my set up I have made every attempt to hook up everything the exact same so as to make the comparison apples to apples.  I do like the PS3 for it's Blu-ray and browser capability.  It's gaming ability is great and had I not a flawless 360 to compare it to on this 12 foot HD screen, I wouldn't think twice about it.  I am, however, dissatisfied with the poor power from the HDMI that plagues the PS3 on longer cable runs.  That is not an issue with the 360.  And the lack of an ir (for simple universal remote use) and no removable battery pack is just simply stupid.  Yes, the lithium batteries do last a long time in the PS3, but they still die and need charging.  In my 360 I use removable rechargeable AA NiMH batteries.  There's always a set charging and thus always a set ready to go.  I switch them out and continue to keep gaming - wireless.  The PS3 non-removable batteries means you can't.CONCLUSION:  If you do not currently own a PS3 or Elite 360 and are trying to decide to buy just one, ask yourself what is most important.  If it's having the ability to play Blu-rays and game on-line for free and maybe surf now and again then I suggest the PS3.  If it's all about serious gaming, then it's the Elite 360.  Note that I do not know when Microsoft got the 360 working correctly.  All I know is that I have a white one from 2004 (I think) and it's crap.  And I have a black one from 2008 (I think) called the Elite and it rocks!Don't take my word for it about the poor HDMI power of the PS3.  Google it for yourself.  I have created several theater set ups like my own and each time it is a chore to get the PS3 to communicate continually well with other devices.  The average viewer may never notice, but audiovideo geeks like me do.  On an all black image, if you are having digital drop off like the PS3 often does, you will see speckles of white like in old films.  It's called sparklies and the PS3 is known for them.  Again, we're talking HDMI runs over 6 feet.  Not a concern in a typical home set up, but definitely a concern for large home theaters.FINAL WORDS:  These are not my opinions.  I have no love of Microsoft.  Actually, I hate Microsoft for several reasons.  These are my observations based on my set up and my desires.  Yours may be different.  I'm simply wishing to inform others of my personal experience... and I hope this helps.UPDATE 11/14/2010 (dropped to 3 stars):  Way too many freeze ups / glitches.  The PS3 is not a new system and has no good excuse for this!  I cannot recommend to anyone to buy a PS3 UNLESS you absolutely want a great Blu-ray player in addition to a gaming system with free on-line play.  My Xbox 360 Elite still reigns supreme as the best gaming system...and I hate Microsoft, so that's a tough statement to make, but I call 'em as I see 'em.ANOTHER UPDATE Feb 2011 & loses another star rating:  I absolutely hate how it seems like every game update stops all play on the PS3.  Unlike game updates on the 360, when the PS3 needs to update a game it CANNOT be done in the background, but rather stops all other activities on the PS3 while it does the game update.  Most (if not all) 360 game updates can be done in the background while you are free to perform other activities with your 360.  Not so on the PS3.  Just another annoying thing about the PS3.  Pop in an older game or even a newer one that hasn't been in the machine in awhile and get ready to go do something else for awhile while your PS3 does nothing else but the update (sometimes for 30 minutes or more).I am disappointed in the PS3.  While the 360 in general has had several problems in it's past, it is easily argued that it has finally been pleasantly refined to near perfection.  The PS3?  Nope, not even close.02/18/2011:  I'm done.  I've had it.  I promise this is the last comment/post I will make about the PS3.  Use it as you will.The PS3 sux compared to the newest 360.  Quantum Solace just froze up AGAIN and ANOTHER software update consumed the PS3 for over 10 minutes and I'm just sick of it.  My Elite 360 NEVER gives me one single issue like this.  Hey SONY, ever heard of BACKGROUND downloads?  Anyone who recommends the PS3 over the 360 has NOT used the newer 360.  It is flawless, but simply lacks Blu-ray.  The latest PS3 is so full of shortcomings (as mentioned) that I have grown to despise it.  Were it not for the Blu-ray feature, I wouldn't keep it.  But hey, you don't have to take my word for it.  Buy a new 360 and a new PS3 and judge for yourself.............I'm done!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005UK88","description":"Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2boasts all 96 levels from the original Super NES game, from cheery Yoshi's Island through the sprawling Vanilla Dome to the grueling Star Road. While some levels emphasize pure action, others require you to puzzle your way out of the mazes and illusions. If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A decent port of the original.","reviewText":"I was lucky enough to be around when Super Mario World first came out. The game made a huge impact upon its release, and it changed the way platformers were made. Super Mario Bros. 3 was already a big change from the original, but this...this was an even bigger change. Better graphics, bigger levels, alternate exits, secret worlds, Yoshi, and a pretty extravagant ending (at the time). Up until I had to sell my SNES just a few years ago, the game would get regular play because it's that good. But this review is for the GBA version. I got this for my daughter, who even at her early age, is doing really good with games. 'thought it'd be a good stepping stone to introduce her to the traditional Mario formula because of how accessible it is to people of all ages, and since it can be played on the DS too. Well, it looks like going from the SNES to the GBA was a big change in its own right.Basic story that you should all know by now- Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool. Mario goes to save her. 'jumps around and runs through tons of different levels. The end. But along the way, you'll have to take out Bowser's kids, clear out some ghost houses, and if you want, find the secret Star Road levels, and then the secret levels within those too! The game takes a while to beat, though hardcore players can probably clear the whole thing in one sitting. The game has a good save feature, and for this GBA version, you can now save and continue/quit whenever you want. Gameplay is very easy since you're really only using 3 buttons and the d-pad, and really, anyone can play this game. When you find an egg, Yoshi will emerge, and you can ride him and take an extra hit, eat enemies, fly if you eat a blue Koopa shell, and use him as a boost if you can't reach a high area on your own. And he finally has green arms instead of orange ones now too! Mario's got some tricks of his own as well, including the fire flower and magic feather. With the fire flower, he can shoot fireballs, and shoot them in both directions during a spin jump. With the feather, Mario dons a cape and can fly after running a short distance, and even glide around if you hold down and then hit up real quick. If you thought flying as a raccoon or tanuki was cool, wait until you see the cape.They changed a few things for the GBA port, most of which are little things. Like now, you can switch between Mario and Luigi on the map. It's kind of annoying since you can choose this whenever you stop at an area on the map, as if the game's reminding you of the feature, instead of selecting who you want to play as at the beginning of the game, but it's still a nice addition. Luigi's sprite changed to his sprite from Super Mario Bros. 2 on the Mario All-Stars collection, and he has the same extended jump from that game too. Truth be told, it's a bit more difficult to play as him now because of this. The other changes aren't that big of a deal, but the main one is the one a lot of people are either overlooking, or somehow not bothered by it. Since this was made for the GBA, before the DS came out, it plays with just the A, B, L and R buttons. A is the default run/action button, and B is your regular jump, but the spin jump- something required for a lot of things in the game, is now the freakin' R button, a shoulder button! Even after playing this version for a few days, I can't get used to it. It feels weird, but it's not like they had a lot of options for controls at the time. Oh, they also put in the obligatory Mario Bros. arcade game (you know, the old Mario vs Luigi game where you just collect coins and take out Koopas by hitting the floor from under them). It's been included on every single Super Mario Advance title, and is fun for a few minutes, but at this rate, it's overkill.The graphics and music suffered a bit in the conversion to GBA. Everything looks a bit watered down and less vibrant, and some animations don't seem as smooth as they once were. Most of the sound effects are the same as the original, as is the music, but because of the hardware, it doesn't sound as good as it once did. 'no big deal for people who never got to play it in the early 90s, but for people who grew up with the game, you'll notice.Super Mario World for GBA is worth your money if you like platformers or want to see how good Mario was back in the day before everything got dumbed down since now most games hold your hand for the first 2 hours and show you how to do the most basic of things. But the uncomfortable controls hurt the score for me, as does hearing the stupid Mario and Luigi voices that were added in. 'just little complaints of mine that have nothing to do with the overall game, but for people expecting a perfect port, this ain't it. Maybe we'll get lucky and an updated Mario All-Stars will come out for DS at some point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00D9EPI38","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Best Xbox 360 design yet, except for one thing.","reviewText":"I'm hoping people who buy this realize how useless 4GB is. Don't get me wrong, the console is great, and the redesign looks stylish and is the quietest, lowest-power-consuming Xbox 360 yet. But I bought one of these along with a 320GB hard drive. The 4GB comes from the factory filled with some bloatware (arcade game trials) and the full version of the Hexic arcade game. But even if you delete all of this, you are left with FAR less than 4GB. That's not even enough to download a single full retail game; not even close.If you want to take advantage of the free Games for Gold (if you have a Gold subscription), good luck downloading any of those games. If you want to use the cloud game saves feature, well that takes up half a gigabyte to activate too. Even if you download nothing, some games download fairly large updates just to be playable at all. Your 4GB will easily be eaten up by any of these things.Unless you plan on buying this console only for non-gaming purposes, like using the Amazon/Netflix/Hulu/etc apps, or only playing very small Xbox Live Arcade games, you NEED to buy a hard drive with this. Or just buy the one that includes the hard drive. But for me, 250GB wasn't enough on my Xbox 360 S, so I bought this 4GB along with the 320GB hard drive.Now, other than the hard drive space, here's what I think about this compared to the previous Xbox 360 designs.- Quietest design yet. I can't say for sure if it is quieter than the 360 S though or just tied, since both designs are nearly silent and I can't hear them at all when any sound is coming from my speakers. I could easily hear my launch 360's fans over my speakers, even when they were playing something relatively loud.- The power brick is the same size as the S, but smaller than the original- The power brick is not interchangeable with any other 360 designs, since the connector on the 360 is a small round one instead of the fairly large semi-rectangular ones from the past- No optical audio out. This would have been a problem for me until I upgraded my AV receiver, which has all the HDMI switching capabilities I need. If you currently use optical out to pass your surround sound, and don't have an HDMI-switching AV receiver, be aware of this.- One less USB port (4 total) than the 360 S (which had 5). One more USB port than the original Xbox 360 (which had 3). Not a problem for many, but I think you can't have too many USB ports, and would have strongly preferred they didn't remove one of them.- Eject and power button are not touch-sensitive. You have to actually push the buttons in (I prefer this).Now the only serious thing I'm actually a little disappointed in compared to my launch 360 and 360 S (yes, I've purchased three 360s...), is something I haven't really heard anybody else mention yet. The green ring around the power button is either fully on, or off. You can't see what player(s) are connected by looking at the lit-up ring quadrants. Interestingly enough, my Xbox One is the same way, but the Xbox One controllers don't indicate which player it is either. I really liked having a way to see what players have their controllers connected. Not sure why they cut this feature.The design itself is quite nice, and matches my Xbox One quite well. But just like the Xbox One, half of it is a glossy surface, so you will need to be careful with it. Glossy consoles always age much worse than matte consoles, since they are easily scratched and scuffed, and show every last fingerprint. Keep it carefully dusted and don't put things on top of it if you want it to stay nice-looking for longer than a couple months.But the important thing is this final design of the 360 is solid, reliable, silent, and will not overheat on you like the original version. A very good redesign, especially when it is in close proximity to an Xbox One, since the designs complement each other well. BUT 4GB IS NOT ENOUGH! Hope I was clear on that. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

Ever since then, I've enjoyed all the different iterations of Mario games that Nintendo has released over the past twenty years or so.  When Nintendo 64 came out, Mario became a 3D game, which was a huge change for the series, so it's good to see that New Super Mario Brothers Wii (which I'm abbreviating as NSMBW from now on) has gone back to the old-school style of 2D Mario games.Simply put, this game is more like Super Mario 3 or Super Mario World than Mario 64 or Super Mario Galaxy.  This isn't just a reflection of the fact that this game is 2D instead of 3D; it also extends to the way levels are structured and the types of power ups you get.  You run, jump, swim, and sometimes fly (sort of) your way through lots of different levels to face off against Bowser.  Each level includes three special coins which allow you to unlock various hint movies and as well as special levels which only become available after beating the game once.  Besides the usual flower, star, and mushroom powerups, there is also a propeller hat, which lets you jump very high and slowly float to the ground, an ice flower which freezes enemies, and a penguin suit, which lets you slide (and also shoots ice fireballs).This game is notably harder than Super Mario Galaxy, although it probably is not as hard as the original Super Mario Brothers or possibly even Super Mario 3 or Super Mario World.  It is possible that complete novice gamers will find this game difficult, although the game does start out relatively easy and only gradually increases the difficulty.  If you're new to games (like many owners of the Wii) and unsure of how difficult this game will be for you, give it a try at a friend's first.  In any case, if you die a lot (eight times) on a level, the game will give you the option to have a computer \"guide\" play through the level for you, so you can see how it's done while advancing to the next stage.The multiplayer is the most novel addition to NSMBW.  Up to four players can play the game simultaneously, which is as chaotic as it sounds.  Because players can pick each other up and push each other around, it is entirely possible for players to accidentally or intentionally kill each other.  This can be frustrating for less skilled players, but there is always an option to \"bubble\", which lets you float around in an invincible bubble and follow non-bubbled players.  Of course, at least one person needs to be non-bubbled at any time.  This lets less skilled players take temporary breaks if they ever reach parts of the game which seem overly difficult.  This also makes the game noticeably easier for players who cooperate with each other, since if you die you will shortly return to the world in a bubble, instead of sitting out until the other player dies.  The only way a group of players can game over is if they all die or are bubbled at the same time.  Outside of the main game, you can also play \"coin battle\" with other players, where you race up to three other players on a level to see who can grab the most coins.The biggest \"problem\" I had with this game is that it seemed too short to me.  I completed it in about ten hours or so, so this game is much shorter than Super Mario Galaxy.  I didn't unlock all the special levels, so that's some additional content, but at times I felt nostalgic for the large levels in Super Mario 3 which weren't present in this game.  (For example, some worlds in SMB3 had fifteen or twenty stages, while in this game most worlds only have around ten.)  Additional content would have made a very enjoyable game even better, but if you enjoy platformers this game is worth getting as is.  I know I had lots of fun every moment I was playing this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}

This network not only connects friends for epic head-to head pursuits and races, but also enables players to compare performances and stats, thereby setting the stage for the ultimate in friendly competition.","reviewerName":"Peace Daddy \"Eclectic ReflectionZ\"","summary":"Five for the fun factor, but....","reviewText":"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit hits with plenty of force in many areas, and falls short in a few others. The cars, tracks and environments are all absolutely gorgeous. There's not much in the gaming world that can match the adrenaline rush you get while being chased down by cops and helicopters, driving a Porsche 200 miles per hour at night as the full moon and a raging waterfall taunt you from beyond. No complaints about the scenery here. This game has a little bit of everything: from snowstorms and icy roads to lightning and thunder as you fly down a slick highway. From desert to forest, to ocean side complete with lighthouse, and some amazing and diverse tunnels that really amplify your cop flashers with a dazzling effectiveness.You're given an impressive and wide-ranging list of cars to play with on here. Not surprisingly, through the Playstation Store you're offered an opportunity to buy a shortcut to unlock all the cars automatically. This is extremely lame and unnecessary. Take your time to actually play the game and unlock them, because the satisfaction of winning new cars is part of what makes games like this so much fun. Why anyone would want to pay extra to shortchange their gaming experience is beyond me. Now, EA & Criterion also want you to pay extra for new cars that aren't unlockable by playing the game. The fascination with forcing people to pay more for things that should have been (and used to be) included in the actual game is ridiculous. By the time you're finished buying all the add-ons you've basically paid twice for the same game... and by that time they've usually released a \"greatest hits\" version of it for half the price that has all of the add-ons included! Very disappointing that we seem to be continuing down this road.My other big gripe is with the absence of local multiplayer. That is the single biggest thing I miss from the older NFS titles. Sitting with your kids / spouse / friends and waiting for your turn instead of being able to compete together at the same time is just not as fun, bottom line. Would it really have been that hard to include this popular feature on here? Others have mentioned the fact that you can't use your steering wheel set-ups on here either, which is disappointing, but not nearly as disappointing as the lack of local multiplayer, especially in my household.That said, online multiplayer is fun and doesn't seem to suffer any lag issues. Career mode in single player progresses properly and is difficult enough to keep you frustrated yet wanting more. The one area where the frustration factor is very high is in the cop time trials. Losing 2-3 seconds for every single thing you hardly touch or bump is overkill, and should have been left out. I understand having some sort of a penalty for cops causing damage on the way to assist on a call, but they could have came up with something more reasonable than that. Crash scenes are similar to Burnout, shown in slow motion and close-up to heighten the rush of satisfaction or disappointment. Spike strips don't seem to work nearly as often as they probably should, and EMP seems to be slightly too successful, but overall the weaponry at your disposal as cop and racer is well executed and fun to utilize. Lastly, the soundtrack isn't quite as good as past NFS releases, but that's where the all-important custom soundtrack comes in. More games should utilize the custom soundtrack option in my opinion, and for me it's an essential addition to every racing game. A couple clicks through the menu and any memory of a substandard sountrack is instantly erased as you fly down the highway blasting your favorite music. EA and Criterion did not miss the mark here.Overall, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit is a fun, beautifully flawed experience. EA and Criterion could have had a real winner with lasting impact in this title, but because they've left out a few key components, I sadly cannot give Hot Pursuit the five stars I wanted to give it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

This is Halo, the original xbox game, with updated graphics, achievements, and a few other perks.Immediately before putting this game in, I spent 7 hours strait playing Halo Reach from start to finish. What I found when I finally put in this game was that I was surprised by how different it was. One needs to realize that this isn't Halo \"reimagined\" with completely updated graphics like you'd find in Reach. The AI, the level designs, and the flaws from the original Halo are all kept.Some of you will LOVE that they kept the game completely intact instead of tweaking and modding it ala the George Lucas treatment. Others will be disappointed by the incredibly stupid AI, certain abnormally overpowered weapons, poor repetitive level designs that make you feel lost (particularly in the beginning), and a bland environment. While yes, the graphics are \"better\", they didn't add to the preexisting environments, so when they design a level that is bland because that is all the xbox could handle at the time, upping the graphics didn't resolve these issues. The game is exactly what it was on the xbox, flaws and all.So if your question is \"is this game for me?\", you will need to look at a few things. If you own Halo CE on the Xbox, you'll need to decide whether a facelift, achievements, 6 \"new\" Reach Maps are worth a repurchase. If you don't own Halo CE and you like the Halo series yet haven't played 1, then it's a definite buy. I personally found that at $40 price tag, it's a bit steep for anyone who already owns Halo CE, so I pulled off a star for that.

More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism.
