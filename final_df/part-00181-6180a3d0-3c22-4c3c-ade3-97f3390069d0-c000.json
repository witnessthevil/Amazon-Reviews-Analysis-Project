The opening cinematic is highly detailed and awesome.Lets get down to business.Sound:Fantastic.The grunts of pain, death, and falling off tall things never sounded so good. Voiceovers during Konquest mode are horrible but well understood.They are over- enunciated and loud.Thumping noises and the clashing of swords sound phenomonial though. Music is well done and dark.Graphics:Highly detailed.Dark, gruesome, gory, and just plain awesome work well in this game. The characters are highly detailed and look cool. Environments are supurbly detailed and fun to play on.Gameplay:Phenominal. The three style fighting system was a well done feature.There are two hand-to-hand styles and one weapon style. Each style has its own weaknesses and strengths. Button combos are great and easy to memorize.Each character has specific abilities,fatlities, and hara-kiris(suicides).They are all easy to memorize as well.Konquest:Fun yet dull.Fun in bursts but dull after an hour. Good for finding Koins though. You play as Shujinko while he is young sent by the Elder Gods to find the Komidogus.You meet various characters and do side-quests, training, and exploring. There are 7 vast realms that you go through while on your quest.Chess Kombat:Great fun. I thought it was stupid but I gave it a try and loved it. Imagine chess but instead of jumping over characters to kill them you actually face each other in Kombat. The winner travels to(or stays on) the square. Also movement for each piece is different than real chess. You also have spells you can cast to help you.You have;kill, imprison, trade, ressurect, and many others.Puzzle Kombat:This is the most addictive thing since Tetris. Very fun and challenging. The character you choose has a special ability that helps you out of a tight spot or puts your opponent in one.Krypt:The only con of the game.Buy art, levels, characters, costumes, and music with your Koins. Koins are earned by fighting in arcade mode,puzzle kombat, chess kombat, and Konquest.This game is among the best in the ps2's library.Not recommended for children.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2009"}

As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"coopertex","summary":"They're Going To Eat You","reviewText":"I liked the story of how you as the main character, named chuck, must aquire Zombrex medication to keep his little girl from dying. You have been accused of unleashing the zombie horde unto Las Vegas, by blowing up the main gate keeping them at bay. You look for clues and talk to witnesses which can lead to you clearing your name.You encounter NPCs that will follow you and sometimes help you as you try to run back to the safe house. The NPC's however can't always run fast, and sometimes get distracting from the endless sea of zombies wandering around everywhere.While you are busy yourself trying to run away to survive the onslaught, I felt that it was annoying to rescue dumb NPCs. The zombies never end and just keep coming by the hundreds.At your disposal are everyday items which can be used as makeshift weapons, such as wooden boards, trash bins, baseball bats, chairs etc... The list of items you can use of the weapons to long to name, and I admit it can be fun using them. However I hate the fact that weapons degrade and you can only use them to kill zombies a limited number of times (after which the weapon breaks and disappears). There are also conventional weapons such as guns, or knives, but they are more rare and difficult to find through out the massive map. So you seldom get to play trigger happy.The level designs is great ranging from indoor mall, to small shops, cafes and large casino's. Everything was coherant and looked fun to explore graphically.There is little to no frame drops even with the thousands of zombies on-screen at once. But after watching the horde of zombies it all begins to blur and get a feeling of \"sameness\" with little variety in enemy types. So what the developers did was add mini boss encounters, which are usually psychotic humans wielding some sort of weapon coming at you at full speed and movement patterns. Lots of cheapness which will end your game early if you don't find and exploit their weaknesses.I wasn't able to try co-op online because there was no one playing the couple of times I attempted to find a game. There is no available games list, instead it tries to automatically drop you into a game. No one dropped into mine even when I left it open to public.I really hated the constant load screens, that broke in every time your character had something to say. or someone else was talking and they showed us a cutscene. Although the PS3 load times are faster than other platforms it still feels long.I also hated the fact that a lot of the missions and side quests had a time limit. This curtails the fact that the game is hailed to have open world gameplay. For the most part you can go anywhere and do anything but you are restricted by the clock! This sucks.After killing zombies there is nothing else to do but kill hundreds more zombies. If this doesn't bother you then no worries, but I found it boring fast.Pro:+tons of impovised weapons+good story+good sound effects+good voice acting+sense of humor+fun charactersCons:-too many cutscenes-long loading times-weapon degradation sucks-NPCs can be dumb and annoying-time limited missions-not as open world as it should be-very repeatative","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

Games like Rogue Warrior, WET, Brink and many Star Trek games have enraged gamers who blindly purchased those games on the strength of their prestigious name alone.  Only FONV was spared of such fate.But just as they were once reinvigorated by a 'hands-off' media mogul, ZeniMax, 'id Software' headed by the Godfather of FPS, John Carmack, has joined the ZeniMax family.  Carmack, wanting to gain financial muscle without giving up his creative control and integrity, turned down EA and agreed to join Bethesda.With a new arsenal under their belts, Bethesda finally published a game that can live up to their TES and Fallout prestige, albeit not without some flaws.  It's Rage, developed by the renowned id Software.((id TECH 5))Carmack, the creator of Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake series, is notorious for spending too much time on the engine and focusing only on the tech side of the game development.  So it's a no surprise that Rage is one heck of a great-looking game on PC thanks to his 'id Tech 5' engine.Colors, graphical fidelity, textures, details and draw distance are nothing short of breath-taking and framerate is rock-solid on nVidia-equipped PC.  The art design is focused on style rather than photo-realism, character animations are highly stylized and vibrant.The game is over 25 GB when fully installed on your PC.((FPS FOR NON-MODERN WARFARE CROWDS))FPS has evolved significantly since Doom 3, the last game developed by id Software back in 2004.So gamers who loves multiplayer-focused FPSs like Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield series must be aware that Rage is a single player-focused FPS with one single player portion, one seperate co-op portion and vehicular multiplayer portion.  There is no FPS multiplayer; no deathmatch, no CTF, no onslaught.Also gamers who expect another Fallout or Borderlands must be aware that Rage is neither CRPG like Fallout 3 nor Action slash RPG hybrid like Borderlands.Rage is a FPS first and foremost with a long campaign (about 12 hours main quest alone and many sidequests and minigames to take on and racings to join); I finished the single campaign around 20 hours doing everything and I finished seperate co-op portion in about 5 hours.  Think of Doom 3 with handful of hub towns set in large open outdoor environment in wasteland and MotorStorm thrown in the mix, you have a good idea what Rage will be like.((GAMEPLAY))You take quest, you drive through the wasteland, fight off the enemy vehicles, enter the indoor environment, kill everything that moves, head back to the quest-giver, upgrade your weapons and vehicles.  Take some rest and play some minigames, take some sidequests.  Rinse and repeat.There is no character buildup to worry about and there is no interaction with NPCs or environment.  Conversations with NPCs are one-way.  They either give you quests, barter with you or engage in minigames with you.  Story is bare minimum and an excuse for the action.  You cannot pick up weapons from the dead foes and items you pick up are solely used for your weapon and vehicle upgrades.  It's this rather simplistic and cumbersome gameplay mechanics and lack of FPS multiplayer portion that will disappoint many hardcore Modern Warfare crowds.Outstanding gunplay mechanics, sound effects and awesome graphics with smooth framerate Rage offers on PC are not just for show but a requirement in order for you to fend off endless waves of hyperactive mobs with excellent A.I.  I've never experienced such relentless, methodical and unpredictable foes in FPS genre and you are in for a fight for your life every inch of your way.  Your enemies will coordinate the attack plans to corner you, flank you, flush you, trap you in packs.  And because you are pretty much ineffective in melee combat, you have to use things like sentry-bot, turret, RC-mini car, wingstick and crossbow to keep them at bay and figure out which types of ammo to use and up to 4 different types of ammos can be slotted in any given weapon.While Rage is not a RPG, it packs surprising amount of depths in customization and menu layouts.  Your weapons must be purchased or given but can be crafted, customized and upgraded to your hearts contents by picking up various items and components scattered throughout the world.  Every weapon packs a violent punch and each hit ends with satisfying gore.Vehicular action and controls are very well implemented and speedy racing action (both combat and non-combat) and mayhem are thoroughly satisfying and a nice change of pace.((DOWNSIDES))The game is definitely one of the longest FPS out there but feels so brief and short in part due to its excellency but also because you get sucked into this gorgeous world that gives you the illusion of endless possibilities but gives you very limited amount of freedom.I guess I've been spoiled by Fallout 3 and FONV (even Borderlands to some extent) but it's impossible to look at Rage and not thinking about some what-ifs; filling out this gorgeous open-world with more NPCs, more quests and more meaningful interaction with such a detailed world, but as I said earlier, Rage is a FPS.  But I have to keep telling myself it's FPS, FPS, FPS,...but what if...It's almost a crime not to fill this gorgeous open-world up with enough contents to rival TES and Fallout series.It would have been nice if they put mobs on foot in the wasteland also but as it stands the open-world outside corridor and hubs are a playground solely for vehicular action, and the world, that will take forever to walk, feels so small when you drive around.id Software is no Shakespear when it comes to storytelling department from Wolfenstein 3D to Doom 3, but I can't shake the feeling that the story is inevitable setup for franchise or more DLCs to come.  The story is rather disappointing and the ending might even enrage some of you.Last, but not least, Rage on PC is not for the average rigs.  While not as system resource hog as the first Crysis or Crysis 2 with high-texture pack and DX11, its system requirements are not low.  Remember that meeting the recommended system requirements doesn't mean you can play the game at the max setting.Considering the size of the installed game and incredible graphics, the game is bug-free and stable with smooth and solid framerate.My PC is equipped with Intel i7 950 3.1 Ghz, Corsair 6 GB tri-channel DDR3 Dominator GT and EVGA GTX 460 1024 MB Superclocked; certainly a high-end but not a top-notch system but the game runs at solid 60 plus fps with no texture pop-ups, no screen tearing, no slowdown and loading time about 5 seconds.((STEAMED))Yes, it's steamed.((OUTRO))If you enjoy unique FPS like Crysis, Far Cry, Deus Ex but not fans of mainstream FPS behemoths like Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield, try Rage.  It doesn't revolutionize anything new at all for the genre but it feels fresh and unique precisely because it does everything different from more mainstream approaches.However, even if you are fans of Modern Warfare, Halo and Battlefield series, you will find it enjoyable if you keep open-minded.  It offers long main quest (in FPS standard) and many sidequests and minigames to take on.  It does offers vehicular multiplayer portion and story-driven seperate co-op portion.  With the graphic to melt your face and awesome gunplay mechanics, it's one of the best game of the year.((Addendum))It seems Rage is much more inclined to nVidia than ATI and so many ATI owners have more problems than nVidia owners but not every ATI owner have problems and not all nVidia owners can run the game problem free.I am not taking id Software's side but it is indeed impossible for any developers to QA for gazillion cases of various PC peripherals combination possibilities, and no developers ever test for any video cards out there; it's just not their jobs outside creating and developing the game itself.  They simply program for the respective graphic card architectures, not toward any specific video card.First update your respective video card driver and optimize your HDD before installing the game.Make sure you keep your drivers for DirectX, C++ Redistributable and sound card up to date and open up your control panel on your Windows and adjust your nVidia / ATI control panel.  These updates are important not just for Rage but for all PC games all the time.If you have broken quests, character stuck in environment, objects disappears, etc, they are in-game programming bugs.  If you cannot start the game, black screen, no sound, scratching noise, etc, they are usually related to your PC settings and hardwares / drivers.  It doesn't matter if your PC is an uber-powerful top of the line machine or brand new.I can appreciate the frustration for those who cannot play the game while I've never had any single problem.  Unfortunately, you just have to wait for the new updates for your graphic card.New patch from the developers also adds new options for graphical settings.  They also plan to release multiple PC exclusive patches, like 'The Witcher' series, that will give additional modding tools, DX11 options and even higher texture packs that were originally cut from 125 GB size.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Taking Heck&Slash to a whole new level","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Devil May Cry game and heck&slash; genre. Since Bayonetta is created by Hideki Kamiya, the creator of the original Devil May Cry and the inventor of the heck and slash genre, I felt obligated to try Bayonetta out. Simply put, the game just blew my mind and here is why.-EXTREMELY DEEP AND ELEGANT COMBAT SYSTEM: Just like devil may cry games, this game has amazing combat system. You will be amazed by how many different types of combos you can pull of using hand to hand as well as weapon combats. Furthermore, as you master these combos, you will enjoy this game more and more. Normal and difficult modes of this game are mainly designed for people who take joy in mastering and exploring different combos and use them to punish enemies; however, if you are a button masher don't worry. Easy and very easy mode will take you through the game, performing various combos by the taps of the same button.-LODS AND LODS OF WELL DESIGNED WEAPONS: In this game you have access to 11 or so special weapons that are specifically made for Bayonetta throughout the game and 4 or more special weapons you can unlock by meeting certain requirement. You will also have access to 7 or more enemies weapons. You can equip two sets of weapons at the same time so there is a lot to experiment by pairing different weapons to punish enemies.-EPIC BOSS BATTLES: To me a game is no good if it does not have good bosses. Fortunately this game has plenty of awesome boss fights. God of War  and Devil May Cry games are my favorite games of all times because of the boss battles, but some boss battles in Bayonetta even goes beyond any God of War or Devil May Cry game. Unfortunately, I can not tell you about some of the most spectacular boss battles without spoiling the experience.-VARIETY OF ENEMIES: So many games these days have the same enemies over and over again. Not Bayonetta though. It will start with some relatively easy enemies, but as you further progress in the games, the enemies will get stronger, harder, faster and more interesting. Again, can't tell you more without spoiling the content.-AMAZING SUMMONS: With difficult enemies and bosses, you need strong moves to finish them, right? No worries, Bayonetta can summon 10 (if not more) ridiculously powerful monsters from Hell to finish off your opponents. As you progress further and further into the game, Bayonetta will summon more and more stronger monsters. Believe me there is no better way to finish a battle than annihilate your opponent using these creatures.-SPECTACULAR LEVEL DESIGNS: Different levels/stages in this game are very well designed. Most game you are standing on flat land from beginning to the end. Not in Bayonetta though. You will be walking on the walls, running on the ceilings, jumping from a chunk of a land flying in space to other, surfing in the ocean and everything that you never imagine a game could make you do. THE BEST PART HERE, the camera angles changes accordingly, so it doesn't confuse you and allows you to make the best move possible. I just loved the whole experience.-TRANSFORMATION ABILITIES: Being a witch, Bayonetta can transform into lightning fast panther, elusive bats or flying crow. These transformations are extremely useful in the combat. Being able to transform into bats right as an enemy hits you to evade his attack, JUST PRICELESS.-WITCH TIME: Another great feature of the game. Dodging an enemy attack at the right time slows time and gives you upper hand to punish the enemy making the gameplay so much more enjoyable.-VARIETY OF GAMEPLAY: While majority of game is heck and slash fighting, you will also be doing cool things like riding bike and other things (really don't want to spoil it more). At the end of each level, you will get to play mini game called Angel Attack. This keeps the gameplay experience fresh and prevent the game from being redundant.-DECENT STORY: While it is not the strongest element of this game, it has fairly decent humorous story. Under most scenarios due to cultural differences, sense of humor is very different in Japanese games from the Westen games. Honestly for me though, different jokes in the games made me laugh hard. Cinematic were decent and if you want detailed version of the story, there are plenty of documents you have access to throughout the game.-PLENTY OF UNLOCKABLES AND GREAT RE-PLAYABILITY: There are a lot of accessories (helps you with combat), combat moves, characters, weapons and costumes you can unlock in the game by spending halos you get from defeating enemies. Plus, there are hard and extra hard modes to the game. It will be difficult if not impossible to unlock everything on your first playthrough. Good thing here is you can keep all the things you have unlocked and use them when you play the game again and unlock more awesome items. This truly adds replayability value to the game.Now like many of you the first time I saw Bayonetta, I was like what the hell is this creature? After playing this game, it totally makes sense to me. She is designed in this particular way because she is a witch and to appreciate the beauty of this design, YOU MUST PLAY THIS GAME.So all and all this game will make you go through the experiences you will not see coming and before you know it, it will get you addicted.  BELIEVE ME, I JUST FINISHED IT FOR THE FORTH TIME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2010"}

My sister first owned this game in 1998, and since then I have owned MANY Pok&eacute;mon games for both Game Boy Color and N64. And let me tell you, the original is always the best! Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue are the best games ever created for Game Boy Color! I still love these games, trading Pok&eacute;mon, and battling other people with the Link Cable!First of all, people of any age can enjoy this game. It is cute and innocent enough to entertain children, but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults. Everyone will love this game.You start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town. Your mission is to become a Pok&eacute;mon Master by catching 150 Pok&eacute;mon (151 if you count Mew) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four. To do this, you must train and catch Pok&eacute;mon, raise them, and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color. This is both fun and time-consuming, which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day. Pok&eacute;mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy. Raising Pok&eacute;mon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pok&eacute;mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok&eacute;mon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pok&eacute;mon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pok&eacute;mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pok&eacute;mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok&eacute;balls with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok&eacute;mon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pok&eacute;mon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pok&eacute;mon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pok&eacute;mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok&eacute;mon Center.The music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok&eacute;mon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pok&eacute;mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pok&eacute;mon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you! Pok&eacute;maniacs rule!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2002"}

MOH actually requires you to be skilled with a gun.  what a concept. if you do go online, be prepared to have you back side handed to you. repeatedly. it can be very unforgiving and more than a bit frustrating.  when i first hopped on last night for my first match i died five times before i even saw an enemy.  but by the end of the night i was more than holding my own. be patient. practice. plan. strategize. i think you'll find this a more rewarding experience than sitting under a stairway waiting for five guys to run by so you can call in your care package.the multiplayer maps look amazing and the sound design, as we've come to expect from DICE, is off the charts.  you really feel the heft of your M4a1 or ak-47. another nice touch is the scorechain, which is different from a killstreak.  you get points for killing enemies, arming/disarming objectives, kill assists, etc.  a certain number of points get an offensive or defensive reward [mortar strike, UAV, etc]. you can choose to reward yourself [mortar strike, missiles], or reward your team [match ammo, flak jackets, etc]. i saw a nice balance of both last night. it's a nice change that i hope to see other games incorporate.  and we can only hope DICE releases NEW maps instead of new MODES of existing maps like they did on BFBC2.if you're a parent and your kid wants this, be warned there are pleny of f-bombs. this is, after all, war.  the gore is pretty realistic [a .50 cal gunshot will tear an enemy's head - or limb - clean off], but there's an option to turn the gore off in the menu.i've not tried the Tier 1 mode yet [an arcady style single player campaign with an online leaderboard], but i imagine it's pretty fun and gives the game some replay value.in short, if you want a man's shooter that focuses on skill and winning, step up to medal of honor.  you won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Mega Man's first adventure and a pretty good game, if a little rough around the edges","reviewText":"When Capcom released MEGA MAN (or ROCKMAN in Japan), they could have had little idea that they just launched their biggest franchise, nor would it be possible for the buying public to realise this character would go on to become the most prolific game character ever.His first game, an action platformer from 1987, famously introduced the concept of chosing your own order in which to beat the stages.  Not only that, when you defeat the boss of that level, you get his/her powers, and can use these powers against other robot masters.  While the weaknesses had some logic in them in the first three games, as it is based off the game Paper, Rock, Scissors, the further we got along in the MM series the less that analogy really worked (seriously, why is Tomahawk Man in MM VI weak too ?).  While the game itself is pretty linear, MM still gave the players a rather remarkable sense of freedom in the 1980s.  While the concept has since been beat to death, if you're from that generation of players you can't help but appreciate MM's rather daring game play.  But that doesn't mean it's a perfect game.  Not by a long shot.The game has some of the most notorious cover art in video game history.  The cover art has absolutely nothing to do with the game, and Mega Man looks like a forty five year old man holding a gun in some bizarre futuristic place.Like most franchise that began in the 1980s (Castlevania, Metroid, Kid Icarus, Ninja Gaiden, Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and several others), this first game may seem a little bit rough compared to later installments.  While arguably SMB could be released in today's game market with little or no changes, games like Metroid, the first Zelda, and this title  would never be released without some significant revisions.  Metroid has no automap, and you're left wondering around this labyrinth maze with little or no direction where to go.  Zelda has the same issue, though instead of a maze it's a large overworld, and it's damn near impossible to find all its secrets without referring to some type of map or game guide, which in the 1980s were hard to come by if you didn't have a subscription to Nintendo Power (the essential gaming magazine of the 1980s).  Metroid is a particular favorite of mine, particularly for the lack of auto-map, but for those professional critics who criticize its game play, the original LEGEND OF ZELDA is just as unforgiving and obtuse at times.  Still both are great games.Mega Man is the same way.  There [are undeniably some great parts to the game, but it's a little rough around the edges by today's standards, like most games of that era].  Overall, the game's difficulty is rather high, especially in the last stages.  And, like Zelda II, the game difficulty also has just some plain cheap shots to it.  If it weren't for the Magnetic Beam, I would probably never get past the last half of the Ice Man's stage (which involves jumping from platform to platform, dodging shots).  You can be standing directly on the platform, in the dead center, get shot and get knocked off or fall through to your instant death.  Even with Mega Man's infamous recoil he should be knocked that far back.  Guts Man's roving platforms at the beginning of that stage are also rather notorious.Speaking of the Magnetic Beam, all six NES titles have special items that you must use to further advance in the game.  From MMII on, you would get said item after defeating a particular robot master.  In this game, however, the item is in plain view in the Elec Man stage, though you must have defeated Guts Man and use his weapon to throw away the blocks that keep Mega Man from getting the item.  You may or may not pick it up. But here's the trick.  You must have it to get past a certain area in the opening stage of Dr. Wily's castle.  The game is rather cheap like that.Other difficulties include lack of Energy Tanks as well as no password feature.  That means every time you turn on the game you must start all over.  Now, this problem has since been alleviated with the game's release on the MEGA MAN ANNIVERSARY COLLECTION. But if you're playing on an original NES, well, good luck.Back in 1987, most gamers were still going for high scores, and so MEGA MAN, the only game in the entire (massive) franchise to do so, has points and keeps score.  Anyone who gets a high score on this game I do admire, as when you run out of lives you die, and given the game's difficulty, you will end up losing your accumulated score quite often.  Still, there's no high score keeper, and you don't get anything for high points.  Overall, this feature feels much more like a relic of its time, and very much feels like the high score feature was simply tacked on to an already existing game.  The high score serves no real function, and Capcom wisely disregarded it when they made MEGA MAN II.The game also features different graphics for the health powerup and the weapon powerup.  These items graphically are the same for MM2 to MM6, but in MM1 they appear totally different.  The game also features an exclusive item to the series, a powerup called the Yashichi.  It only appears once in the last stage of the game.  Capcom used the item in other games in that same era.[Throughout the series, if Mega Man is hit by an enemy, he becomes temporarily invincible to further attacks. From Mega Man 2 on, this invincibility would even protect Mega Man if he fell onto spikes. However, in the NES version of Mega Man 1, that is not the case. While the temporary invincibility is featured in this game, it will not prevent Mega Man from perishing if he falls onto spikes. This aspect of the Mega Man 1 play mechanics contributes greatly to the game's overall difficulty.Also, for the six NES games, MM1 is the only one that makes the player fight enemies after reaching the Robot Master's lair. In the other five installments, once Mega Man reaches the Robot Master's room, Mega Man goes into a short passageway into the next room to fight that particular level's boss. There are no enemies in these passageways, and are only one screen long. However, in MM1, the corridors are longer than one screen and there are enemies to contend with when bartering passage to the Robot Masters. These corridors might have been leftovers during development, during which Capcom originally was going to release the game on the Famicom Disk System. The corridors would have been used as \"loading tunnels\", allowing the disk to be accessed and load up the boss fight without any major pauses in the action. In the end, Capcom switched to cartridges instead, but the tunnels stayed, anyway.Mega Man 1 is also the only NES Mega Man game that makes the player climb up or down once he or she reaches the inner chamber. In Elec Man's stage, the player must climb up a ladder to reach his lair; in Bomb Man's stage, the player climbs down a ladder (or falls) to reach his lair.At the end of every NES Mega Man game, the player must fight the game's Robot Masters a second time before going to the final showdown with Dr. Wily. MM1 is the only game that spreads these fights across two separate levels (Mega Man must fight Cut Man and Elec Man on Wily Stage 2, and then has to fight Bomb Man, Fire Man, Ice Man, and Guts Man on Wily Stage 4). MM1 is also one of the only two games in the Classic series (the other being Mega Man & Bass) that does not allow the player to select the order in which to fight the Robot Masters a second time. In Mega Man 2 through 6, after defeating each Robot Master the second time, a large energy pellet appears. In Mega Man 1, these do not appear, making the last stage considerably difficult.Starting with Mega Man 2, the player is shown a visual representation of Dr. Wily's castle (or, in Mega Man 4, 5, and 6; Dr. Cossack's castle, Proto Man's castle, and Mr. X's castle, respectively, with Dr Wily's castle following each). Each stage is a dot on the map, and when Mega Man beats one stage and goes to the next, this progress is shown on the map. Mega Man 1, however, does not have this feature. In the PSP remake, Mega Man Powered Up, it can be seen as the player loads one of four final levels, and is named \"Castle Wily\". Mega Man 1 is also the only game where the player selects Dr. Wily's stage and he appears like the Robot Master with the clear points listed next to him.This section in brackets drawn from Wikipedia.  I wrote these sections in that article, however.]I can proudly say that I have beaten this game, but only once.  The last stage on Dr. Wily is absolutely brutal, and the last fight with those four bosses back to back extremely hard.  Without the pause trick I don't know how people do it.  And the Yellow Devil is a nightmare as well.  Still, I beat the game (this one's harder that LOST LEVELS any day).Of all the six NES games, this has the most old-school feel to it.  Other installments to the series feel much more refined and much more polished.  This title, though, feels like it stands along the ranks of Zelda, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, and Mario for that old-school, mid 1980s gaming goodness.Despite its difficulty, this is easily one of my favorite NES games.  The game has proven to hold up remarkably well, despite the rough edges, and it is only by tinkering with the game engine slightly (by lowering the difficulty and introducting a couple new features) that Capcom introduced the masterpieces MMII and MMIII.  But the foundation for those games was all here.Overall, this is the worst of the original Mega Man trilogy.  Still, a legendary start, and rightly so.This is my order of Mega Man NES titles from best to worst.  II and III are the best, though I give a slight edge to II because this is the game that really redefined the Mega Man formula, but III is just as good, and probably better.  IV and V are about the same as well, though neither approach the sublime quality of the first three.MEGA MAN IIMEGA MAN IIIMEGA MANMEGA MAN VMEGA MAN IVMEGA MAN VI.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2007"}

Considering that the game is developed by Rockstar, the makers of Grand Theft Auto, that may come as a bit of a surprise. But the elements of this game are also a surprise, and the game is a twisted combo between Resident Evil, GTA, and Splinter Cell.You begin the game as James Earl Cash, a dethrow inmate who is &quot;sentenced to death&quot;. Actually, you are &quot;saved&quot; by the Director, and evil personality who puts you in the middle of a sadistic film. This is essentially where the game begins. You are set loose in Carcer City, a horror of a city where gangs run rampant and where the smell of death is everywhere. In each new level, you are set in a new part of town, where a particular gang patrols. These gangs become increasingly violent and harder to kill, and saying that you had a fun time patrolling these areas would be a huge lie.There are two ways to kill these enemies. You can go on a shootfest, or you can take the tougher and more encouraged route to success. This is where you execute the victims through three different attacks of bloody degree, depending on what the Director demands. These are all executed by a series of weapons ranging from a paer bag to a sawed off shotgun. The weapon selections are as expansive as in GTA Vice City.As in Splinter Cell, the shadows are your friends when going up against these tough enemies. You must hide to survive, and when the time is right, kill the victim, or prey. Make a slight mistake, and you could be the catch of the day for these hunters. As you can figure out, the name of the game in Manhunt is stealth.In great Rockstar tradition, the sound is excellent. not so much the music, but the chattering of you, the director, and your enemies. A headset is also available to yell at your enemies at and confuse them. It is an interesting technique. The graphics are on par with GTA III's.Manhunt is sick, twisted, and bloody. Much worse than Vice City, too. But as it is new territory, any fan of Vice City, or the macabre will love hunting humans in Manhunt.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}

I now own 3 xbox 360 controllers.  The one that game with the console worked fine for about 4 months, and now the left stick \"wanders\" - that is, if you let go of the stick, it continue reading forward motion.  This causes characters to keep walking, cars to keep driving, and any kind of flying craft to nose dive.  It has gotten to the point that I can't use the controller anymore.  Some people claim that controllers just \"do this\" after extended use, but 4 months isn't a lot of time, especially when I swapped usage between this controller and the second that I bought separately with the console.The second controller had a spring issue right out of the box - the \"up\" direction on the D-pad (the lower-left gray '+' button) had very little spring resistance.  I always have to press up more deliberately than the other directions, and in face-paced games it can mean the difference between life and death if the button doesn't register.  I can still use the controller, but I choose it for slower games like golf.  I thought it would work itself out which is why I never returned it - my fault.I recently bought one of the blue controllers (big PennState fan here) and it too has a slightly reduced spring feel to the up-D-pad button, but it's barely noticeable, and does not affect game play.I'll keep my receipts in a safe place from here out, but otherwise, these controllers have good battery life and remain comfortable.  They're also nice and heavy which makes them feel sturdy and reliable.  Let's just hope that the later remains true.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2008"}

If you purchase the Stone Prisoner option and replace Lloyd with Bella as the head of the Redcliff Tavern the bug will start and eventually corrupt your files.  This is will happen if you remove the Shale Stones from her chest and sell them for your precious gold.  This bug has apparently been fixed on the computer version from what I have read but it remains on the XBox versions.  The graphics for the game should have been much better and EA could be accused of false advertising since this game is not even remotely similar to the promotional videos for it.  I was very disappointed by that.  I also am not happy that the merchants charge about 5 times more than the sell back for items making  you reluctant to purchase much of the neat armors and swords and such. Unlike games like Oblivion all the merchants seem to buy back things at the same prices and so when you buy that 27 gold priced sword you will only get maybe 5 gold back for it.  For me this is a real draw back in the game and is just stupid on the part of the developers.  There is enough things about this game that make it interesting if you like this kind of game.  I have played it over and over and enjoyed many things about it and continually discover new things in it but it is far from perfect and when you put so much time in a game and discover you have a serious bug that could prevent you from playing to the end, well that is a real disappointment.  I had this problem too with Oblivion when I apparently went to a certain ruin too soon.  Never did finish that one.Here are some more annoying bugs I have found in this game.  You can only create a limited number of characters, once the limit is reached you have to delete every saved file for one of the other characters before being allowed to continue which means if you want to do say the city elf story you have to get rid of your completed mage or noble, and that means you can't use them in the add-on Awakening which is also buggy as all get out, too short, not as interesting as Origins.  Oh and by the time you get really good at killing darkspawn and such, the game is over.  Speaking of Awakening, when I imported my city elf rouge to the game instead of the tattoo she had a stamp on her head saying DO NOT USE.  Good Grief can't they fix this crap.

Baldur's Gate 2 has incredible RPG depth, a strong tactical aspect, and great replay value. The expansion is bigger than most, and adds significant epic-level capabilities for your characters.The game picks up several years after the events in Baldur's Gate, and continues the plot. If you didn't play that first game (a shame- go get it) there are a few quick recaps of the key points. You can play in single play mode, in which case you make your one main character (or import from Baldur's Gate); multiplay with just you, in which you can make your whole party; or multiplay with friends, in which everyone can make and control one or more characters. In any case, your party has up to six people at a time, and you can dismiss or add characters at will.Add to this a whole lot of classes, including special 'kits' that are akin to 3rd edition prestige classes (save that you can take them immediately) and you have a whole lot of room for party customization. There's a host of NPCs that can join your party, some better than others, but all very interesting and with unique (sometimes very extensive) side quests. You can have romantic relationships with some of these potential party members, and some will even have romances with other NPCs.Almost all of the dialogue in the game is spoken, and although there's not much full motion video, when there is it's well done. The plot advances through chapters, and there are numerous side quests that take you to many varied game world locations. The rewards for some of these quests are awesome, and some of the monsters you'll run into are equally so. This is where the tactics come in- your party composition is crucial for winning these big fights. For example, dealing with that red dragon is going to be exceedingly difficult without some protection from fire and fear effects. There are also many ways to solve the various problems you run into. For example, a thief laying some traps in a doorway can turn a tough band of charging enemies into so much cannon fodder. Then again, if you don't have a thief or aren't a very subtle type, you can just fireball the lot of them and clean up what's left with a good old-fashioned sword charge.I mentioned earlier that the graphics are dated. This is true, but it doesn't really detract from the play. The area backgrounds are actually very nice, though also largely static. Spell effects look decent, if less flashy than newer games like Neverwinter Nights. The music and voice acting are also top-notch, and don't get old even after many times through the game (which is likely to happen once you get hooked). The latter in particular really lends character to the people you meet. It's a testament to the developer's success in this regard that you'll have strongly varied feelings toward nearly all of the NPCs- just as you would expect of real people.As for the story, it is superb. The scope is truly epic, and the side quests actually interesting. This is more than can be said about much of Neverwinter Nights, for all of the polish and vaunted expandability of that title. Though generally linear, the campaign doesn't seem to be linear. When replaying, though you'll be going to the same places and doing the same things, the different characters you have along will make it seem like a different game. There's also a ton of secrets and hidden areas- you might just find something you didn't see before.That said, it's worth mentioning that although there are no official tools for editing the game, there are unofficial ones. These have been put to good effect, and there's a host of mods and add-ons available for free download. There's even a mod that converts the interface to Icewind Dale's more attractive look (though you must have that game for it to work) and thus significantly improves the graphics and changes the somewhat clunky 2nd edition rules to 3rd edition.I think the value of this title can be summed up by the fact that I played it through at least 5 times, which is something I've only done for two or three other games (the original Baldur's Gate being one of them). Even if you're not into D&D;, don't particularly care for RPGs, and don't give a hoot about Forgotten Realms, this game comes highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2005"}

And while you're at it, get your girl back!","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"Next Gen Game with Old School Challenge","reviewText":"First off let me say that I have been a fan of the Ghosts and Goblins series for a long while, so I may be a bit more biased than some.Maximo is the 4th installment in Capcom's Ghosts and Goblins series which began on the original NES as a 2-D side scrolling action game.  Maximo is the first in the series to go to a 3-D environment and it is done very well.  The environment is very well detailed, to ripples in the water, to plants moving from the wind when you jump near them, a lot of attention was given to the detail.The story is fairly simple and straight forward.  The classic save the princess from the evil dude (Archiles).  Maximo's kingdom has been taken over by his former advisor and friend, and Archiles also took Maximo's girl and married her.  Since taking Maximo's kingdom Archiles seems to have become power crazy.  He uses a drill type scepter and pulls spirits from the underworld to use as his undead army.If you have never played any of the other games in this series you will not be lost.  Your goal is fairly easy to see, and the gameplay is something that you can jump right into.  It seems to hearken back to gameplay of old, mixed with Next Gen. graphics and a fantastic 3-D world.The game is by no means easy.  While not as hard as the original Ghosts and Goblins, it still offers even the most seasoned veteran a good challenge.  And for even more challenge each level has a \"mastery\" percentage.  Meaning it gives you a percentage of how much you have found in that particular level, so even if you got through a level there may still be more to find.  According to the manual there is a bonus at the end of the game if you have mastered all the levels, which would be a tough task, but one that would be entertaining.The music is the music from the old games, just updated and revamped a little which was a good thing to me because I like hearing the music from my youth again.  But even if you do not know what that music is, it's still enjoyable music that does not detract from the gameplay at all.  I personally think the music is very fitting and good.I would only not recommend this game to very young children.  While the game is not scary, it could be a bit frightening to young children because of monsters in the game.  But for anyone probably 12 and over I would say that there would be no problems.  But even though this game has a teen rating, it still is a lot of fun for us who haven't been teenagers in quite some time.If you are an adventure game fan, who likes the next gen graphics, with an old time game feel then I think you would really enjoy Maximo.  It kind of reminds me of Pitfall 3-D for the PSX, it has close to that type of feel.  With the jumping over pits, slashing at monsters waiting for you, or popping up from underneath you.  Collecting coins, trying not to get hit.It's a very fun game and I have nothing but good things to say about it.  I don't think too many people will be disappointed in this game if they give it a chance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2002"}

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Sleeping Dogs:  The best open world game you've never played","reviewText":"Games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row get most of the attention, but this game (which originally was part of the True Crime series, to be named True Crime: Hong Kong, was canceled and the rights picked up by Square Enix, and rebranded Sleeping Dogs) is an incredible amount of fun to play in its own right.The main character, Wei Shen, comes over from the US to help the cops, and it turns into a very twisted, awesome story in which lines are crossed and friends end up being betrayed (or killed).  The ending of the Triad storyline, especially, is incredibly satisfying, which I won't spoil but is great :)The \"story\" is made up of the aformentioned Triad storylines and as well as the Cop storyline (Triad shows up as Green on your map, Cop ones are blue).  No mission is truly impossible or controller smashing difficult (something that Grand Theft Auto IV definitely can't claim), but some are challenging enough where if you do not obtain the upgrades from the health shrines (increases your max health) or increase your face meter (which bestows buffs/benefits to Wei) that you CAN die if you're reckless.For those \"trophy hunters\" out there, this is also a VERY easy platinum, the only frustrating part is obtaining the Gold for the \"Pure Gold\" trophy, as it requires you to win $1M gambling, and only one cockfight will give you the ability to bet enough to do this, and it's COMPLETELY RANDOM.  Meaning, you better save before each attempt.  It took me 2 hours of grinding before I finally achieved enough wins to earn the $1M.  Everything else (relatively speaking) is a piece of cake.I really could not find a reason to drop a star on this game at all.  In over 30 hours of gameplay, it never froze my PS3 once.  I cannot say that, honestly, about any other PS3 game I have played (for comparison, Fallout 3 and New Vegas, Skyrim and Borderlands 2 have all done it more then 5 times each).  The game rarely stutters or slows.  The radio stations are nice and varies.  The combat is fluid and adds a lot of room for improvisation.  Maybe the only gripe (if I had bought this brand new) is the story parts end up being a little short, so if that's all you are playing it for, that might disappoint you a bit.  If you intend to do everything, you will definitely get your money's worth especially at the current price point ($14.99 or less).Finally, the language is DEFINITELY bad in this game (Including words that Grand Theft Auto V didn't use, and I thought THAT game was bad enough).  If that's something that's a turn off, then I'd look elsewhere.  The game definitely lives up to its mature rating on the box.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2014"}

Unless a handful of heroes can protect the remaining crystals, the world will fall into ruin. Set off on a grand adventure in the finest version of Final Fantasy V ever released!","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"4.5; Got lots of free time?","reviewText":"I first played Final Fantasy V when it was released with VI with Anthology for the Playstation. Being one of the few installments that didn't get a stateside release (along with III which is here on the DS), a lot of people loved playing V mainly for the gameplay since storywise they're just wasn't anything there. While it does feel like they're releasing the games over and over for money, most can't even find the original Anthology release anyway so we have V being released separately which is a good game in its own right but it might not be as well-rounded as VI or the later installments.Story: Same ol' really but here it goes: King Tycoon is off to the Wind Shrine to check on the Wind crystal which he fears is in danger. Princess Lenna follows him only to be blocked by a massive meteor that hits the ground. Meeting traveller Bartz as well as Galuf, an old man with amnesia, the 3 travel to the Wind Shrine and with the help of Faris the pirate, have to save the world and protect the crystals from evil.Graphics: Nothing that stellar really but this is a Gameboy Advance title so it's easier to forgive. The graphics look more cleaner but don't expect major overhauls to the graphics to make them more advanced or impressive, they're just more...polished. Character portraits as always have Amano's artwork which is always a welcome though it's kind of odd, but not distracting, to have characters with certain features like Faris' grey hair in portrait to have purple hair in game. But it's always been like that so whatever.Sound/Music: V's soundtrack is sandwiched inbetween IV and VI, the latter being arguably his finest soundtrack. V's is also impressive with memorable tunes and melodies and some well-known ones like Dear Friends or Battle on the Big Bridge but on the other hand, other tracks are just iffy. They're nice and all but there was never a moment during IV or VI where a bad song suddenly showed up when you entered a new area but in V it's more like it's good music then all of a sudden \"hey, this theme's cool\".Gameplay: Unlike IV and VI which had specific classes, in V you can be anybody and the fun comes from mix and matching. Instead of only bringing out certain characters because they're more useful in battle, you can customize your character however you want. Sure you can be a Thief and rob enemies but what if you want to Cure as well? No problem: just learn White Magic, be a Thief and put White Magic in ability menu and poof, now you can nab helpful stuff along with curing your party. Some classes are incredibly useful and even fun to use while others are just quirky and you'd probably only use them for completion purposes.The Anthology release was fun though frustrating to play since levelling up was kind of a must with many times needing to level up your characters in order to not get slaughtered and the GBA one is just as tough though it's slightly more lenient let's say. Just toughen up your characters and you'll be fine. Also, there's not a lot story wise to the game since it's basically crystals in trouble, warriors come together to stop evil with a touch of character development now and then (i.e: characters waking up in the middle of the night to have a monologue). It's not the most deepest RPG storywise and aside from Lenna and maybe Faris, the characters are not as endearing as a Rydia or Kain.I'd recommend V since it's an addicting game to master Job classes though for a more well-rounded game with story and characters, seek VI out but when you're finished with that, by all means give V a go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2008"}

This remains as the most popular Mega Man entry to date probably because Mega Man by now was very popular among the fans and while I think this is a great game, sometimes people tend to overshadow later entries.  In any case, Mega Man's back for a third helping of goodies and enemy bashing.  Read on:THE GOODTONS of more levels than the previous game.  This game is harder in comparison to the second game (although easier if you use codes) and not only do you fight eight new robot masters, you have to tangle with Mega Man 2's bosses!  The rock monster from the first game shows up again as well.  Rush, your robot dog, is introduced here.  Also introduced here is Mega Man's older brother Proto Man (disguised as Break Man initially...).  Older, because he's a prototype.  The music is very good for the series and many of the tunes including Spark Man and Snake Man stand out considerably.  The best tunes are the title screen and the ending theme featuring Proto Man's whistle (AWESOME piece of music).  The graphics are top notch for the NES and they would only improve...THE BADI grew up with this game a lot and I really love it, but it does have a flaw that's a little hard to dismiss.  Mega Man (1) and Mega Man 2 connected very well and Mega Man 4 really connects with 2.  Unfortunately, this game doesn't connect as well with the aforementioned games, probably due to the music.  I'm not quite sure why, but in whatever the case, I really hoped it would've connected better.  Oh well.OVERALLWhat can I say?  My personal favorite in the series and an NES gem.

You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Poop Thang","summary":"The Classic Sequel to a Classic Hit is Back!","reviewText":"First off, this game is very well made and I have no put-downs to it except for the plot.

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"average, maybe even below average","reviewText":"Metroid Prime is definitely overrated.  Let me list all the reasons why-- The game totally rips off Mega Man Legends 2, a Playstation game released two years before this game came out on the Gamecube.  The fire snakes that pop out of the lava, and the beetles that pop out of the ground, are two things in particular that are WAY too similar to aspects of MML2 for me to buy this is supposed to be some kind of coincidence.- The music is severely disappointing.  The main theme song where the spaceship is located in the beginning of the game is a remake of the classic theme from the original Metroid (released in 1986) but done much, much worse.  Oh sure, it may have sounded beautiful and epic back in 2002 to signal the realistic approach to the 3D movement video games were taking at the time, but nowadays, this particular theme lacks inspiration, melody, and any distinctive qualities.  In other words, despite the epic beauty of the music, it's just bland and pointless to me.  I'll take the original 1986 version with its inspirational melody thank you very much.- I mention this game feels like a ripoff of Mega Man Legends 2.  It's also a ripoff of Quake II, the classic PC shooter.  The environments and many of the dark areas feel *exactly* like Quake II, which makes me wonder why I'm playing Metroid Prime when I COULD be playing Quake II instead.  Metroid Prime is nothing more than a corridor shooter.- The enemies you encounter are quite uninspiring for the most part.  You have these suicidal bats that dart down from the ceiling, but they're small, boring and lack inventiveness.  You have vines that pop out of walls and pretend like they're snakes- these are just annoying to shoot.  You have wasps that swarm from hives and dive at you- it is VERY irritating to take out a swarm of these.  There was nothing like this in Super Metroid.  Nothing was irritating about the enemies in that game.  Enemies are not only annoying to take out completely, but unacceptable to look at because of the way bland way they were designed.- Boss battles are flat-out horrible.  That gigantic plant you have to take out is underwhelming compared to the plant boss in Super Metroid (not to mention it takes WAY too much time to actually defeat, despite your best efforts to use the charge beam and morph ball).  I'm not impressed at all here- boss battles are, for the most part, overlong and boring with no usage of creativity on the part of the developers.- Metroid Prime overall suffers from the same problem that Resident Evil 4 suffers from- the movie-like cinematic feel of the entire game, used for no other reason than a cheap attempt to make the game look as much like a movie as possible.  I don't see the appeal of these kind of games to be totally honest- going for that grand and pretentious movie theater effect in video games has been done so many times by this point that it's just not worth the time or energy to create them this way anymore, not to mention graphics aren't nearly as important as many gamers would have you believe- graphics mean crap to me.- The game is trying to go for a perfect 3D update to Super Metroid, but Metroid Prime is *nothing* like Super Metroid.  How CAN it be???  Metroid Prime is just one of literally hundreds of generic 3D shooters out there where one man (or in this case, woman) goes through a huge world, narrow corridors, and shooting and exploring... and before you say this game is all about exploration... let me respond by saying \"Not really\".  The exploration aspect has been greatly exaggerated because you're honestly not exploring more in this game than you are in, say, Quake II and THAT game never gets credit for the exploratory features it implements, so neither should this one.I just don't like this game very much.  It's boring, overrated, and not very fun.  This game gets a 2 out of 5, despite the fact amazon keeps saying I'm giving it a 5 out of 5.  Trust me, I'm not.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2006"}

In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable.

However, I was slightly disappointed by the Collector's Edition.Let's start with the book ends:I didn't expect rich, mahogany wood or something like that.  By the picture, I figured it would be a plastic or a molded resin.  I'm even satisfied with the particle board with fake veneer covering.  What I'm not satisfied with is, again, by the picture, the Sackboy on the right end and the Larry DaVinci with sackbots on the left end appear to be an actual, 3 dementional \"statuettes\" of sorts.  Instead, they are a heavy cardboard in the shape of these things with a picture adheared to the cardboard.  It is a very heavy and sturdy cardboard but cardboard none-the-less.Now the Sackboy plush:From the picture, he appears to be a ragdoll-ish design.  I expected a heavier little doll with floppy arms and legs.  Instead his arms and legs are kind of stiff and he cannot sit like in the picture.  I can barely prop him against the bookends to stay upright.  The zipper and the zipper pull are cheap plastic made to look like metal.The included costumes and avatars:These are the one redeeming thing about the Collector's Edition but not very much so.  You're basically getting all of them included with the game, which is cool, but I do expect these individual costumes and avatars to come available on the PSN store within 3-6 months anyway.  Although they'll probably be together with some other items in a small \"pack\" anyway.  I only speculate about this based off the Kratos and Heavenly Sword costumes that came from Best Buy and GameStop/EB Games as pre-order goodies.  Both of those came with a little more than just the costumes and a couple stickers when they were finally made available on the PSN store.Overall, I am disappointed but still glad I got it.  For those in Europe that aren't getting the same one as the U.S., you're not missing much plus you can probably find the book ends and the plush on eBay right now if you really want them.  My suggestion, get the game itself and save the rest of the money and put it in your PSN wallet and wait for the costumes to come out to the PSN store.Rock on, Sackboy!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}

If you reach that limit, then you'll have to call EA in order to add one extra activation. That's not as simple as it sounds, since when you reach that point EA will assume that you, the paying customer, are a filthy pirating thief. You will need to provide proof of purchase, reasons why the limit was reached, etc, etc (it has all happened before with another recent EA product, Mass Effect). EA, of course, is not obligated to grant you that extra activation or even provide that service. In a couple of years they might very well even shut down the general activation servers, because \"it's not financially feasible\" to keep them running. What you will be left with is a nice, colorful $50 coaster. And you will be required to pay for another copy/license if you want to continue playing.This basically means that you are actually RENTING the game, instead of owning it. The game WILL stop to function in the future. That's inevitable, because even if EA keeps the activation servers going, there IS going to be a time when EA will simply cease to exist because of financial issues or federal laws (like most businesses eventually do).Second, the game was dumbed down to oblivion. Evolution doesn't even matter anymore. For example, you can add as many legs to a creature as you want, but the multilegged creature won't be any faster than a single legged one with higher leg stats. This gameplay element makes \"creating\" your creatures entirely pointless (cosmetic only, because everything is based on stats), and brings you about the same amount of excitement as dressing up a plastic doll.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

I would say it looks even better on the Vita, mainly because my tv isn't an OLED tv and the Vita's OLED screen looks amazing. And the game for both platforms is virtually the same with the exception that on the Vita version, if you pinch the screen you can zoom in or out on the game which is a cool addition.My girlfriend loves this game. I get frustrated with it because I am impatient and kind of a caveman. This game can be unforgiving and pretty damn hard at times. Sometimes I will die 50 plus times on one level that should only be a 5 minute level because some of the level design for this game is made so you have to play it perfect or you'll die. Some levels the screen moves and you have to keep up with it and if you don't, you die. So your timing has to be perfect. I've watched my girlfriend play a 5 minute level for an hour because she wanted to collect everything in it, which you need to do to unlock the 60 plus levels.This game looks like you're playing a traditional 2D animated movie, it is hands down one of the best looking games I've seen, has amazing music, is responsive in its controls and is really fun. It's multiplayer too which is great. I know some people won't be patient enough for this game (like me at times) but it really is worth all the frustration. I am not a Rayman fan, aside from some Raving Rabbids games, this is the only Rayman game I've actually played and it blew my mind. It's one of the most charming games I've ever played, has some of the best level design in a 2D side scroller I've ever seen. I don't like Mario games, but if you do like Mario games, I think you'll like this even better. The flying levels and underwater levels are borderline jaw dropping.This game was the sleeper hit of 2011, look it up on Metacritic, it's like the best scored game of the year next to Skyrim, Uncharted 3 and Batman Arkham City, yea...it's that good.

It comes with Kingdom Hearts - Final mix (was only in Japan), Chain of Memories, and the cinematics for 365/2 from the DS which tells the story between chain of memories and KH2. All three have been redone for HD - with Kingdom Hearts being completely redone as they originally lost the source code for the game, so they had to do the whole game from scratch while still using the original soundtrack, voicetrack, and script. This has an extra boss fight and other Keyblades that was not in the original US edition. I have only played the first hour of the first game, and i already have enjoyed it. Controls are the same so no new learning, just have to remember how things work since it has been so long since I played this. So get this classic set and start playing and remember why you enjoyed this series while we wait for 2.5 remix and of course KINGDOM HEARTS 3!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007C72F2U","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian M. Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"Yes Gods Or Kings, Not Only Man (And No Andrew Ryan)","reviewText":"I used to be a game addict. So deep in the video junk, the countdown to release could be a nail-biting, room-pacing, saliva-brewing torture.Beyond the Swordsuper expansion forSid Meier's Civilization IVwas my last bad game craving, my first Civ on Steam.Might be unfair to jump from there into *Gods and Kings*, the not-quite-as-super expansion for Civ 5. Espionage, religion, and advanced diplomacy were either part of Civ IV or added in BTS. They should have carried over to core Civ 5. Fortunately the latter gave as much as it took: hex-based tactics, Great Tile Improvements and Natural Wonders, culture purchases, and City States... given in principle. In execution Civ V was shaky, and execution is what gods and kings are about.--Installation and Performance--Amazon Vine sent me the DVD of the game. Like the core title it will load to Steam (see my Civ V reviews for benefits and hazards). No user key and no massive patch to keep me from jumping into the game. I installed G&K; on my custom Intel rig: an i5-2500 quad core with 8 GB of DDR3 RAM, all games running off a 1 TB 6 Gb/s hard drive. My video card is a Radeon HD 6800 series. I did not test this pack with integrated graphics.Civ V had been patched long before this expansion, allowing it to boot faster and run farther before texture popping. G&K; continues the boost and looks terrific in DX 11. On my custom giant map I can explore half the world and reach the Renaissance before I have to turn down graphic options due to tiles washing out. Saves, loads, and turns all move swiftly while the map is able to scroll without stuttering.A new problem arose. Sometimes the GUI console will flicker out of existence, disabling the commands and leaving me with a pretty but untouchable map. This usually happened when I was loading and reloading frequently. Also, the game flat-out froze and crashed on me twice. This remains a significant improvement over Civ IV BTS, which suffered hideous memory leaks and turn crashes. Better programming, or the intervention of Gods and Kings?--Religion--Between the two executives, Gods are the big addition.In Civ4, religions boosted science to reach religions. So long as you climbed the tech tree you could rack up holy cities and swamp the world in psalms. Piety also took part in Civics to influence strategy. Mostly, religion brought gold, science and culture bonuses--especially if you had more than one holy city. Otherwise the faiths had no difference beyond their names and icons.G&K; introduces a different competition where civilizations accumulate Faith: to found a pantheon, to generate Great Prophets, to found religions.  Only one Religion may be founded per civ, preventing the ever-expanding theocracy in the previous title. Pantheons and Religions are customized from a long list of first-come, first-serve beliefs. Each belief has a unique effect, so the motivation of the players is to beat each other out for tenants which best match their strategy.Right off the bat this creates more character.  Faith points accumulate and spend just like culture, so players can buy missionaries and Prophets to spread their rival vision. Not all Beliefs benefit overseas missions, so religion spamming is less useful. Rising costs also keeps missionaries from flooding the map. Because missionaries and prophets have the unique ability to enter closed borders in peace time, place an Inquisitor near your city to defend it against heresy. Finally, faith can be spent on other Great People with the appropriate Social Policy. Overall, I prefer G&K; religion to BTS because it creates a gameable distinction from science.--A Spy is Born--Partly because you can spend Faith on secular options, religion works into the late game. Otherwise it becomes unnoticed in the bustle of civilization growth. Enter the Espionage.Like missionaries, Civ4 could flood the map with agents. Spies in 5 are only granted to the player once per era beginning with the Renaissance. If killed, a new spy eventually spawns. Regardless of whether they succeed, Spies amount to lines of text in an Espionage window. This is informative, but your agent provocateurs should still be provocative units, bought with espionage points, and including a Great Spy. This keeps the mechanic consistent with Religion. Finally, a Spy could succeed the Scout unit in the mid-game. Alas, I must use missionaries to tresspass.Spy missions are also competitive. Your spooks steal or defend technology from rivals, uncover intrigue, or influence city states. Each course has a gathering effect on the campaign. Capping out at six spies, players will also have to juggle missions; you can't generate agents other than to advance the ages.--Truffles from Brussels!--Agents can deepen the city-state strategy. One of the most nettlesome uses of the spy is to rig elections or launch coups to win clients. Poor nations can vex rich nations this way, since spy missions cost time instead of coin. Financially impoverished players can also compete though the revamped City requests: they can generate culture, science or faith instead of bribes. Probably most important to me, many City State requests now have a time limit. Whether unable or unwilling to perform a mission, don't worry because it will simply be refreshed.City states matter more because they provide bigger bonuses, increasing the benefactor's growth and reducing their dependency on diplomacy. Early in the game, coming into contact with a Religious City can reverse the race for pantheons. The also-new Mercantile City helps my rivals keep books in the black and their feet in the race.Nevertheless, I could still collect alliances and use Patronage polices to score cheap Victories.--Call to Power--I won two games on Prince difficulty for this review. Both turned out differently, but also showed off differences from the core title.Right away the AI opponents are more powerful. Even with 22 civs rubbing elbows, many stayed close on my heels. I significantly outpaced the AI in Culture and Production. They usually built huge militaries, settled vast areas, and spread more religion. The A.I never lingered more than two ages behind, and usually hounded my technological heels no matter how much of a head I got from research boosts. Contrast this with the equivalent campaigns in BTS, where rivals smothered beneath my combined weight, their Medieval armies overshadowed by my Stealth Bombers.G&K; is also supposed to increase the heft of combat. World War I tanks, aircraft, and infantry are the big addition. Unfortunately, the AI seldom made use of the new naval unit type, vessels that can take cities from the sea. Because melee ships are faster and stronger than embarked units, they make swift coastal campaigns. Yet the computer kept fleets in deep water, reluctant to attack.Armies were more inconsistent, penetrating deep against ancient cities, only to freeze at the gates of a new colony. I watched a Persian Infantry unit, backed by two Machine Guns, allow itself to be bombarded to death by a 1 pop city. As tedious as it was inexplicable. And when it ended, the MGs picked up and left as quietly as they came.If peace is any compensation, the international diplomacy tightened up. Most civilizations are not as quick to condemn you as a warmonger or slow to make declarations of friendships. It is now possible to maintain partners well into the late game before degenerating into the usual storm of denouncements. Civilizations still have a chance to backstab each other; for the most part their motivations are as transparent as in BTS: such as border tensions, opposing social policies, and proselytizing. G&K; offers more opportunities to affect relations through embassies and espionage. BTS didn't make room to score brownie points.Still, Civ 5 Diplomacy suffers from an inability to pass international resolutions. And it continues to lack alliances, where member civs can collude to rally your friends against an enemy. Each would be an alternative form of joint action to the other. Another diplomatic absence are vassals and colonies, both of which added depth and neither of which is adequately replaced by Puppet Cities. I finally miss the random events of BTS and their impact on world society.--Test of Time--That's how the odd-numbered entries of the series go. It gives, it takes, it experiments with new ideas without being a big leap forward. So is this expansion jump worth the money?As my title indicates, the one missing executive was the businessman. No corporations. But business sense tells the player that what was new to predecessors should have been default in the successor. As in my review forCivilization V Game of the Year, I recommend that players who haven't made the big leap from Civ4 can wait until a bundle with Gods and Kings comes out. Those who do have Civ5 can simply wait for a holiday sale on Steam.I give kudos to the developers for several innovations and evolutions in this pack. It earns my four star approval... not my obsession. There are reasons why I'm not a game junkie anymore. Will Civ6 take the jade away and set my nerves on fire? Gods and kings only know.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

I don't think I have spent more time on any other video game this year than I have spent on Starcraft 2.  The multiplayer experience is superb!  Three diverse yet balanced races to battle in multiplayer with tons of options and the tools to customize.The campaign or story mode is rich and one of the best you will encounter in this median.  Unlike the previous game, Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty focuses on the Terran/Human race alone, with expansions to follow focusing on the other races.  Even though the story only focuses on one race, the campaign is longer than that of the three races combined from the previous game.  There are 29 missions with each having multiple difficulty settings and multiple objectives.  It is going to take all your strategic know how and skills to figure out how to complete some of objectives on the harder settings.  Ton of RPG elements have been added which made each campaign play-through unique.  The Starcraft universe has become a lot more immersive with all the elements added between missions, which are no longer linear.Piracy is rampant today, some developers have stated that less than 10% of their games have been legitimately purchased (such as in the case with World of Goo's 2D Boy studio).  So it is understandable that Blizzard put some safeguards in place to curve piracy.  Most of the hostile reviews left on this otherwise perfect game can be attributed to those safeguards.  I initially left an overall 5 star review for this game but since Starcraft's 2 launch (approximately a month and a half ago), the server has been down about half a dozen times.  Today, the server is down for five hours due to maintenance but it has gone down every week or two from a few minutes to a couple of hours.  During this time, the game is unplayable. I hop Blizzard addresses this issue in the near future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2010"}

I expected a corridor shooter with a over the top story but I got much more. The game starts out exactly as you would think, in the middle of action trying to survive and what this game does well is use the situations to slowly teach the player how to play the game. So it starts out as a corridor shooter and slowly expands into more of a sandbox teaching game mechanics as you go. Wolfenstein is full of secrets and gives players plenty of reason to replay levels and the entire game in order to get the full experience. This version of Wolfenstein seems to have been influenced by Dishonored which I liked because I enjoy stealth but guns blazing is always an option for those with a more aggressive play style. There are ways to enhance your play style too by completing objectives to unlock perks. There are also armor and health upgrades that can be found depending on a choice you must make early in the game which splits the game into one of two timelines. Wolfenstein gives the player choices of how to play and where to go to accomplish the missions. I really thought that this would be a nice filler game to keep me busy until Watchdogs released but I'm realizing that this game has a lot to offer and will now be competition for my Watchdogs play time. I highly recommend fans of FPS games and Stealth fans alike to pick this up, one of the best games I've played in a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Alex Gomez","summary":"Awesome portable system, but with major flaws that earn it a 3 in my book","reviewText":"Its really a shame that such a good piece of equipment can be so faulty.

A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"M.

I played the trial version several times and the full version and I'm still not sure what happened.  How is it that Age of Empires 2 still seems better than this one?  Okay I'll throw out a few points here:If you don't know what this game is about read some of the other reviews, check out Age of Empires 2 (or any other world-conquering game) and you'll get the idea: build, conquer, rule.Graphics, Sound, Performance:- Ummm... Supposedly better.  Even on my high-end rig the graphics weren't impressive.  So what it's 3d - that doesn't mean anything!  It's a bad-looking 3D - even with the graphic tweaks cranked up.  Lose points on this.- The sound is what it is.  It does the job and sounds good - but it's nothing earth-shattering.  Nothing really innovative or impressive.  Not that it should be: but a next-generation title with advanced graphics and the hardware available today should have a really breathtaking soundtrack... For the price!- As noted I have a high-end system and this game performed poorly.  Other games, far more demanding on resources, perform flawlessly on the same system.  What gives?  Perhaps it's just clunky and SEEMS to be poor in performance... Nonetheless even if your PC exceeds the minimum requirements listed on the Box be wary it may not show in the game.Very disappointing!  Even if it is loaded with historical information - so are other games and the older Age of Empires titles.  Sometimes games that are less graphically dazzling can far outshine newer 3D based games: this is one case.If you haven't checked out Rise of Nations do so - it performs much faster, looks great, and offers a greater scope of playability than Age of Empires 3.  If you must have this game then wait until it hits the bargain price range ($20 at best).  I give it 2 stars out of respect for the genre, the title's legacy, and for other games backed by Microsoft that are fabulous...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2006"}

Not having an exhibition mode that two people can play is a downer and subtracts from the overall rating.The good news is that are quite a bit of additional stuff to do besides play volleyball (which is why the word 'volleyball' never shows up in the title.)  There are a variety of mini games.  Such as tug of war and the infamous 'butt battle'  neither of which I am any good at.  The volleyball play is pretty hard.  Sometimes you can lose two or three games in a row right from the get go and your partner will dump you.  That's a bummer.Recruiting new lady friends is hard because most of the girls are picky about what gifts they will accept.  (On a side note this game is like a really bad relationship game.  Give your girl flowers so she'll go out with you...I mean play volleyball with you.  What do you want Christie?  What do you want?!)  Well, anyway.  The graphics are nice of course if a bit much at times.  Whoever designed the physics of the girls really leaned on the whammy bar when making the breasts bounce.  I mean, it looks a little silly at times.  The slightest move sends the things zigging and zagging, sometimes in opposite directions like a pair of water balloons.  Gravity defying cleavage aside the game looks very realistic.If you can tolerate getting dumped by girls and then not being able to woo any new ones then you can still have a decent time, unless you suck at riding in a jet ski and bumping other girls with your butt.

For those who haven't played it, this collection is an insanely good deal, and you shouldn't even think twice about getting it.The minute you start Morrowind you know that this is a game unlike any other. Your character can be one of ten races, each distinct in appearance and abilities. You can create your own classes, emphasizing any of 26 skills and eight attributes. As you enter the vast fully-3D world you advance your character by practicing and improving chosen skills. This makes it practically impossible to create the exact same character more than once.The game world is simply gigantic- Morrowind has a huge landmass that takes you upwards of a half hour to run from one end to the other. The expansions Tribunal and Bloodmoon (included in this edition) add the additional Mournhold city and Solstheim island. All of the areas are chock full of enemies, caverns, tombs, ruins, and non-player characters. Many of these give you quests, which have rewards varying from gold to unique items. There are hundreds of quests, weapons, items, objects, and distinct locations in the game. I've played Morrowind for hundreds of hours and still occasionally come across something I have never seen!The main story of Morrowind is well done and quite involved, and Tribunal and Bloodmoon add additional main quests to the plot. However, unlike every other RPG I've played, it's not at all compulsory to complete them. In fact, you can simply go gallivanting about Vvardenfell doing whatever you see fit- and have a good time at it too. There's plenty of towns and people to talk to (and, naturally, to kill) and side quests to complete. You can join one of three Great Houses and build a stronghold for yourself, or join any of a half dozen other factions- all with unique missions and rewards.Morrowind's graphics are awesome- the detail in the objects has to be seen to be believed. There isn't a single sprite in the entire game, and both characters and terrain are all extremely well done. The game world is thickly populated with all manner of persons and objects, and you can explore in either first or third person. This can be a problem, however, if your system isn't up to it. If you can't see all the pretty graphics, the game isn't so fun, so be sure you exceed the recommended system specifications. Morrowind needs everything your PC has- there really is no such thing as too much power with this game. In particular, the game looks a lot better if your graphics card can run full-screen antialiasing with it.Admittedly, combat in Morrowind is rather straightforward and can get a bit dull. You can shoot, hack, or nuke things up at will, and the ability to create customized weapons and spells makes this fun in a Diablo-esque way. Fighting isn't really the best part of the game, though. Rather, the freedom is. You can go anywhere and do anything you want in any order- a rather intoxicating degree of control that I've not seen in any other game. In fact, I should warn new players that after playing Morrowind other games- especially other RPGs- will seem extremely constricting due to the lack of freedom.That said, there's another 'best' part of the game. That is the customizability of Morrowind and the jaw-dropping amount of fan content already available for download. With the editor you can change almost anything in the game. With that and 3D Studio MAX you CAN change everything in the game- and people have done so. Everything from total conversions to monster additions, new items, new objects, new quests and areas, and even new races and appearances are available for download. Due to the very intuitive plugin system, addition of this content is simple (the only problem being potential conflicts in plugins). If you take the time to learn a bit about it, you can make your own items and locations with the editor. Another warning here- this is more addictive than most narcotics, and once you start you'll always see something else that 'needs improvement.' It is not unheard of for 'players' to spend more time editing Morrowind than actually playing it.Last of all, the soundtrack is definitely worth mentioning. Jeremy Soule (Icewind Dale, Total Annihilation, Neverwinter Nights) has composed one to remember. Best of all, it's all there in mp3 format, and you can customize it as well.Even if you're not that much into RPGs, Morrowind is sure to hold your attention for a very good, long time. While it's initially not much of a challenge to play and there are a few sub-optimal features, these problems can (and have been) addressed with the editor. Though it lacks multiplayer mode, the game will almost certainly have you hooked for as long as any game with multiplay, and then some. There's a good reason there's no 'hours of play' figure on the box- this, like almost everything else with Morrowind, is completely up to you.Morrowind is probably the best PC game ever released, in terms of sheer entertainment value. It's almost certainly one of the top ten RPGs of all time. If your computer can handle it, you should definitely pick up a copy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2003"}

I found the game entertaining but far from compelling.  My main problem with the game is the fighting engine witch is very limited and repetitive.  You get surrounded by thugs and try to string along combos without getting hit.  Not too much else beyond that.  Exploring the asylum island and seeking out hidden things with various gadgets is fairly fun, but again nothing amazing.  The other aspect of the game is taking down multiple armed guards in a stealth manner, which was OK but a far cry from the Splinter Cell games that excel at such game play.  Thus, the game is a mix of various game types and does OK at them all.  The graphics are solid and the history of the comic was well incorporated.  The game is certainly worth a play, but there is no way this is a five star game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"An Old-School Gamer Weighs In","reviewText":"About a year ago, my brother and I, being dissatisfied with the Nintendo Wii's childish nature, \"traded it in\" for an XBOX 360 system.  \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" was the first non-sports game we purchased for our new system, and for the first time since the heyday of the Gamecube, I was actually excited about a new adventure game.  Unfortunately, this game proved to be much of the same for gamers who prefer the simplicity of older-gen adventures.At face value, there doesn't seem to be anything to NOT like about this game.  The graphics are excellent, the plot is interesting, and the basic movement controls (which are seemingly always an enormous problem in superhero games) are much more streamlined than in the past.  The opening cutscenes are enthralling, and it seems for all the world as if this truly is going to be a game for the ages.However, and I'm speaking as a rather old-school (growing up on the NES) here, the game never really sucks you in like some of the old classics.  To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but after those initial cut-scenes and beginner experimentation, the fun factor gradually fades away.  Perhaps the fault comes in the game's trying to be too much on too many different levels.  It wants to be an adventure-mystery...but nothing is ever really difficult to solve, thus no big emotional payoff due to time invested.  The game also tries to be full of action...but aside from the basic kicks and punches, the other combos are too tedious to learn and don't really add anything to the plot of the game; thus you are left to just punching out all the bad guys and being spoon-fed your next strategic move.Perhaps I have now turned into a \"gaming old fart\", but this game failed to really captivate me like, say, the classic NES version of the same character (I could literally play that game for hours on end).  Like I said, I can't quite pin it down, but it seems as if most of the current adventure games (present company very much included) have lost that \"it\" factor and now just use kicks and punches to try and compete with the first-person shooter genre.\"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" isn't a horrible game by any means, but just be warned that it may not live up to all the hype, either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2010"}

Each character is in complete control of their own destiny in this single-player fantasy RPG, which features groundbreaking levels of non-player AI.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The strangest kind of disappointment","reviewText":"Sometimes I feel there is 2 types of gamers: the ones that finish the game and experience all it has to experience before they can rightly say how they feel about it and then there's those who after awhile get the idea planted in their head of \"I'm not going to be able to handle 25 more hours of this\". Games like Assassin's Creed had some very bad gameplay choices and incredibly repetitive structures but I still beat it mainly because one part of my brain thought \"it's tolerable\" but in the case of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, after a few hours in, I thought there was no way I'm going to be able to handle any more of this and there's still 100 hours or more apparently and I have to tell you, I just couldn't handle any more.Story: Instead of topics about existence and spiritual matters as seen in a lot of Japanese RPG's, Western RPG's tend to be about England in the Middle Ages with characters fighting demons and goblins from an evil realm, Emperors and heirs to thrones and the collecting of mystical artifacts. And that's Oblivion in a nutshell: the Emperor gives you a world-saving quest involving his previously-unknown heir and the realm of Oblivion and the dark forces that go on there. I think that's part of the reason why I couldn't really get into the story as it's too familiar and too close resembles other RPG's.Graphics: I mentioned this in another review but it definately applies to Oblivion as graphics can be divided in 2 categories: the aesthetic and the performance. Oblivion as far as its look is quite gorgeous and there's many picturesque locales and sceneries that look quite striking (although there's not much variety in them either). On the other hand, despite the 5 gig install which isn't Bioshock/Devil May Cry 4-like where it does it at the beginning and does it through the gameplay itself, it still has texture pop-in where trees just magically appear, framerate dips and even pauses within the game and glitches. One time I wanted to ride my horse but apparently I was in the wrong spot as my character just walked against his side, forcing me to jump away and reposition my character.Sound/Music: First I'll do the music as it's quite fantastic. Renaissance-esque music with flutes, violins, pianos and more triumphant themes show up and I just loved having the music on and listening to it which especially works well as your travelling the countryside. However, the voice acting is iffy as you'll literally run into people from different ends of the land with the same voice. One mission I had to save a village because its citizens were invisible. Going to a nearby fort and locating a man that gave me the item required to help out, imagine the confusion when the man who sent me on the quest in the first place had the same voice as the guy who gave me the item. Either they're part of a inaccessible cloning experiment or the voice actors didn't even have the common sense to change voices for new characters. At least Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean are here to make things better.Gameplay: Games like the Grand Theft Auto series or an RPG like Final Fantasy reward players for doing quests off the beaten path. In GTA, it's driving a certain number of taxi missions, police car, ambulances, fire trucks, locating hidden packages and the like. Final Fantasy ranges from card games to ultimate weapons or fetch quests. Oblivion is similar as the main love many have for this game is the large amount of stuff you can do. From levelling your character's stats and equipment to taking on various quests from people to item collecting, it's fair to say if you're a completionist well this game will keep you busy. I, however, like to finish the main quest with the occasional optional stuff (Gold Chocobos let's say) but I didn't even bother taking on most of them and wanted to finish the main quest, which is sad cause there wasn't really a driving motivational reason to beat the game other than saying I \"beat it\".The oft-maligned levelling system of Oblivion rightly gets it scorn as you don't progress by EXP to conquer your foes necessarily but rather repeatedly using one skill. Want to be a better swordsman? Cut down lots of enemies. A better sniper? Use your bow. Better your shield and armor? Get hit. Not only does this feel rather strange but it also makes it easier to work your way around the enemies who level up with you. Key is to better your stats so that a level 20 run-of-the-mill demon won't clobber you like your inexperienced level 1 self. I don't know about you but I prefer the traditional system of taking on multiple enemies so I can kick a level boss all over a room by the flick of my finger and not have the jerk bust my balls because I don't use my shield more often.At a certain point, you have to stop trying to force a game and just take it for what it is. Unlike other games I initially didn't care for, only to keep playing because something kept bringing me in, the more time I thought about playing Oblivion more, the more thoughts of tediousness and general lack of motivation I had for completing the game. Sometimes bad games don't deserve such hatred but on occasion even the heavyweights aren't always for everyone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

Instead of gaining experience the usual way, this gauge spins and you gain SP which can be used in various ways.  The DWM also levels your materia, it also provides special attacks, summons, limit breaks, and more.  My beef with it is that it has a more 'random' approach that I do not like.  Despite being an action RPG, I like having some control over things.  You do get to set up your main attacks, which is nice, but you really can't initiate your special moves.  I can't tell you how many times I got fed up with watching the animation for Octoslash when the enemy was one normal hit away from death...That was my big negative.  The rest is positive.  Except that I am not overly enthusiastic about some of the story elements.  There is a lot of melodrama.  It's like watching a soap opera when Angeal, Genesis, Zack, and Sephiroth are all in a scene together (or when at least two of them are in a scene together).  But the overall story is complex and well played out. I especially enjoyed seeing some of the characters that appear in FF7 making brief (or more important) appearances.Some of the characters are rather one dimensional, mostly those that don't appear in FF7.  If you have played 7, then you kind of know what is in store.  You really know who is going to make it into the next game and who is going to 'ahem' kick off.  But knowing that, I still enjoyed the game.  There were some poignant moments, like where Zack fell into the church in the slums... I was thinking... so that's why Aeris was instantly attracted to Cloud!  (And they call her Aerith, for the record, despite it sounding rather odd... like Bar'th'elona, Spain).Voice acting is generally very good.  I am impressed for this being an English dub.  There is a lot of voiced dialogue too.  Cut scenes are good, but generally filler.  Some of the regular scenes have great interactions and wonderful graphics, so the cut scenes are not adding THAT much more to the game.  There are a few that are more interesting, like the holographic fight on the Junon cannon.Gameplay is rather ordinary.  The fighting gets a little old after awhile.  New enemies make appearances, and difficulty really only amps up on boss fights or when you are facing multiple tough enemies.  The more difficult battles are in the optional missions.  Basically you just accept a mission well below the recommended level (it will say Hard or Very Hard) and you are in for a nice challenge.Equipment is limited in application though not in variety.  The materia system is good, but improves when you can fuse materia.  And there are optional missions where you can look for more items, materia, and equipment.  These pay off with leveling as well.Though the leveling system is weird, you do level more often with tougher enemies.  I don't know the exact formula, but it has to do with attacking, dodging, and your overall SP compared to the level of the enemy.  But again, it's not an exact science.For action RPG fans, especially those who enjoy the Kingdom Hearts style of battle system, this is a fun and exciting game.  I liked the prequel story, but wish it was a little more like the interface of FF7, especially when leveling up is actually important and stats actually make a difference in battle.  The random seeming factor of special attacks, leveling, and materia leveling is a detracting factor, but not enough to really take much from the game itself.  A solid PSP title, worthy of five stars if it didn't say Final Fantasy in the title.  I admit it.  I expected a little more polish.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

This game is more realistic and funner than all of the medal of honors combined. And that is saying a lot because I am huge fan of the medal of honor series since it first hit Playstation.Key features:This game has some major key features that separate it from any other game. It is the ONLY WWII game I have ever heard of or seen that offers squad based gameplay. So instead of you running around doing all the work or like the case in the call of duty series in which people shoot at each other but nothing happens until you do everything. In this series however you have to command your squad to a safe area and try your best not to get any of them killed. You can have them lay down fire to suppress the enemies behind cover and then run around and flank them with another squad. The sounds and detail of the level of realism and authenticity is indescribable. This game was worth every penny of it. I think I paid only 3 dollars but I would have paid more if I knew how amazing it would be.Cons:When I first got it I downloaded the most recent patch I could find on a file website which I believe was patch 1.13 or something close to it. The game seemed to have trouble with the Audio and the direction the audio needed to be coming from(ex. people talking sounded as though they were behind you or next to you though they were actually standing right in front of you) which provided added difficulty when enemies were all around you I ended up having trouble finding them and died a lot. Also I had frequent memory dunps which is weird because I have a PC powerful enough to play Call of Duty 4 at maximum resolution and settings with no lag. So I did some tweaking to my CPU and reversed the flow of my fans and also re installed the game but this time I only got the most recent patch that was available on the game makers website which I believe was only patch 1.3 or something like it and I havent had any problems thus far.Definitely worth the money and I would recomend every play it while they still can because all the Brothers In Arms games are tied together and the 3rd one comes out soon.

Now for the veritable maniac who invests that much time into it...you can then just start said character over at level1 while retaining virtually all of the stat points you had....This is a dream come true and a nightmare. Cancel your weekend plans...in fact...dump your girlfriend too... Did I mention that every item in the game hosts a 100 level dungeon?....Every item in the game hosts a 100 level dungeon...there... So its cool you can go inside a sword and for every level you beat the blade gets stronger...so that when you go inside ...the next sword..you wont die...but you dont need to stop there...you can level healing items too... You may actually go insane if you are a completist trying to play this game...but it will be sort of a happy mania... Theres tons of Classes to choose from too! Wow... The con is that if you are a normal person with a life, you will be in over your head... It will keep you off the streets though...PLOT and CHARACTERSThe plot and characters in this game are priceless. It has an episodic feel to it, like and anime, complete with changing character portraits. You will fall in love with Laharl who has sort of that same invader Zim charm. Thats your main character, and he is prince of the underworld. Your quest is to gain power over your domain after the death of your dad. Along the way you meet up with misfit demons to join you and usually after thrashing a boss he will enlist...Some of the characters are hysterical....particularly you will enjoy Captain Gordon cheeseball space hero, and \"Mid-Boss\" a hapless demon that you torment mercilessly throughout the adventure... The story is interesting and things keep popping without ever getting dull.  This ones a real keeper, and at the very least its better than flipping the lightswitch on and off for 10 minutes or washing your hands 20 times...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2007"}

The game-play is flawlessly implemented.  There is an excellent balance between fun platforming and third person shooting with the best cover system I've seen in a game.  In my opinion the cover system in Uncharted works better than Gears of War.Visually this is the best looking console game ever made.  Hands down, no question.  As someone who enjoys immersion in games, I've never had a better experience with a video game.Have you ever wanted to play a GOOD Indiana Jones game?  Well, this is that game.  The world, style, and humor is straight out of Indiana Jones.  So you have a game set in a world that is much like Indiana Jones, and it just happens to have some of the best game play I've experienced in any game on any console.  If you own a PS3, you simply must buy this game.  If you don't, I feel sorry for you.  If you don't own a PS3, you should buy one to play this game, and pick up Ratchet and Clank while you're at it.

Developed by Ensemble Studios,Halo Warsfor Xbox 360&nbsp;brings all the drama of a real-time strategy game to the popular Halo Universe. Set in the year 2531, before the initial Halo first-person shooter game, this game lets you control the human armies of UNSC in a whole new way..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; }Play as UNSC or Covenant and exploit your faction's unique strengths.View larger.Invade enemy strongholds full of advanced technology.View larger.Find ways to make the detailed environments work for you.View larger.Bring in air support to turn the tide of battle.View larger.Experience the Epic Battle from a New PerspectiveDefense, offense, and the ability to hold down a command center in the face of hostile attacks: there's a lot to think about when laying out tactics for an all-out alien war. Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"Gamblor","summary":"A Great Addition to the Series","reviewText":"You can read about most of the gameplay from other reviews - I'll try to add some extra information, positives, and negatives.I am a fan of the Halo Universe (read the books, played the games), and this is a worthy addition. Although it takes some serious liberties with the canon, it works as a great story in the Haloverse - every unit, building, and vehicle looks and operates exactly as it should.The gameplay is fast and arcadey - it's technically an RTS, but I tell people to think of it as an action game with resource and unit management.I really do love this game - playing cooperatively online against Legendary AI skirmish opponents is some of the most fun I have had in a long time - rivals most online gaming.The game is excellent, but is not without its flaws -1. The game is short. Very short. I played through a few times and nabbed 44/50 achievements (805GS), and the game clock said I had played for only 19 hours.2. The script is one of the worst I have ever heard. There are childish one-liners galore. I love the character of Forge, but I would rather him be a mute than listen to his drivel - \"I'm getting tired of saving your a**!\".3. The online ranking system is messed up. It takes 500 points to reach Recruit - this can be achieved in your first match, whether you win or not. The next rank is Lieutenant - 80,000 points - doable in maybe 15-30 games. The next rank is General - 3.2 million points. This will take well over a year legit. The problem with the ranking is not that it takes forever to reach General, but that there are only 3 ranks. In other games like Halo 3 and CoD, you rank up consistently and it provides a great motivation and reward system. The system is broken in Halo Wars. Fortunately, this could be patched in the future.Great game, succeeds despite a few flaws - pick it up if you love the Halo Universe, action games, or online co-op or competitive gaming.EDIT: My bad, there are 8 ranks. I still would like more, but 8 is better than 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

In short, it was repetitive, and failed to provide any real development. This game fixes that issue, and more. The missions are far more diverse, the story actually progresses in an interesting fashion, the side-quests are relevant and entertaining, etc. Granted, if you didn't like the first game AT ALL, then you probably won't enjoy this one much more. However, if you liked the first game, and was hoping for an even better version, buy this game.Graphics: There are pros and cons to the graphics in this game. The human animations are generally pretty good, and the facial expressions are particularly well done. The cities in general are also good. The only real drawback is the animation for certain scenery items, which can appear flat and without detail.Gameplay: Running through the cities and across rooftops is much as it was in the last game, which in my opinion isn't a bad thing. The fighting, however, has much improved, both in terms of quality and diversity. There are several more types of enemies, and a much greater variety of weapons. And of course, the assassination kills are ever more entertaining.Plot: Although I overall enjoyed the plot of the first game, it at times was so complex and convoluted it became boring. The plot of this game retains the aspects that made Assassins Creed I original and entertaining, while adding elements that keep the player interested throughout the game.So as I already said, I'd definitely recommend buying this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0045FEEAS","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario 25","reviewText":"Hard to believe, it has been 25 years since Nintendo unveiled the classic Super Mario Brothers, and there is no question about the strength Nintendo has made into their classic plumber. Not only has Mario been the most influential video game character of all time, but the gameplay in platform games has been incredibly strong after all these years. Not only did Super Mario Brothers influence platformers, but a quarter-century after its release it still is as popular today, as it was 25 years ago. Nintendo is really celebrating the best of Mario all year long. With the Nintendo Wii, gamers have been falling in love with Mario all over again with Super Mario Galaxy and Mario Galaxy 2, but with New Super Mario Brothers Wii. But for those who've never experienced the Nintendo Wii, a new chance is finally here, and it is definitely hip to be Mario red.The Wii Hardware Bundle in Red is specialty made to celebrate with Mario for his 25th Anniversary. The system looks absolutely vivid, and includes New Super Mario Brothers Wii, one of NIntendo's guilty pleasures from last year, and the classic Wii Sports which was bundled into the game as well. The system also includes a cute red Wii-mote, which clashes nicely into the system & nunchuck controller. As you play New Super Mario Brothers Wii, you'll encounter a long & winding road filled with villians from goombas, to Bowser's koopa kids including Larry, Ludwig Von Koopa and Iggy Koopa, to the innocent but not so cute Wendy. The grpahics look absolutely amazing, and the control is easy to master, as you try and save Princess Toadstool from the vulgar clutches of Bowser and a even more challenging Mega-sized Bowser whom spits giant fireballs of madness at you.The system bundle also includes Wii Sports, the first game developed for the system. The game includes 5 classic sports games that you & your friends can take on and try to score your way to victory in bowling, tennis, baseball, one-one-one boxing, and putt your way to a hole-in-one with golf. The game is a party classic sampler which shows how strong it has been since Nintendo unveiled the Wii 4 years ago. The control of Wii SPorts is simple and fun to have with your friends to play around. While Wii Sports isn't much, as was shown with Wii Sports Resort, it still shows how simple it is to play around with the Nintendo Wii.All in all, while there are so many new gamers trying to seek the Kinnect for the Xbox 360 and Sony's Playstation Move for the PS3, they unfortunately haven't been able to really deliver what has honestly came down to it, the games. Of the 3 current systems on the market, I would honestly still choose the Nintendo Wii. Nintendo has never stopped revolutionizing the ways we play video games, and they've never even stopped delivering in on the fun. It has just kept on coming. I absolutely recommend the red New Super Mario Brothers Wii Hardware Bundle for anyone whom wants a video game system for the holidays.New Super Mario Brothers: A-Wii Sports: B+Graphics: ASound: A-Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: A-Overall: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

As a result, I was confused with the plot somewhat and had no particular hate toward Emil and Marta as a lot of people seem to have (and I don't seem to understand that which I'll bring up later) hence why I give the game a 5 instead of a 4.The game takes place a few years after the first game (I think its 2) where the two worlds are merged together into one. Lloyd and the group thought that would eliminate the problems of the first game but only caused more problems now. Instead of people getting attacked because they were half elves, now the Tethe'allans are harassing the Sylveranti and it's about class now instead of race. Emil and Marta have to live with the consequences of Lloyd's actions.Regardless, you start off playing as Emil and easily you notice the improvement of graphics. That's a plus. And the Z Skits are also voiced and that's good and all, but then you noticed that almost all of the English voice actors except Colette (and another fan favorite who I won't say) were changed so while Genis sounds like he hit puberty and Lloyd no longer sounds like Robin from Teen Titans, the only voice I found obnoxious was Zelos (and it's a shame since he is my favorite character).The game quickly throws you into the game, but then you quickly notice how Emil seems to be useless in battle as he can't even hold a sword correctly. This is changed later when Emil makes a pact with the Centurion of Darkness Tenebrae who gives him a split personality that does all the fighting for him (later dubbed Ratatosk). And then this is when you notice that many battles in the game are lose-lose situations in the sense that I feel like this game has more boss battles you lose then when you win (case in point, fighting Lloyd or Richter usually means a curb stomp battle for a cutscene).But yeah, Emil and Marta's goal is to collect the Centurion orbs around the world before Lloyd does for whatever reason because his friends won't tell him. The relationship value is gone in this game mainly because Emil and Marta are the main couple it hurts. Lloyd however is fortunate as he can decide who he went with at the end of the first game (getting a love confession from the girls and if you're like me, will squeal for the Lloyd/Zelos bit).Anyway, gameplay is very solid but can be a game breaker as using free run allows Emil to outrun almost any enemy. You can play either Emil or Marta and by the time you reach the highest level, they're be so broken with Emil killing things with one hit or Marta only taking a second to cast a powerful magic spell. Which to say the AI isn't that bad this time around, but I feel that Marta is bias toward the other characters when it comes to healing as she'll tend to focus on just Emil.The characters from the old game return, but this is the fault of the gameplay. You cannot customize them at all and they are at a set level depending on the portion of the story (which allows you to judge the level of the boss). This makes them useless on higher levels unless you give them items that permanently increase their stats as it will carry over to the next game. The bonus dungeon as a result will kill them easily especially on higher levels unless you're playing them or have them spam their special moves. So basically you get a bunch of great characters that were awesome in the last game that are medicore to lame in this one. The worse part is most of the game has you with Sheena and Regal and Sheena can't summon anymore in gameplay (what a waste) and Regal's special move feels unfinished and lame. This is generally why the monster pacts you make in the game is important because these monsters are going to be helping you out more when you separate from the group multiple times (it gets annoying).In fact, the game was worked on with a lower budget so many things feel cut out and unfinished gameplay wise. Story wise is still good. Character wise, people prefer the villains over the heroes (Richter, Alice and Decus) mainly because Emil is \"whiny and useless\" and Marta is \"clingy and obnoxious\". Never mind that we have had characters like these in the past but the only reason it's brought to light is because of this whole \"masculinity\" thing for Emil and how he's often compared to with Shinji from Neon Genesis and Tidus from FFX never mind that Emil does get character development (and it IS slower than the rest of the main protagonists of other games but come on! A boy that has abusive parents and a town that hates and bullies him would make it hard for him to change as a person.) With Marta, its mainly how people see her attitude toward Colette as selfish despite the fact that because of Lloyd's group, her family went to hell because of her mother's death. And Marta gets better with her attitude problem after Emil has to talk some sense into her.Overall, I feel like this sequel helps expand on the Symphonia universe. While I admit it doesn't do justice to some of the characters (-cough- Yuan), it is a game worth buying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2013"}

The amount of content that is in this game alone made me realize that this game is worth $59.99. As I am writing this, I have beaten the game once and sitting at 64% done with collecting Riddler trophies and finishing side quests. I haven't even started the new game plus option and done all of the combat, silent predator, and campaign challenges. This game keeps on giving. The very plus side, and I thought Arkham Asylum was it, but this has got to be the best digital Batman experience YET.I wouldn't be human to not have any issues with Arkham City, but they are very slight. You still have to hold a button down to run instead of just pushing the thumbstick down all the way. Next complaint, the issue with purchasing this game new or used determines how to obtain the added Catwoman campaign. I would totally argue to not be a tool and just buy the game new instead of used. I just wished they added her campaigns anyway. My final complaint would be the ending. I will not reveal any spoilers but it made me sad and kind of demanding more. But that's it, the rest of the game was an absolute Batman nerdgasm.Anybody who would give this game lower than 4 star rating must be really nick picky or must only like a certain variety of games to not appreciate this action adventure masterpiece. I will honestly say that next or all of the Assassin's Creed games combined will never be near of greatness that is Batman: Arkham City. In fact, Assassin's Creed II will never be near Arkham Asylum to me.If you are a fan of Metroidish action and adventure with comic book appeal, DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS. Please buy and enjoy the fun!

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Justin VanHalbert","summary":"Meh.","reviewText":"Being a big fan of action RPG's (Skyrim, Oblivion, Kingdoms of Amalur), I picked up this game thinking I was in for a real treat.  After seeing all the glowing reviews from the PC world for a year now, and seeing all the high praise after it was released on the 360, I expected a great game.  This is probably going to be the biggest gaming disappointment of the year for me (or at least I hope there aren't any more).The graphics are very nice and the environments are varied and interesting.  The voice acting seemed of high quality as well.  The story was starting to get me interested, but alas, I had to eject this game.  I dumped just over 4 hours into this game, but I just can't bring myself to waste another hour hoping it will get better when there are so many other games that are probably fun from the start.The worst part about this game is the actual action/gameplay.  It feels cumbersome and frustrating.  The other equally bad aspect of this game, as noted by other reviewers is the horrible map/directions system.  I spent too much time running around wondering where so and so was or where to pickup this thing I needed.  There was a multitude of other smaller issues that I don't care to go into (I've wasted too much time on this game already), so all I will say is this.  If there is a demo, you should probably check that out first.  Don't assume just because you like action RPG's that you will love this game, otherwise, you are leaving yourself open for some wicked disappointment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2012"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

It is simply a wonderful game, very addictive and fun to play. The graphics are very impressive and I enjoy the free movement around the city. You can climb just about anything. One thing I am very impressed with is the voice acting; you can really feel the emotions of the different characters from their voices. Usually voice acting is something overlooked in the whole game design. The abilities that your character has are awesome and the progression to new powers is tied into the story well. If your someone who likes to collect extra stuff or unlock trophies there is plenty of that here. The only downside I have to the game is the non-story missions are repetitive. However, the story is very interesting and has not had that problem, I am about halfway done.

VASQUEZ","summary":"An entertaining but ultimately underwhelming followup to the amazing series","reviewText":"I'm a huge God of War fan, been playing it back to back since the first one came on PS2, and the story and gameplay of previous installments was top notch, so much that of course i bought this one as soon as it came out. I had read some positive reviews that made a point of some type of inconsistency in the story, but i payed it no mind and just bought my game as i usually do. After finishing it, i have to say i'm greatly disappointed as to what was done with it, particularly with the story. But let me divide my review in specific points.GAMEPLAY: Simply the best of the series as far as gameplay goes, there's just so much content here, many new weapons, many new ways to fight enemies, they certainly upped the bar here and you'll find yourself enjoying the fighting like never before, particularly the boss fights which are incredibly epic, specially the earlier ones you run into. You have a total of 4 weapons including your blades, new moves, new enemies and new fighting mechanics, again this was done very very well.STORY: This is where we run with such a huge screw up, that i can't begin to understand what could have possibly happened in development that could have led to such a big inconsistency. Story wise the game has a start like no other in the series, i will say it's the BEST by a huge margin, and it remains that way for most of the first half of the game, but then suddenly a change of focus occurs that makes no sense at all, and almost everything that has happened in the first half, and that has served to drive you that far, is simply forgotten, as if it has no meaning at all. Basically the first half and second half of the game feel as if they were developed by different people, there is no cohesion with the story, you start a quest of taking down the gods with the titans on your side and then at one point titans simply disappear from the map, nothing is said of them, of the new war between them and the gods, you don't even get to see any of them anymore, it's just you, by the end of the game this continues with no explanation. All of it feels so out of place one wonders what the hell happened in sony when they were working on that second part, which honestly feels like a whole different game story wise.In conclusion this lack of cohesion in the story, the lack of coherence of it as a whole, really takes a huge lot from the game, because ultimately half a game is it's story, the other half gameplay, and while the gameplay is excellent as usual,the story really is a stupid mess that i am left wanting an explanation of why that is.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2010"}

Bottle Rocket Games was fired (and rendered defunct as a result) by Namco around early 2009, and it took Namco's in-house team nearly a year and a half to fill in the rest.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Great game for Ultimate Ninja fans","reviewText":"Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is a simple, fun and easy to play fighting game for those who are already fans of Naruto but new gamers should find it a fun to play game too.This is the latest in the Ultimate Ninja chain and takes place in the Naruto Shippuden era of the show, beginning with Naruto's return to the village and ending a little after Pain destroys the village. The story may not appear to familiar to someone who has only seen the American version of the show because it is farther ahead of the show's timeline.The story mode has you a lot more involved as character then the last game. You travel and speak to characters and agree to take missions instead of last game's method of simply accessing the menu and picking a mission. This makes the story mode of the game more interesting and more interactive but it also means that you end up having to run back and forth. The map is bigger compared to the last game and you can travel to other lands beyond the Hidden Leaf Village. Unfortunately if you were looking forward to jumping on rooftops and smash open lamps for money, it's not a viable strategy in this game. This game expects that you have to stay on the ground. Another improvement over the previous edition is that you can customize your battle items before you fight in story mode. And, of course, the graphics are also a lot better.The fighting style and controls are generally similar to the first game. This game comes with a lot more characters than the other game. You unlock characters by getting storm points instead of through the story. You get storm points by winning battles and completing missions. When you get a certain amount of points, you unlock a new character. The Ultimate Jutsu doesn't have the mini game any more but it is more difficult to connect. In awaking mode you are powerful but you can't use Ultimate Jutsu or supports.Online is a new feature where you can challenge real people with skill and experience, instead of the easy-to-beat computer. You also have an online ranking that is based of the fights you win. Something that is a con to me, but you might like it, is that your power is based on skill. You can't get more powerful as you rank up, just more experienced.To summarize, the one major improvement over the previous version is, of course the online mode. This should keep the game interesting for a lot longer than than Ninja Storm 1. Other improvements include: more characters, larger map, more complex story and better graphics.My rating is 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2011"}

I must admit, that between the issues I had with finally getting Oblivion to run, and what I heard about Fallout: New Vegas (I fortunately didn't have time to play that one right away,) I was nervous that Bethesda would release yet another title with game-breaking bugs.  Well, I haven't had any problems thus far (several hours of play so far.)  What I have noticed is how much they improved the system!  It looks to me like they borrowed heavily from the recent Fallout titles.  My review will be focusing on the mechanical aspects of the game:*Skills and leveling seem less obtuse.  They got rid of the stats, so you have more freedom to decide which skills you level.  You no longer have to worry about the age-old TES question \"Should I tag that skill?  Or will it cripple my character?\"  They also removed the \"you must rest in order to level up\" requirement, which is a bit more convenient.*The crafting system seems to borrow heavily  from Fallout: New Vegas (and games like World of Warcraft.)  You no longer need to carry repair hammers around.  Instead, you find raw materials and instead of maintaining your equipment, you can improve it.  Over all, this makes the skills feel more useful, and at the same time, it seems that it reduces the tedium (stopping in the middle of a dungeon to repair my damn boots in Morrowind/Oblivion was always annoying!)*Questing has improved!  The quest log is far easier to follow than it has been in previous titles.*Combat hasn't changed too much, though they added the ability to equip a weapon in your offhand.

Every now and then the game will threaten to lock up, but I don't think I had to ever reset my console.  Also, I haven't had too many problems with quests, which seems to be a common complaint from other users.  Again, I've played other Bethesda titles, and I think dodging some of the big glitches is the luck-of-the-draw; I've had attempts at Oblivion and Morrowind that stalled within the first few hours, and I've also had complete play-throughs with very few hang-ups.Update (4/3/12)Still playing this game from time to time!  And I still haven't run into many serous glitches.  A few graphical errors, and that's about it.  If I play for a long time, the game seems to get a little fussy (and it may be because of heat issues with the PS3 itself.)  There are still many areas to explore, and tons of quests to complete, so I haven't tested everything yet (even after all this time!)  Skyrim still has my highest recommendation!  In fact, with respect to my experiences, it's probably the most stable game Bethesda has released to date, and every bit as fun as the previous titles!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}

You just choose the songs from the main menu and choose the time whether normal or short, and the level of difficulty.This game has really cool features such as being able to sing along using a headset, or bluetooth.  Also, what is cool is you can set up your own choreography steps.  This is pretty cool and takes time.There are plenty of features such as saving your performance and also going online.  Also there is a workout section where you can exercise.  This is a great thing for kids...and adults!!The songs are a wide range of songs from 70s, 80s, 90s and 2000's.  But, some of the songs I think are inappropriate for even Teens.  I'm not a big fan of \"Lady Gaga\".  But, there are a few others in this package that should not have been included.I was disappointed that there aren't many songs that can be purchased as add-ons.

Gameboy perfected!","reviewText":"It's been a decade since I got my Gameboy Advance, my first system ever. I was ten when I got into the gaming circut and I got in at a great time. Pokemon was at its peak, the PS2 was surfacing, the older systems were widely availible and really cool. The Gameboy Advance was a really cool system, practically a Super Nintendo in your hand. Sure, there were better games on better systems, but the games were still good.Years past and the Gameboy was discontinued after several redesigns and incarnations. The good ol' Boy grew into the DS. With the abilities of the N64 and a touch screen gimmic that works better than I expected, the system got off to a good start. The first system had a port for GBA games and could play all DS games.I was hesitant. I watched and waited. The Gimmic did not interest me and the new games were not catching my eye. So I waited.2011 came and brought us the 3DS. A new gimmic was introduced, 3D. Remember the Virtual Boy and it's 3D? Well, I do, and I remember the headache people got from the 3D. So I was still hesitant.THen I learned you could turn 3D off. I still wasn't sold on the idea.Then I heart Netflix could work on the 3DS through a wi-fi connection. My ears perked.I got this thing as a gift and it is excellent. You will want to get a clam case for the system to keep it from smudging and some screen protectors, but this thing is worth every cent. THe Netflix is very good, the Wi-Fi browser is great, the games are spot on, and the battery life is terrific! It has a ten hour battery and a neat charging dock. Man, this thing is just so cool. There are built in games that are fairly fun, as well as a camera and drawing pad, and that is a hoot.The real hook for me was that the 3DS can play all DS games. Yes, that DS collection can play on the 3DS perfectly. There are so many worth-while DS games out there and they are not lost on the new system.I can say that this was worth every cent. The games vary, but the touch screen makes them a little more playable. Netflix is really good on the go, provided you get to a Wi-FI hot spot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"J.M.","summary":"Werehog Levels stink","reviewText":"Sonic Unleashed would be an awesome game, if it wasn't for the werehog levels.  The werehog levels take place at night when Sonic tranforms into a beast.  This might sound pretty cool, but it's definately not.  The werehog version of Sonic isn't fast at all (infact, he's really slow), so it doesn't feel like Sonic.  They require you to run from point A to point B, but while doing it, you must do some platforming, fight some enemies and collect a bunch of weird stuff.  The combat system is broken.  Werehog Sonic has no cool moves, and sometimes he can't even reach the flying ones, resulting in running around and waving your claws randomly until you hit something.  The enemies are also very unoriginal.  All of this makes these levels quite boring and they make me want to go take a nap.  These levels also take you eight to ten minutes to complete, so if you don't like them you will be stuck playing them.The regular Sonic levels were pretty good though.  They were a lot of fun and really fast.  It's too bad that they are only a small fraction of  the game.The graphics were horrible!!  I honestly checked to see if there was something wrong with my TV.  They looked worse than even some early PS2 games!!  However, the cutscene graphics were nice.  They were smooth and the colors were bright.The cutscenes were really well done.  They were kind of silly, so I looked forward to seeing them.  The voicecovers were really cool.Chip is your companion throughout the game.  Part of your goal is to retrieve his memory.  He was cute during the excellent cutscenes, but during the gameplay he is really annoying.  For example, he says stuff like \"Look, Sonic!  The barrier is gone!  Now we can go through here!\"  Comments like that were just dumb.  You don't have to be smart to realize that once a door is gone you can go through it.If you are dying for this game, rent it first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00020BV0Q","reviewerName":"kidnugget","summary":"Great game design","reviewText":"This is a fantastic game in all aspects.  The sound, the graphics, the game play, the level design, all of it is awesome.  There is a fabulous amount of diferent vehicles with quite a variety of armor, handling, weapons, etc (not to mention an endless variety of hand held weapons...).The basic premise of the game is great.  You're a merc, and you're out to collect bounties on the deck 52 North Korean evil bosses.  Each one awards you a cash bounty (cut in half if you kill them instead of take them alive...).The best part of this game is the airdrops.  As long as your SNS signal isn't being jammed by the enemy (which is fairly rare until late in the game), you can order weapons, health, vehicls, and a lethal variety of airstrikes.  The airstrikes are hard to summon up at first due to the high price, but once you've collected several bounties, let the fun begin!  Again, variety is the key, from bunker busters to tank destoyers to several varietys of artillery (there are dozens!).The level design in huge, and half way through the game, you get a new map with tons of new cities and secrets to find (including a code to change your skin to Han Solo!).It's not all perfect, though.  The third suit of bosses gets rediculously difficult for some reason, and the third ace boss is just lousy game design.  In fact, the face cards of the final two suits (and the final Ace of Spades) are prohibitively difficult for a casual gamer.  You can get through them, but they lack the intelligence of the rest of the game.  They are just point and shoot sprint fests.Buy this game, don't rent it, and play, play, play.  You get to play three different characters, each with different strengths (though you select one and play the entire game with him/her, and this kind of sucks--it would have been nice to swap between the three throughout the game).  The three characters makes the game very re-playable, plus you can continue after you beat it and keep all the money you've earned ($100 million plus!).Great game, simple but fun design.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"B. Rose","summary":"Decent game, but with some flaws.","reviewText":"Short and to the point: Dragon Age is pretty fun, with an interesting 'tactical' spin on combat, a passingly good story, great graphics, and it's smooth-running.The reasons I don't give it five stars (might be some minor spoilers of the first thirty minutes of gameplay):Mainly, it's because this isn't a five-star game. It's not pushing the envelope in any category, and after the initial battle at Ostagar, the storyline goes downhill. It's back to the typical \"go to each of these 4-5 places, find 'x' or get support of 'x', then prepare for the big battle\". Along the way, you take plenty of frivolous quests to detract from the drive of the storyline.Speaking of storyline, there are some major holes in the plot. After the battle at Ostagar -- are we really supposed to believe that no one in Loghain's army thought his retreat order seemed odd? Are we really supposed to believe the Darkspawn simply stop dead in the tracks after their victory and sat idly by while the main characters bumble around Ferelden wrangling nugs and helping start new chantries?A lot of people laud the 'conversation' and 'character interaction' aspects of the game, but they're a little annoying to me. All the conversation options boil down to is a little difference in XP / items gained and maybe a party member gained or not gained. Another thing there is the inability to explore. Everything is basically 'on rails'. You can't venture over hills or through trees or in ponds, but are locked into a set area... no matter how they decorate them, environments are a straight path to the 'boss' or the 'treasure' with a few side paths thrown in for extra items / XP.The thing is, in trying to make the game seem more 'free', the developers actually make it more cramped. Games like Fallout (the original one and its sequel), Arcanum... these games truly gave the user a sense of 'open-ended' play, yet kept a coherent and fixed plot drive. This lower-budget games had inferior graphics but combat, dialogue, and overall storyline seemed so much more fulfilling than Dragon Age. I guess you could say that Dragon Age is the equivalent of the 'safe' hollywood blockbuster: huge special effects budget, all-star cast, mediocre story and direction.Fanboys and apologists get mad when they hear the word 'cliche', but seriously... the Dwarves pray to The Stone. The deity of the Chantry (the Chantry of Light... how creative) is called 'The Maker'. The universal enemies, the 'Darkspawn', look like orcs, have no identifiable motives other than being 'evil', and were created by the corruption of mages. I'll stop there and say, regardless of what fanboys claim, cliches abound in this game. Don't look for any innovation in the way of fantasy plot elements.A final pet peeve is the frequent downloadable content. What the hell? The game is expensive enough. I watch a guy get stabbed in the woods, run over to him, and \"DOWNLOAD CONTENT to save him and find out the secret!\" Seriously? He's going to lie there in the woods with a knife-wound to the gut and somehow stay alive indefinitely, waiting for me to buy an overpriced expansion module? Give me a break. Suspension of disbelief just ceased being suspended.Eh... hm. Don't get me wrong, it is a pretty fun game with pretty graphics, but it's a clear indicator of the WRONG direction games are taking. Big budget, eye candy, and check-box plot elements for an ultimately forgettable, 'vanilla' RPG.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships.

{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A fun weekend rental","reviewText":"The Good: Childish but funny mature humor, grotesque setting and atmosphere, great play on light and dark, story is entertaining, fun boss fightsThe Bad: Repetition throughout, Garcia is a hard character to like, story is simple and straightforward, no reason to really go backDuring the first 10 minutes of the game the first thing you will think is \"WTF?\" There's nothing else to describe this game full of childish mature humor and sick twisted ideas. That's not to say that it is bad. Most of the humor in the game is actually so childish and gross that you can't help yourself and laugh. Some stuff is downright hilarious such as Johnson's Boner gun. Before I get into any detail, I have to say the story is pretty entertaining if straight forward and simple. You play as Garcia Hotspur who is a Mexican demon hunter and has a demon accompanying him in form of a floating skull named Johnson. I didn't really care much for Garcia because he is a typical potty mouthed action hero, but I found Johnson to be the steal of the show. He's a posh British demon that uses clean cuss words and is a stark contrast to Garcia which makes him more likable and hilarious to listen to. Garcia is trying to get his stolen girlfriend, Paula, back from the demon lord Fleming, and of course you follow him into the depths of Hell.That's about as far as the story goes. There's a small twist at the very end after the credits, but after you see it you won't be surprised it happened. The main attraction is the banter between Garcia and Johnson and the stories you read throughout the game. Some of these made me bust up because they were so funny. Other than the story I have to say that I really love the guns in this game. The creators force you to use all three, but they are upgraded so much that they feel like whole new guns throughout the game. Boner is your pistol, Teether is your machine gun, and the Skullblaster is your shotgun. These can get upgraded by finding blue gems from bosses. Boner turns into Hot Boner that can set explosive mines, Teether can get a homing upgrade, and Skullblaster will eventually get an upgrade to create giant bombs. You can find red gems throughout to upgrade your weapons and health. Gracia guzzles down alcohol to heal himself because apparently alcohol keeps you alive in Hell.The game works around a light vs dark gameplay idea and it works well. When you are surrounded in darkness your health depletes and you need to shoot a goat candelabra to return the light. Yeah, it's weird and that's only the beginning. Gate keys consist of shoving strawberries, eyes, and brains into creepy baby faces that are guarding the gate. One level even has you walking over a giant naked Paula. The game never stops delivering weirdness, and that's exactly what makes this game so fun, because hey, it's a Suda 51 game, what do you expect?There are a few puzzles thrown in that can be fun because they are straight forward. I didn't even need a walkthrough to get through this game. Even the boss fights use light and darkness to be beaten. In darkness you can only see the weak spot on enemies so you have to quickly shoot it because you die. This sounds frustrating but it's not. You get a darkness shield that depletes before your health starts going down. The enemy design is pretty crazy, but repetitive. I got tired of shooting the same demons all the time. The whole game overall is repetitive in nature because it uses the same few elements mixed around a lot. My least favorite idea was the 2D shooting levels. These were frustrating and felt like pointless filler. There's a fun boss fight at the end of the third level, but I could have gone without these.After you beat the 8 hour game there's no reason to go back. There's no multiplayer or extra modes which is a shame. I guess if you want to collect all the red gems you can, but why bother? This is a fun weekend rental or cheap bargain bin purchase and nothing more. If it weren't for the repetition set throughout and those pointless 2D levels I would have liked this a lot more. Garcia is a hard character to like and the story is simple and straight forward. Overall through, this is a solid game and highly entertaining.

If you already own Little Big Planet and purchased any or all of the downloadable content from Playstation Network, then there isn't any reason to pick up this Game of the Year Edition, but if you missed out on Little Big Planet the first time around, then by all means pick this game up.

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","summary":"great game, bad ending...","reviewText":"This game is a sequel to the anticipated game, Final Fantasy XIII. After the miracle at the end of the game, Lightning disappears and everybody soon forgets her, except Serah, her sister, she knows she's alive somewhere, that's why Snow (her boyfriend) goes on a quest to recover Lightning, but never returns. Meawhile, Lightning has become a warrior goddess who is in a eternal battle with a man named Caius ,  a man that wants to destroy everything, so she sends out Serah to time travel with Noel (from the future), so they can fix the Timeline.I really tried to hate his game, because the ending sucks, but I couldn't. It was so fun time traveling, resolving missions by going to the past or the future, or resolve paradoxes. I really recommend this game,the graphics are beautiful, the game is really fun, although it's not storywise, if you know what I meanIt would've been the perfect ending, if Serah and Noel, really DID fix things at the end. I have mixed feelings towards the sequel Lightning returns, because I found that this Final Fantasy was satisfying(at least for me), it had everything the first one didn't, and in the third part there's not much to be told, Lightning Returns to atone for the mistakes she did in this game, making the third game really short.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2014"}

{"product_name":"B009AFLXQQ","description":"Your games, your way. However you think of your gaming style-hardcore, old school, or purely nostalgic-the Wii U Pro Controller puts you in the game. Designed for accessibility and extended gameplay comfort, the Wii U Pro Controller features the dual analog sticks and ergonomic button layout that you&#x2019;ve come to expect, as well as a rechargeable battery that can last up to 80 hours on a single charge. The Wii U Pro Controller can be used for playing a variety of games-from packaged games at retail to downloadable games from the Nintendo eShop. Look on the back of Wii U game packaging to see which games use the Wii U Pro Controller. Not compatible with the Wii system or games.","reviewerName":"Nerrel","summary":"Nintendo's best standard controller yet, but still not perfect","reviewText":"The Wii U Pro fills a similar role to the Classic Controller Pro from last gen- a more traditional alternative to Nintendo's default controller- and in that purpose it's a success.  It's more comfortable to hold, simpler to pick up and play with, and generally preferable for any game that doesn't make extensive use of the touchscreen or motion input (which, in all honesty, is 90% of the Wii U library).The components in the Wii U gamepad and the Wii U Pro are mostly the same with few differences.  The Wii U Pro has no motion sensors, speakers, TV control, or NFC built in, which may negatively impact the way some games play- for instance, Wind Waker HD is clumsier to navigate without the inventory and map screens and Wonderful 101's dual screen segments are much less enjoyable when compressed to TV-only play.  That said, most titles play much more comfortably on the U Pro without any real sacrifices.The grips are fuller than on any other Nintendo controller and have similar contours to the Xbox 360 pad, but without the obstruction of the 360's battery pack.  The analog sticks are the same new clickable type used in the gamepad, which resemble Nintendo's Nunchuk/CC Pro sticks but have much smoother movement; they're the best sticks Nintendo has ever used and I would even argue that they're preferable to the 360/PS3 sticks.  Unfortunately, they're not up to the same standards of the Xbox One/DS4 sticks, with larger dead zones and more \"junk input\" (my right stick also has an off-center neutral point that makes playing some games on PC a pain).As one would expect from Nintendo, the D-pad is exceptionally good- responsive and tight without feeling stiff or clicky- and works far better than the D-pads in any competitor's offerings.  The Z shoulder buttons are much more narrow and trigger-like than on the gamepad and L and R are modeled after the 360's shoulder bumpers.  The face buttons are the same as the gamepad's, with a softer \"click\" and tighter grouping than those on the CC Pro (big improvements).  The buttons themselves are a little heavier and have thicker plastic than past Nintendo controllers, giving them a higher quality feel.Many have complained about the placement of the buttons below the right stick, but this layout makes sense for modern games.  More and more titles tend to make heavy use of the right analog for aiming/camera control while using the triggers to attack in order to keep the player's thumbs on the analogs, leaving the face buttons used for occasional tasks like ducking or reloading.  Giving the right stick a higher priority makes sense considering that a player's thumb will be resting on it more often than the face buttons for most games, even if it is awkward to adjust to the change.  It also preserves the symmetry of the D-pad and face buttons when playing virtual console titles.Unlike the CC Pro, the Wii U Pro is fully wireless and has its own rechargeable battery.  Nintendo's claim of 80 hours of life (without rumble) is accurate- it takes weeks of casual play to reach the lowest battery bar.  The WU Pro only has one rumble motor, housed in the right grip, but the rumble is evenly dispersed and feels smoother than the gamepad's.  It's also far more quiet, but not as responsive for very low level rumbles- light or brief shakes barely register at all, even though the rumble is very powerful at its maximum.There are a few subjective problems with the layout of the U Pro; the smaller and more narrow design of the ZL and ZR buttons seems like an overt attempt to copy the triggers of the Xbox 360 controller, the issue with this being that the ZL/ZR triggers on the Pro are not analog.  Using digital triggers on a hinge feels somewhat awkward as they don't protrude as far as analogs and must be depressed at their bottoms to get a firm click.  This hinging actually allows for faster trigger pulls, but I find myself wishing ZL and ZR were wider (as the gamepad's triggers are) to allow for a more stable grip.Another problem is that the XYBA buttons seem poorly placed.  On a normal diamond button layout, the user's thumb should fall vertically across the B and X buttons, with Y and A a short distance on either side.  This is true with the gamepad as well as the CCPro, SNES, 360, and PS3 pads.  The U Pro instead has the user's thumb come in at an angle that's rotated 45 degrees off from normal, with the thumb landing straight in between all of the buttons (parallel to X-A and Y-B) without resting on any of them.This results in X and A being fairly easy to press- in fact, it's very comfortable to rest a thumb across X and A- but Y and B require such a downward stretch that it's awkward to access them.  This problem can be mitigated by mapping the buttons when possible so that X and A are the primary inputs, but not all titles allow for this.Despite a few minor complaints, the Wii U Pro is a solid, comfortable controller that is superior to the Classic Controller Pro in every way and can even hold its own against the more fully featured Xbox One and Dual Shock 4 controllers.  It's usefulness is limited for players who are satisfied with the Wii U gamepad, but it can be a great alternative for those who want something more conventional and it can even serve as a great substitute for the 360 controller when connected to a PC (which requires an adapter for full compatibility).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2013"}

The beautiful fianc&eacute;e of Leon Belmont, a knight crusader, is captured by Walter Bernhard, a master vampire.  Leon deserts the crusades and flies off to the castle of the aforementioned vampire.  There, after being handed a mystical whip, he penetrates layer after layer of horrible badness until he faces, and hopefully destroys, his true enemy.  Which is about all the plot a good third person hack-and-slash really needs.However, to create such a game with sufficient workmanship to make it compelling visually and challenging mentally and physically is no small feat.  And that is what sets Lament of Innocence apart from many of its competitors.  For one thing, developers are always tempted to substitute extreme difficulty for interesting challenges.  Lament, on the other hand, is just doable enough to keep the player from throwing the controller at the monitor in disgust.  And its puzzles can be resolved by keeping in mind that anything can be a tool.Castlevania isn't perfect.  I found that motion control and camera angle are both a little too loose.  To some degree this is intentional, but I prefer controls that send objects where they are suppose to go.  Especially when you are leaping from stone to stone in a frantic effort to scale a wall and there is one, and only one, spot from which to leap.One of the problems in rating a game like Lament of Innocence is that it is very good, but falls slightly short of some other, very similar games.  In this case I'm thinking of Devil May Cry.  This is a case where 5 stars are too many, but 4 are too few.  I would recommend both as great examples of their genre that can be played repeatedly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2003"}

Starting back in the early 80's with the Intellivision and then I moved on to a Nintendo (old school variety), Sega Genesis, Playstation 1 and so on. Of all of those system only the original Nintendo has had the staying power of the PS2. There are literally thousands of games for you to play!Does the system have flaws? Of course, but so did the Intellivision (I remember I used to have to \"blow\" into the games or even take the game apart and clean the contacts with a pencil eraser). Nintendo games wouldn't always play, and when they did you had to write down HUGE passwords in order to continue/save. Then Zelda came out with its internal battery/memory so you can save on the game...this was great until the battery wore out a year later!What are the Playstation problems - well they can be a bit moody and it may suddenly decide to reset itself (all of the other systems did this as well). Mine will not read the cursed \"blue discs\" (these are discs with a blue backing instead of the standard silver), and a few other minor annouyances, but nothing too bigWhat is great about PS2? Almost everyhing else - first there is an amazing array of games - from \"Kingdom Hearts' (one of my favorites) to \"Friends\" (a trivia game based off of the tv show - my wife's favorite) to the dancing game with the camera.  Next, thegraphics and sound play are also outstanding. While some complain that it may not be on the level of the XBOX or the Gamecube - all I have to say is that it they beat the crap out of the Intellivision and the Nintendo (both of which I logged many, many enjoyable hours on).In summary, while some of you may want to wait in the huge lines and pay the incredible amounts of $$$ for the Playstation 3 or the XBOX 360, but for me (at least for now) my trusty PS2 will work just fine!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2006"}

Sure, it's graphics can't hold a candle up to Metroid Prime and it's story isn't quite as good as Metroid Fusion, but if you're gonna make a Metroid game you might as well do it right don't you think? What I mean is we want exploration while there's a good storyline in tact. Something that the two new Metroid games didn't put together. While Metroid Prime has great exploration it's story kind of sucks. While Metroid Fusion has a great storyline (probably the best in all the Metroid games thus far) you can't explore worth crap! But put them both together and you've got a Metroid classic! That my friends is Super Metroid!I remember playing the first Metroid game and it was an inspiration to me. It wasn't some linear path, you had to explore. Sure there's a lot of backtracking but if there wasn't then it wouldn't be called \"Exploration\" now would it?The storyline of Super Metroid is that the Metroid Hatchling Samus found at the end of her previous adventure, she left in the care of scientist. But that station came under attack and Samus finds that she must help. When she gets there she has a confrontation with Ridley who ends up flying away with the Metroid hatchling and Samus tracks him down to planet Zebes. This is a great storyline!Some landscapes look a lot like those of the original Metroid game but enhanced. Some abilities are even in the same spots! Still, that exploration is there and for that I was happy.  Instead of having a linear path to follow you can play the game at your own pace and find the power-ups how you want to find them.  Exploration in my opinion is what Metroid games are all about.As far as difficulty goes, this Metroid game is REALLY easy compared to the original NES one and the newer Metroid Prime.  It's about the same as Metroid Fusion, meaning that if you know how to take on something you'll undoubtably come out of nearly every confrontation without a scratch.I have only ONE gripe with this game. That is the default control settings.  Thank goodness Nintendo has allowed us to change them!  The default control scheme is TERRIBLE (using the X button to shoot?) and it's better that you can customize the controls.Now, as far as games go I think Super Metroid is one of the greatest games every made! It would be on my top ten list of the greatest games ever and I'm happy to have gotten the oppertunity to play this.If you want an example of how a Metroid game, let alone Action/Adventure then this is a great example! Super Metroid is without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made and I have to second the opinion on making it the greatest SNES game of all time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2003"}

Kid Icarus, Mario 3, and Zelda are some of the hardest yet most exciting games I have ever played. Nintendo was so full of creative ideas that the NES probably didn't need third party support to succeed, but it had a lot anyway. That leads to good and bad. Capcom and Konami made some of the most wonderful titles like Castlevania, Contra, and Mega Man, but lesser publishers used the popularity of the NES just to make a quick buck.

I still prefer Green Hill Zone or Angel Island to this level, but it is a good design. The theme was rather weak, and THE FIGHT WITH EGGMAN WAS THE FUNNIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE. He swoops down and gets in a bulldozer and tries to run over Sonic. It only took 5 seconds for the tires to pop off while Eggman tried to retreat. I guess Emerald Hill was okay, but I've seen better.Chemical plant- 10/10: Sonic had a ton of speed in Chemical Plant. If this were a Mario level you would never complete it in time. The level is so massive, but Sonic made it look like a trip to the local market. The theme is one of the most catchy things ever produced as well, but the boss was a another LOL moment. Eggman spends half an hour filling up a tiny bucket with chemicals, and then tries to dump it on Sonic. Poor Eggman's Eggpod exploded before he could even finish filling up the bucket.Aquatic Ruins- 2/10: Aquatic Ruins was the first bad zone in Sonic 2. I never said that every zone was great. The main issue with Auqatic Ruins was it's distorting and glitchy layers. Plants blocked my view, the scrolling was funky, and I could never really tell what I was doing. The boss ended up being better then the other two, but Eggman was a little too difficult.Casino Night- 9/10: The colorful graphics, giant slot machines, and jazzy theme really gave Casino Night a lot of charm. Even Eggman decorated his Eggpod with a ton of flashing lights. Casino Night is definetly one of my top 5 favorite zones in Sonic.Hill Top- 5/10: Hill Top did not impress me very much. It felt like a remade Marble Zone, and that feeling was only heightened when the Eggman fight was the same thing as the Marble Zone.Mystic Cave- 7/10: This level focused more on puzzle then speed. Unlocking rock doors got really frustrating. I've seen Sega have better ideas then a cave, but it was not that bad.Oil Ocean- 8/10: The first Sonic level with a sadder tone to it. Every other zone was boosting with peppy music and bright colors, even in a chemical factory. Oil Ocean had a orange background that showed a shaky sun. The entire level's bottom part was covered in oil. Oil Ocean is one of my favorites because of the sadder pace, though.Metropolis Zone- 0/10: I HATE THIS ZONE SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's dumb factory theme dosen't fit it's name, the musical score is out of tune, and IT IS EXTREMLY DIFFICULT, AND IF THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH SEGA MADE IT 3 ACTS INSTEAD OF 2! All of my friends agreed with me, Metropolis zone is awful.Sky Chase- 8/10: Many people did not like this zone. I thought it was a nice change of pace, though. Sonic gets in his airplane and chases Eggman's Flying Fortress. That was pretty much it. I liked it.Wing Fortress- 7/10: Eggman's base is a unique level. The theme was a very peppy bugel theme, and the design of the level was very good. After Wing Fortress it came time for the final level!Death Egg-  6/10: Not so much a level as it was an area for the final boss. The Death Egg in Sonic 3 and Knuckles was really amazing full zone, but the Sonic 2 Death Egg only had 2 bosses. Metal Sonic looked strange and no rings made it hard. The Final Boss was another LOL moment, but not because it was too easy. Eggman built a HUGE overweight Eggman robot that looked just like him. One of the reasons Eggman is my favorite video game villan is because of his ego. After defeating Eggman's Eggman Robo, the ending plays. A beautiful 3D ending that was really worth the playthrough.

{"product_name":"B0014ET6EM","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"Fun Game But A Tad Bit Short","reviewText":"Fable 2 is a decent game, but is it worth $60? Well...maybe. Its length makes it feel more like an expansion pack to the original game.The game world may be larger than the original's, but given how small that game world was, that's not saying much. It's far too easy to see every location in a weekend. It's also far too easy to beat the story mode and every single quest in a small amount of time. I played the game trying to delay playing through the whole thing quickly, and despite my best efforts, which included bar tending for hours, doing endless slave rescue quests, exploring, finding every silver key and gargoyle, level grinding, gold grinding, renown grinding, purchasing every building in the game and upgrading all of the furniture, adjusting the rent/price bars up and down countless times, buying everything in a town to boost its economy and selling the crap in an economy that was doing well, fighting countless enemies, opening every Demon Door and overall just simply trying to crawl through the main story so as to not blow through it, I was still through the game entirely within a week.Coop was a much hyped feature, yet it ended up being a major letdown. Whether you play coop with a friend on the same system or hook up with someone on XBox Live, it's really nothing spectacular. The other comes in and must stick with preset characters. They are completely unable to earn loot or use what they have collected in their own game, so there's little point in doing coop unless you want to get some achievements with someone who'll make it easier.The Pub Games download from XBox Live Arcade breathes a little more life into the main game, since it's possible to win some neat items from the tournaments (assuming you're patient enough) but these items are only good for an early game. By mid to late game the items you win from the tournaments are useless.The \"every action, a consequence\" selling point is also underused. There are only so many branching paths in Fable 2 and so for the most part, replaying the game and choosing another path will offer little to make for a different experience.And as for the climax....well, bear in mind that this game is satirical towards a gamer's expectations.Now is the game without its good points? Not at all. The dog is a very helpful companion and the glowing trail is nice, since it becomes impossible to get lost should you explore before going on with the quest. The game also has its characteristic humor, satirizing the common people's obsession with celebrity status, its gullibility and simple mindedness (you can do a laughable dance, and suddenly some of them proclaim \"This is the GREATEST DAY of my LIFE!\" and they will be completely serious.) While remaining spoiler-free, the game's villain also gives a speech talking about how his ambitions will be accomplished through the little people's efforts and like the sheep they are, the crowd just laps it up and cheers, as though to pat themselves on the back, utterly convinced that the villain actually gives a crap about the little people. The game also presents in one section a more difficult choice when having to pick between good and evil - you'll know it when you see it. It's better than previous games that forced you to make a choice between good and evil, much better.One of the key aspects that greatly affects how the game world plays out is one that is also rather simple - the relationship between your character and the dog. How you treat him and other people will directly affect how he treats the other people and how he grows as a dog. Treat him well and make people like you and he'll have a golden colored hair and jump up on villages to lick their faces. Be evil and he'll be a snarling bull dog who casts fear around people as much as your character does. Regardless, the designers did a wonderful job of making the dog look and sound like the real thing. It's when you don't truly notice an aspect that it really shines through. That is to say, for a long time I took for granted just how true to life the dog really was, because there wasn't really any glitch or problem that shattered my suspension of disbelief. It's that good.And the game's biggest strength is that, short as it may be, it's still a fun time. Even though you may have to wait an hour or more to experience the roller coaster (longer if you go in the \"front seat only\" line) it's the roller coaster ride itself that remains the memory, even though it's only about five or ten minutes long. Likewise, even though we've been waiting for a long, long time for Fable 2, and even though it is really short, that experience while it lasts is a good one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}

With the resolution of this   incident, later to be known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, it    seemed that humanity had survived yet another threat to its existence.However, there was a secret condition in the deal that put an end to   the crisis. Nokolai Stepanovich Sokolov, a Soviet scientist who had   defected    to the West, was to be sent back to the Soviet Union. The U.S.   government agreed to this stipulation, and returned Sokolov back to his   native    land. Little did they know that Sokolov was to be the designer of a   nightmarish weapon. Now, with Sokolov back in their hands, the Soviets    are ready to resume its development. If this weapon is completed, it   will mark the beginning of a new age of fear.August 1964. Realizing at last the urgency of the situation, the CIA   forms a plan to recapture Sokolov. They dispatch the covert FOX unit    to Sokolov's research facility, located to the south of the great   Soviet fortress of Groznyj Grad. Led by former SAS member Major Zero,   FOX is a    next-generation special-forces unit that operates both as a   specialized combat group and as a covert intelligence outfit. The FOX   unit's modus    operandi is to send a single agent, backed by radio support from afar,   into enemy territory to carry out solo sneaking missions.August 24.

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"Get the Xbox version","reviewText":"Get the Xbox version, which has better graphics, Dolby 5.1 surround sound (makes a HUGE difference), and easier controls.

Often i found my self hating the game because some things were so complex when they should have been simple: moving the Monkey from certain places to the next and some puzzles.overall, if you can get this game for $15 and have already played the amazing games like; heavenly sword, the last 2 assassins creed games (2 and BH), the god of war series, then pick this up. but do not pay more that $15...yeah, it'll please the eye, but the frustration of some camera work and horrible character movement will make you want to stop right away. but then again at $15 bucks(how much i payed for it), you will probably consider that this game is an overall 3.5-4 out 5 because of the interesting story and intriguing epilogue, and a fun hack-and-slash, if you can get over the drawbacks i listed earlier.hope that made sense, it's almost 5am and ive been playing for the past several hours. some of what you read might not all fit. use your imagination.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Worthy Successor to GTA 3!","reviewText":"To anyone who thought that GTA 3 was revolutionary, but was disappointed with the Vice City's emphasis on gimmicks and movies over gameplay, and the Getaways lack of any useful Navigation system, this game is for you.  Out of all the GTA type games out there (GTA 3, True Crime, GTA Vice City, Simpsons Hit and Run, and The Getaway), this is definitely the second best game on that list.This game starts off with a huge part of L.A.  While not a replica of the city (like the Getaway is with London), it has all the streets, parks, landmarks and freeways of the LA area.  When I mean huge, I mean huge.  While on an uncongested freeway, burning rubber, it still takes a considerable amount of time to get from one side of the map to other.  The city map is a little too vague, but the on screen map in intuitive, and more importantly, street names are presented on screen, so you'll know if you're on Santa Monica Blvd or if you're on Highway 405.  Also, the cars handle really well, the traffic is sparse and smart, and with your customized music, it's a joy to just zoom around.This brings up the music portion.  It's almost all rap, with a few heavy metal songs filled in.  I'm not talking just some no name artists (but most of them are), but there is also major names, like Snoop Dogg, Warren G., N.E.R.D, and heck, I think there is MegaDeath as well.  All the music is made to fit the atmosphere.  The best part is, it's customizable.  There are three different sections for three different types of gameplay (cruisin', slow action, fast action), each with about 15 unique songs each to play or not play.  Simply amazing - I would say over 40 songs.  The only problem is that you can't mix one type of music (e.g. slow action) with another type (e.g. cruisin').  So while I like the N.E.R.D song \"LapDance\", I can only hear it in certain situations.Now to the gameplay.  There are three basic types of missions - outdoor ones involving driving through the city, indoor one with gunfire, and indoor ones with martial arts fighting.  All of these missions are short, so there is not much repeating or backtracking.  The outdoor ones are the ones where it shines.  The city is immense.  Unfortunately, the missions do tend to be on the easy side, and are either tailing, racing, escaping, or just get to a destination.  The indoor ones are not quite as fun, but the auto-aiming combined with bullet time movement makes it enjoyable, despite the camera conspiring against you.  The fighting is slightly more annoying, as it is more button mashing than anything else, but again, it's doable.  I hate all fighting games, so to me, it was the weakest type of mission.The missions are combined into episodes.  Each episode has six to eight missions, and there are eight missions to get to the best ending.  There are two alternative endings that branch off, giving a grand total of 12 episodes in all.  The best part is that all the missions are straight forward.  You don't have to look into guidebooks or ask your friends for special tricks to beat any of these missions.  Even so, beating all the missions are not required, so if there are some missions that are annoying or hard, you can skip them.  This might result in alternative missions or missing some other missions altogether.  Either way, you're never stuck.There are also side mission you can do to upgrade your skills, or you can search random people on the street, or stop crimes and run down common criminals.The only problem I have is one episode where it detracts from any sort of realism and where you fight demons, zombies, and dragons.  A couple of these missions were extremely repetitive and so badly designed that it almost made me lose respect for this game.All in all, it's a fantastic, immense, and polished game that I can't recommend highly enough.Pros:Huge cityMusicCustomization of musicGraphicsNothing too difficultNo gimmicks, guidebooks neededCons:Dragons and demons missionsToo many indoor missionsFighting was pretty lameCamera angle is bad in tight spacesDifficulty Level: Easy/MediumFrustration Level: LowHours to Complete (100% of all episodes, all endings): 20 hours","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2003"}

Unfortunately, the quality of the larger trackballs made today is terrible (I went through four in five months!) - so I've been using mice again. This \"gaming\" mouse is perfect for graphics, touchup, etc. Why? The on-the-fly resolution. Pressing a button allows me to change the on-screen accuracy for pixel perfect editing.The ability to record macros is also a big bonus. I could create custom actions in Photoshop, but when I'm doing batch editing, I'd love the ability to create one-key macros. I could define hot-keys, but Photoshop already uses the bulk of them.  Now it's just a mouse-button away! Click - contrast, saturation, sharpness adjusted. Click - specific filter is run. Makes my editing easier and fast!Other notable points: Uses a rechargeable AA battery, so when the battery eventually dies, you can replace it! Very smooth operation - it glides across my desk. The wheel can be adjusted so it ratchets/clicks or not. LED's on the side of the mouse indicate the current profile - I would prefer a number. You have five profiles and three lights, but once you learn the \"code\" it's pretty easy. Battery life is long, and you can go wired or wireless. When wired, it also charges the battery. The scroll wheel has a nice ribbed rubber surface, and the sides of the mouse has a slight texture.  There's also a power switch on the bottom, and a storage compartment next to the battery (under the door) for the transmitter.There's no software with the mouse, and only minimal instructions - you need to visit the Logitech website to download the driver and configuration software (free.)

{"product_name":"B00420K18K","description":"","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"Still the leader for MLB games","reviewText":"You expect a certain number of minor tweaks each year to annual sports games and MLB 12 does not disappoint with reportedly over 1000 new animations including player reactions to the on-field action.  There are improvements in lighting, stadiums, sound...all of which add up to making this a better looking and sounding game.  But Sony did not stop there.  The biggest change is the new overhauled pitching system which they are calling pulse pitching. Gone is the usual pitching meter of past years and in its place is a pulsating circle grows and shrinks in the strike box. Time your pitches when the circle is at its smallest for the best accuracy and power.  The size of the circle changes depending on the type of pitch that is thrown.  Obviously pitchers with good control will be more apt to hit their target and fastballs will be more accurate than breaking balls.  It helps to make the entire pitching system easier without sacrificing true realism.On top of that there are major changes to the games physics in almost every way...from the way a ball pops off of a bat, to the way it bounces on the ground, to the way it careens off of an object it may hit like a base or a fielder.  The ball reacts in a much more realistic way.  This means a bit more unpredictability when it comes to fielding.  You're more likely to see bad bounces than you have in the past.  The batting system is also refined and gives you more control in the strike zone.  Timing is everything when it comes to both the new pitching and batting systems.Football games seem to be generally considered the most complex simulations, especially when it comes to all the things you can do in Franchise-style modes but MLB 12 might just have any football game beat with its sheer number of options.  MBL 12's Franchise  mode puts you in charge of all the operations although you can turn on or off what you want to do for as much or as little detail as you want.  If you're not interested in drafting then simply let the AI handle it for you.  Road to the Show returns as MLB: The Show's career mode and has been beefed up to include more training options for hitting, fielding, and base-running.  You'll begin your career as a top prospect at a Double A affiliate.  Work on your game and you might just get that call up to the big league roster.A new mode this year is called Diamond Dynasty.  This is basically an Ultimate Team mode similar to many of EA Sports' games.  Utilizing virtual baseball cards, you build a team using both real and fictional players.  You can compete against both CPU-controlled teams as well as other players online and even make trades for other player cards.MLB The Show has always excelled in its beautiful, broadcast style presentations.  The game utilizes numerous cameras during the game, just like an actual network.  These give you the perspective of seeing the game from various vantage points as well as through the reactions of the players in the field and in the dugout.  These are done in a very professional, fluid style and you can easily find yourself believing you are watching an actual TV broadcast.  The announce team of Matt Vasgersian, Dave Campbell, and Eric Karros are solid and knowledgeable.  They are often quite conversational (an important trait with baseball announcers) although a bit on the dry side.The usual adage is that if it isn't broke, don't fix it.  MLB The Show was not broken but Sony did not rest on its laurels.  They took the risky chance to improve major aspects of the game and frankly they succeeded.  There are some quirks and baseball games by nature take some getting used to and have a higher learning curve than other sports games but MLB 12: The Show shows why it can always be summer with a great game that has a ton of options, a beautiful presentation, and remarkable realism.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

Great attention to detail, interactive objects, ability to get almost anywhere, and great recreation of Chicago.-Great selection of fake cars (most are modeled after real cars and easily identified) which range from small and slow cars to large and powerful. Motorcycles and trucks are included.-Story has a good pace and interesting plot turns and twists. Nothing earth shattering, but it's a good story from start to finish.-Hacking side of game gives some interesting opportunities to Watch Dogs that other open world games lack.-Almost every mission gives you the option to go with stealth or go in guns blazing. I like the option instead of being forced into one or the other. Tip: For those looking to breeze through the game, you can beat most missions guns blazing much faster than stealth.The Bad:-Missions early on force you to get a taste of online hacking. Whether you suceed or not makes no difference, but for people who have no interest in it, c'est la vie. I am not sure what would happen if you are playing offline. You have the option to set your game so the online hacking option is off, and people will not be able to intrude. I left it on and I only had 2-3 incidents where people hacked my game while I was away from the game. In the end, you don't lose anything except a little online experience.-My biggest gripe: No jump (you can vault and climb), no melee (you can take down people, but you can't just hit a random person).-Side missions are fun, but can be very repetitive.-Aiden's voice (main character) is laughably bad... think Dark Knight Batman bad.Overall, this game is a lot of fun. I would recommend buying it. I don't regret buying it at full price, but would say it would be a great value at the $40 range or below. I know a lot of people are mentioning GTA V here as the comparison, but it's closer to Assassin's Creed in controls/missions than GTA V. I think, as far as controls/fun goes, if you are looking for open world awesomeness, I would recommend going with Street Dogs.

The change is a simple one, but basic. It has to do with the notoriety system. Once your notoriety gets in the red all the guards will attack you on sight. In the second and third (second and a half?) game when you become conspicuous you have to bribe heralds, kill informers, or tear down wanted posters to remove your notoriety. In the first one you just had to hide until they went away. They understood the idea that people don't want the guards to be permanently after them. This game has forgotten that. They removed the wanted posters and made the other two rarer. Which means that when you become notorious it is extremely difficult to lose it since you'll have to do a lot of traveling and the guards will attack you on sight, increasing the notoriety that you were trying to lose.Far worse than that though, is what they do to punish you for becoming notorious in the first place. When you get spotted after becoming notorious the Templars attack one of your bases. When this happens you lose access to every shop and convenience connected with that Den. Aggravating doesn't begin to cover it. Anyone who's ever played the game knows how easy it is to become notorious. Now whenever that happens you have to play a silly game where you defend your base. It's all based on where you position your troops and it is a pain in the butt. I find it so aggravating that I simply let the Templars win and then kill the den leader to take back the place. That makes you notorious of course so then you have to try real hard to lose notoriety without being seen or else your nice new base is gone again. The best way around this is to simply never capture the darn things. You're only going to lose them again anyway so what's the point? Of course, if you don't capture the bases you can't recruit assassins, and once your Assassins reach Level 15 they keep the base safe for you. After you get them up that high the game suddenly becomes fun again. Of course, after you've spent all that time leveling your guys up you're probably all but done with the game already. I spent an entire day leveling my guys up and remaining incognito. Not how I wanted to play it.Essentially what Ubisoft has done is decided that there is only one correct way to play their game and added new features to force you to play it their way. Gone is the option to simply run around the place killing people like an angel of death. On a platforming game like this where the whole selling point is the ability to run through and over the city such a limitation is intolerable. Running across rooftops is half the fun of the game but you always get spotted sooner or later. Now they want you to be low key and sneak your way everywhere. Maybe that's in keeping with the story but it isn't how I want to play and I strongly suspect I'm not alone in that. A game like this needs to appeal to as many types of gamers as it can. Limiting it now is a mistake, and one I hope they will correct in future games. If they don't they've lost a customer. C'mon guys, it's a really easy fix.Other than that the game is fine. It's not as good as the other ones since Ezio has no personal connection with what's happening. The enemies are Byzantine Templars trying to take their city back from the Turks. Ezio doesn't know anyone there. I had thought the game would be set earlier since Leonardo was in Istanbul in the early 1500s and that would be a perfect time to stick Ezio there. But they wanted him old. And while his age is a nice touch and provides most of the interest from a character perspective it should not come at the cost of losing the other characters. Ezio spends a great deal of time writing letters to his sister, which is the closest thing this game comes to a personal touch. Of course, there's also the romantic interest who isn't bad but she doesn't make up for losing his whole family.Speaking of character design, the characters have had an overhaul. All of the faces have changed which is kind of disconcerting. It seems like that would be something to save for the next game when they no longer have Ezio. Still, they don't look that bad apart from the strange fact that Ezio's eyes glow in the dark. Also changed are the controls. Long distance weapons have now been separated from short range ones and use the triangle button. It takes a little getting used to but I think that overall it's an improvement. Eagle Vision has become Eagle Sight which is now accessed by pressing the L3 button (ie: pushing in on the D-Pad). It's a little hard to get used to but once you get the hang of it it works fine. Eagle sight itself is pretty useless though. It no longer spots the targets instantly, you have to keep pointing at them for several seconds which is a nuisance.Some of the new enemies are a real pain. The jannisaries are all but impossible to kill. You can attack them all you want and you'll never hit them. Kick and grab don't work on them which means that the only thing you can use is counter attack. Even there it isn't an instant kill, but takes 4-5 goes to take them out. They're also able to easily outrun you, although they can't climb like you can. I appreciate having harder enemies but I don't really like how this system works. Having to wait until they attack you just takes too long. Sometimes they just stand there, and you stand there, and they don't move, and you don't move, and it just gets really boring. Perhaps if some other attacks worked or if they were more aggressive it would work better. Like I said, not a bad idea but one that needs a little tweaking. In a lot of ways this game feels like a test for the next one. They're seeing what works so that they can make that one great. Otherwise I don't understand the reason for all these little changes.Some new things have been added. Specifically bombs and the hook blade. The hook blade is awesome and makes for a lot of fun swinging across Constantinople. My new favorite hobby is tripping pedestrians up as I go past. One of the things that I really appreciated was that they didn't force you to start off at level one and learn everything all over again. As soon as you hit Istanbul you can use the hook blade to jump while climbing and you start off able to use all your weapons. While your health still starts off pretty low that's only to be expected. The other addition is the bomb crafting system. I can personally take it or leave it. It doesn't matter to me. I never use the things, but I can see how other people would. In exchange for this we have to give up horses. Which sucks. I don't think it's a fair trade. I loved going everywhere on horseback, but I appreciate that Constantinople isn't designed for that as well as Rome. The streets are just too narrow.Constantinople is beautiful. As expected the design team has really excelled itself. I was surprised how much I missed having the snarky British guy narrate the locations for me but the descriptions are just as snide as ever. The design for the controls has been very simplified. The health bar is now just a series of lines instead of that plus an animated wavy line. I suppose this is meant to indicate the damaged nature of Desmond's mind, or the simplified state of the Animus. Either way I'll be glad when the old one comes back. The load screen looks much the same but you can now play demos during it which teach you the various moves. Not a bad idea.So there you are. If you like sneaking around and never breaking cover then none of these problems will really bother you. If you don't then Ubisoft will make you comply. I know that everyone likes to play differently so this problem won't matter to a fair number of people but it will matter to enough that I hope Ubisoft takes note. The rest of the game is pretty good but I really found myself forcing my way through it instead of eagerly awaiting the chance to play it. If you've never played an Assassin's Creed game then I'd strongly recommend eitherAssassin's Creed IIorAssassin's Creed: Brotherhood.Assassin's Creedis good too, but they fixed a lot of the problems from that one in the later games. I'd recommend all of those games over this one. I never thought Ubisoft would let me down. A real disappointment.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000HCL5QO","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Fun for All Ages","reviewText":"Viva Pinata is a sandbox style game where you raise innocent pinata-style creatures and plant grass, flowers, food, and other items to decorate their world.You start very simply. You have a fairly small patch of run-down soil, filled with weeds and junk. You have a broken-down shovel and have to destroy the junk and turn the soil. Over time you build up your skill set. You can plant the land with a grassy meadow. You can start adding in flowers and food items. You can build structures.As you do these things, you draw a variety of creatures into your garden. Each creature type is given a cute name and an even cuter look. There are worms and birds, deer and moths, and everything in between. Each type of creature has its own needs and desires. As they become a part of your world, you can name them and create an environment that makes them happy.This then leads to some tough decisions. Here you are, happily caring for your worm family who you have named and raised through generations. Along comes a bird. The requirement for EACH bird is that they eat a worm before they'll have a baby bird! So now you're having to sacrifice your beloved children to your new pets. It's certainly the circle of life - but it's also a bit sad.The game goes through busy and slow times, just like real life. So sometimes you're frantically trying to keep up with all the requests coming in, and then when everyone (or mostly everyone!) tucks in for sleep at night you can finally take a deep breath and have a snack while the moon drifts past.The game is great for all ages. Young kids can learn the value of managing resources and keeping track of \"virtual pets\" with needs. Older adults are also drawn into the logical challenges presented.Clearly this is a \"raising a world\" type of sim, so it might not appeal to those craving bloody shooters or fast car chases. But for those who do enjoy world-building style games, I recommend giving Viva Pinata a try. Just don't get too attached to those cute little worms.Rating: 5/5I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Gaming Fan xbox","summary":"Broken, Boring, & Unoriginal.","reviewText":"This is one of the worst purchases I've made ever for a game. SP is so short I beat it in under 4 hours. The later chapters feature major slowdown which is horrible especially for a game that looks like it could of been released in 2005. The only fun part of the single player campaign is the goliath. Other than that it's as generic as you can get. It's more generic than Medal of Honor (2010) release. I wonder how much they payed the writer because if I was THQ I would ask for my money back. I mainly bought the game for multiplayer and that's been a HUGE disappointment. Servers were not working at all. When I finally got to play a few rounds that matches last less than 5 minutes for Ground Control. Death Match is filled with snipers who can kill with one shot across the map. The game also suffers from major lag. This is the first game I've played on dedicated servers and it runs worse than Black Ops which is peer 2 peer. I can't believe this game was released for 60 dollars and like a lot of people here I ended up buying it the release date and got shafted by the price drop. I will never buy another game from KAOS studios.UPDATE - I have been reading reports that a lot of people are experiencing a major bug that will freeze your game at the splash screen due to the Battlecode they inputed. This renders your 50 dollar plus purchase useless and they still haven't put out a patch for this. Way to go THQ. Not only have you not fixed your server issues (half of the time it logs me out in the middle of a match and won't let me log back in), you have created a bug that renders the game unplayable to the purchaser. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise so they won't have to experience this horrible game. My advice to anyone looking to pick this up don't. Rent it if you must, but don't reward these fools with your money. Beta testing THQ. It could of gone a long way to making this a better product.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2011"}

There's still plenty of moments to laugh at, especially if you've played the PS2 prequel Up Your Arsenal, but is perfectly enjoyable stand-alone. The world is complex and intricate while still being chock-full of things to chuckle at.Story: 8/10The effects are all superb and they definitely take advantage of the PS3's ability to animate movement and complexity, but like many newer PS3 games it contains a few too many instances of the \"shiny surfaces\" for my tastes. Most won't have a problem, with billowing explosions and rippling water helping show development of general effects. Some textures are surprisingly advanced - you can see metal grain on Clank and fur on Ratchet, even during normal gameplay - Ratchet will even look over his shoulder to talk to Clank, while you're starting on the next stretch of combat platforming. There are even details like Drophyds quivering in fear when blown out of their power armor, and the \"halographic\" perspective-illusions in Apogee Space Station.Graphics: 7.8/10The sound effects are expansive and appropriate - funny when it needs to be, rumbling and ominous when it isn't. The balance is excellent, and the ability to independently alter speech, effect, and music volume is always a welcome option.Sound: 7.8/10Quirky and effective, I don't think there was a single moment in the game where the music didn't help the setting.Music: 7.5/10Insomniac has a well-earned reputation for quality, and this game delivers both intricate (yet not aggravating) 3D platforming, action with a variety of interesting weapons, and a slight RPG cant with the ability to upgrade specific facets of your weaponry and add interesting sub-effects. Not quite as thorough as Deadlocked, but very expansive. The story and puzzles do a good job of drawing you forward without seeming obligatory.Gameplay: 8.4/10Like the rest of the series, every bolt, weapon, upgrade and item you've earned in previous play-throughs remains with you as you journey back through the game. No bonus chapters unlock, but keeping the money and guns makes it much easier to reach those well-guarded or out-of-the-way nooks and helps unlock the rather plentiful extras.Replayability: 8.5/10The ending clearly transitions into a two-part saga completed with \"A Crack in Time\", but this easily stands on its own. Playing through this is likely helpful if you're planning on moving on to that, but Tools of Destruction delivers an enjoyable experience through Insomiac's brand of humor and platforming that almost everybody will find things to enjoy.Overall: 8.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"Best COD to date.","reviewText":"This game plays and feels better than any of the past games to date. I really cant see why its getting all of these negative reviews. In past games I usually have between a 1.40 and 1.50 kill death ratio and Im averaging about the same on this and sometimes a little better.Graphics : The graphics have definately been upgraded from the last Black Ops game. Everything seems really crisp and clean. There is also more popping color in BLOPS 2. They have also upgraded the particle effect as well. The graphics dont look like Modern Warfare 3 graphics but treyarch games have never looked like the Infinity Ward games anyway. Personally I like the Treyarch graphics better. Now Im sure your experience will vary depending on what type of TV you are playing on and also if you are connected with an HDMI cable or not. To me it looks spectacular.Controls : This game seems to control smooth as butter. All COD games have had excellent control but this for some reason I cant explain just feels so much better. I had to turn my sensitivity up a little because the default settings were a little slow for me , but once I found the right setting for me everything fell into place.Gameplay : As always they have delivered an excellent and compelling campaign experience. With twists and turns you wont expect this game really delivers. There are also like in most COD games driving missions to break up all of the shooting and throw something fresh at you. There is one mission that is unlike anything I have played in a COD game. You will be riding a HORSE and running and gunning from the HORSE. I thought this was a very fun , funny and refreshing addition to the game. If you pay attention to the game , watch the cut scenes ( and not skip them ) you will find this game has an excellent story to tell and one that will make you want to visit it again and again.Multiplayer : To some people this is all that COD games are about. Some never even attempt the campaign like some friends I have that only live for the multiplayer. I really enjoy the campaigns and I also really enjoy getting together with friends and having a blast on multiplayer. This game ( in my opinion ) is the most balanced game in the series. Every one has a fair shot. If you were good at multiplayer in past games you should be in this as well. Also people that didnt do so well in past games are doing better in this one. The maps are very well made. Even though you will ALWAYS have campers in EVERY COD game Treyarch has actually attemted to deter this unlike all past games. If someone does try to camp in a building , hallway or anywhere else there is always more than one way to get to that camper and take them out. Even if someone tries to camp a room with one door way there is always a window and always a way to get through it. So if you are the camping type sitting in one spot after you kill someone is a BAD idea. There is not a negative thing I can think of about this multiplayer. I believe most of these negative reviews are nothing but people that kept a high kill / death ratio in past games but cant quite match their past Success in other games. I am not a camper but I do take my time rounding a corner , entering a room and am careful when running into the open. Play thoughtful and methodical and you will do well in this game. But that is the way I have played in all COD games and it works in every one.Zombies : Im not going to get into this one except to say it is just as awesome as I expected. I have lots of friends on my friends list so when we go into a zombie match I alsready know everyone and we work together and communicate well and that is defenatly the key to Success in this mode. I have really enjoyed the new modes in zombies and will continue to. Our favorite so far is grief. 2 teams 4 on each against the zombie hoards. last team standing wins. Brilliant and tons of fun.This game has unfairly gotten some bad reviews and I really believe the ones leaving these nasty reviews are the fan boys of either Modern Warfare 3 or either Halo 4 , because if you notice that after most all bad reviews they will mention Modern warfare 3 or Halo 4. Most likely if you liked the first Black Ops and World at war as I did you will really like this game. So dont listen to all the negative junk people are posting , get the game and make your own mind up. Like I said before If you liked the previous games I mentioned there is a great chance you will love this one as well.

This seems to be on so many people's list as one of their favorite games of the year, and after getting it I understand.  I am not sure if even reading the reviews can prepare you for what is Grand Theft Auto 3.  But I will try and give you my feelings and opinions towards the game.The game is incredible!  The sheer magnitude of the game is almost over-whelming.  The game consists of three different islands on which you unleash all heck.  Your character is a thug, plain and simple.  At the beginning of the game you escape from a police wagon (with some help of course), and after that you meet people who need some jobs done for them.  The variety of the missions will keep you guessing and wanting to see what the next mission could be.  It could be something as simple as picking someone up and taking them somewhere, or it could be as complex as helping someone to blow up a tanker.  There is just so much variety in the jobs that you do.  The variety of automobiles is also quite impressive.  You can yank someone out of any car you want.  The car's handle as you would expect them to handle.  For example, a SUV can drive off-road just fine, but cannot take a corner at high speed without lifting up on one side.  And just testing out all the vehicles you find is part of the fun.  You can see which vehicle best suites you.  Personally I like the fast cars that can take a turn.I am not sure if there is any game I can think of that can prepare you for GTA3.  It's one of a kind, at least for now.  There is just so much you can do in this game.  Listen to different radio stations in you car, pick up ladies (the kind you have to pay), jump over buildings, ride the monorail, equip your car with a bomb, get chased by the police, and I could keep going on.  There really is just so much to do.This game however is not for the young.  It comes with a \"M\" rating for good reason.  There is an ultra amount of violence, and bad language please keep this game away from the kiddies.  But for those of you that are old enough to play, I strongly suggest giving this game a chance.  Again, I probably didn't really state much that wasn't already stated by others, I am just another one that strongly recommends this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2002"}

Fig.","summary":"Every RPG Game Should Be Like This.","reviewText":"A few things about my gaming style before I go on with my review. First, I like FPS, action, TPS/view and some fighting games. I always despise RPG turn-based games, ever since a friend let me borrow a final fantasy game, which quite honestly, now that I think about it, didn't give a chance to. Anyway, that's my gaming taste, but........then I bought Mario & Luigi Browser's Inside Story and my ENTIRE perspective of RPG has been changed and for good. This game has managed to change my mind, in fact, after playing it, I went around looking for other RPG games, including Final Fantasy! Of course, I also ended up buying Mario & Luigi Partners in time.Now, the game....like I said before, I never liked turn-based games, I'm a button smasher, but the minute I started playing this game, I was hooked, I could not put it down. The story, the controls, the graphics (used on a 3DS),the sound, the entire package is well done and balanced.The story begins at the castle, of course, there's an attack, Peach is taken, oh Peach, she's hopeless...moving on...this dark power takes over...So througout the story, you'll be placed in the shoes...claws of Bowser, who is freaking hilarious, playing as him is a unique experience that everybody should go through. Later one you will be in the shoes of Mario & Luigi, most of the time it will be Mario, but during segments of the game, you will also play as Luigi, never the less, the entire experience makes this one of the best, most fun games I've played in a very long time. You will swap between Bowser and the Bros for combined actions and will also get power ups in the form of Bowser's spike bracelet, Marios shoes, amongst others.... I can't go into any more detail without spoiling the experience. So you'll have to find out for yourself.There's no voice, well, there is, but only from Mario & Luigi, but is jiberish Italian, which is some of the funiest I've seen. Anyway, the entire game is done with captions, gestures. The music, is on par with everything that happens in the game, it's not theatrical material, but it is decent and doesn't overwhelm the FX sounds of the game, plus, it isn't cheesy, at all. A big plus for me.I played all my DS games on a 3DS and the quality of this one is not different. It looks colourful, sharp, perfect. I have nothing to complaint about the graphics. Each pixel has been done according to the game's formula we've all come to love over the years. You will be right at home.Controls:Consider this, I am absolutely NEW at RPGs. And this game was as easy as it could be for a newbie like me. Every single input translated into an accurate output. I did not notice a single problem, none whatsoever. The entire experience was a smooth, pleasant ride; there isn't ackward button lay-outs or combos. At instances, you will have to use the stylus, but doing so, was easy, quick and problem free. Like I said, this is a well balanced game. You will also need to use the DS/3DS microphone and the ocational vertical viewing, but again, both are smooth and easy to use.So, if you are an RPG gamer and like Mario franchise, then this is \"the\" package for you; a fun, exciting story, tight controls and good graphics, plus tons of humor. If you are new, like me, trust me when I say this. You will love this game. For me it was like opening the Pandora's Box of RPG. It gave me a new perspective about the gaming style and also set the standard, at least for me, that every RPG game should be like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2012"}

I know it's not fair to review this now b/c this game has been out for a while now compared to GT5. This game is really fun. Very well made and really nice graphics. Just not as nice as GT5 and not as deep either, as GT5 has many different license tests and driving challenges in addition to various races. However, I did like the car damage aspect for Forza which is missing in GT5. Also, I won this game with a controller, as a driving wheel is not completely necessary.

I also recommend downloading as many of the DLCs as possible for each game - for ME3 it is a must; especially the Extended Cut, which expands upon the ending and brings a bit more clarity to consequences of your final choices.

{"product_name":"B0050SWYTC","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Mercenary isn't quite the cinematic experience as other games, but the best shooter on Vita","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visual feat, gun play transitions well from the PS3, fun multiplayer, brutal melee kills, the Valor system and drones are awesomeThe Bad: Short campaign, story is lacking, small multiplayer suite, lacks the epicness of the PS3 games, campaign feels very linear and claustrophobicThe PS Vita has been really struggling with great games lately and with the dual analog sticks everyone has been chomping at the bit for a good FPS. Resistance: Burning Skies was decent, but nowhere near the quality of the console games. Along came Black Ops II which could have been an amazing experience, but instead was a literally unfinished game and has been deemed the worst Vita game ever made. Now that Killzone has come along we finally have the great portable FPS experience we have all been wanting. While it's not exactly up to par with the PS3 Killzone games, it's still a great game.Killzone has never been famous for its story, but the whole universe of Killzone is interesting itself. You play a mercenary working for both the ISA and Helghast -- you basically want the war to go on longer for more money. The story picks up right after Killzone 3, but this isn't a direct sequel to the events between the warring nations. The game also plays a little differently from other Killzone games. It feels a bit faster, yet still has the heavy feeling weapons and gun play fans have grown to love. The game is definitely optimized for portable play and for the Vita. You switch weapons with the touch screen (one secondary and primary) as well as using grenades and your drone. The controls are actually cleverly laid out utilizing the entire system without compromising comfort.Weapons aren't picked up via enemies this time around -- you get access to a black market where you buy them and equip them. You earn cash by picking up ammo, stealth kills, melee kills, multiple kills, or any other way you can think of. This is a brand new feature to the series and it works well. The only thing about the weapons that I was disappointed about was that they are the same ones we've seen through the entire series and there aren't that many of them. Even so, the campaign levels are very linear and mostly in enclosed areas so you will stick with a shotgun and a sub-machine gun most of the time. Speaking of the campaign, there are only 9 short levels. While they are fun, they aren't anything special and lack the epic set pieces of the console games. However, most people are going to pick this game up for the multiplayer suite.Mercenary has a brand new Valor system that uses decks of cards. You rank up and earn new cards by doing things in the game -- most will be earned in multiplayer. This is to extend the longevity of the game and to keep you coming back. The online play is a bit more fast paced than the PS3 games and is a lot of fun. This is really feels like a console game in your hands. It's so satisfying to sneak up behind someone and execute a brutal melee kill or start getting a kill streak going. Be warned -- there is a lack of modes and maps here. I hope more are introduced through DLC, but what's here is fun for quick bursts of online shooting action. Another new system introduced are drones. These are weapons that can launch missiles down on enemies, put up shields, make you invisible, or even be used as a mobile auto-turret. This adds a whole new level to the series and is a lot of fun.The graphics in Mercenary are phenomenal. The best portable graphics to ever grace a handheld device. They look nearly as good as the PS3 games. There is so much detail everywhere it's nearly impossible to imagine how the Vita can render this or have this much power. Thankfully the frame rate keeps up with the action which could have seriously hampered the game. As it stands, Killzone is the best portable FPS game out there, but isn't the best Killzone game. It could have been a lot more with more time, but what we get is a decent package with an entertaining, yet short, campaign and a fun multiplayer mode.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"R.

I didn't notice any dead zones but I don't play shooters.  Works well on rpgs like Dragon Ages and Kingdoms of Amalur.  Its too bad as most other 3rd party controllers don't have the start and select buttons like this one does.

The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

After playing through the game the first time, I started a new game right away to try out some different choices and a different character class. I am currently so excited about playing the 3rd part that I want to build a time machine to get to March of 2012.This is a phenomenal game. Fun firefights, great backstories for the characters, amazing graphics, and the DLC is amazing, too. I would definitely recommend getting The Lair of the Shadow Broker since it's worth the money AND has some pivotal events for the next game.Anyway, there are some great reviews below.

Bakehorn","summary":"It's Yoshi how you've never seen him before","reviewText":"I hope that Nintendo realizes more and more by the day how important it is to have excellent first-party input on their DS console. Their latest release for the silver, dual-screened console, Yoshi Touch & Go, is a good game that could have been great, had it not been for a few key flaws.Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go, a &#8220;sequel&#8221; or &#8220;side-story&#8221; from Yoshi&#8217;s Island, is a very unique title indeed. The gameplay premise is to use only the DS&#8217; touch screen and microphone to control Baby Mario and Yoshi as they trek through Yoshi&#8217;s Island. &#8220;Controlling&#8221; Yoshi and Baby Mario is only &#8220;controlling&#8221; by definition; you actually use the stylus and touch screen to control their movement.There are two different &#8220;parts&#8221; to the game, each focusing on controlling a different character. The game begins with Baby Mario falling from the sky, and it is your job to make sure he avoids enemies and collects coins by drawing clouds in the sky with your stylus. You can also &#8220;capture&#8221; enemies and fling them at Mario to get points. Once you&#8217;ve lofted all the way down to the bottom of the level, Mario falls onto Yoshi&#8217;s back. How convenient. This second part has you shooting eggs, drawing cloud &#8220;bridges&#8221;, and capturing enemies in order to direct Yoshi and Baby Mario to the end of the level, or as far as you can. Though this part of the game has a more frenzied pace, it is slightly slower and less cluttered than Baby Mario&#8217;s free-falling portions.Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go is a novel concept. Fans of the novelty will enjoy the game, while others might not like it so much. I was slightly disappointed with a few things, but for the most part, I loved the gameplay. Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go uses the DS&#8217; capabilities extremely well. Drawing clouds and capturing enemies is simple (that is, if you know how to hold a pen and use it), and blowing into the microphone to &#8220;blow away&#8221; unnecessary clouds is very helpful at times. There are a few cool tricks you can play on the game, like drawing a cloud &#8220;wall&#8221; to stop Yoshi&#8217;s progress or encircling a huge group of enemies and coins to get more points. However, points seem to be the only motivating factor to play. Like an old arcade game, Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;levels&#8221; per se, but instead has the same repeated level with a few twists each time to test your skill.This is the most disappointing thing about Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go. Memorization of the levels quickly becomes the key to getting a lot of points. While your skill will indeed increase over time, basically remembering coin locations and enemies will have the biggest effect on your outcome. Fortunately, there are four different gameplay modes that have a slightly different goal each time you play. The gameplay mode I&#8217;ve basically already described is Score Attack, which is the first mode you have when you boot up the game. Marathon, which is essentially as its name implies, is a test to see how far (in yards) you can make Baby Mario and Yoshi travel without dying.Once you&#8217;ve earned top scores on these modes, Time Attack and Challenge are unlocked. Time Attack was my least favorite mode, where you are prompted to get Baby Mario on the ground as quickly as possible, and rush Yoshi to the end of the course as quickly as possible. The major downfall with this is the fact that it obliterates any sort of pace and doesn&#8217;t allow you to take your time. Challenge mode is a mode where you have to keep collecting coins and killing enemies before the evil broom-riding Kamek arrives to steal Mario away. This sets the pace a little higher than Marathon and Score Attack while still allowing you to take your time and do what you want to do.The graphics are very similar to Yoshi&#8217;s Island, both in appearance and direction. The environments and characters look so cute and sweet that you could get a cavity just playing the game for too long. Unfortunately, none of the DS&#8217; graphical possibilities are pushed&#8212;there is no 3D involved, only 2D sprites. The music, while it fits the bill nicely, isn&#8217;t as infective as Yoshi&#8217;s Island&#8217;s music was back on the Super Nintendo. I would have loved to see some of those tunes revived for this game.Overall, Yoshi&#8217;s Touch & Go is a good game that DS fans should check out. While I don&#8217;t suggest it to everyone (especially anyone thinking this is a new platforming game - you&#8217;ve been warned) people looking for a new and innovative way to play their videogames will find enjoyment with Touch & Go.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"A. J. Herring \"Daemon\"","summary":"Fairly decent but ultimately repetitive.","reviewText":"I will start by saying this game is adult themed. Consider that before your purchase.The graphics are pretty wonderful. I liked the rendering and the artwork is pretty fun.The story is okay. It's not entirely believable, but it's okay.The gameplay is where the game shines. The shooting and the skill system work out well together and it all flows together very well.The biggest problems with the game are somewhat minor. I had one mission where I needed to infiltrate something. Well, the game lets you use a glider sometimes to get around the island and I am pretty good with it so I was thinking \"Man, I am going to infiltrate this boat from the sky. Screw diving in and climbing a ladder. I'll just drop in from the top and shoot people in the face.\" Yeah, well the developers apparently had a different idea. I got about 150 M from my drop and the game slammed my glider into the ocean. I was thinking, \"Well this might be a glitch or something.\" I reloaded the game and tried again from a different angle thinking perhaps I went in too hot or something. Nope... it just slammed me in the ocean again. I was pretty disappointed about that. I was really wanting to fulfill my \"drop from the sky\" plan.My bigger problem was just the sheer repetitiveness of the game sometimes. Find a radio tower. Climb it. Activate. Clear the outposts in the area you opened up. Rinse, wash, repeat 18 times for the radio tower and about 36 times for the little outposts. Also, while you're at it look for 120 relics that are a pain to get to most of the time, Rakyat trials that aren't all that exciting, 20 Japanese letters that give you all the rewards you will get after 6 (and the same goes for relics.. I haven't gotten anything since about 40)...Anyway, I'll stop there because I think you can get an idea of what I am talking about if I just say \"Wow, they took Assassin's Creed's formula for tedious searches and added guns!\" I am not the biggest fan of Assassin's Creed either. That game had a repetition problem too. It just smacks of a \"let's see how long we can drag this out.\" Either way it was worth the 20 bucks I dropped on this game. I would recommend it if you generally like shooter games with an open world feel to it. Some of the stealth stuff can be pretty fun too. I guess it will just depend on what you expect out of this game. I would recommend it for most people.Edit 6/30/2013I decided to try the multiplayer because I was bored. I still haven't tried the competitive stuff, but I am a bit disappointed with the co-op multiplayer. It has an experience system that lets you unlock things and I like this. What I don't like is the constant dropping, reconnecting and lost xp that occurs because of \"dropped connection due to lack of players\" or some other excuse. I've only been playing it for about 3 days off and on and I have had two instances of playing for 45 minutes to an hour and it dropping and losing everything. I didn't gain a single thing from it. One time it just started killing me off and dropping me through the floor. The word is buggy. The game is extremely buggy. Also, there is no way to filter who you play with really on multiplayer. If you want to play hard on a certain map you create the game yourself, but people will just get randomly put in there and their skill level may not be anywhere near what you want. You may have people that don't sit well with your style too. You want to sneak and kill people rather than have the hordes gun you down? Forget it. You've got a better chance in hell of getting cold. You're going to be paired with people that will only run in guns blazing. Oh, and the \"competitive mode\" is terrible. If you're not the host don't expect to win some of those. Also, they are time consuming and tedious.I'll just say the multiplayer gets 2/5 stars. I only give it an extra star because the game is still fun sometimes, but horribly offset by its many shortcomings.Edit 7/13/2013I want to further expand on the multiplayer experience a bit. I am now (well I should be) level 70. I gained that level in the last game I played. Am I actually level 70 right now? No, all my progress was lost again. I played through an entire 45-minute long map only to have the game bug at the very end where you get the encrypted data and it not actually \"close\" the game to save your stats. So I had to quit to even continue playing after waiting several minutes for it to *gasp* do what it should do. I am actually dropping my star rating of this game because of the multiplayer now. I did consider this game to be a 4-star experience. I can see they really did not put much effort after a certain point. This could have been one of the best games ever. It's still fun to play if you can get over the constant frustration this game will bring you.Let me cover a few other points of frustration:1. You will play with people who have no idea what they are doing. They will go in guns blazing. They will enable objectives that will spawn enemies right on top of you. They will not revive you when you are right next to them and they are essentially safe.2. You will lag to death. Count on it. The competitions will never be fair because host almost always has a strong advantage on the gun competitions. They have to suck bad to lose usually.3. If the host leaves, expect to restart at the last checkpoint. The game doesn't care if you spent 15 minutes in the area finishing it off.4. If everyone leaves and you're at the end of the game, expect to lose all of your progress. This game will not let you solo a co-op. You're just going to get over all that time you just put in. For that matter count on this to happen a lot.5. Expect to die randomly. I said it. You will be walking. You will die. It will come from nowhere. There will be no explanation. It will happen frequently and you will witness it happen to others. Your teammates can't revive you. You just get to watch. Enjoy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2013"}

It's chock-full of player-driven choices and exquisite cinematic cutscenes with a fairly decent story to boot.  Unfortunately, it's the story that has led me to give this game 4 stars rather than 5.You see, the story is entirely unoriginal.  The developers at Bioware clearly \"borrowed\" (almost to the point of downright stealing) storyline elements from Star Trek and Stargate.  All they basically did was create great characters with cool-sounding names and intricate personalities.  I mean, the whole mass effect relay system is just like the wormhole from Star Trek Deep Space 9 or the actual stargates in the Stargate series.  Also, the ENTIRE overarching plot with the Reapers is ALL based on the Borg from Star Trek (and don't deny that fact!).  \"Indoctrination\" is the same thing as \"assimilation\".  Sorry Bioware, but the idea behind that is completely copyrighted by Gene Roddenberry and Rick Berman!!!Aside from the storyline hiccup (which is a borderline burp), Mass Effect is great fun to play.  Make sure to play this game at least twice in its entirety (once using all Paragon choices, and the other playthrough using Renegade choices...just to see the difference in Shepard's character).As of this writing, I'm playing through Mass Effect 2.  So far, it's not as good as the original Mass Effect, and I'm not sure if I want to play Mass Effect 3.  From what I've heard, the ending to ME 3 is terrible.  Since that seems to be the general consensus, I'm going to forego buying and playing ME 3 (and I suggest you all do the same).  If you only play the first and second games, you should be fine.  In fact, if you can completely block out the \"Reapers are coming!\" possibility in the first game, that should be all you need.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2012"}

The Cover systems works well it also makes for a fun as well as a more realistic gameplay experience. While this system has its share of problems (its not as easy or streamline as Gears of War) it works well enough not to be a concern and bring something new to RPGs.- A well thought out and well played story that rivals or bests that of Elder Scrolls, Resident Evil or any Final Fantasy game. The story itself is it told through dialog between yours and other characters, because of the choices of make during the story it has a \"choose your own adventure\" feel to it.- Gorgeous graphics and nice animations, that look just as good as games like Half-Life 2: Episode 2 and Assassins Creed.- A great sound track that has the movie like quality of some of the great Sci-Fi Space movies from the past twenty years like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars, and Dune.BAD:- The learning curve is steep in this game and you will spend the first few hours learning how to play this game well. Although gamers who are use to playing First/Third Person Shooters (like Bioshock and Ghost Recon: Advance Warfighter) may find it easier to play (they should start the game on hard). Gamers who like playing turn based RPGs (like Final Fantasy X and Blue Dragon) will have a hard time adjusting (they should play the game on normal or easy).- Most side quest planets can be barren with little to do outside of the quest you came for and a scant few other item pickups scattered around, plus many structures/buildings you enter during these side missions are almost exactly the same.- The inventory system that you use keep track of items as well as equip items on your character is not very streamline and can be annoying due to the fact that there is no way to organize your inventory in any real order and keeping track of more then a few items becomes something of a chore.- This game has a more then a few loading sequences during gameplay that might upset impatient gamers.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- The story of the game is mostly told through dialogs between yourself and other characters in the game, it should really be noted that your choices in responding to questions asked of you and your reactions to events unfolding around you is going to change the story of the game and attitudes of others around you. It should also be noted that during the games story you can make choices that either make your character into a brash loose cannon who cheats, steals and shoots first asks questions later or a by the book fighter or justice and freedom with moral values and willing to sacrifice personal wants for the good of others.- A Sci-Fi RPG with lots of Third Person Shooter (Camera behind the player) elements. The games combat has quicker pacing then most RPGs like Final Fantasy XII or even Fable, although the over all combat is slower then more main stream First/Third Person Shooters like Halo or Lost Planet, the shooting aspect has an emphasis on shooting behind cover as well similar to games like Gears of War and Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2.- You start will all the gun types your ever going to get in the game (pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle) you can of course get newer versions of these guns and later even add mods to modify the effects and stats of each gun type. Although the effectiveness of each gun type is really depends on your skill with that gun type (you upgrade your gun skills at your stat screen), you can of course use guns you have no training for which will result in much less effectiveness of using that gun type, so it would be wise to always try to use guns types your character class can (will be able to) upgrade. Note: Solider class is proficient in all gun types (can upgraded in all gun types).- This game has lots of dialog/story, which plays a very big role in this game, which in turn will turn off gamers looking for fast paced action with little interruption.- No multiplayer or online gameplay.- Travel to many different worlds/solar systems through out the Milky Way galaxy (the galaxy you currently live in) with your own star ship the Normandy and its crew. During your missions you get to bring two of six other characters with you and these other characters (all six of them) can have their stats as well as equipment be chosen by you.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (Xbox/PC)- Ghost Recon Advance Warfighter 2 (360/PS3)- Jade Empire (Xbox/PC)- Gears of War (360/PC)- Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion (360/PS3/PC)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- To get all of this game's achievements your going to have to beat this game at least three time. You get an achievement for beating the game once as well as twice but to unlock the \"Insanity\" difficultly (which after beating the game on this difficultly you also get an achievement) your going to have to beat the game on Hard then Hardcore just to unlock that difficultly.- In the limited collector's edition you will find an art and background story book \"Galactic Codex\" as well as a bonus DVD with the videos \"The Making of Mass Effect\" documentary /music (from the game)/360 dashboard themes and it all comes in a tin case.- There is already a novel out called Mass Effect: Revelation, which has lots of background story for the game as well as the background for the characters you meet in the game Anderson and Saren.- There is talk from Bioware about downloadable content coming on the way for Mass Effect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2007"}

The advances Nintendo has made over its \"GameBoy Advanced\" are amazing. In fact, just the \"mini\" games in Super Mario 64 game has more entertainment value than almost any Gameboy Advanced Game. Another thing that is incredible is the size of the game... it is the size of a standard flash memory card, which makes Nintendo DS games about 75% smaller than those for GB Adv.Here are a run down of a few of my points.-  The touch screen incorporates very well into the games. In fact, you start to wonder,\"What did I do before a touch screen?\"-  The power of the DS is very similar to the Nintendo 64 - and in my opinion- you really don't need much more. Have games really improved all that much since the 64? The graphics may be a little better with the bigger machines... but game play has stayed about the same.- The ability to link wirelessly may be a double edged sword. While it will get rid of those burdensome wires (and allow for text/picture chatting)it may eventually get the DS banned on airplanes. The Feds are not big fans of having anything that transmits a signal on an airplane... so stay tuned.... because this may become a MAJOR drawback to the DS.- The text and picture chatting...

Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail.

He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy.

K. Malone","summary":"One of Miyamoto's few missteps","reviewText":"Normally, any game made by Shigeru Miyamoto would get a heartfelt and appreciative five stars from me. Pikmin is an exception, because Miyamoto broke one of his own rules of thumb when he designed it. That rule is: Let the player play at their own pace.Pikmin's core game play itself has the makings of a perfect game: Grow and harvest criminally cute little colorful carrot people and then use them to complete various tasks and chores in order to recover enough pieces of your damaged spacecraft until you can leave the alien planet you're stranded on. (i.e. Earth) The Pikmin come in three colors and each color has its own strengths and weaknesses. You must command your Pikmin to knock down obstacles, build bridges, defeat enemies, carry parts back to the ship, and grow more Pikmin. Quite a bit of strategy is necessary, or you'll fail. You have to set Pikmin to a task and leave them to it while you go and direct more Pikmin to do something else. This in itself could have been gaming nirvana. But then Miyamoto decided to take it a step further: You have only 30 \"days\" to complete the mission. (1 day in the game = approx. 15 minutes of actual playing time)While it's not all that difficult to finish the game before time's up, it does add an unwelcome sense of pressure and stress to what otherwise could have been a delightful and even relaxing game to play. The playfulness and sheer whimsy is overshadowed by a dark cloud of impending doom. When you could have been happily cheering your Pikmin on as they do your bidding, you may instead find yourself cursing at them. \"Faster, you little morons! Faster! No, not that way you idiots! THAT way! Damn you! Damn you all to Vegetable Hell!\"It was the time limit that prevented me from completing Pikmin back when it was released. (Not because I was unable to, but because I stopped playing because I didn't need the stress.) I've completed it recently, because I want to play Pikmin 2 (which has no time limit, thank God) with a clear conscience. One of my solutions to facing the 30 day challenge was to get into the habit of \"scouting.\" You can only save your progress at the end of each day. At the beginning of each new day, the first thing I would do is explore the level (alone, without any Pikmin tagging along) to look for ship pieces, take note of obstacles, enemies, and the general lay of the land. Once I'd formulated a plan to get that piece back to the ship, I'd reset the Gamecube and reload my save file so I could have the entire day (i.e. 15 minutes) to achieve my goal. On the best days, I was able to retrieve a whopping TWO ship pieces. In my opinion, Pikmin should have let you take as many days as you needed to complete the game, and they could have offered a \"Challenge Mode\" with a time limit to satisfy the more hardcore gamers out there. As it stands, I now admit that this -is- a fun and addictive game. However, it could have been so much better and I would have finished it when I originally bought it instead of years later. I'm grading it on a curve, a curve set by Miyamoto himself with games like Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Legend of Zelda- A Link to the Past, Super Mario 64, and LoZ- Ocarina of Time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2004"}

It has a very interesting setting, great aesthetic style and graphics, and an interesting story that will make you think.  It's almost as good as the original Deus Ex and is definitely a worth successor that captures the flavor of the original nicely.  The gameplay is enjoyable and it also has fantastic music.  I almost never finish games anymore, and I beat this one and completed almost every side quest, which should tell you something.  The one big downside is the AI is very lame about being able to find you.  You can hide under a desk or crawl in an air duct and they'll forget you're there, which is pretty immersion breaking.  But everything else is so good that I can overlook that.I recommend playing at the highest difficult level, but you may want to turn on the option that makes items you can interact with glow, which is what I did.  For added challenge and fun, I recommend trying to go through it non-lethal and (along with that) stealthy.  I went through the game pretty much murdering everyone in sight because I wanted to be able to hack every computer and read every email in peace in order to flesh out the world, but I would have enjoyed it more if I'd gone non-lethal/stealthy.  I'm actually considering replaying it, which I almost never do with any game.  I also ended up feeling pretty guilty about killing so many people (which should tell you what a good game it is!)  If you're worried about the bosses, just put a few praxis points in the typhoon and you can lolpwn them easily.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}

I know they are trying to fit the setting but still they should include a language toggle option.  But setting that aside, this game is sooo much fun!  There are many many hours of gameplay here, and that's just counting the 100+ missions for the storyline.  There are the usual taxi, firefighter, etc. levels to do as well if you are one of those who want 100% completion.  I love being able to modify the cars too and change them into hotrods.  I did find a bug though were I have lost a lot of cars in my garages around the city.  It didn't matter if I have one car or three in my garages, I still lost a number of them.

I followed it a lot during its development and everything they said about it sounded great.To me it is a decent game that I am sure a lot of people enjoy, it just feels super repetitive.  The quests are the usual fair, however you don't feel like you are running back and forth trying to complete the task and then turn it in.Basically on each map there are a number of different things for you to complete like helping people and discovering things.  The map does a fine job of showing you where you are, what there is to accomplish and what you have accomplished.  For a completionist I thought this would be great, though very early on in the game I realized it was getting repetitive.  I didn't feel like I was adventuring.  I felt like I was making checkmarks on the map to no great purpose.This coupled with the fact that I was not enjoying the way you control your character started to really make the game feel disjointed to me. It feels like action combat with a targeting system and it feels wrong.My preferences aside, you may very well enjoy this game.  Many people do.  It just does not fit my playstyle and I was not having fun.  I own it, there is no monthly charge and I don't even play it anymore.If nothing I said bothers you, you might like it.  I don't want to scare people away too much.  Its a nice looking game graphically.  The controls are probably great to some people and the questing is probably right up the alley of many.

Xenogears is a pure RPG classic.  However, I only recommend this to those who are in love with the RPG genre and also whom don't mind to read for long periods of time.  This brought a great gaming experience, but some times frustrating.  Often the mazes the characters were forced to find their way through brought on a lot of aggravation when there were a lot of random encounters.  By the time the battle was through one could almost have forgotten where they came from.The Pros: Excellent story with strong, believable characters.Beautifully done animated cutscenes with voice-oversFun battle system with learned combos and magic.Quite a lengthy game, (took me 63 hours to complete)A gorgeous musical score, (get the soundtrack too!)The Cons: Often times frustrating areas to explore.Graphics can be quite pixilatedThe battle sounds are quite repetitiveOverall, Xenogears is one of those hidden, \"treasures\" in my oppinion. However, if you are not an avid RPG player, young into the genre, and lack patience for lots of reading, Xenogears may not be the game for you.  Though the game is hard to find, (which may change, since it may soon become a Greatest Hit) Although if you can't wait, and believe your game collection is not complete with out it, (which is what I believe), run and get it now, it is worth a great cost.

Initial PS3 games that I'd played weren't particularly stunning, but now the titles are starting to justify the hardware.If I had to compare the PS3 to the XBox 360, I'd say the beauty of it is that it doesn't brick itself with a Red Ring of Death.  If I had to compare it to the Wii, I'd point out that it's far more of a media entertainment device.  And that above all, Sony's strict adherence to backwards compatibility has given it a strong advantage:  I can play Playstation 1 and 2 titles with ease and have yet to have one fail to work.  This means you still have access to a massive library of titles, and I find myself playing PS2 and PS1 games as much as the few I have for the PS3.The only bad things I've encountered so far are that the Sixaxis controller's \"tilt\" functionality (slightly similar to the Wii's ability to physically move the controller in the air to play a game) is very shaky:  it's difficult to control.  Also, the fans on the PS3 are extremely loud, and run constantly:  even playing a movie will create the roar of the unit trying to keep itself cool.

Dramatic lighting, shadows, and reflections heighten the realism, while subtle water effects animate puddles, ponds, and oceans with incredible detail.","reviewerName":"brutusmuktuk","summary":"Addictive and pretty to look at","reviewText":"Some may argue that Dead of Alive 3's only appeal is its wonderful character models. It's certainly true that Tecmo's lead developer on the project, Tomonobu Itagaki, had a fondness for his character, particularly the well-endowed female characters. He was so fond of them, in fact, he put them in a volleyball video game where they could strut their stuff in bikinis, while hopping up and down, no less. Perhaps it was to a disturbing degree that Itagaki admired these characters, but there's no denying his team did an excellent job of rendering them life-like. While the excellent visuals are one reason to enjoy DOA 3, beneath the eye candy is a fast and brutal game with an extraordinary fighting engine.With twelve well-balanced characters in its roster, with between 60 and 110 combos in their arsenal, this is a game one can spend a long time with, if you want to get to know each character. The sparring mode allows you to practice and memorize the moves of each character. This is a feature I wish more fighting games used, as it can be difficult to learn moves merely by fighting. Once you feel comfortable with a character, you can head off to the story mode, which doesn't have much of a story, and fight the computer AI on different difficulty levels. Or you can play with some friends on one of the many different modes (outlined below). The fighting moves lightning fast and there's never a hitch; throwing punches, kicks, and opponents has never looked so awesome. The game adds strategy in the form of counter attacks. Counter attacks help prevent one player from simply pounding another into submission by mashing the button, but there is also a level of guesswork in the counters to balance things out. To be successful at this game requires a little more thought than mashing your favorite combo.With the realistic looking characters comes excellent character animation. Each character's stance and attacks bring out their personality. Take Zach, for example; when he kicks, it's a quick and spastic kick, accompanied by a shout, to display a level of hyper energy. Christy, the assassin, also has quick jabs, but hers are focused on certain areas of the opponent. She has a deadly calmness about her. This is true for all of the rest of the characters, though some are certainly more interesting than others.The game also has plenty of game modes to choose from. I've mentioned the sparring mode, which is merely a place for practice. I've also mentioned the story mode, though I'd like to add that this is merely for single players, and its purpose is largely to unlock movies for each of the characters. The movies are well-done, for the most part, so this is worthwhile, though the story mode is essentially a bunch of randomly thrown together fights. The survival mode is a nice challenge, as you fight opponent after opponent and see how long you can last. Team attack allows you to create a team of fighters to face against your opponent's team of fighters, where your next fighter comes in when the current one's health dwindles to zero. The tag battle mode and vs. mode allow for one on one or two on two fighting action. This is a healthy amount of game modes, however there's not a whole lot of depth. DOA 3 does pale in comparison to some of the other fighters out there, such as Soul Caliber, but as an early Xbox game it was a rather fun diversion that sucked away a lot of time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

You work in a squad and are never really on your own. I can't say that this is scary at all and sort of goes against what a Resident Evil game should be.

Even on HARD (professional) it's not much of a challengeOnline multiplayer is fun because you and your team are tossed in some awesome Resident Evil maps fighting against another online team and there are zombies and other RE monsters everywhere. It makes for a challenging & fun online experience. I enjoyed the online aspect of this game more than the single player Champaign.This game will keep us RE fans busy for a few months while we patiently wait for Resident Evil 6, which will be amazing. If you didn't pre-order Raccoon City, then I would continue to wait until the price lowers as it is nothing amazing , but it is fun for the fans. There are some scenes which remind us of Resident Evil 2 & 3, but I feel they could have done a little better. Whether you're playing single or multi player you can choose from a variety of characters to play, each with different weapons and specialties, however there isn't as big of a difference between them as we may have wanted.

My first impression of this drum controller was the quality of the product. It's pretty sturdy and seems to be well built, not just cheap plastic. For the price, I wouldn't expect anything less. The initial setup takes a few minutes and I had to readjust a few times to get everything where I wanted it. I cranked up Guitar Hero and played a few sets before making a few more adjustments. One of the biggest things I noticed was how loud the drums are. However, I my living area is small, so I'm sure that doesn't help. Just keep in mind that you may need to increase the volume of your television to block out the physical sounds you are making on the drum controller. Not a huge deal for me, and as I stated might be because of my layout. I found the drum controllers to be fun to use, though I'm not very good as of yet. I had a few friends over to check it out, and they enjoyed playing them as well. I wish I had another type of drum controller to compare it to, but I don't. Therefore, I'm not sure how much better this unit is then the cheaper units available. I do wish they would have incorporated Bluetooth into the unit, but they require you to use a USB dongle. I think for the money it should have come with Bluetooth on the unit itself so you're not using a USB port. If you are a avid gamer and play the drums in games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band, I think you will find this set to be to your liking.

There was little variety in the campaign and overall it was quite boring.  I had fun driving the mech and the tank but those parts are short-lived. Adding to my boredom was the lack or variety in weapons, enemies, and scenery. My final bit of frustration was that the ending of the game is ridiculously hard. In fact, neither me or my wife could finish it. I suppose we could have completed it eventually but we were so sick of the game that we gave up and traded it in. I didn't try the online play but the campaign has little if any replay value. It does have outstanding graphics and tight play but those few things don't make it worth $55.

It was one of the reasons I bought a PS3 when my 360 red-ringed for the 2nd time.  But when I was playing it at home, it just wasn't as fun.  First, I have to commend the developer's for it's enemy AI--truly the best I've played against in any game.  They rush and outflank you if given the opportunity.  I've never died so much before in any fps on normal difficulty.  The graphics are also top notch, though not the best as some would have you believe.Now for the parts that annoyed me.  The lack of a story, or good story shall we say.  I usually don't care, but in a game that is set in similar locations throughout, it does get pretty monotonous, which leads me to my second gripe--all the environments look the same, as do the enemy.  When you are constantly fighting in drab war-torn buildings or cities that use the same colors and shoot at enemies with the two red eyes, it gets old.  In this regard, the game is very much like the original Fear, great AI but all too similar enemies and backdrop.  There is not one level that stands out in the game.  Another gripe I have is the sudden freezing in the game whenever it is loading from one setting to another. This is in-level loading, not the between level so you are walking and then it just freezes for up to 5-10 seconds sometimes.  The controls work well enough.  The cover system isn't as good as some other games, but does suffice. Some people complain about the weapons feeling heavy and slow, but I didn't have a problem with it.I wound up quitting at the very last level.  This is something I never do because you work your way through an entire game only to give up before the ending.  But the last level was so difficult and some of the deaths were cheap rpg hits that you don't even see coming.  The thing is, I never even got angry because I felt like I was playing a series of similar maps the entire game that I could care less how it ended.  I looked up a walk-through online to see the strategy and could probably pass it if I spent another hour or two on it, but the passion isn't there, and I don't care about trophies.I don't play multiplayer, but I've heard that it is the redeeming quality for this game.  In short, I would say if you liked Fear without bullet-time, you'll probably like this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Love Child of Assassins Creed II and Red Dead Redemption...","reviewText":"The first Assassins Creed frustrated me.  It was a new generation so you'd think the fancy graphics and new gameplay would have been fun, but having to walk around like a slow monk just to avoid detection did not excite me.  However, the massive improvements inAssassin's Creed IIwere enough to make me a super fan of the Assassins Creed series.  While both Brotherhood and Revelations did add some interesting things (training Assassins and the zip-line technique) they also made some side-steps that were boring (such as the tower defense and more Desmond sequences) so when I heard that the NEW Assassins Creed would have a new protagonist, I got really excited (like pretty much everyone else).Storyline:I'm not really into Desmond or the Animus or any of the back-drop behind the Assassins Creed series, I would have rather played through the Assassins Creed games without being forced out the experience by being forced to play as Desmond, I've never found these parts interesting nor their story-related-elements fascinating, I've played to be Ezio and would've preferred them to work their way up to a present day Assassins Creed game (where you play as Desmond).That being said, I really enjoy the setting and world set up by Assassins Creed III, admittedly it gets off to a slow start so you have to be prepared to stick with it even if it seems trivial or boring.  Once you're Conor and garbed in your Assassins robes, you'll know who you're fighting for and why.Graphics:The graphics in this game are AMAZING.  It looks as good as any other Assassins Creed game yet the details here are astounding.  The little touches in the frontier and the cities of New York and Boston look outstanding, really bringing life to the world of the game-which is the true star of this game.Sound:The sound in this game is part of what makes it really immerses you into the world of the game.  It's hard for games to stand out in this way because many of them have become so movie-like in their attempts at realism and immersion into the characters and setting.Gameplay:The control scheme for Assassins Creed has always been different (nick-named the \"Assassins Claw\") for instance when you play infamous you don't hold down the same button for running as you do for being attacking and that kind of thing, so your transition from playing Arkham City or inFamous 2 or Red Dead Redemption is gonna be a bit different.  The control scheme has even changed from previous entries in the Assassins Creed series.  There are a few glitches here and there that detract from the overall experience, and even a game stopping bug or two (not game breaking, mind you).  But sadly, that's par for course these days.  but when you leave this experience, it's the running through trees, the hunting, the tomahawk, the guns, the swords, the Cities, the Frontier, the Naval Battles that will stay with you fora  long time.  It reminds of you riding through the West as John Marstin, and running through the trees is as natural as running across the roofs of any Italian city.Conclusion:If you loved previous Assassins Creed games and/or are a fan of open-world/sandbox games, then by all means go out there and pick this one up immediately.  This game feels like a combination of Assassins Creed 2 and Red Dead Redemption and since those are two of my most favorite games, this game is near PERFECT in my book.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"Assassin's Creed 3 Angry game review.","reviewText":"WARNING: This review is being handled differently from my previous reviews in that there will not be an overall score and I won't be going into many of the overall game play and story. This will mostly just be a list of issues I've found with this game. This will probably piss some people off but this is based on my experience with the game. I'm not trying to discourage anyone from playing this game but if you know any of the things that I talk about in this note tend to piss you off, you might want to reconsider this game.So yeah, Assassin's Creed 3 is the game I have been looking forward to all year long. The trailers have been amazing; the setting of the American Revolution is rather original for a game like this, an interesting new character to the Assassin's Creed series, and a time in history most Americans should be familiar with. This game had so much potential. Also it's been getting near perfect scores from several game review magazines and sites. I have to ask, what game have they been playing? Because the AC3 I've been playing is not a perfect scoring or high scoring game. I was so sure this was going to be game of the year material for me and it makes me so sad that I cannot even recommend it for a top 5 slot for games of the year. For me, this game is just not very fun most of the time. It's been mostly frustrating and stress inducing. That's not why people play video games and if that's why you play games then maybe you're a masochist. Very rarely have I had fun with this game. There is a lot to it, I'll give it that. It is a very big game and it is impressive in that aspect and it is a very beautiful game. Something like it hasn't been quite done before. Sadly, that comes with a price.The graphics in this game, while beautiful, run into a lot of frame rate and slow down issues. There are times I've noticed in the cities where things just don't move so smoothly. You see slow down here and there in these massive areas. Not always but sometimes. Glitches are another issue. Granted, I've run into glitches in all the AC games (AC had some of the worst) but AC3 had some game stoppers. One involved me just running along and then I suddenly just fell through the ground and died. Another I hid in a pile of hay and got stuck in it, forcing me to restart the area I was in. More minor glitches include odd clipping, animals getting stuck in trees, and other silly things that you run into in open world games. Only a few of these glitches really hurt the game play but they were on the rare side. I can't help but feel that this game is just pushing the PS3 to its limits but the minor visual errors are minor compared to other problems in the game. UPDATE: A friend of mine experienced a glitch that prevented him from beating the game because a cutscene would not start.Probably the biggest issue in the game is the new combat system. Wow! It sucks! It is a huge step back from the combat system from Assassin's Creed 2. The first thing I noticed when I got into a big fight was the camera: It doesn't follow your character. It just doesn't. You have to adjust it manually. When you got so much shit going on around you, you don't have time to adjust the damn camera. Something always seems to get in the of the camera too, be it a tree, wall, part of a building, ect. The combat itself feels less skill based. Every now and then, Conner will pull off some of the awesome finishing moves we saw in the trailers but I have no idea how I did them. I still have no idea how to use someone as a human shield and it is an almost mandatory move to know if you want to survive firing lines. The majority of the time you are hacking at the enemy's defenses and countering them whenever prompted. It becomes a button masher. A lot of times I would press triangle to try and counter because I am so used to the combat from Arkham City but that's my fault. There is also no real lock on method in this game. It seems to want to try lock on automatically in combat but it does a poor job. You end up missing your target or accidentally running up a wall or something. It's very frustrating and takes awhile to get used to especially if you are familiar with the combat system from the previous games. It took me about 10 hours of playing the game to get a hang of combat. There is no place you can go to practice like in AC2. You pretty much just have to go pick your own fights with British patrols and learn the hard way. Shooting and firearms have been added to the game which makes sense but the shooting mechanic is trick to get a hang of but once you do, it's pretty handy even though you have to deal with the slow reloads of the time.The story is another issue and the one I have the most mixed feels about. I won't go into details or spoilers or anything but I will talk about the pacing. The first 5 hours of the game is very slow paced but does have a good pay off with quite the bombshell of a plot twist. Then it bounces around from being fast paced, to slow paced, and just jerks around a bit too much for my liking. Other people don't seem as bothered by it as much as me. It does have some good moments like some epic battlefield scenes and the naval battle missions that, thankfully, actually live up to the hype! You could make an entire game based around the naval missions and naval combat system. It's fun. But there are only three mandatory missions where you control a ship on the seas. There are side missions for this in addition the many, many, many diverse side missions you can find though out the game. There is over 70 hours of content in this game, so it's not short. You do get your money's worth in terms of content with this game. I usually had more fun just running around doing all these side missions than the actual main missions.The next major issue I felt that goes along with the problem of the story's pace is that the first 7 hours feels like a very long and slow tutorial that spans out over this time. If you're a veteran of the series, some of this stuff isn't new to you but things like learn out to use the shooting mechanic could have been handled in a better way. You learn how to actually shoot your weapon in combat simple enough but  right after that you have to shoot these powder kegs to blow open a door. Okay, simple enough. At this point you think pressing the triangle button will let you shoot at anything and L1 is what you use to manually aim. There is a wagon with these BIG barrels on it and the game just told you to shoot at the barrels so naturally you aim at try to shoot them but nothing happens. I sat there for like 5 minutes pressing every button on the controller trying to figure out why the shooting button just no longer works. Then I notice that if I drag the little aiming cursor over these small barrels below the big barrels, the small ones light up and I can actually shoot them. It doesn't tell you to shoot the little barrels that light up. WHY NOT?! I know for a fact I am not the only one who has had this problem! It's turn into a little meme on the internet, I think. The game has several moments of poor conveyance.  It introduces new mechanics poorly such at the Battle of Lexington and Concord where you have to run back and forth between ranks and order Colonists to fire on the British. This is a really cool mission but when it starts they don't tell you how to give orders and it took me a few minutes to figure this out and ended up failing the mission a couple times. You have to stand in little circles that appear in order to give the commands. They could have made that much clearer.  A lot of things could have been made clearer on how they work and this goes back to the combat system. You can't just equip whatever weapons you want when you want. You have to go to a general store (the place you most likely bought your weapons and equipment) and you can only equip things there. These general stores are not common you will only find two or three in the two main cities of the game, New York and Boston. If you know how to equip weapons in a different way, please let me know!Every mission has sub-objectives to complete each synchronization and I HATE THESE THINGS! They are completely optional but if you're looking to complete this game 100%, you're going to have a bad time. Some of these are nearly impossible and half the time I end up failing them before I even know what they are because they only flash on the screen for a brief moment on the corner of the screen. They make missions unnecessarily difficult. If you want that kind of challenge, go for it. There is one where the game expects you to chase someone through a crowd without pushing anyone. Ha! Good luck with that. Speaking of chasing missions, they make for some of the MOST frustrating missions, especially this one near the end of the game. All of this stuff together ultimately leads to this game being very frustrating and just not as fun as it should be. There is nothing wrong with a challenging game but that challenge should be fair and not based on issues with the overall game play.Now like I said this is all based on my game play experiences. Maybe you have or will have better experiences but for me, ultimately this game is a big letdown. Assassin's Creed 2 was just so much better in just about every way and was way more fun to play. If you are not familiar with Assassin's Creed, AC3 is not game to start with. Now I can't stress this enough, this is all my opinion. Maybe I just suck at the game and there is something I just completely missed and I am playing it wrong. Don't let this review completely steer you away from the game as it is something that should be experienced to a degree. This game is an impressive technical achievement in many ways and it is a HUGE game. It's just too frustrating and ultimately unenjoyable to me overall which is very disappointing as I was really looking forward to this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2012"}

I'm running White 2 with the C-Gear turned on. Playing it 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there, etc, only closing the lid when it's time to take a break. Using the original battery, the 3DS would have been long dead by now. I would comfortably say this can at least double the battery life. Since it's only a week or so old now, only time will tell if it continues this performance.It does add some weight and thickness to the 3DS, which can be noticeable over lengthy gaming periods.  Couple that with sharp edges of the 3DS (unlike the smoother edges of the DS series) it can cause a bit of discomfort. On the positive side, the bottom of the battery is a rubbery non-skid material which does make it slightly easier to grip, and sits on a table-top without fear of sliding away.The battery is really easy to install. Just four screws, pop off the back lid, pop out the old battery, and insert the new battery. While the included tooth-pick style screwdriver is a nice gesture, don't use it. Any game geek or computer nerd worth their salt should have a precision screwdriver set; if you don't have a set, ask around. You don't want to strip the already-easy-to-strip screws, so be careful. If you're not comfortable with this, find a friend (the same one you borrowed the precision screwdriver from).Be careful how long you take, because many games are time sensitive, and if you take too long, the clock will reset. I did not notice this, and when I tried to sync White 2 to the Global Link, it detected a time change and placed a hard-wait of 24 hours on me. I think I saw a discussion here how to quickly pop it out without losing the date/time.Finally, not sure if it's worth noting, but my 3DS is one of the original NA releases (Ambassador Certificate), so the original battery might have already been approaching its end of life anyways.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00D4WTO1M","description":"","reviewerName":"SRS47","summary":"What you expect from COD but with large maps and useless killstreaks","reviewText":"***  Campaign: The campaign is around 5-7 hours long. It's very simple and not challenging at all. Same Campaign as MW1 & MW2 & 3. Just run around kill 10 enemies in front of you and move to the next level. Graphics are ok, but not that good for next gen compared to BF4 or Killzone. Only new thing in the game is the dog that you take control of it in certain parts of the game. Story is predictable, and very simple. No customization for guns or even gun chose in the single player ( unlike Black Ops II that you could choose your gear) you just pick up guns of the ground as you go; no control over the attachments. Overall, there were only two levels that really got my attention, but other than that, nothing was that interesting. Just simple run and shoot... just like 10 years ago.***  Multiplayer:  I played the game for 5 days and 15 hours so far, my K/D is 2.11 at the moment and I can tell you I'm done with the game till the next DLC comes out.I can not say Ghosts is like other CODs because It simply is nothing like BO II. However, the game uses pretty much a same mechanism to attract gamers and especially new players. As I said at the beginning, the game gets really boring after few days. Everything is just the same as the previous matches. I play KC and Domination more than any other modes, but I can tell you %90 of the time every match is like the previous one. Same old same old, campers camp at a corner and get 30 kills and their team loses because they had no team work,.... I get 3 kills then someone re-spawns behind me and kills me. Ghosts is the only COD that really made me start camping and not doing my objective as much as I used to.killstreaks: as title says USELESS. Maps are very big and getting heli and other killstreaks like it won't get you that many kills. On the other hand, it is good thing since nobody really cares about getting them; therefore, nobody should camp, RIGHT? WRONG... In every map, there are tons of corners and camping spots for players to camp & snipe. I just don't understand what is the point of camping when killstreaks are useless!!!Lag is still there: when number of players go above 50000 players, I feel the lag gets worse. When I got the game, everything was fine, pretty much no lag at all. but now,.... it's crazy. Same thing that used to happen in BO II. You shoot the guy nothing happens, he shoots you, die in 3 bullets. Some people see you earlier than you see them. However, I believe it's Sony's server, not the game servers. Because I also experience lag in Killzone and BF4 ( but not as much as COD ).BIGGEST ISSUE: for some reason IW decided to shove Clans up our asses. I never took gaming that serious to join clans. I just enjoy the game for what it is, and play it for 2-3 hours every day. However, be prepared to be put against crazy good clans because there are certain days of every month that are dedicated to clan wars. What about people who want to play alone? I'm not saying this because I'm not part of a clan ( I have a clan IMOR ), but I'm saying it because I see we go against people who just purchased the game and have no idea what is going on. It will ruin the experience for them, and it is never fun to go against 5 clan members with 3-4 times the skill of a new player. Therefore, be prepared to avoid the game in certain days of every month because you will be against clans of people who prestiged 5-6 times. In the first week of release, I could hardly see 3 people in one clan, but now pretty much 80% of every lobby is part of a clan. Don't get me wrong, clan wars are fun and challenging, but why they are mixed with regular players?? just have them play in a separate lobby.Over all: this is the list that I recommend for you guys out there, if you just want to buy one FPS multiplayer PS4 game. Here is my list:1- Battlefield 4( Interesting campaign, crazy good MP )2- Killzone ( OK campaign, very fun MP)3- COD ghosts","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Elmo","summary":"Great RE game for PS3","reviewText":"I have been a fan of the franchise, so I am be a little biasPro- Great story mode, you learn more about the RE timeline- Combat feature: aiming, similar to RE4- Graphics are amazing- Voice over sounds fluid and matches the characterCon- A little short, may take you just a few days or a hardcore gamer, a few hours- ending could have been better","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2014"}

{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A slightly flawed masterpiece by the great Hironobu Sakaguchi","reviewText":"More than ever before, I wish amazon reviews allowed half stars in their reviews, because I really would have liked to have given The Last Story four and a half stars.  The Last Story is an absolutely beautiful game, both aesthetically and emotionally.  It tells a rich, intimate story in a way that only a master like Hironobu Sakaguchi, who has been enchanting our world with his masterful games for decades, can tell.  Even though it is slightly flawed in its execution of its battle system, this is still very much a game worth experiencing, as there are few games that work on the level that The Last Story does.The first thing worth noting about The Last Story is that it really isn't a \"JRPG\", like many are labeling it.  It has many characteristics of JRPGs, especially when it comes to the game's characters and themes, which deal with love, loyalty, betrayal, identity, and of course, saving the world.  But at its core, this is very much an action RPG, with a battle system that has more in common with Mass Effect 2 than it does with a modern JRPG like Xenoblade Chronicles.  The battles are all played out in real time, with you controlling the main character, Zael, most of the time.  On paper, the battle system is fantastic and actually quite innovative.  You navigate battlefields in real time, armed with a sword and crossbow, and have the ability to issue commands to your teammates, who are a mix of melee fighters and mages.  You can take cover, draw enemies towards you using a mysterious power, have your mages create magic \"spheres\" that you can either stand in or \"diffuse\" (which spreads an effect across the entire battlefield), chain combos together, destroy environments to rain damage on foes ....the list goes on.The battle system is actually quite deep and enjoyable most of the time, but the problem here is that it doesn't always work as well as it should.  You'll fight the camera at times, duck into cover when you meant to dodge, and sometimes your AI teammates can become more of a burden than they are a help, which can be extremely frustrating.  It's a very cool battle system that just isn't executed as well as it could have been.  While I didn't find myself fighting the battle system more than a handful of times, others may have a different experience, and it is worth noting when reviewing the game's overall quality.Beyond that, it is very difficult to find something wrong with a game like this, one that was obviously painstakingly crafted with so much love and care by some of the best minds in the industry.  This is one of the most beautiful games to appear on the Wii, with the most epic cutscenes, detailed environments, and fluid animations to appear on the console.  The fully orchestrated soundtrack by longtime Sakaguchi collaborator Nobou Uematsu further cements his status as the greatest living composer working in the gaming industry.  From the epic, intense battle themes, to the soft, haunting piano melodies that accompany Zael as he walks through the beautiful Lazilus Castle, the music masterfully compliments the game's emotional arc in a way that only Uematsu can do.Of course, being a Sakaguchi game, the heart and soul of this game is the incredible story, and the characters who take you through it.  The game is unique in his output of work, in that it is a much smaller, more intimate story than he normally tells.  It isn't convoluted at all, is enjoyable to follow, and will tug at your heartstrings while thrilling you in equal measure.  The ragtag group of mercenaries, while not as developed as some may like, are still incredibly likable and will feel like your friends by the time you get through the 30 hour campaign.  It's an intensely powerful story that will stick with you for a long time.  It will make you laugh, and maybe even shed a tear.  This is one of the finest tales to appear in a video game in this console generation, and is a perfect swan song for the Nintendo Wii.  If you're looking for a game that is a little different from anything you played before, and especially if you can be patient with the occasionally twitchy, yet unique battle system, you are in for a treat.  The Last Story is a powerful, special game of incredible emotional poignancy that is incredibly fun to play and difficult to forget.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2012"}

Whether you've enjoyed this series in the past will be a very good indicator of whether you will like this one as well.There is some grinding involved, though I don't find this as annoying in a DS game as I might elsewhere because the portable device makes it very easy to pick it up for 10 minutes, knock out a few battles, then get back to doing something else. It generally becomes a lot easier to get through that kind of stuff in small spurts, rather than sitting down and putting in hours.The story did a pretty good job of holding my interest, though there were some plot twists that were surprising and others that weren't. There is clearly a lot of bonus content that comes after you finish the main quest, and some of it does sound a little interesting. It just seemed like it was going to involve a lot more grinding than I would be happy to do. If you have a limited game budget or are looking for something to give to a kid, that bonus content looks like it would stretch the potential play time out a very long way. For me, I was happy with the value I got just focusing on the main plot, so I preferred to move on to the next game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

I just purchased my Nintendo 3DS and I would have liked to have protected my investment. This \"case\" is just odd. I don't see myself ever using it. Here are the reasons why:1.) It is huge! I need a carrying bag just to carry the case. I think I am more likely to drop my 3DS, or put it down somewhere and forget it with this monster of a case. Something this big really needs a carrying strap or at least a handle.2.) Only room for 3 games. Seriously? As I said, this thing is a monster and they only put 3 game slots in it?3.) You have to take the DS completely out to play. Another opportunity to lose something.The only upside is that this thing does what it says: it protects the 3DS. The way the inside is rigged, if you strap down your DS like your supposed to, even a fall of a few feet isn't going to affect your DS.That said, I am still looking for a convenient way to carry and protect my 3DS. It would be nice, but not necessarily required, for it to carry a few of my games as well. This case just does not fit the bill.===============Update: The product description/title has changed since I first did this review to include the XL.

I feel drawn to this game and I love it despite the jarring flaws the game has. There's more to love about it then there is to hate, however, as it is the best Castlevania since Symphony of the Night, hands down... its also a very difficult game, and being a master of Castlevania games that's saying a lot.There are games I'm not very good at. I'm only moderately good Mario games, I've only ever beaten one Sonic game, and I am terrible at First Person Shooters, especially the mouse and keyboard control variety. Castlevania games, however, are one series that no matter how difficult they can be, I usually can clear them pretty quickly because I'm good at them. I'm an expert... in short; I should have beaten this game by now. I have 86% of the map covered, but can't get any further, not because I don't know where to go, but because those paths are blocked and I have no idea how to remove the obstacles that have impeded my progress. This is unusual for a Castlevania game to do to me. In the past such obstacles were easily removed by finding the switch, or using the correct spell, or in even older Castlevanias, whipping the blockade. Such does not appear to be the case in this one.Enemies in this game are not so easily pushed over, unless they're bosses, oddly enough. I have found myself doing quite a bit of leveling up in order to survive the harsh halls of the latest castle as it may seem like a walk in the park to battle the bosses, but the average enemies have a distinct advantage over Juste at first, and that's something that will have you desperately seeking save points (which refill your health) and using potions... thankfully I found a luck charm which allowed me to collect quite a few of those, but despite that I still got hit hard enough to kill me before I could use them.This game feels like a mix of classic Castlevania with the newer RPG style. I don't know how or why, maybe it's because old school Castlevania is this hard, and harder, of course that makes me more determined to beat it.The biggest draw back to this game, ironically, is its uninspired NES style music. The music selections of this game are horrid, but thankfully forgettable. I was really disappointed that Konami didn't at least compose decent midis like they did with Circle of the moon.Graphically the game is light years ahead of its predecessor, but I'm still convinced that GameBoy Advance can look better, as Juste has quite a lot of jagged edges that could have been smoothed out, and he looks too much like Alucard. It would have been nice to have an original design for the character. Maybe there's a plot point that covers that. Perhaps Simon Belmont married Dracula's daughter? Hopefully there is an explanation; otherwise I'd have to dock the game points for lacking originality... which the game play does not lack.It's strange how they always come up with something new to keep the new style CV games fresh. I had feared that this style would grow as stale as classic CV games have, but if they continue to conceive innovative new magic systems, and new challenges like this it may last several more years yet. Although I do still believe these games can be and should be done, perhaps on GameCube?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2002"}

As a software professional myself, it pains me to see a product released with so many issues.Although I have not experienced as many crashes and various problems that other reviewers have, the constant skipping that occurs while the game attempts to perform in-game loads is absolutely incredibly frustrating. As you trek across large landscapes in order to reach a new part of the map, every 10 seconds or so, the screen blips as the game attemps to load more data to refresh the screen. As minor as this sounds, over the span of 30-60 minutes of gameplay, you can potentially see up to 180 of these 'blips', which completely destroys the experience.The game itself had a potential to be at least on par with FO3 in terms of plot and gameplay, but the technical issues be far ruins any chance of this game being anywher near FO3 or any other RPG/shooters in the market today.

{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

The stores and such look rather bland. You can't even enter them so it seems lacking in that you can't raise hell inside the stores as well. However, this game takes off in terms of action once you've got 10 or more gang members/corporation members on your tail and you manage to pick up the shotgun or grenade launcher. There's lots and lots of weapons to pick up from tasers, axes, pepper spray, swords, Ak-47's, Uzis, shotguns, grendade launchers, etc. The action gets intense as you try to accomplish your next mission while you've got bogies on your tail, bystanders in the way, and a loaded weapon in your hands. What to do? What to do? Well, anything you want. That's what. Gameplay isn't very original or deep.

When I got this game, the first thing I did with a pal was tear into the coop. This is one of the freshest, most original games in a long time. Having 4 portals is just insane. The map is divided into what are essentially \"worlds\" connected to a large hub, and you select which you want to go in. At first my friend and I were worried because we were flying through it, but suddenly right in the middle of world 2 we had to slow waaaay down and really think it through. It only gets harder from there, but never unbearable. Glados also keeps the mood up with constant cracks at the players, so just when you start to get frustrated, she'll say something to make you laugh.CONCERNING CAMPAIGN LENGTH: I have 3 sections left in what is the last \"world\", but it's safe to say that the coop campaign length clocks in at roughly 7 hours.There are a multitude of fps's released so far this year and most of them feel very much like you've played them before.

{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"Nightshift worshiper","summary":"A very disappointing end~","reviewText":"The makers of this game must've been on drugs.This game is way to easy. If you like to explore the world before doing the quests, then I highly discourage you from buying this game. Everything is pretty much closed off until you do the quest associated with that specific location.Some of the higher level creatures in specific areas are very strong and hard to kill if your level is relatively low, but don't fret, you can just run circles around them, or just jump on a rock and shoot them with your bow for 10 minutes to kill them.I will admit that the upgrading weapons system is one of the best. You can literally break down every kind of weapon or armor that you find, and use those materials to upgrade your weapon or armor of choice. Also, any weapon that you breakdown with an elemental status on it, or a skill, you can add the skill or status from that weapon to the one of your choice. The weapons and armor gain slots when you level them up and you put the skills and status' on them. The weapons and armor also grow stronger on their Atk-Def Ect.The magic system is pretty cool, but pretty useless. The spells are original and the fact that you have to combine different kinds of spell cards to make spells is very different and I like it, except for the fact that the only spell I ever used was for stamina. I pretty much killed everything with double-wielding a blunt weapon and a slashing weapon and didn't really need magic but only a couple of times to defeat the bigger demons in the swallows with a strength spell. Alchemy is pretty much needed to beat the game easily, but if you are thinking of using any jump, or water walking potions then they are pretty useless as well, being there is really no where to jump to that's interesting, and walking on water will get you across to the other islands, but there is no use in going there before you open them up in the game via portals because everything is pretty desolate and non-active in the storyline and locations.There is not that much strategy to this game at all, but it was still really fun up until the ending.I beat the last boss pretty easy with potions, and then the game lets you continue to explore and finish any sidequests you might stumble upon. There is a ton of quests to do, so if you want something to do for a couple weeks that'll keep you busy then this is a good purchase and pretty fun.This game does have some glitches, but they are pretty minor, but frustrating if you like to explore every inch of your surroundings.If you choose to stray from the roads and trails then you will find mountains that hover over the ground, and you can literally walk underneath them(this seemed to only happen in the swallows), you will see vast areas on the map directly surrounded by rock structures, and even though it might look like there should be something in the middle, you will only see a vast open space with grass and no purpose for that being put there in the game at all. Not to mention that really big island that you'll be looking forward to going to the entire game, only to find out that you can only explore the edges, and transport to a swamp almost directly in the middle of it(the swamp is part of the storyline). If you want to swim around the whole island then you will find various tribes of fish men to kill and some loot, but there is nothing really there but experience. If you try to climb over the mountains to get further into the middle of the island then it will restart you somewhere else whilst a message pops up on the screen telling you that you have strayed to far from the path. SO FRUSTRATING!!If your looking for something constructive to do for a couple of weeks then check this out, but personally, I think part 1 was better even if the graphics were lacking.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2013"}

Most of this takes place in rainy or dismal settings, so get used to your characters being wet all the time.Issue seen on PS3Slim (others have seen same on original PS3, I dont have one to confirm):Ok lets talk about the issue I have with the game so that we can get to the good stuff. The video is choppy. No two ways about it. I have the new PS3 Slim and the video jerks and stutters just enough to be annoying over time. You can tell its pushing the system pretty hard. Other times its smooth and beautiful. Most of the time the jerky video is not during anything fast or major, just when the character may be walking it looks like Monty Python sketch about silly walks. It doesn't tear, it merely is just a very slight lag when moving the character, 1 step is smooth 2nd step is slower, 3rd step is slower yet then back to smooth again maybe 2 steps and repeat the slow down. Its not overt and you might not notice it at all. Ok thats my major gripe, now onto the game.Interface:Fantastic and feels very immersive. At first the interface seems really clunky and weird until you get the button combinations down then it is very smooth and easy to figure out. Eventually you really dont have to think about it at all.  This game is rewriting what interfaces are in video games and even though it is cutting edge it sometimes feels a bit like Dragon's Lair. If you find that you just cant keep up due to whatever reason you can change the difficulty setting by selecting how comfortable you are with the PS3 controller. They attempt to use the sixaxis controller like it was meant to be used but it feels a bit, eh, ok. Its not as intuitive as say,Flower  [Online Game Code - Full Game].Load times:The load times do take a little longer than I would like, however they use it as a chance to show off the incredible facial modeling and motion capture. The characters look around and you can see the really fine attention to detail.Adult themes:One thing I like about this title is its frank dealing with adult themes. Its not overt sexuality, but there is nudity both male and female, and also psychological illness and struggle that most children would not be able to handle. I recommend this for people over the age of 18 and also with sound mental capacity. Reason being is, the story has some very dark imagery that is both disturbing and essential to the thriller. There are graphic depictions of drug use, and it is not pretty.Fight sequences:At times in the beginning you can practice fighting with doing other mundane things such as juggling and playing with one of the children in the game. It shows you through a very inventive way the skills you will need later on to fight. One thing that I like is that the producers offer this in a subtle way. Once you have this hit X now - Up - now Triangle, Now down sort of timing it becomes second nature. If you remember Dragon's Lair then you will find yourself right at home here.Imagery:The game is dark, its almost always raining, there are times though when you can escape through a virtual environment in the game to lush areas. It is always beautiful and quite breathtaking to see some of these vistas. After playing for several hours to see the sun was very refreshing and almost brought my spirits up. Then it was back to the case. The visuals are spot on. There are pieces of plastic caught in the barbed wire of the fences, cans roll around the street, there is dirt under and over a light switch on the wall. These are some of the great details to look for. So much attention to the small details help to make it more believable.  In the beginning you are in a modern home with fantastic architecture and it looks just like a movie set. Textures, reflections, water all play very integral members of the cast. At times I forgot to move because I thought I was watching a movie, not playing one.Vocals & Storytelling:I am playing the US version and the voice acting is very good. I appreciate the vocals at times more than the graphics (which is saying alot). They are actual actors and not the textures guy doing a voice for the game. What you get is a compelling story told through many peoples viewpoints. Think Steven King or Dean Koontz with regard to many characters telling the whole story. This is not a hero quest layout and often I had trouble finding who to root for. That in itself makes it a very powerful story. I never felt that the story was out of hand or too deep to grasp. I really felt as I was integral in many ways to what was going on the screen.Replayability:There are so many different ways to go in this story that it could mean infinite replayability, although I doubt its that much. Even so it could be like 200+ different ways to play it meaning it is a very good value. Just do what you think the characters would do and live with the decisions, or go back and try again.Synopsis breakdown:Pros:>> Motion capture is some of the best I have seen, only sometimes seems too stiff (like going up stairs)>> Interface is easy to use once you get the basics down>> You can change the difficulty based on how fast you think you can pull off the moves, so it doesn't penalize older players with slower reaction times.>> A true adult game (mild sex), but with real life issues and themes.>> Gritty and holds no punchesCons:&lt;&lt; PS3 Slim with plenty of HD space had jerky motion and felt a bit pushed&lt;&lt; Harkens back to old school movie games with the controls based on timing and buttons (its ok not much of a con but thought I would mention it)Overall this game will touch you in many ways. It is both wonderful to look at, yet you will find yourself wanting to look away when the bad stuff happens. You become very attached to each character and the smallest decisions you make may change the whole conclusion of the game. Matter of fact there is no guarantee  that anyone will solve the case, so, be wise with your choices.Highly recommended.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

The best mini-game collection on the DS.","reviewText":"My recent review of another mini-game collection reminded me thatMario Party DSis still the gold standard for the DS.Mario Party DS delivers single-cartridge multiplayer support so four players can play the entire game from only one copy (the system's Download Play feature). This feature alone makes this a superb value compared with the litany sub-$20 mini-game collection on the market. I bought this game when my sons were ages 6 and 5; they managed to draw nearly a year's worth of gameplay from Mario Party DS before it hit the trade shelf.Mario Party DS contains two modes. In story mode, you advance through five game boards, collecting coins and stars as you compete in mini-game battles. Each board concludes with a boss battle:Round 1 Boss: Pirahna PlantRound 2 Boss: Hammer BroRound 3 Boss: Dry BonesRound 4 Boss: KamekRound 5 Boss: BowserIn party mode, you first establish the game length from 10 to 30 rounds. Two-on-two battles require teamwork where each player alternates button presses to accomplish a goal, like climbing, driving or stacking. The computer AI tends to be aloof as a partner and vicious as an opponent.In summary, Mario Party DS is the best mini-game collection we own for the DS. Offering more than 70 mini-games in a game board presentation, Mario Party is at its best when played with friends in multiplayer mode. I place it just one notch belowMario Karton the must-have list of DS games.Rating: Four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2010"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"HATE IT!!","reviewText":"update: I do not recommend this game at all.

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"You Will Lose All Your Souls... Over and Over Again...\"","reviewText":"In 2011, the original Dark Souls hit store shelves with the slogan, &#34;Prepare to Die.&#34; It was an unapologetic challenge and a masterpiece. One that spawned an enormous cult following. Nearly three years later fans still talk about Dark Souls. Fans of Dark Souls don't just like the game. They love it. They're passionate about it. To this day I'm still thrilled, awed and challenged by Dark Souls. Needless to say a sequel to Dark Souls has very high expectations. It's especially daunting because the original is such a huge cult classic--one that didn't need too many major refinements to begin with. Dark Souls II is definitely familiar to anyone who played the original or who played Demon's Souls. But it also has some surprises.You play as an undead who is seeking to break the curse upon you before you go hollow. That is the story of Dark Souls II in a nutshell, but the story of Dark Souls isn't comprised to just a basic plot alone. The world you'll enter has a lot of diverse characters, lore and a lot of storytelling through more than just dialog to get you to understand what's going on. It certainly has more dialog to help you along than the first game, but the emphasis here is still on exploring your surroundings, meeting a diverse cast of characters and the lore of the land in and of itself. That's not to say the story is somehow bad or put under the bus. It is only to say that the approach to storytelling here is not like every other game out there.As with the first one you'll begin by choosing a class and selecting a gift. Each class comes with their own set of levels and skills at first. A sorcerer, for example, begins with a little bit of magic and a boost in intelligence while a warrior begins with a boost in strength and will be able to wield better melee weapons at the start. As with the first, however, no class is restricted in any way. A sorcerer can still use swords and a warrior can still use magic. You may, however, find your stats growing differently as they start off with higher stats in certain attributes than others. There are a couple of new classes added to the mix. The swordsman, who is able to wield two swords at a time with ease. And the explorer who has some slightly more balanced stats but the real benefit is that they start off with more items than any other class. You can customize your character to look anyway you want and you have a lot of options to choose from.Once all this is done, Dark Souls II becomes incredibly familiar with anyone who has played either Souls game before it. You've got a life gauge and you've got a stamina gauge. Each swing of your weapon drains your stamina. When depleted you can no longer attack until it replenishes. Your stamina also effects how long you can hold your guard against an enemies attacks with a shield. Combat in Dark Souls II is just as meticulous as it's ever been. Those who enjoyed the original Dark Souls, though, may have an edge up if only because some moments take a very similar approach. What is slightly different, however, is that the AI of your enemies has increased. Enemies no longer stand around watching as their allies fall to your blade. They are more willing to jump in and attack you while you're in the midst of combat. While this happened in the original, it was often easier to lure enemies away from each others and divide them. This doesn't happen as frequently in Dark Souls II. Combat also flows faster and smoother. The strategic element is still there to a large degree. You still have to be careful with your stamina and utilize dodge rolls and backsteps.That being said, it's quite surprising that Dark Souls II doesn't quite throw you in the same way the original does. One of the hallmarks of the first Dark Souls was that it established itself as not being a very handholding type of game from the get go. Dark Souls II's tutorial area allows for more exploration and throws some relatively weak enemies at you early on. Where as the first one plunged you into a boss fight within the first five minutes, Dark Souls II takes a bit more care to let you get acquainted first. This isn't to say that Dark Souls II holds your hand. In fact, it is better described as a false sense of security. There are markers and messages telling you the controls while also presenting you with an obstacle or objective to try and apply what it is you've just learned. But it isn't as quick to throw you into a boss battle. For the enthusiast this might suggest Dark Souls II is easier than the first one, but in truth it's not long before it actually start really punishing you.Dark Souls is a game where dying is an integral part of the experience and where learning from your deaths is also integral. And make no mistake, you will die. You will die a lot. You'll fight bosses and perish a couple of times before learning their patterns and learning how to defend against their attacks and dodge them. But the sense of accomplishment when you finally do overcome a boss is quite exhilarating. Dark Souls II is one of the few games where the sense of accomplishment is the reward. You are, however, rewarded in more than just a sense of accomplishment. Usually either with better weapons, rare items or a multitude of souls which you can use to increase the attributes of your characters, or buy some much needed weapons, armor and items. . Also make no mistake that Dark Souls II expects you to really work for those rewards. To get to a rare item or a chest often takes a lot of work. Sometimes taking some daring risk or getting past unusually powerful enemies to do so. Dark Souls II is no hand holding experience by any means and it hammers this in several times.Death is going to happen. When you die you will lose all your souls. When you respawn from a bonfire you have a chance to get them back by running to place where you died and retrieving those souls. Of course, what killed you is usually still lurking around as well. The penalty for death is slightly more harsh than the first game, however. Each time you die now, your maximum health will also decrease. And this stacks until you are at fifty percent health. The only way to cure it is by burning an effigy, which is a fairly rare item to come by. Considering how many times you'll perish, this is an invaluable item. The game also makes another couple of tweaks. In the first Dark Souls you could keep respawning enemies and killing them to your hearts content to grind for souls. Dark Souls II takes a different approach. Eventually the enemies in the area will stop respawning, cutting off your ability to farm for souls or grind. While this seems strange at first, you do have an item that allows you to revive every enemy in the area (including bosses) and they'll all be more powerful when you do.Dark Souls II still has a good deal of covenants to join, items to collect and deadly traps in store. Exploring the world is both a fascinating and frightening experience. It is a game where death can (literally) lurk around the next corner. As I said, you will die a lot. Gamers easily frustrated will find this is not the game for them by any means. Dark Souls II isn't always unfair about death, but you will approach several moments where you'll have to die first before you can succeed. You might stumble upon a trap that'll kill you, or find yourself encountering an enemy you weren't prepared for who will massacre you. For the purist of Dark Souls, this is the name of the game. This is what you've come to expect. For those who ignore the warnings that you'll lose your souls over and over again (or who constantly ignore the &#34;Prepare to Die,&#34; slogan) this game is a rude awakening. It can be frustrating. Especially when you lose everything you've worked so hard to obtain, but Dark Souls II is still a rewarding experience.One of the most rewarding aspects of Dark Souls was always the online community. Throughout the experience you'd find people who would leave messages. Some were quite helpful like warning you of a fall or a tough enemy ahead. Others were deceitful, such as tricking you into jumping off a ledge when you shouldn't have or leading you to your doom in other ways. This returns in Dark Souls II. And like before, you can rank them. A lot of the time they're helpful. Other times they can be deceptive. That being said, the community serves as a nice guide at times. Often you'll learn when new dangers are around the corner or when great rewards await. The community works for and against you, however. Soon you'll find yourself being invaded by other players. One of the other new additions to Dark Souls II is being able to use an item to make the enemies in the area notice the person invading you. This seems small, but it adds a nice layer into the experience. Dark Souls has always had a unique online experience and it continues here. You'll be invaded and you'll be able to summon an ally to help you fight off tough bosses. You can also touch bloodstains to see the final moments of another characters death.Whenever you need a rest or need to level up or shop for wares, Dark Souls II provides you a hub area that is a lot more similar to the Nexus in Demon's Souls. It slowly becomes populated with more people who can be both your friend or your ally. Some of the NPCs carry valuable items and you can attack them at any time, although they're no slouches. They'll come back at you. But once you kill them they're gone. While some carry rare items others are necessary for you to go through your adventure.There are also plenty of covenants abound. You can join some that add layers to the online experience. Some covenants have an emphasis on helping other players while others put an emphasis on invading them. Most of them will be, from the outset, indistinguishable from the first game, but there's a little extra layer here. There's a lot more emphasis on the online experience here. In particular, a covenant that will summon someone to your aid any time you get invaded is rather nice.Graphically speaking, Dark Souls II looks really good. The rag doll physics aren't present here anymore. There are also fewer dips in the framerate. Every now and then there is still a hiccup but the game runs smoothly. Likewise, the game sounds magnificent. The sound effects are good, but the music score is just as haunting as it can be. There is certainly a wider range of music here than in the previous game. It's a good looking and sounding game. That's not to say some issues don't get in the way. When listening to other characters speak there are some strange pauses. The dialog and voice acting itself is quite good, but sometimes the game has to load the next line of dialog.Dark Souls II is a huge experience. The world is enormous in all sorts of ways. There is plenty to explore, lots of characters to meet and plenty of enemies to kill and be killed by. Dark Souls II is a good game and great for those who want a challenge. It can feel unfair in its approach to difficulty sometimes. Dark Souls II doesn't hold your hand in any way, shape or form. When you explore the game will throw just about anything and everything at you without ever preparing you for what is to come next. This makes the game exciting and exhilarating, but it can also be dreadful. Players who simply rush into any situation expecting to be triumphant will be knocked down a few pegs. Dark Souls II is hard, but not for the wrong reasons. A lot of the time when you die you'll feel it is through your own doing or missteps as opposed to the game itself. The game also expects you to learn from those deaths, however. Obviously this means that Dark Souls II is not going to be a game for everyone. But it's difficulty is meticulously well designed. If you accept that several deaths are inevitable going in, Dark Souls II is apt to be a fun experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

They are all insanely goofy, all look pretty terrible, all are brutally redundant...yet are, consistently, absurdly playable. And this is no exception.The creator of the series didn't work on the previous Beautiful Katamari (which was awesome nonetheless), opting to work on Noby Noby Boy instead, but is now back with Katamari Forever, which signals Katamari's return to the realm of being a PS-exclusive title.As with all other games, the King of the Cosmos has destroyed all the stars, which makes him up there with Princess Peach in the annals of people who never learn lessons, and you must fix them. Except, this time, the King is hurt and the Prince, who we learn is a masochist, decides to build a Robo-King to insult him and demand him to make stars as he wants.The game is fan service in every sense of the word. The levels all come from earlier titles, many from the prior Beautiful Katamari game. Layout is pretty much the same, item location is basically unchanged, and this game has few appreciable differences from other titles, outside of the number of things on screen at once.They actually have improved the visuals. It is still blocky --- the game wouldn't work at all if it was realistic-looking --- but the art style does seem to have taken a small step forward. You also unlock the \"Katamari Drive\" mode after beating a challenge, giving you the chance to re-do a level with your character moving extremely quickly, which usually serves to ease up the difficulty, but in some levels, it makes the chore actually a bit tougher. The other new addition is a jump move which is too difficult to pull off with the Sixxaxis to make attempting it worth your time and effort. You'll spend more time trying to do it than you'd have spent simply finding a way up to where you wanted to jump to.Of course, the gameplay of the series is back. They have some of the same difficult challenges, such as the maddening \"Keep your Katamari at a certain temperature\" chores which are enough to make one rip one's own hair out.If you have hated all the games earlier --- well, first, HOW could you hate them? I mean, seriously, they are goofy fun ---- then pass on this. It won't change your mind. But if you have any fondness for this trippy series, this game is a must-buy, though it seems harder to find than I'd have expected.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

I saw this game one day and I wanted it. However at the time the case was in bad condition but it had the advertising cover art, the disc was not clean but still worked on my system and on top of that the manual and safety precautions booklet was missing. So a few years after I bought it, I later on  found it at a local store where I live called \"O-Nett-Gaming Company\" the owner is someone who I know and goes to my local church. So anyway again I saw it, only this one I found was in great condition the box was perfect had the Advertising cover art, a manual and the precautions booklet, the disc was scratched but the place I bought it from had a disc cleaning service which if you buy a game that is disc format and it shows signs of any scratches or doesn't work on a console then one can have the disc cleaned. So I did and the game works great and more importantly I have a manual with this game. I love this game and this game is fun for everyone. Though parents should be advised this game does have a T for Teen rating. But if the whole family is involved so that parents watch their kids while they play this game then there should be no worries. I personally never saw any blood in the game, but then again this game is violent. So that does make sense. As far as what I paid for this game, I think I paid originally the first time $8.00 maybe less then that but it was a long time ago. The second time around, the game I saw on the shelf was originally $10.00 since the one I saw at O-Nett was in great condition in comparison to the previous one I originally bought. So the owner made me an offer I could not refuse he offered $3.00 and I took it. I would pay that price all day long for this game and any other popular title on the Gamecube. I highly reccomend this game used since the price is way cheaper. Compared to if you were to buy new.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2012"}

I prefer to have just the one though it's quite comical to see the 2-3 interact.THIS IS INGENIOUS - the little dog responses to you calling it and will run to you and paw you as a real one would. When you pat it, it responses realistically with expression (closes it's eyes and beam).  It will tend to perform better at competitions if you feed, water and groom it just before and of course if it has had training before. But it can get tired too after extensive activity and that is implied when the computer will prompt that.Got one for my special needs niece and she spends hours on it because she couldn't have a real one.

You even see fleas jumping about around it =).  Of course that will not happen with yours. All that is needed then is to feed it, give it some water and a long long bath (2-3x to get clean) and you may even need to do a little retraining and a lot of patting and reassurance cause k9 may still be a little unhappy with you.  Nintendog thinks of everything.If you don't own any other game, this one will keep you smiling for a long time. INGENIOUS.

They were supposed to be based on James own person demons. So it didn't make any sense and was just lazy to have them in Homecoming. Only the boss fights had any meaning. But most of the game your fighting James's demons.The atmosphere is too dark and dull. It seems like they where trying to make the game scarier by making it so dark that you can't see but it doesn't work.This game is way to combat-oriented for a survival horror game. It has this awful up and close combat system that wants you to fight almost every enemy. The older game wanted you to try to escape the enemy's. This one you can't even run! This isn't a survival horror game, its a really bad action horror game.The story tries to hard to be like the movie. In the original most of the cult members were dead. It makes no sense for them to be alive, why would Silent Hill let the other cult live?Almost all the scares are predictable jump scares.The only good thing I can say about this game is the soundtrack is amazing, and there were a few good boss fights.Homecoming is not a Silent Hill game.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Too Old for Games \"casualgamer\"","summary":"You get what you pay for","reviewText":"Not speaking in terms of value, but in that you are getting a 6-7 hour linear campaign in the vein of the Call of Duty moniker.  To think it would be otherwise is basically naivete on the part of the consumer.  It's always the populist mindset to root against the 800 pound gorilla in room...Yankees, Patriots, Lakers...and in video games, Call of Duty.  But the product they put out is usually pretty consistent and predictable, albeit, they're basically blueprints of prior iterations.  I'll just give you some of my perspective of Infinity Ward's versions starting from COD4.  I only play single player so I'll give a review on the campaign only.  I know, it's shocking to think people still play a game for the single player so to all those who say games like these should solely put out a multiplayer product, they would lose the revenue stream from players like myself.COD4, in my opinion, was and maybe still is the best fps single-player on the market.  It revolutionized the genre when it came out.  It was short and linear, but was memorable due to its set-pieces (first time you fell out of the helicopter, the death of a protagonist from a nuclear explosion, the final shot at the end) and innovative missions (sniper, AC-130 and the extra spec op mission).  Most games these days, you forget about entirely once you eject the disc.  COD4's staying power is due to the fact the game stayed with you long after playing it.MW2's campaign was a not unexpectedly a flaming turd.  It was impossible to surpass its predecessor so they basically tried to shock you by bringing the war to U.S. soil and adding the stupid \"No Russian\" scene.  They killed off so many protagonists that it became laughable and the scene from the Rock was just over the top.  Unfortunately, shock value is not lasting and this game was instantly forgettable.So what to do with the end of the trilogy? Of course you return to what brought you here and that's exactly what this feels like--COD4 re-imagined with parts of MW2.  You get some sniper missions, an AC-130 mission, killed off another protagonist, dropped the Eiffel tower (rather flippantly too). Then they peppered in some parts from MW2 like the seal team mission, breaching rooms and the scene from Rio, but it's in another 3rd world country this time. And tried to shock you with civilian casualties again. This sounds like a lot of content within a short time-frame and it really is.  I enjoyed it quite a lot and would say if you play a lot of single player games, then this one is right up there.  This is probably a better game than COD4, but since it came 4 years after, I docked it a star for lack of originality.It's a shame that all the 10 year old fanboys came out to review MW3 and Battlefield 3, thus skewing the overall score for each.  If you're deciding between the two campaigns, this is the far superior one.  (Didn't realize how long this got.  Sorry for the length.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

It takes place in Costa Rica 10 years after the events of \"Snake Eater.\" As Snake (Big Boss) you're both trying to build an army by recruiting soldiers while also trying to stop a potential nuclear war. The story revolves around the creation of a nuclear deterrent in the form of Peace Walker, an unmanned walking mech capable of launching nukes as a defensive mechanism. Snake is brought into the middle of this when he hears a recording of what might be The Boss' voice, proving she may still be alive, and goes to investigate. What makes \"Peace Walker\" a great handheld game is its structure. The missions are short but sweet and there's a ton of them, all having good replay value as you'll want to earn S-Ranks for each. The gameplay is made a bit more forgiving, allowing for more generous accuracy of shots, etc., and better suits the hardware. The coolest feature is being able to extract incapacitated enemies (you attach a balloon to their belt and watch them go shooting up into the sky) back to your home base, view their stats, and use them for things like crafting gear. This is important as bosses will require that you have the necessary weapons and equipment before they can be defeated. Also included is online 2-4 player co-op and 3v3 versus multiplayer. The nature of the fractured structure does hurt the flow of the story though, which I thought was lacking compared to previous \"MGS\" games anyways. The scenes are beautifully illustrated but lack the strong impact the series is known for. It's impossible to deny however that this is an amazingly well-made PSP game, and among the very best on the system.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2014"}

This game has it all - a good story that has good pacing, nice characters, very good gun play, lots of exploration, excellent character development and great game mechanics.As I said, finding negative things to say about this game is challenging, but if I had to name a few annoying aspects of this game, they would probably start with the main character, Lara.  Call me sexist, but listening to her high-pitched whining can get a little annoying - especially early on in the game.  Before she becomes a \"hardened explorer/combatant\" she starts out a little green and girly.  Also, about midway through the game, it seems that every enemy has an unlimited supply of molotovs and dynamite to hurl at you, which can get a little annoying in a firefight.  Finally, there are a few points in the game that require perfect timing in a certain sequence, and failure results in immediate death.  That would be fine if there wasn't so much going on so fast that it was hard to see what was coming.  I one scene, you are being washed away in a rapid stream and you must avoid branches and other debris while shooting barriers with a shotgun...I think I had to do it over about 5 times before getting it right.Aside from those small annoyances, the game is simply great.  The game felt a little short to me, but it's really not.  I think I just had such a good time playing it, that when I finally beat it, I wanted more.  I certainly look forward to the sequel and I absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of adventure/3rd person shooter games.  This is actually one game that I didn't mind spending $60.00 on.PROS- great storyline, characters and voice acting- great visuals/graphics- great sound effects/musical score- excellent controls/shooter mechanics- excellent player development system- excellent weapon upgrade system- lots of bonus exploration outside of the main storyCONS- Lara Croft starts out a little whiny and annoying- enemies have unlimited explosives, which can get annoying- a couple of the real-time scenes are a little difficult to navigateOverall: 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

We got this with the thought that the kids would be able to play more with their friends. We have found that many of the games are geared towards the family and are a lot of fun. Wii Sport is a game we play most often. Wii Fit is probably second. Just these two games are worth buying this system. Also, the fact that you can browse the internet, etc., makes this a no brainer. If you are looking for the hottest graphics, etc., then an XBOX or PS3 is probably better, but if you have you kids, and/or you are looking for fun things to play, this is the system for you.

The good:  the cities are incredibly dense and detailed.  It's amazing how much there is going on there, and how good it looks.  You really get a feel for the city when you go for the bird's eye view.  Another positive is the sword fighting - maybe it's not the best in the world, but I have fun with it.  As for the bad, the game is awfully repetitive.  If they had varied the game a bit, it could have overcome its other shortfall - the incredibly weak AI.Still, it all adds up for a very enjoyable game.

{"product_name":"B0000D12XI","description":"In 2001,Max Paynearrived to set the benchmark for action gaming, earning countless awards and revolutionizing the genre with cinematic combat sequences fuelled by the groundbreaking use of slow motion and compulsive narrative-driven gameplay. Now, working together with Rockstar Games' New York-based production team, Remedy has combinedMax Payne's hallmark gameplay with all new innovations and unmatched production values.Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payneis set to raise the bar for action games all over again when it's released fall 2003.","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"A really good game","reviewText":"I played the original Max Payne a long time ago.  I enjoyed the gameplay, and the plot was decent, but I really didn't think enough of it to look for a sequel.  When looking for a new game to play, Max Payne 2 came up, and I decided based off of the original that #2 would probably be worth its $9 pricetag.That turned out to be an understatement.  Max Payne 2 is one of the best PC games out there.GAMEPLAYThe game is a 3rd person shooter that works really really well.  Max controls great, and the bullet time is fun to play with.  The Bullet time has been revamped so its available more often in this one (which makes the game a little easier), but also makes it a little more fun.The ragdoll physics go just a little bit over the top, but only just a little.  It's a nice treat when enemies are knocked back by the force of your shots, tumbling off balconies and such.  Sometimes it ends up with humerous/cinematic events like shooting someone with a shotgun, having their body fly back 3 feet through an open window, hit a scaffolding on one side to use the wood planks to catapult the paint cans up in the air which land on top of the corpse just after it hits the ground.  It's an added bonus when it happens in slow motion.While it's nothing new, Max has a satisfying array of weaponry for every occasion: dual pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, a sniper rifle, etc.  The molotov cocktails are fun as well.The game can probably be beaten in about 8 hours of gameplay, but is fun enough in both gameplay and story to make a second and third run pretty good as well.THE SOUND / GRAPHICSThe graphics on the game are pretty good and can even run well on lower end machines (by today's standards).  People move lifelike (with the exception of when they're dead...but you wouldn't move lifelike then I suppose...).  Facial expressions are well done and expressive.  The environments look lived in, and are appropriately dark and gritty.The voice acting is superb.  There's not a single poorly done voice that I noticed, and Max's voiceovers are terrific if you like detective-style noire.I did have some difficulty with the sound though.  I did some research and found I was far from the only one, but Rockstar Games appears to be ignoring the problem.  Some of the ingame dialogue will come in extremely soft, something to do with the center sound channel in stereo.  I turned the subtitles on to not miss the dialogue, but because the voice acting is so good it's a shame to have to miss some of it.CHARACTERS / STORYThis is where the game truely shines, and this is where the unexpected suprise came from.  The story is simply great.  Max is already a well developed character.  He is more than just a macho, gun toting maniac like most games.  You sympathize with him, and you're on his side.  His voiceovers reveal his inner thoughts, his guilt, his conscience, his humanity.  The other major characters are equally well done and complex.The story is well done to with twists and turns and excellent pacing.  It's a very mature game, though by mature I don't mean blood and boobies, I just mean complex themes and moral ambiguity... many shades of grey instead of strictly good and bad.  Its dark and gritty without being rediculously so.  It makes some good use of symbolism, but not in a heavy-handed manner and is overall a very satisfyinh tale from start to finish.OVERALLThis is a great game for fans of action and old black & white detective stories.  I'm glad I decided to pick this game up, and I recomend it to anyone else who has $10 and a little time to spare.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2007"}

Overall it is very addicting to see the storyline progress and I like the way you can affect the outcomes. There are supposedly 8 endings. I am on the last part of Stage 7 (8 stages total), and I've played for about 9 hours 45 minutes. So the game is pretty short... I did not mess with the arcade game in the bar though. But if you go for the different endings and two different girls, you will obviously have a lot of replay value. Catherine has many funny moments and everyone can relate to the relationship issues in here. The puzzles are CHALLENGING which is what I like. There were times when I was very frustrated screaming at the TV, and a few had me redoing them for over half an hour because I couldn't solve them correctly. People who get frustrated easily will probably not enjoy this game. The stages actually require you to think and use your brain. I wish there were more games like this. If you get stuck, it's better to just restart from the checkpoint or do something differently because there aren't infinite ways to solve each puzzle. You're either doing it right or wrong. Bottom line Catherine is UNIQUE and one of the best PS3 games I've played in a while. I rarely buy a full price game freshly released but this was definitely worth my money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2011"}

Conker and Banjo both belong to Rare (which, in turn, belongs to Microsoft), and thus Nintendo is unable to bring us the Diddy Kong Racing in all of its 64-bit glory. I played this game with friends when I was a youngster, for nostalgia's sake, I picked it up again about a year ago. I'm happy to report that the game is not only still fun, but that it holds up remarkably well even today.Graphics:How were they then? They were amazing back then. It's hard to believe that Rare was able to make such an impressive looking game. The environments are varied and the characters have a surprising amount of detail.How are they now? They're still among the N64's best, and only a little age can be detected. Diddy Kong's face could use a little polishing (which I'm sure they did in the DS remake), as could a few of the other characters. But as the tracks themselves, they look good. The only things that look like real relics of the past are the occasional 2D graphics in 3D space, and given that I've seen a few Wii games employ the same effect... maybe it doesn't look all that bad by today's standards. HehMusic:The music is in the upper echelons of N64 sound. There are a surprising number of melodies, and to the best of my knowledge, few if any are reused on different tracks. It's all high-geared racing music, with the exception of some the Frosty Village tracks (which sound like Christmas racing music).Gameplay:In the end, retro gamers look to DKR for its awesome gameplay. It's the only kart racing game I've played that has a proper storyline and an actual quest-like adventure mode. The multiplayer is still intense 4-player action, which also allows you to put AI racers alongside you and your friends.And once you've beaten the game, there's still more content. There's a second adventure mode with the mirror tracks, and after that, there's a very challenging time trial mode which allows you to unlock T.T.. And after that, there are cheat codes (one of which turns the one-player mode into a two player mode, and another allows you to bolster the AI of the computer kart racers, which extends replay value well into forever).The only thing that's missing is an online mode, which Rare was kind enough to give us in the DS version. But what that version lacks is Conker and Banjo. Any game called Diddy Kong Racing without a redneck bear and a drunken squirrel is not Diddy Kong Racing.Kart racing is not even my favorite genre of game, but I really believe this is the finest title the N64 has to offer. It's even better than Goldeneye or Ocarina of Time. So, DKR is far more than a Mario Kart 64 clone. Mario Kart 64 wishes it had even half the depth and quality of this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0000631WI","description":"InStuntman, you'll perform dangerous stunts in three or four vehicles as you play the part of a Hollywood stuntman for hire. You'll need to be good: the stunts will get harder, and you must accumulate skills to progress from low-budget productions to multimillion-dollar Hollywood blockbusters. Each stunt consists of a series of clearly defined objectives, which can range from 180-degree spins to perfectly timed jumps, dramatic barrel rolls, and T-bone smashes. To succeed, the player must achieve all or some of each scene's set objectives. Stunts take place on movie sets in six different countries around the world; completing each stunt rewards you with bonus items for use in the Stunt Arena, which you create yourself.Stuntmanwas developed with the help of one of the movies' most experienced stuntmen, Vic Armstrong.","reviewerName":"Chris Peters","summary":"After the novelty wears off, you'll wonder why you bought it","reviewText":"Stuntman is extremely overated.  The theme is interesting enough that I can see why some people defend the game so strongly.  Acting out stunts from your favorite movies is something anyone wants to do.  Yet poor design decisions and sloppy controls has made Stuntman much, much harder than it needs to be.  You MUST rent this game before you buy it, trust me.I just don't like being forced to do the same, limited thing over and over again in a game.  You have to perform the EXACT stunts the game wants you to, in the schedule it requires, and the slightest mistake means instant death.  Hitting ANYTHING in the level, any building, car, or even a fence or sign, and you are forced to restart.  Fall behind even 1 second and the game only gets harder.  And speaking of time, I don't like waiting 20 seconds for the game to load after just 15 seconds of gameplay.  When you are forced to replay a level 50-60 times, I would estimate that you've got 10-20 HOURS of load time to sit through.  It gets old fast.The game physics are extremely chaotic.  Collisions and jumps at any speed or angle can cause a flip or spin-out all too easy, and usually force you to restart.  Even minor steering adjustments can cause a spin-out and cost you a hard played level.  Hitting a small curb has actually flipped my car onto its back, more than once.The levels are tight and restrictive, with most obstacles appearing suddenly from behind a hill or corner, with no time to react.  You memorize this game, not play it, and as you play each level encountering something new will most likely kill you immediately. There will never be that magic moment you find in games like GTA3 or Tony Hawk, when you've learned the skills to start improvising, reacting to new obstacles as you encounter them and making up your game as you go.  No sir, not this game.Calling Stuntman \"difficult\" isn't accurate enough.  Frustrating, too restrictive, poor controls, and annoying are better descriptors.  I wouldn't even recommend renting this game unless you enjoy insane obstacles. Buy it with risk.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"The Series Takes an Enormous Step with this Sequel","reviewText":"My hot and cold experience with Capcom&#65533;s infamous Survival Horror series, Resident Evil, has been something I&#65533;ve endured for years without the satisfaction of actually defeating any of the games. It&#65533;s a group of games that makes it incredibly easy to become stuck, frustrated or cornered, and as a result give up altogether. Though I enjoyed the unique perspective of the first game, the integrated elements of past horror movies, and the whole premise of an underground city filled with zombies, I really had a hard time correctly rationing my ammo, my game-saving ink ribbons and my time. It&#65533;s a strange marriage, a brainless, balls-out action title merged with a time consuming, brain teasing puzzle game. Capcom teases you into adopting a &#65533;Final Fight&#65533; mindset, then completely derails the player by halting the action altogether and throwing them coldly into a &#65533;King&#65533;s Quest&#65533; style, item gathering and puzzle solving mission. That&#65533;s like hopping into a Dodge Viper, pulling it out to the highway, and shifting from fifth to first without slowing down.As with any sequel, RE2 borrows a lot from its predecessor. The controls, the camera angles, the weapons, the enemies&#65533; everything is very close, if not the same. But, again as with any sequel, this second installment improves upon the original in every way. Perhaps the most notable improvement of them all lies in the storyline itself. Comparing the stories of the first game and the second is like pitting Sam Raimi&#65533;s first &#65533;Evil Dead&#65533; against the recent blockbuster &#65533;The Ring.&#65533; Sure, they&#65533;re technically the same genre, but the differences in budget, acting talent and overall production quality aren&#65533;t even in the same ballpark.Chapter two is, for all intents and purposes, a true sequel, tough perhaps this is a sequel where the filmmakers couldn&#65533;t convince any of the original stars to return for a second run. It picks up three months after the storyline of the first game, and ties in closer and closer with the original plot as the story goes along. Put simply, the virus that created the zombies of Resident Evil 1 has spilled into the city streets and infected an entire town. As either Leon, a rookie police officer enduring his first day on the job, or Claire, the sister of RE1&#65533;s Chris, you enter the horrific world of Raccoon City and attempt to save the world from the brink of disaster one more time. The two strangers meet thanks to a stroke of luck, agree that the Police station is the safest place to hold out, and are almost immediately separated before reaching their target. Once there, it&#65533;s almost business as usual again&#65533; firing on monsters, uncovering an elaborate maze of tricks, gimmicks and puzzles, and shooting for the head of the evil Umbrella Corporation once again.The graphics of the second installment have taken a big step forward from the first game. Both the main characters and the creatures themselves move much more realistically this time around. Zombies will lunge when you get close, they&#65533;ll stumble backwards when they take a couple bullets. Leon and Claire, as well, show the effects of the damage they&#65533;ve taken. Both have three different methods of walking; an uninjured trot, a mildly harmed walk with an arm around their midsection, and a nasty limp, dragging their weapon behind them as they go. The more damage you take, the slower you move and the more likely you are to take additional hits. Every character, human and zombie, now comes fully equipped with an independently moving head, which locks onto the nearest moving object and follows it, staring, as it moves around the room.If you&#65533;ve played the first Resident Evil, or any installment since, you understand the gameplay of this series. It really hasn&#65533;t changed all that much in the last six years. You either love it or you can&#65533;t stand it. The action is presented from a series of static camera shots, overlooking all the action and switching  angles as you leave the plane of vision. This setup offers positives and negatives; for one, the backgrounds are much more detailed than they could have possibly been rendered in three dimensions. Unfortunately, the rapid changing of screens and immovable camera angles still make it easy for your enemies to get the drop on you. The zombies, lickers and evil plants can see you from down the hallway, but you can&#65533;t see them until they&#65533;re right on top of you.The audio is the only portion of chapter two that isn&#65533;t a notable improvement over the first. It&#65533;s still a strange, subpar performance of tense symphonic arrangements mixed with elevator music. It&#65533;s quiet at the right moments, it crescendos at the right time, there&#65533;s just something strange about it. Something that doesn&#65533;t fit right. Many of the sound effects are carried over from the first game, but they&#65533;ve been joined by some all new samples. Zombies still make the same characteristic shuffle when they move, they still occupy themselves by mumbling incoherently, and it&#65533;s still entertaining as hell. Leon, Claire, Ada, the Chief, and the other half dozen characters with speaking roles put on a notably better performance than the talent in the first game. This isn&#65533;t emotional, professional-quality voice acting yet, but it&#65533;s a world and a half better than Chris and Jill&#65533;s boring, unenthusiastic delivery in the first title.All accounted for, Resident Evil 2 is everything a sequel should be. It integrated many of the elements that made the first game successful, improved upon the areas in which the original was lacking, picked up the story and ran with it, and delivered an overly solid presentation. There are still some major flaws with both the gameplay and the story, but on the whole this is a big step in the right direction. Resident Evil 1 was an unexpected surprise, solid but not necessarily legendary. Part two really put the series on the map as a serious force.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2003"}

What makes the Wii version so much better is that it uses the GameCube edition's graphics, the PS2 version's extra content, plus Wii specific controls and mashes it together into on sweet combo. What's so cool about the controls is that you can now control where the gun goes via the Wii mote and you control Leon/Ashley/Ada with the C stick. This makes aiming so much easier than the gamepad. You can now use your knife with a quick swipe of the Wiimote or you can still do it the hard way.My favorite feature is that RE4 uniquely uses the Wiimote's bult in speaker. When you blow up heads, reload, shoot, jump, it all goes through the speaker and it sounds great. Capcom really put effort into this port and tried making it somewhat different. All the rest of RE4 is intact including the great story where Leon has to help rescue the President's daughter from an evil Spanish cult, the iffy voice work is still here and so is everything else. With 20 hours+ game play and the extra Ada missions your sure to spend loads of time with this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Roman","summary":"Trust me, it hurts to give this 2 stars.","reviewText":"I absolutely adored the first Animal Crossing game for the GameCube. I'd play it every single day for about 2 years, filling up my catalog, hunting for bugs, fishing, getting all the fossils, trading items with friends, etc. I even went the extra mile and got the E-Reader accessory just so I could get surprises from the Animal Crossing cards that were made. For me, Animal Crossing was easily one of the top 3 GameCube games, and I put it in my top 25 favorite games list not that long ago on here. Then...the DS game Wild World came out, and I just couldn't get into it. The 'rolling world' effect was annoying, there wasn't much new content that was fun, and I didn't care to get another copy when it got stolen. When City Folk here came out a few years ago, it didn't look much different from Wild World, and I noticed that Nintendo was very disappointed with sales for the game, even after they hyped the whole voice chat accessory for it. Well, I've recently given this game a chance, and it hurts me to say that I can have more fun with the original than this newer version, which I almost just called an upgrade, but it's anything bur that. But before I get started, if you're new to the Animal Crossing games, you can change my ratings to 4 stars for both fun and the overall rating, as it'll be fresh to you.City Folk plays exactly like the previous games, where you start your life in a new city full of talking animals, digging up fossils, catching fish and bugs to fill the town museum, helping people deliver items to one another, and take part in town events like fishing tournaments and even holidays. When you enter the city, you don't have any money, and run a few errands for Tom Nook, the local shop owner. He actually lets you live in one of the little houses nearby, but you'll be in debt, and need to pay it off in order to get a bigger house, and for him to get a bigger store. And that's the main part of the game, more or less, though the game really doesn't have any objectives that need to be met, and it never really 'ends'. You can see the credits on saturdays when K.K. Slider shows up to play music, and the credits play while he sings.On paper, the game sounds really boring, but it's fun and engaging, if you're new at least. There are many different kinds of fish and bugs to collect, with many only being available at certain times of the day and during certain months. Some bugs are incredibly fast, and can take some players years to catch if they're not quick enough. Fossils are dug up, identified at the museum, and if they don't have what you brought in yet, they'll take it and display the bones in the appropriate section. Of course, you don't have do donate fish, bugs, paintings or fossils- you can sell them to Tom Nook, trade them with other villagers if they ask for one, or just display them in your own home. Decorating your house is one of the more fun elements in the game, as Tom Nook only has a couple of items for sale each day that you can put in your home, with new stuff coming in all the time. You'll want to pay off that debt fast, and make your house bigger and bigger so you can make room for the cooler stuff, as you home barely qualifies for a shack when you start out. Wallpaper, carpet, beds, couches, dressers, ninja swords, ponds, bonsai trees, there are hundreds of things you can decorate your house with. Some items are themed, like the Lovely series which has a heart design with everything, or the Kiddie series which resembles an indoor play area for toddlers, complete with elephant slide. You can have up to 4 different people in the same town, and can send letters to one another along with items to help them out. It's pretty fun competing to see who can get the most things in the museum. There's also the online mode which is like the Wild World feature, but a bit smoother of course.I just made it sound like fun, but the thing is- I just basically repeated what I'd say for anyone playing the GameCube game, aside from the online play. There are barely any new features here that I can say anything good about, and then there's another problem- there just isn't that much to do. I remember talking to villagers in the original, and they'd almost always have something for me to deliver to another villager, or want me to buy something of theirs. In City Folk, I'd actually be surprised when a villager would have me run an errand, since most of the time they'd just spew some cute lines or ask me to change their catchphrase. Unless you have a lot of friends with the game that you can visit online, there's not going to be much to do aside from the usual fishing/bug hunting. But what about the City, the key feature here that's even mentioned in the game's name? Very disappointing. Gracie, the stylin' uppity giraffe, now has her own store full of overpriced furniture and clothing. There's a theater where you can watch someone give odd performances, and walk out with a new expression for your character to do while walking around. The black market businessman Redd is back, but he requires both an invitation AND a bit of money to enter his shop now. And there's also a barber, shoe shiner, and Katrina the fortune teller has a building as well. It sounds like a lot, but it's usually a waste of time coming here unless you REALLY want to fill your catalog and spend a lot of Bells on Gracie's stuff. It's not much of a city, especially when everything's on one side of the street.My other problems have to do with minor things and the controls. The main complaint I have as far as minor things go (aside from the rolling world) is that when you run around on the grass, which is what covers the majority of your town, it deteriorates quickly, resulting in your town turning into a desert wasteland. You'll need to plant flowers over any dead areas in order to restore the grass, but it a lot of time. I guess this was made so that characters could create paths to areas they frequent the most, but when you're chasing after super fast dragonflies, you're going to be killing off a lot of grass quick. So...unless you don't care about how your town looks, you're going to be walking most of the time. But the controls are something that I couldn't get used to. The game uses the nunchuck for movement with the analog stick, and the Wii remote for selecting things from the item screen. Why? Why can't we just use the analog stick for everything?In the end, the whole game feels rushed, and I can't recommend this to longtime fans. If you've never played an AC game before though, you're in for a treat, as I have fond memories from getting into this series years ago and having everything feel so new to me. This is truly a unique franchise, but I hate seeing a lack of progress on Nintendo's part with this version. I hate that the best new feature to me was that you can take pictures in-game and save them to the SD card, but even then, you can only have one picture saved on the menu at a time.But you know what? The Wii IS backwards compatible with GameCube games...and the old Animal Crossing is cheaper than this. So...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2011"}

I understood that because there may have been a lock-out this game had features not presented before..not sure what they meant by that ? Anyway like always they change things from what worked and what did'nt and still never keep the real good ones and Add most of what people ask for....I enjoy this game but like all sports games when you play at times its like you are pee-wee players and the CPU is the Pro's....then you have to in the middle of the game turn it off and wait and play later ( I guess that is true in most sports games, well the ones i played anyway) But over all, i like the game and they took out the speed boost sort of thing i noticed, and now unless your just plain fortunate you can get to the line and through a hole before the entire defense stands there waiting on you to get the ball. I also noticed far to many dropped passes on offense and especially on defense...balls in your hands but can not catch it. And the worse of all I see all the time when you light up the player to make the play he normally runs away from the opposing player ( example- would be )-> If he catches a long pass and my DB is close and I light him up to intercept or to make the tackle, when I light him up his first movement is away from the opposing player..and an immediate tug on the stick is needed and mostly that little shutter causes you to miss him and worse he always runs 3 times faster then you do...one of those moments you shut the game off in mid play to settle it down and you go back later and play and it does not happen as often.[ is that built in to drive you carzy or what ? a Madden joke maybe ?] Anyway in honesty, its fun to play and the graphics are great, the commentators are really boring and the same lines over and over well its madden I guess we can not expect anything more. I gave it 5 Stars for fun , but only 4 Stars for overall...simply because of those same nagging gliches that drive you crazy, especially when its a close game and its near the end and your winning by 3 or something and nothing you do stops his passing or running, and you can not tackle and or sack the QB even when you run over him and even with double coverage his guy always catches the ball and runs through your guys and runs 3 times faster then you can and when you light your man up he runs the opposite way and the CPU scores no matter what .....yelp...its normal Madden game .","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}
