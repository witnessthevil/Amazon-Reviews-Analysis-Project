The E.A. hate train has started again, and it's unwarranted. I've been playing Madden since it was introduced on the Sega Genesis in 1989. Mind you, I've been disappointed with Madden this gen with the exception of Madden 10 which was actually very good. 11 and 12 were actually worse. But now we got Madden 13. It feels and plays great! the new animations and physics engine is pretty tight. It has some weird moments at times, but 90% of the time, it feels very smooth and convincing. Canned animations are definitely a thing of the past. Graphics are amazing. Great life on the sidelines, great weather effects and field degradition and excellent presentation. They actually did away with ESPN, taking a big risk, they went with the guys from CBS. Sims and Nantz are at the helm and do a pretty good job. A few hitches here and there, but we got a very decent presentation. While not endorsed by CBS, it still feels like CBS is doing the presentation stuff. I love the game speed also. I actually prefer to play at a \"very slow\" game speed and it feels like a real game. The passing feels very organic and sticking in the pocket is key. Throwing on the run again is very risky this year and you can't make the cheese plays like you used to. Online seems veyr stable. I actually played 3 games my first night on launch day and amazingly they booted right up and I had zero lag. People complain so much about online but E.A.'s servers are actually very good compared to the 2K servers which I continue to struggle with on their NBA franchise. As for people not saying Franchise is on the game. Guess again, it's just embedded through Connected Careers and there is tons to do. Go to Connected Careers, choose \"Coach\" mode, and start your franchise.  It's just a different approach. Lordy haters. You can also play as a Legend from the Past like Barry Sanders or Reggie White. Great stuff. So now...I have to say... First play the game before making a review.Make no mistake. Madden 13 is not a perfect football game, but it's more than likely the best Madden ever made. They listened to the fans and they got a new engine and new physics engine. It's got some issues here and there, but overall you will love it. I highly recommend it for any self righteous Madden fan.For a good solid review from an unbiased sports game site, Operation Sports has a very honest and straight up review on the game. 8.5 out of 10. I'm agreeing totally, best Madden ever made. Enjoy it for what it is, a great playing football game. If something is missing from last year that annoys you, then that's fine. But for me, I'm all for fixing the engine and making a new game before adding goodies.[...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Excellent puzzle designAesthetically and stylistically brilliantAppropriately understated soundCons:Most players will finish it in fewer than 10 hoursBattles are too easy","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"!CO","reviewText":"I could not type enough exclamation points to get across to you how good this game is. You are Ico, a 12 year old boy that was born with horns. Because of this, he is exiled to a Gormenghastian castle (only bigger) where he is locked up in a stone-shelled sarcophagus.Then the earthquake hits.His sarcophagus falls to the stone floor and cracks open, letting Ico out. But Ico is unconscious. He has this dream.When he awakens, the game starts. Some of the rooms in this castle are HUGE. One thing that I like about this game is that you can move the camera around with the R2 button. When a game boasts such beautiful graphics and settings as ICO, this is an outstanding feature to have.Less than an hour into the game, you find a ghostly but glowing princess locked up in a cage and free her. In most games, you are struggling to reach the princess. In ICO, you already have the princess. But now, the question is How Do You Get Out? The earthquake has caused bridges to collapse, stones to crumble, forcing you to do things that most people wouldn't do--like jump onto windmill blades or chandeliers.The sound effects in this game are also fantastic. For one, throughout the whole game, Ico breaths heavily. Probably because of all the physical exertion he's putting up with, but one could almost feel the adrenaline going through this young boy's veins, especially when he first breaks out, that sudden urge of I MUST GET OUT OF HERE!As far as graphics go, I have NEVER seen a tree look so realistic in-game. Every LEAF has light and shadow on it, both of which change when the limb sways back and forth. Also impressive are the effects of sunlight filtering through windows.Unlike some puzzle games, the puzzles in Ico are logical. There is very little back-tracking, and nothing ridiculous like one of those silly Nintendo-ish find 5 golden banana's to unlock the door. I have never been stumped by a puzzle in Ico, just gotten impatient (never frustrated). And when you go on the internet to find the answer, you will often feel stupid.But you will not be solving puzzles throughout the whole game. Black Shadows come out of dark pools and attempt to walk off with your princess. The shadowmen are nothing more than 2D shadow shapes that are blurred around the edges, walking around your screen, but they look pretty impressive.Everything following the events of the opening of the Main Gate is fantastic, especially the last battle. And guess what? Even the last battle is a sort of puzzle. Once the credits roll, hang around, because once they're done the game is not entirely over yet.The Playstation 2 is my favorite console system. Unfortunately, some of the games that I was hoping to give 5 stars (Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2, etc) disappointed me in one way or another. Ico doesn't disappoint and fans of this game will be glad to know that there is a sequel in the works.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2002"}

We're talking hours and hours and hours of racing and unlocking.There's also new weapons, like being able to turn into a Bullet Bill and shoot down the track knocking your foes right out of the way. There's also a squid power this time around that shoots black ink on your foes screen, blocking out their version for a short period of time.All the old classic moves are back as well, like banana skins, red and green shells, etc etc. Great fun!For the first time ever in a Mario Kart game, now you can go ONLINE and compete against players from all over the world with a wifi connection, OR get this...if you have the game, but your friends dont, up to 8 people locally can play the game using only ONE game pack!Bottom line, if you're new to Mario Kart, or a veteran of the series, there's simply SOO much to love about this beautiful and amazingly fun game.10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2009"}

Rage installed cleanly on my 4 year old Systemax (8 gigs, etc.) HOWEVER, I DID get the 'game has stopped working' shutdown on first try after installation. The solution, for me, was a simple video card driver update (ATI), then it ran smoothly. BTW, I don't mind the Steam account login as many others seem to. Before I go any further, KUDOS to ID for: INSTANT SAVES!!!!!  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!!!!  I despise the increasing absence of instant saves in modern games. The graphics in Rage are detailed and nice, sound appropriate, weapons work well, very, very 'corridored', but there's enough creative interest to keep me coming back. Characters are ok - (not like Alyx, of course), and the enemies are fun to knock off. Missions are pretty much 'same-oh'. I do get kinda tired of driving hither and yon, but... no game is perfect.

I have played it long enough to now write about the controls with the knowledge that they will not get any more comfortable with extended play.With that said, I can say with confidence that the engineers who designed this handheld have doomed it to an early demise due to unbelievably leaving out analog control.  It is amazing that they would take the time to create a system capable of displaying beautiful and fluid 3D graphics (Mario 64 is amazing looking) but then utilize a control scheme last used on the SNES which specialized in 2D scrollers.  Just think of 3rd person 3D games you play on your home console..do you ever use the control pad to control the character or the analog stick?  I will bet you use the analog stick and could not even imagine using the digital pad.  The Nintendo DS asks (no make that demands) that we forget all the advances in 3D gaming and go back to the bad old days of digital control.  The \"virtual\" analog control offered by the touch screen is completely ineffective and amazing frustrating.  This system badly needed an analog control stick (like the PSP has) even more that it needed a gimmicky touch screen.  Basically the DS will be relegated to mini game type products and an occasional First Person Shooter (which stylus control could be ok), but any hopes of 3D adventure games is totally ruined.In closing, I compare Mario DS to an amazing looking Thanksgiving Turkey that is made of plastic.  It wonderful to look at, but you cannot actually enjoy eating it.Shame on Nintendo for overlooking analog control.  The saddest thing is that they will probably have to scrap the DS and come out with another handheld that has an analog stick. effectively screwing all of us who bought this flawed product.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2005"}

For very personal reasons, John must find a way to stop the zombies and find a cure to the condition. There is a truly creepy feel to the game that zombie horror movie lovers will enjoy and the interplay between the living and dead adds real depth to the game play.

They are a company that plays at greatness constantly, but can never quite find the correct balance of story and gameplay. At least, not sinceStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic, a game which I still hold today as my most favorite game of all time (in addition to being my favorite story of all time). But ever since the days of Revan and the Ebon Hawk, Bioware has since attempted to bring that true RPG experience back to the players a few times over. And while they've yet to fully succeed in my eyes, this game certainly comes the closest.DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS is a tale of dark fantasy that takes place in the nation known as Ferelden. It hearkens back to Bioware's earlier days in the gaming industry, when they were primarily known for their FORGOTTEN REALMS games, based on the popular Dungeons and Dragons setting. The land is being swarmed by an ancient menace called the darkspawn, creatures left over after a group of mages attempted to conquer Heaven and failed horribly. With the dark armies in motion, the player must join an equally-ancient group, the Grey Wardens, to quell the invasion before it destroys Ferelden.I apologize ahead of time for my long-windedness here!PROS:--These days, if you play a Bioware game, then you play it for the STORY. Bioware have become the eminent storytellers of the video game industry with games likeStar Wars Knights of the Old Republic,Jade Empire, and the most recentMass Effect. The story for DRAGON AGE does not disappoint in the least, and I would say that it is one of the best ever put to disc.--For the first time in a Bioware game, the Taris Problem has been solved. You know what I mean: the beginning part of a Bioware game that you will be doomed to repeat over and over should you have the wanting for a second playthrough. The part of the game where you're almost on autopilot the entire time, like Eden Prime from MASS EFFECT or Taris from KotOR (Endar Spire, Undercity, Swoop Race, Ebon Hawk, lightsaber--done!). The Problem is solved by giving the player several options for a unique beginning each time you play. There are three different races, each with one or more origin stories (six in all), with your choice of gender altering each of those in turn.I chose to go with a male city elf to start out. Your origin story isn't something that's left behind when you get into the bulk of the game. It will constantly come into play, all the way up until the grand finale, which makes the game seem that much more dynamic. At the end of my first playthrough, I started up a female human noble, which was dramatically different from my last experience, and packed just as much punch. There is a great opportunity here for the player to walk away feeling like a unique story has been created just for them. I know that's how I felt.--The CHARACTERS that will eventually become your traveling companions are marvelously characterized. Each is unique, likable, and confidently voiced. You'll find yourself investing a lot into them and how they interact with you. I loved them all, with Alistair, Morrigan, and Oghren standing out the most to me. I dare you not to laugh when you start discovering Oghren's inability to handle his drink.--The GAMEPLAY is applied very well on the Xbox 360, considering this game was meant to be played with a keyboard. You're given a set of six hotkeys for your various talents and items, and a radial wheel that pauses the game so that you can choose talents that you weren't able to slot. It handles very well, though with a class like the rogue, it's a pain to pause the game to select another sword attack when the action is so furious.--The gift system is a big plus for me. Giving a character a gift raises their opinion of you, which unlocks hidden talents. But, listening to your friends' stories actually pays off. One of the characters loved the smell of leather, so I have him some leather boots, which unlocked a cutscene and a conversation that led to more revelations about their past. A terrific concept that I hope is implemented in further games.--As you might have experienced with other Bioware games, the worst thing about them is that they end. After investing so much time into your friends and the story, sometimes that drastic cut to black can be a downer. To ease the pain, there are several different endings to fall into, depending on your choices throughout the game, and a lovely epilogue at the end that gives a feeling of closure, rather than a cliffhanger.--To touch on the graphics argument, I found them to be very adequate for a game like this. Not once in the game was I disgusted with the quality, with the exception of the dungeons, all of which looked as though they could have been made overnight.CONS:--This is a very hard game. I set the difficulty on Normal initially, and I died on every boss, in every city...all the time. This game shows you no mercy. If you want a pleasant experience, I highly recommend that you swallow your pride and set it to Casual. Even then, be prepared to die.--I suppose I'm spoiled from playing OBLIVION and FALLOUT 3 so much, because I can't stand a disjointed RPG setting any longer. You will find no shortage of loading screens in this game, they are everywhere. Between cities, between streets, and sometimes between rooms, no matter how small the house is. I once entered a house the size of a shack, and there was a loading screen to get to the top floor. It was very hard for me to get used to it all, and I'd like Bioware to get to a point where their games feel more like an open world, instead of a collection of stages.Although, I must give them props for implementing the campsite, which is easily one of my favorite parts of the game. At any point, when you're traveling between cities, you can choose to go to a campsite, where all of your companions will be lounging about. Many great discussions can pop up here, and it really makes it feel a lot more like true fantasy: traveling the world with good friends.--I hate dungeons. I think there was a time, back in the day, when dungeon crawlers had their place in the world. And maybe they still do, but not to the extent that Bioware implements them here. This is a long game. Skipping most of the sidequests, my first playthrough clocked in at just over 33 hours. You will be spending most of that time underground, in dungeons so uninspired that I swore that some of them were exactly the same.To me, they were boring. They took hours to complete, were filled with similar enemies, and often offered little reward beyond finally letting you progress the story. Again, I must give props to the story, because these parts of the game seemed like major speedbumps, but I pressed on just to see the outcome of what I was doing. (Special mention goes to the \"Broken Circle\" quest. One of the WORST gaming experiences I have ever had.) In further sequels, I would love if there were more things to do out in the open. Pleaaaase.--The Bioware Formula is in effect here. Whether it's collecting starmaps in KotOR or coordinates in MASS EFFECT, you will be doing something similar here: collecting armies. If you've played other Bioware games, how the story progresses might not surprise you.--As is common with games of this size, there are a number of glitches that put a damper on certain key moments. Dialogue went unvoiced a few times and some triggers wouldn't activate, which required a reload. There were no game-ruining glitches, but there were enough that it became noticeable.CONCLUSION:Don't get me wrong, there is much I hated about this game, but there is also so much I liked. The lore is as original as fantasy can get these days. The characters are amazing, and you will be sorry to see them go when the credits roll. The story, while predictable, is very entertaining. The combat is accessible, fully customizable, and fun. All of these save DRAGON AGE from being a mediocre RPG, to making it one of the must-play games of the year.In the end, I desperately wanted to see my character's, as well as my companions', stories continue. The game's epilogue promises further, and more grand, adventures on the road, as all good fantasy stories do. I hope I don't have to wait too long to hit the road again with Oghren and the gang, but if we do, I hope that Bioware corrects the glaring faults that this game suffered from. Less monotonous, labyrinthian dungeons, more adventure, and more of that wonderful story.And I really hope to hear the end of Oghren's joke about the human and the elf in the bar!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2010"}

CoD has always been a fun time waster in my opinion, and i sure did waste my time in this game. Not to say all of it is all bad. Apart from the majority of CoD players, i enjoy the campaign more than the Multiplayer. Why? Because the campaign actually feels exciting! Sure- the campaign has been similar in the recent CoD campaigns, but Infinity Ward really pounds the action on you, there have been times where ive said \"oh sh!t! I gotta run! This is crazy!\" that is what makes the campaign fun, feeling like youre in danger, and trying to survive. I did not give this a 5 star review because i hated the multiplayer. Complete faliure in my opinion. Maybe its because i suck at FPS games, but i was a pretty good player in MW, Blops, MW3, and WaW. It felt like activision/IW really drained the graphics. I dont understand how this is still praised as being the best CoD in multiplayer terms! I died countless times to the point of rage-quitting- something about it really pissed me off(probably the players). I never liked the multiplayer in this game, but what makes this game from not being horrible is a great story, though its short.I never really got into \"spec ops\", but i remember those are fun and challenging, it is fun to play with a friend.Pros:-pretty fun campaign-great graphics(campaign)-multiplayer may be fun for some-spec opsCons-in my own opinion, muliplayer is terrible- crap graphics in MP-Short story-first MW was betterLastly, its a \"meh\" game. Id say you should buy it for the campaign, or merely to play with friends via split screen, but the multiplayer is annoying, glitchy, and bland. Hope this helpsExtra- if you look at the categories for ps3 games, and look under strategy, you'll find this #2 on the list. Man, i lol'd, i feel like there is no strategy in this game whatsoever.

First, it's gorgeous- 60fps, fluid...it looks like a next gen portable game, whereas SF could almost pass as a PSP game. My only gripes are that the 3d mode is only worth turning on during the cutscenes...during gameplay, it ruins that smooth 60fps and knocks it down to sub 30fps, then around a hideous 15fps during the win poses- really mars the appearance of the game. But during the Chronicle Mode cutscenes, it adds a nice effect. The tiny D pad of the 3ds is kind of a problem for fighting games in general, but DOA does the best it can with it. There is a ton of content, unlockables, and modes- Throwdowns being an interesting one. As I understand it, they are weekly fights Tecmo sends you to unlock things like costumes- I've only participated in one so far, so am not 100% sure how it works. So, if you're a 3ds owner looking for a fighter, skip Street Fighter and get this instead- it's the best on the system at the moment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

I have 4 Wild World games and have completed 2 and started over. I have City Folk on the wii too. When this came I I wanted it so bad but I have the DS lite and it is for the 3DS. I finally could stand it no more and bought the 3DS just to play this game so glad I did the bigger screen is so much better. I cannot do the 3D as it makes me sick so glad you can turn it all the way off.I have been playing 10 days now and I am so addicted. I am 57 not a kid and I play 2 to 3 times a day. There are so many new things and almost all of the old things but better. I love how the animals actually do things they shop and go to the museum and fish shake trees. They invite you over to their house to give decorating ideas and if you talk enough they let you pick out an item and take it sometimes for free or if it is really specials sell it to you really cheap.Going to the Island is so much fun and a way to make money fast. You get to bring back 40 items like fruits, shells, fish, flowers each time you go over. There are more fruits than before the island ones are worth 250 bells. I write letters to the animals all 9 of them everyday asking for fruit I still need apples and pears but they are not cooperating. lol. You start out in a tent that cost $39,000 but you don't have to work for Nook in this game. Nook is strictly in home building and remodeling at quite hefty price points.You are the mayor of your town. You get to choose the layout form 5 or 6 cannot remember exactly as you are on the train. When you get there you get to pick where you build your house. Very nice features. I simply love going swimming and deep sea diving.I did buy the guide I have all 3 it is nice to mark off what you have. It has some bad reviews but really its not that bad. I like the smaller hand held book I would have liked to seen the pictures of the animals with the names but except for the new ones I can look back to the previous guides they do have pictures. Mine feels sturdy and of good quality not going to fall apart.Now all I need are people who are nice and respect each others towns to wifi and visit with. I have visited on the island but not really talking much. I will not trample flowers or leave your sight nor will I steal. I do need apples and Pears. I can trade everything else except bamboo have not seen that on the island yet. If you want to wifi and are of like mind leave me a comment.I also found a web page that has some very helpful hints that are not in the guide I cannot post it here but I could put it in the comments if you ask, if you hit like I will get an automatic email so I can respond.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2013"}

Let me say that a game shouldn't be judged based on it's age, graphics and sound alone.  This game taught me that the importance of a game was it's gameplay and that my friends is what this game is all about.First let me say this though, there was one moment in this game that made me realize that games are meant to be explored, and you know what that is? That invisible block in the first level! When I first found that invisible block I was in awe because it was in the middle of NO WHERE but just appeared.  I actually let that one-up get away the first time. I'd never seen anything like it before in ANYTHING!Now I know that people complain, &quot;Oh you can't save&quot; and &quot;You only get three lives and when you die you start from the beginning&quot; and &quot;There's a @#$%^&amp;* time limit!&quot; and of course everyone's favorite &quot;These graphics suck&quot; and second favorite &quot;The game is too short&quot;.  Well, as I said it isn't the age that counts.  For it's time these graphics were some of the best the world had ever seen!  Also, the ability to save your game wasn't in thought yet (Metroid was one of the first games to even use the &quot;Password&quot; system).  You got three lives on just about EVERY game back then and as I said, saving hadn't been thought of.  The lentgh? You certainly wouldn't think so now but Super Mario was one of the longest games in the world when it was released! For today's standards the difficulty has gone down (but I'd still say it's easier than the majority of XBOX, PS2 and GCN games) but not by much.  The game can still be hard but it's easy to master. In fact this game started a series of Video Game challenges in which people did crazy things like go through the entire game without grabbing a single mushroom on one life WITHOUT warping! I remember doing that as well.For the ages this game is freakishly awesome.  Even those born in my time would know this game pretty well and have fun with it (Some of us were like what...one? two? three? etc.?)Truly if you're an NES fanatic and an old-skool gamer this is one game you CANNOT be without!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2003"}

The martial arts fighting/development was really cool, the Hong Kong setting was pretty exciting, and the story was fairly engrossing. The actual controls were pretty easy to master. Whether shooting guns or duking it out with a host of bad guys, it was a very intuitive controller layout and the application was easy enough to grasp. The driving parts were also super cool. Definitely GTA inspired, but far more forgiving, and in a way, it kind of reminded me of the Burnout series from that standpoint. Riding your crotch rocket full throttle through the Hong Kong highways was pretty much as good as it could possibly get in my opinion. The graphics were very nice....not top line, but very cool and beautiful in their own way. There was an amusing technical glitch that happened a few times during my gameplay where a dumpster or a person on the periphery would suddenly fall from the sky, bounce on the ground, and then integrate into the game. The story was very dark and interesting, with a very shades of grey moral sensibility. If you are overly sensitive, this is not the game for you. Some of the things you need to do to finish the story will make you somewhat uncomfortable. However, that only made the story more intense and realistic from my viewpoint.Anyways, I really enjoyed the game a lot. Maybe the best I've played in quite some time. I think it took me a total of around 18 hours to finish the game, although as an open ended world, there is still plenty to do when you've finished the main story line. I'm guessing if I had just focused on the story alone, it would have only taken between 8 and 10 hours to finish. As it stands, from an achievement standpoint, I was at 45% when I finished the story line.

The game takes place in Hong Kong, and unlike most open world games you play a cop. Don&#8217;t worry though, it isn&#8217;t a goody two shoes type of cop! You play Undercover officer Wei Shen, who is infiltrating a Triad society called the Sun On Yee.Sleeping Dog is the &#8220;Spiritual successor&#8221; to the True Crime games. If you owned a Playstation 2, you most likely played either True Crime: Streets of LA or True Crime: Streets of New York. Sleeping Dogs started it&#8217;s life out at Activison / Blizzard as True Crime: Hong Kong, however the game was cancelled for various reasons, and then insteps Square-Enix who bought the rights to the game. They however did not buy the rights to the True Crime franchise, and so the game was renamed Sleeping Dogs.Now that we are done with the back story of the game, let&#8217;s move on to the meat of the matter! The review!First things first! The graphics are amazing! Probably some of the best that I have seen on a finished console product. Everything from the lighting to the water to the fire looks amazingly realistic. Those are three of the hardest things to create in video games and keep realistic looking, but Sleeping Dogs pulls that off with flying colors.The cast is all very believable, however since it takes place in Hong Kong, there is a fair bit of Cantonese spoken, although nowhere near as much as you would expect if you were actually in Hong Kong. However, there are subtitles, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too much of an issue to anybody.One thing that has become a staple in Open World games, is the car radio! Which makes sense, because usually a fair amount of time is spent in a car, and a person just needs some tunage! Know what I am saying? Well, Sleeping Dogs knows what I am saying, and they gave us car radios as well. Their choices for radio stations and songs playing on them however kind of suck! This is probably the worst collection of &#8220;Radio tunes&#8221; I have heard in an open world game since GTA3.The game is actually pretty linear compared to others of the &#8220;Open World&#8221; genre, in fact I would go so far as to say, that it only gives the ILLUSION of freedom. Most things have to be done in a certain order, however you can explore the entire city right from the beginning. You don&#8217;t have to wait for bridges to open up, or anything like that. Just grab yourself a car and explore.The game naturally has races, which has become standard fare in these types of games, however I usually suck at races, which usually either means I don&#8217;t finish the game, or I get bored and move to another game for a few months, the prolonging my completion of the original game. However, unlike other games of this Genre, has the races as side missions. If you love the race missions, do them! If you don&#8217;t, just skip em! Brilliant!Then there is the combat! The game feels like it&#8217;s trying to lift the combat style from the Yakuza games and blend them with the newer Batman games. It does a pretty decent job of blending the two, but the combat does become frustrating, since there are a few times, where you get your ass handed to you, and have to go back quite a bit, because Checkpoints are few and far between.Overall, the game is great! Sure, there&#8217;s a few areas that could use some polishing, but nothing that will break the game.Fun fact though: Some players who research a lot on organized crime, or are familiar with the Chinese Triad, might think the games Triad clan Sun On Yee sounds familiar.

The driving mechanics in this game are as good as anything you'll see in a driving game, the gunplay is perfect, and the melee combat is satisfyingly brutal.  You can immediately tell that this game was a labor of love for United Front Games.  I praise them for crafting an interesting story and I actually cared about what happened to the characters.  Each character is brimming with personality and the lines between good and bad become blurred.  Games such as Mass Effect and Infamous make the good/bad moral dilemmas too obvious.  No such thing in Sleeping Dogs.I love the attentional to detail.  To hack a camera, you do not simply go up to it and press a button.  There is a minigame to go through.  Same with planting a bug, tracing a phone call, etc.  Instead of going for a \"bigger is better\" approach, everything is more condensed and packed with quality.  However, this game is still huge.  There are many side quests and collectibles to be found.  All of this might seem familiar at first glance but you begin to realize that the little tweaks they made to the formula really give it that extra punch.To be honest, I hate the Grand Theft Auto series and I can be hard to please but this game (and the Yakuza series) is pushing this genre forward.  The developers at United Front Games took everything bad about the sandbox games and improved it.  I cannot praise this game enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2012"}

This game does have a very good story with twist of plots. The in game movies are really good and with good sound effects and voice over. The environments in the game are also very well done and detailed made, which is a huge credit for the game. This game also adopt both types of battle encounters - random and touch base, which feels like utilising both ways to attract gamers to play it. The battle system is very Final Fantasy indeed. Turn based menu with different commands. The biggest feature is the Addition which requires skillful timing to get the biggest damage on the enemies. Nonetheless, it will be frustrating if you are in a boss fight and just missed one button that your can't finish the addition. The upside is you can purchase item (but at high cost) to ask the computer to finish the additions perfectly for you. Also the enemies will counter attack you if additions are done manually, which adds the difficult in physical attacks. Magic attacks are limited to using magical items, which lacks flexibility. At the same time, you can only hold 32 items at one time further limits your flexibility as some useful items are reuseable and must be kept to get your through the games; that leaves limited space for magical items considering you will need to use a lot of healing items if you characters levels are not high enough. The most annoying part of the game is the SNAIL PACE levelling up. Since all the experience points are shared by all members in the battle, this largely reduces the points each character can get in a single battle. Considering at a certain level, you need more than 10 thousand points to level up and every battle just earns you 200 points! This might be the reason that many people just finish the game with great effort at level 35-50 ....The highest level you can get for your characters is 60 but it will take you more than 400 hours to get most of your characters to that level. After level 60, the character will continue to receive experience points but without levelling up ...Another annoying part is sometimes the character selection screen just pop up without a reason and you will find that your original party was moved and substitute by other characters, which will then require you to choose again without a reason. Also good items are very difficult to find and some of them cost you a huge fortune to get. The development of the characters are also not as flexible as those in Final Fantasy for you can only equip them with certain stuff and some of those stuff are really useless. Anyway, the game does have a good story and some good graphics, considering it is a PSone game. Just need to bear with those pretty annoying characteristics of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2003"}

The controls are absolutely sluggish:  Ico does not walk where I want him to walk, and Princess Yorda does not obey his calls accurately.  In fact, making Ico having to call Yorda in order to progress through this game is a ridiculous element in any video game that I've played thus far.  Ico's calls of \"bon-swa, bon-swa\" were also VERY annoying. I completely agree with the other 1-star reviewer about the windmill part, too.  Luckily, I nailed it, but I considered bringing this game back about 10 tries into it!  Little did I know that the windmill experience was just a prelude to the final outcome...What threw me over the edge was the fact that when you die, you start over from where you last saved at the couch.  RIDICULOUS!  Why couldn't they have you start over after the latest cutscene event?  After I died in the waterfall section, I absolutely had it.  No way was I going to start at the couch and do everything over again.This was the first 3D game I played after recently purchasing a new Acer 27\" 3D monitor, and the 3D effects were not that hot either.  Nothing really popped out of the screen, except for when the flying black spirits were coming down in the foreground.  Sure, the environments looked beautiful, but there was nothing awe-inspiring at all.With that said, I originally bought this game at Best Buy as part of a \"Buy 2 PS3 Collections Get $20 Off\" deal.  So in reality, I got this collection for $29.99.  Now that I've traded it in to Amazon, I should be getting $24.30 back.  That would make my final purchase actually $5.69....not too bad at all, and that's not a lot of money spent on such an awful game.  I'm going to use my new Amazon gift card balance to get another game, for sure (maybe Mafia II or something).And like the other 1-star reviewer, I also did not even bother playing Shadow of the Colossus.  I just ejected the disc, went on Amazon, printed the return shipping label, and speedily drove to my nearest UPS drop-off store.  This game SUCKS.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0HAC6","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"My game of the decade","reviewText":"I remember back in 1996 when I went to CompUSA (which I don't think exists any longer) and picked up a copy of Duke Nukem Atomic Edition with my dad. I had so much fun playing Duke Nukem that I just played every chance I got. At the time, I also subscribed to PC Gamer because computer games was such serious business to me at the time.I remember sometime in 1997 when PC Gamer released a preview for Duke Nukem Forever. At the time, I was so excited that I was looking everyone for what sort of graphics card I needed, etc. Of course, nothing ever came to be and all I remember was bits and pieces of information that popped up every now and then.Well life went on, I grew up and every so often I'd hear a joke about the \"Forever\" part of Duke Nukem Forever and on occasions I would see a preview or some new development about Duke Nukem Forever.It wasn't until 2010-2011 when suddenly Duke Nukem Forever came back into the picture. This is nearly 14 years from when I originally heard it and to top it off, it said that it was going to release in 2011 and on top of that many retailers were taking pre-orders. I went on amazon and pre-ordered the Balls of Steel Edition immediately. I was pumped up and ready to play after so many years of hearing about it.Then came a few problems. The first one was the one month delay. It gave me a scare but the developers were just playing into the whole meme with Duke Nukem Forever. So that was okay for me. Then the demo came out. I was majorly disappointed with it in terms of graphics and gameplay with two weapons limitation and regenerated health. I went online and read at various places and a lot of people were saying the demo was actually a previous build of the game. I figured that since Duke was playing \"himself\" in the demo, maybe it was a joke. Still not understanding why they would put a demo for something that is an \"older\" build, I went ahead and downgraded my pre-order to the regular edition of the game.About a week before the game released, one of the main developers came into the scene with a preview and a famous line that I would never forget: \"I hate to be the reviewer of this game because it's going to be so epic that it could not be described in any review.\"With this in mind, I got the game from Amazon on release date and when I got the package I ripped it open in excitement like my 13 year old self would have done 14 years ago. I felt that the disc tray was \"too slow\" to load my game - that is how excited I was. Then the loading screen came up and Duke Nukem came to appear and I was thinking to myself how awesome is this gonna be. After the loading was done, my wide smile on my face quickly went down to teeth grinding anger.The first level is exactly like the demo. The demo isn't the \"previous\" build of the game, it IS the game. I was angered and I said to myself, \"Okay this can't be bad, it's Duke after all.\" Then after the first level, the game was still horrible. It wasn't until about four hours into the game, after this construction level outside of Duke Burger that I put the game for sale online. I was utterly disappointed with the game's nature.To put it bluntly, the developers said that this game would be a old school first person shooter. This means a lot to me because when they say \"old school\" I think of Duke Nukem 3D and think what it brought to the table: massive arsenal of weapons, health packs and gadgets. Duke Nukem Forever offers none of the old school element. The game plays regenerative health, two weapons limitation, and to top it off it's all offered in a watered down graphics environment.To put it overall, Duke Nukem Forever is at best mediocre and even then it doesn't even appeal to me as a Duke fan simply due to the fact that they set the game like it was 14 years ago but they add in modern elements with it. Overall I would not recommend this game to anyone who great up playing Duke Nukem 3d or any other Duke Nukem titles. This game is just a horrible mess.My only hope is that if they decide to make a new one, a team that really understands what \"old school\" means come in and do it. Otherwise label it correctly so that people who have been waiting know what to expect.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

Boy, am I glad I did!  First off, there are many design flaws that plague the game, most notably the save point issue - but, let's be honest, people playing this kind of game aren't going to be casual gamers; they're going to spend a few hours on it every night, so the fact that its save points are after 30-60 minutes of straight gameplay should not be any surprise or bother for most.  In my experience, that was the main issue, frustrating, of course, but after I found out how my Xbox 360 had been saving my progress I blew through this game in about a week (I'd estimate the game plays through in about 14 hours on single player mode, which I did).  Speaking of single player mode, reviews claimed it was nearly impossible, but I don't really understand where they're coming from.  Yes, your AI in single player mode are largely idiots and only sometimes helpful, depending on the time and place in the game, and follow you around so much you do most of the killing in boss battles (the gigantic Akrid), but I found playing it along challenging and rewarding.  The voice acting is topnotch and the orchestral music is amazing.  As you probably know, you're no longer on only ice fields, which is a big plus for me as I hate the snow; I love the variety, especially being able to fight underwater and in space.  The graphics are off the charts amazing - brilliant and beautiful, not as polished as, say, God of War 3's, but still very, very good with a unique quality to the MT Framework 2 engine that created them.  This game also packs one of the most epic cutscenes ever, which happens right at the conclusion to Episode 5 where a train is heading with a gigantic gun to blast through a seeming impossible layer around the Over G Akrid you kill in the end - it is truly awesome and awe-inspiring.  Being able to play many characters is also good, and basically you play numerous factions that all come together in the last episode and unite against NEVEC.  In the end, Lost Planet 2 is a game you should experience for yourself, not based judgements on by others; who knows, you may love it as much as I do (in my opinion it's the second best game of the year).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Beauty is Only Skin Deep","reviewText":"Having thoroughly enjoyed every Prince of Persia game on home consoles since \"The Sands of Time\" I was eagerly anticipating playing the PS3 iteration of the series. That said this new \"PoP\" game is a huge disappointment.First though I have to comment on what I liked. The graphics are intensely bright, colorful and simply beautiful. There are many moments where I just paused and looked around enjoying the scenery. Character models, boss characters and animated sequences are also equally well done. The graphics use a style called cell-shading which gives the game a more \"cartoonish\" look than previous games. However, the new style fits the \"PoP\" setting perfectly and I felt that it actually complimented the series better than previous efforts.Prince of Persia also succeeds in being somewhat less linear than previous games. Now once the Prince meets up with Princess Elika the player is given almost free reign to explore the world around them. It's not quite an \"sandbox\" experience a la GTA but more like maps connected by passages. Every area is also displayed on an easy to access map for navigation. Certain areas also require the player to upgrade Elika's abilities before full exploration can be accomplished.Unfortunately that's where the good parts end and the game starts to show it's flaws. First and foremost in my opinion the biggest single issue I have with Prince of Persia is the repetitive nature. Every area has a set level of maps to explore which require a set number of \"Lights Orbs\" to be collected in order to upgrade Elika's powers. Since the player begins the quest with no powers you'll end up doing quite a lot of backtracking. Every new power you do acquire will open up new areas for full exploration but after only a few hours this type of mindless gameplay becomes boring.Another issue is that Prince of Persia is a game without consequences. The game will not let you fail as your partner, Elika has the power to save you from any and all circumstances. Because of that the game loses it's edge. Boss fights become a button mashing mindless mess. Missing jumps or simply sacrificing your character in order to reach an out of the way Light Orb have no penalty. Honestly, while playing the game I was wondering aloud to my friend why the Prince is even needed in the adventure. Elika could've easily gone it alone.Also as a result of it's non-linear nature the storyline in \"PoP\" suffers. While previous games in the series featured great stories and well balanced pacing, Prince of Persia does not. The game relies heavily on real-time interactions between the characters engaged by pressing the \"L2\" button. However, since most areas can be explored at any time you're never quite clear on why exactly you're exploring the area at all. Again the gameplay boils down to collect 45 Light Orbs to get X power to collect 160 more Light Orbs to fight X enemy. Rinse and repeat.Sadly this is the first game in the series that I cannot recommend. The title has such well crafted graphics, and earnest effort to appeal to a broader range of people and a return to a less \"edgy\" art style than in Warrior Within and The Two Thrones. However, it's focus on mindless orb hunting and lack of difficulty completely unbalance the game and leave it a beautiful mess.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2009"}

Not Everyone is a fan of the BBC...I'd personally like to see an entire Top Gear game from Turn 10 where I get to race insane nonsense creations against the hosts...CONS:- limited number of tracks. some are beautiful (Prague, etc) but you'll repeat them ad infinitum.- limited number of everything else, there are no weather effects, day/night, etc- although there are a decent amount of cars, there is no way to own a lot of them without playing this game every day for the rest of your life. earning credits takes too long so you will be required to pay real money to get them faster. spend a million credits on a car you don't like? tough luck. I even got 300,000 free by logging into the Forza website, but it doesn't matter. I'll need to race 30 races to get enough to buy a high performance car...I don't have that kind of time...- even if you come in every race 1st, you always start near last. there are no qualifying runs. starting near last means the guy in front doesn't have to contend with all the bumper car-style traffic nonsense that can knock you out of control...and you feel dirty hitting the Y button to correct it...- the game pointlessly uses 2 methods of purchasing power, credits and tokens. they do the same thing so why use 2?- the game sort of cheats from time to time. I played using the default settings. In a few races, I lost because the game AI assists would continuously break even though I was on a straightaway with nothing but a sea of blue arrows...I have NO IDEA what was going on there but it was NOT fun to see my car breaking for NO reason while cars sail on by...- I played beyond level 50, nearly all of the series, and yet I still don't think I \"figured out the trick to the game\" -- Do I pick speed? Acceleration? Speed, acceleration and handling? A good mix? Just pick the one they recommend? I could pick a car with all 10s and still spin out of control. Pick a different car with average stats and get through multiple series without hitting the REWIND button even once, never spinning out of control, not even when someone else hit me, or me them...After all this time, racing the same tracks over and over and over ad nauseum, I just don't \"get\" this game...In the end, I think MS needed some good launch titles fast and Turn10 churns out good products, so this is the result. With the limited number of tracks, etc, it feels unfinished. With the Top Gear guys, it feels glorious. It's a mix, just like the Xbox One itself...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2014"}

It was the coolest game at the arcades at the time and just about every young boy to teenagers wanted a home port of this game. Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat changed video game fighting games forever, introducing standards for special moves, combinations, graphics and even the way it sounds overall. In it's day, this game and Mortal Kombat 1 where the #1 games on any boys xmas list.It did soon change as Street Fighter II champion Edition, Hyper Edition came to the arcades. So Sega consoles got champion edition, and it revved up the whole Nintendo vs Sega debates, but then Snes got Turbo edition, which was both Champion Edition and Hyper edition in one. No one really played Champion edition, they stuck to hyper, especially with a cheat to enter the Capcom Code and play it at 10 star speeds. Pretty much like what happened to this game, it was good in it's day, but fell victim to upgrades. If it's not for collectors purposes I can't see what anyone would buy this original version over it's later updates... unless it's to see just a couple of moves that where not transported over the next versions... which is mostly just a few light moves on some chars that you never used, and a couple of Zangief's holds that you never even noticed where taken out of champion edition and so forth.I really got out of the whole Street Fighter thing around the time of Super SFII Turbo. I have had very little interest in the Anime styles it's gone towards since in Alpha versions. Plus I cant keep up with them, there must be a million different versions of SF games by now. But, this is where it all started. And this is the true SF game that is responsible for all those clones of this game. But nothing compares to SSFII. It has since breathed new life again on the Game-boy advance. I cant remember what it's called, but it's pretty much the same with some new extras included, and Akuma. But Super SFII was a remake and redesign of this game, so if you want original looking graphics, or to see what it was like when it all began, then check this game out.It was the Snes versions that dominated the market in SFII sales for home consoles. Pretty much all due to Sega's crappy controller layouts.I have not played it yet, but there is a game on PS2 called Hyper Street Fighter II Anniversary Edition or something like that. Apparently you can choose between original, champion, and Super Street Fighter II games... a couple of reviews say the coding isn't quite right, but I hope to bring you a review about that game soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2005"}

Wait a year and see.","reviewText":"I bought the this along with new super mario u, zombie u and nintendoland. I probablly played with the Wiiu for about a week and it has been collecting dust ever since. I honestly feel like I have wasted my money on this system. I encourage everyone who reads this to not waste your money, wait a year and check back on the game library then to see if you want to buy one.Why do I save done waste your money on a Wiiu? Because every game on it you can play elsewhere. Games like new super mario is the exact same new super mario games on the ds, 3ds and wii. Games like mass effect 3 are the same thing as you probablly already played on other systems. Games like zombieu which being exclusive to wiiu is just another zombie shooting game. I played a few other games at a friends house and those were all very much \"been there, done that\". Granted it is a new system and good games take awhile to trickle out but at this point there are no must have titles. Third party support is also lacking as there are'nt many third party developers creating a lot of new content exclusive to the wii u and the majority who are seem to just be porting other games to it.I dont like the online aspects of it. Like the friend request process, the lack of universal game invites, and downloadable games being split between the eShop and Wii Channel. It is just all very user unfriendly compared to say the ps3 or a pc's online community. It still feels like nintendo is being dragged kicking and screaming into the online world.It lacks the appeal to older people and non gamers that the wii did. Couple that with the fact the Ps4 was announced it looking rather nice so far and the fact that Microsoft should be announcing their next system soon, Valve is making a steambox and tablets/phones becoming more powerful it is hard to justify buying a wiiu.I cant justify the price for what it is. A upgraded wii. There is'nt a major technological leap here. Some might argue the tablet controller is a huge upgrade but its just a normal controller with a touch screen on it that has far less resolution than most smart phones, a less responsive touch screen and less features. The system itself is in HD now but it still lags behind the much cheaper and much older ps3 and 360 in terms of horsepower. But at it's core it is still just a wii.The wiiu itself is essentially just a slightly upgraded wii and nothing more. I really didnt like holding onto that tablet for very long and since it served me no real purpose aside from a few gimmick features it was pointless to hold on it. I cant imagine playing games on it that require analog stick, it would be like holding a giant ps3 controller. It is a cool concept but no one has implimented anything into their games that makes it worth while. I also didnt care for how the controller is, it feels like its a couple generations behind the curve in its mens and interface.For graphics people its still behind what a ps3 and 360 can deliver in terms of speed and graphics quality. You can buy a ps3 and a library of games for less than the cost of a wiiu system by itself and with the ps4 launching this year I cant even begin to reccomend buying a wiiu. Now good graphics do not equal good game, they never have but if they are important to you then you'll be dissapointed.So my suggestion is if you own a wii then dont buy a wiiu. If you dont own a wii then buy one instead of a wiiu because you can buy a wii and a bunch of really great used wii games and still spend less than you did just buying a wiiu system with no games. The wiiu isnt worth the price right now due to lack of good games, maybe in a year when more have come out and so on but as of now its just lacking too much to be worth paying for a new system plus the cost of games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

I got it working and played it at bit to my surprise no blood!  I personally could care less about this because honestly I never cared about the gore factor anyway.  Aside from that and I know for some this is a major buzz kill, the game looks great and moves are easy to pull off just like another reviewer said.  However two major down flaws your character's walks and jumps aren't very fluent.  Also it seems kind of slow I remember this game being a bit faster, the game looks wise is amazing however (given the time context and the original arcade version).  To be honest tho I remember this game in the arcades and not being a fan really I say this one is the best.  I have 2 and 3 on an arcade classic pack for Gamecube and the controls are pretty bad as well and the matches end fast.  So all and all if you have the patients for this game and you don't mind the no blood and some what shoty movements you will want this game.

{"product_name":"B0009IX7K8","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Same GTA with some RPG touches","reviewText":"As one might suspect GTA: San Adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving, guns galore and a lawless protagonist, and a linear storyline. Let's be honest though; nobody buys GTA to JUST play the mission part and in fact I have a hard time getting into the missions. In San Andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game (unless you want to cheat). The clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay. Haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase. You have various parts of your character that can be built up--fat, hunger, muscle, driving skill, weapon skill etc. Obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry. The others are self explanatory.Some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game. The hydra, which is a harrier type jet, the stunt plane, an attack helicopter, a four wheeler, a parachute, and my favorite--the jetpack. Other than that the game is like each created before it from GTA 3 on. The graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired. Whatever engine they use is clearly the same as GTA 3. Animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic. Music from the radio stations is lackluster, but I believe it is possible to use your own music instead.As a computer game San Adreas' controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done. In the worst case scenario--the hydra--however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking. If you want to shoot something below you, be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds, not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction. I, myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the USB port on the computer. Even with that it is not much better and you still need the D-pad to make decent turns. As you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game.Overall Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has a lot to offer if you don't have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls. I would rate it a 7 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Young","summary":"Not too shabby!!!","reviewText":"First, let me start off by saying that I'm am a very hardcore Xbox 360 fan; However, I still own a PS3 and now the PS4. I decided to pre-order this console over the Xbox One console this past summer because Microsoft came up with bright idea that they should limit or pretty much eliminate buyer/player freedom over games; new only, no used or reused games on their beloved next-gen console ( they soon changed that). So anyway, I pre-ordered this console from Amazon.com and I received it 11/18/13. After I read several negative reviews from this website, I wondered if I made a wrong decision...the answer is not at all.The console itself is pretty light weight compared to the original PS3; the design is sleek and innovative. The set up was simple and easy, I think it was set up to the TV in about 5 minutes. This was met with some reserve because I was waiting for the \"blue light of death\" to appear and it didn't...I was ecstatic. So then I began to set up my user account and if you have a PS3, then you can connect to the same account. I accidentally set my PS4 under another name so I have two Playstation accounts. So, getting set up was pretty simple and I like the new menu interface over the older PS3 crossbar media interface, this one seems to be set up more like the Xbox Live interface without being Live. As an added bonus Playstation includes a code to redeem 1 month of free Playstation Plus (required for PS4). So I began to play Madden 25 (a must have) and I noticed the graphics were second to none, better than 360...really. The character animations made me think I was looking at a real live NFL game on TV. So after playing Madden 25, NBA 2K 14 and Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I was thoroughly convinced that this system was an excellent choice for me. The one thing I have to get used to is the controller; I really like the dual shock 4 controller over it's predecessor the dual shock 3. It's larger and wider, the handles have better grip for sweaty hands, I also think the dual shock 4 is more comfortable in the players hands (much lighter), it's not heavy like the Xbox 360 controller...good controller but heavier.Overall, I can't compare this console to it's direct competition (Xbox One) yet because I haven't had the pleasure of purchasing one thus far; but compared to the PS3, Sony has done a wonderful job of not repeating the mistakes of the PS3 console at launch. If your a hardcore gamer like myself you will probably buy both consoles in due time, I will. The Sony Playstation 4 console comes highly recommended from me; one thing I think is an edge over the Xbox One is that PS4 has a removable 500 GB HD and the One does not. This is important to know because the PS4 games require a lot of HD space, for example NBA 2k 14 uses about 50 GB of Hard Drive space, which is a lot for one game.To sum it all up, which ever system you decide to buy, I don't think you'll be disappointed especially with the PS4.

Each of Spyro's dragon friends has fallen victim to the nefarious Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals. Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills. For this reason,Spyro the Dragonis an excellent title for youngsters or less experienced players, who want to play without having to master complex movement combinations.--Kasty ThomasPros:Large worlds provide hours of game playingVariety of scenariosEngaging graphicsCons:Low game skill requirements may prove less challenging for expert players","reviewerName":"Cumulonimbus Harpe \"samsmylife\"","summary":"The Origin of Spyro","reviewText":"The is the first Spyro game and it paved the road for all the other Spyro games. The story: When the evil Nasty Norc turns all of the dragons into statues, it's up to Spyro, a small purple dragon, to set them free and defeat Nasty Norc. You travel with Sparx, your dragonfly companion and also your health gage, as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over 25 levels in all. This game is great, although it's not very challenging, it offers hour of entertainment. My favorite world is the Beast Makers world. It's a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime, which to me is the best type of level in Spyro. My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling, even the music is creepy in it's own way. Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no mini-games in it. Those always provide extracurricular fun, but I'm happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release. I'd recommend this game today if you don't already have it. If you not into Spyro, this is the place to start at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2004"}

I am definately not the type to be biased to one game in a series, i own castlevania chronicles, aria of sorrow, circle of the moon, and symphony of the night, and they all rock. There are some things i greatly appreciated in this title, but it does fall a bit short in one area that can really be the ultimate downfall of a game, but first the positive.What i really did enjoy about this installment is the sheer massivness of the soul system. every recent castlevania has there own power gimmick. Be that souls, cards, or relics, they all have there own thing. Every enemy in aria of sorrow has a soul inside of them that you can attain. the souls can do anything from give you subweapons, to turn you into a giant four armed chick! with all the different enemies, your looking at over 300 different powers to find! Another point that i found to be a nice change is that instead of having to hunt down which subweapon you want, they are all stored in your soul set menu, once you find the enemy with the correct soul of course. Instead of having a seperate MP and heart guage, there is only the MP guage, and the subweapons use MP instead. This also helps the MP situation, since collecting hearts now refills your MP guage a bit.Another thing that has been fixed since symphony of the night is something ive been praying for for years. In symphony of the night you can only sell certain gems, which makes the more pricey items almost unattainable. In aria of aorrow, anything you collect in the castle can be sold to the merchant for cash. This makes the 300,000 dollar soul eater ring, which makes collecting souls easier, all the easier to get to.Now for the ultimate downfall. One of the best aspects of Symphony of the night, in my opinion, is the fact that there is two castles (and one is upside down, how cool is that!) In aria of sorrow there is only one castle, and i would venture to say it would take about 4 or 5 hours of your average gamers time to completely explore. More and more GBA games are seeming to have this problem since the cartridges just can't hold as much memory as the discs. I guess that problem will be fixed with the next gen handhelds (which will run on mini-discs) but until then, the handheld market suffers.In conclusion, Aria of Sorrow is on par with some of the greats of castlevania in most aspects. If it would have been made longer, i feel the expierience would have been much amplified. Thats not to say there is no fun to be had here, while it lasts it is classic castlevania action. Anyone who has played some of the more recent Castlevania games will find something they love here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"bulletstopper \"bulletstopper\"","summary":"Sony fanboys UNITE!!!","reviewText":"Since the Sony fanboys have decided that now is the time to start some kind of flamewar about the supposedly lowly DS I guess I will stoop to your level.

The truth says that the DS has almost 100 games while the PSP has only 30.  By the way most of them are old ports of Playstation games.  ENJOY!  The truth says that no matter how much you want it to the movie Spiderman 2 still looks like crap when viewed on a 3 inch screen.  Crowd in boys and girls this is gonna be great!  The truth says that it sucks waiting 20 minutes for a game/movie to load and then watching your batteries run out.  And finaly the truth says that in the end specs don't mean jack.  Good gameplay equals longevity.  Sony thanks God that the world is full of stupid people.  Otherwise the PSP would still be sitting on the shelves.  Remember.  The truth doesn't lie.

I was just looking for something that I could play while traveling, during lunch, or just hanging out at home. I wasn't that interested in some of the other features like MP3, picture viewing. At some point I'll probably pick up a movie and see how it looks but for the most part this will be a game only system for me.Over all I'm pleased with the PSP. The graphics are very good, the quality seems good, and the selection of games isn't bad. Some of the other positives are:1.) Battery life- seems good to me for casual use.2.) Wifi- love the ability to go on-line and play against others on-line.3.) Interface- the interface is just like the PS3. I think the interface is very clean and easy to use.Some of the cons are:1.) Controls- playing some FPS type games can be a bit of a challenge with the controls. My hand/fingers tend to cramp up.2.) With the Piano black model a memory stick is not included. So by the time you buy the PSP, memory stick, 1 game and a travel bag you are out a fair amount of money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2008"}

Obsidian didn't do enough test playing here.  After weeks of gaming, all of a sudden my game freezes up all the time.  I can't go more than about three minutes without my system freezing.  It freezes when I save, leaving corrupt files.  It freezes when the level is too big or there's too much action hapening (which is always).  Looking at various blogs, every site lists glitch after glitch after glitch.  Characters showing up and not talking when a dialogue screen pops up.  Glitches with lightsabers.  Trouble with characters in your party getting killed when you spar them to advance the story line.Perosonally, I've tried everything to fix my lock-up glitch, but I pretty much have to flush my 42 hours and start over.  Not a pleaseant prospect.  I haven't seen this many glitches since I played Enter the Matrix on Xbox last year.Aside from the glitches, you'll also be a bit lost at the story line.  You're playing a character with memory loss, and the interaction and discussion with other NPCs never really fill you in.  It's a good 20+ hours before any of that back story starts to make any sense.On the positive side, I love the game play.  The new prestige classes and lightsaber forms are sweet.  The improved interface, the new powers and combat options, those are great, too.  You can even play a martial artist who is on par with a jedi or a blaster king.  It's a fun game if it lets you play it.If you liked the first KOTR and don't mind random, stupid glitches either slowing you down or (in my case) ruining yoru entire experience, get this game.

Raillard","summary":"A lot of fun, but could have been so much better!","reviewText":"As a big fan of the original Crackdown (which I didn't purchase just to get a beta invite to Halo 3!), I was very excited to see that a follow-up was in the works.  Having played this sequel for a few weeks, I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, the game is a lot of fun, and is very, very faithful to the original.  On the other hand, it really does feel like a second helping of the same exact dish.Pros: the silly, giddy superhero feeling you get when leveling up your agility, strength and other skills is still just as much fun.  For many people, running around from rooftop to rooftop to grab agility orbs IS the game.  Jumping higher and getting stronger doesn't get old.  The city is large and features a number of different environments.  Like its predecessor, it has a Robocop-meets-GTA feel.  The new multi-player element is fun, but not groundbreaking.Cons: The game just doesn't innovate nearly enough, and actually takes a few steps backwards.  What disappointed me the most is that the graphics took a step back- gone is the cell-shaded style that made the original so cool looking.  Instead, we have a drab, dated look.  The city doesn't really feel different- this isn't like when GTA went from liberty city to vice city; this is the same basic town, and all of the neighborhoods pretty much look the same.  The shooting/targeting/aiming mechanism isn't bad, but it isn't anywhere near good, either.  The story is pretty repetitive as well.Bottom line: If you liked or loved the first one, you'll have a lot of fun with this one, but will probably feel a bit disappointed that it really does feel like a remake of the first game, and not a new one.  If you're new to the series, check it out- it'll have you chasing agility orbs for hours.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2011"}

Everything hinges on your actions in BlackSite: Area 51","reviewerName":"TrailsEndWild \"Writer/Researcher\"","summary":"Way Better Than Expected!","reviewText":"I picked this game up at a \"going out of business sale\" (all too common these days).  I bought it based on the subject matter (aliens and Area 51) and less on actual facts or reviews.  First off, this is actually a really fun game. Short, about 4-6 hours.  I think that is the first thing that truly surprised me.  Is it original (from a FPS point of view), no.  The shooting is basic, the targeting isn't always \"spot on\" (i.e. sometimes you don't need to hit your target to get them to fall), the \"squad commands\" are generic, and the driving takes some getting used to...but it is STILL FUN!  For what it is, it delivers!  The dialogue will make you laugh, which is perfect since this game doesn't take itself too seriously.  I think any gamer who goes into this game with a similar attitude won't be disappointed.  My only two major gripes are more of pet-peeves than actual complaints.  So many developers take a ton of time trying to get details correct (guns, uniforms, vehicles, etc.) which is to be commended.  However, inevitably in ANY and ALL games these days there is a bathroom you can walk into.  Sorry to tell you guys, bathrooms in the Middle East (specifically Iraq) are significantly different from American/European bathrooms (if you've been there, you know what I mean).  If you are going to take the \"cheese route\" and put these particular details in a game, make sure you have it right.  Also, what ever happened to big, dramatic endings in video games?  Playing the older games (NES, Sega Genesis, etc) the ending cinematic was always the \"pay-off.\"  Too many games these days lack this simple item.  They waste tons of time on cinematic elements throughout the game that only serve to break-up game play and then get stingy with the finale.  That is more a comment on all games these days rather than just Blacksite.  Other than that, Blacksite: Area 51 is a fun game.  I would recommend it highly, especially if you get it for less than $15.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001T8S62Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Nice improvements, wish it were lower priced","reviewText":"When I first heard a new DS was coming out, I was excited. I heard about all the new features and thought \"Great! I can't wait to trade in my old DS!\" Then I saw the pricetag. While all it's new features are novel and well implemented (for the most part) I just don't feel all the extra perks are worth the extra $40.That said, if you have the money to burn and absolutely have to be on top of all the latest gadgets and electronics, it does have some fun features.Pros:-----1. The cameras actually work really well and have plenty of fun ways to play around with the pictures you take. The pictures aren't professional quality, obviously, but clear enough to enjoy viewing on your DSi. Long term it will probably become a rarely used feature, but kids especially will have a lot of fun with this and may replace the need for them having a real camera if they've been pining for one.2. The new DSi definitely is noticeably lighter and thinner and the screens are visibly larger, albeit by a minimal amount. Overall a nice improvement, but nothing that will knock your socks off.3. DSiWare is a nice addition for those who like to have an assortment of \"mini game\" titles on their DS, but those who like more in-depth games may find the selection lacking. As the titles available for download expand to include games from other systems, this will be much more viable and will hopefully somewhat make up for the missing GBA port as those titles become available for download.4. SDHC card adds a lot of new capabilities to your DSi that wouldn't be possible without it. You can browse photos from your camera, listen to your favorite music, browse the net and play your games all in the same unit. The built in memory is also decent, able to house 412 pictures (taken with the DSi camera) or roughly 10 DSiWare games. The SD card effectively makes the DSi a nice all-in-one device at a decent price.5. The browser is better implemented than I was anticipating considering how poorly done PSP's browser is. Scrolling is smooth and entering text is quick and easy. My only gripe is the way you have to constantly scroll across the page. The upper screen gives you a preview of the entire page while the bottom screen is used to view a very small portion of that page in an enlarged window. It's rather annoying when you're trying to read something as you have to continually scroll back and forth to read a full line of text. An independent zoom feature would have been much more useful.Cons: (potentially not cons depending on your preferences)------1. DSiWare could potentially cost you a lot of money you've already spent in those old Gameboy games you used to be able to play on your old DS. With no GBA slot, you'll be forced to pay to download them to your DSi, buy another GBA/DS or not play them at all. I think the removal of the GBA slot was a poor choice given that it was only done to make the unit very slightly smaller and lighter. I'd much rather have my GBA slot, but it may not be an issue for new gamers without any GBA games and no interest in purchasing any.2. While listening to your music via the SD card is great, the DSi only supports AAC format. If your music files are not in this format, you could spend quite a bit of time converting your files over for use on the DS. If you already have a large collection of music, you probably already have an MP3 player anyway. If your files are already in AAC format, lucky you!3. Browser doesn't support flash or cookies, just like the Wii and PSP browsers. While casual surfing is fine, a lot of users will be frustrated by this no frills browser. If you have no other portable browser, it is handy to have for quickly checking the weather or finding where bids are at on your ebay watch list, but you won't be able to log in to check e-mail, log into forums, make purchases, pay your bills, etc, any of the other things you would normally do online.Overall, it is a nice improvement to the DS and I wasn't truly disappointed in any way. The browser was as I expected though the cameras did surpass my expectations. If it were the same price as the original DS, there would be no reason for anyone to not have the DSi. Lots of fun!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2009"}

One more thing is the AI usually does not block the end, they completely bypass their assignment on a pitch and go after the corner who is 10 yards down field.

The game included (New super mario bros wii), is worse than Mario Kart Wii, which actually is the better bundle.

The system of scoring &quot;kudos&quot; for driving with style is certainly different among the current crop of racing games.  However, I found that I quickly lost interest in the game.As I mentioned above, the game is based around a system of points called &quot;kudos&quot;, which you earn for driving well.  Sliding your car and getting it on two wheels are examples of moves that earn kudos.  You compete in various events such as races, top speed challenges and overtaking challenges (see how many people you can pass in a given time).  Along the way you earn kudos, which unlocks more tracks and cars.  The challenges are varied enough to keep things interesting for a while.  And the promise of new cars and tracks serves as a good carrot and keeps you playing.Although PGR is unique as far as racing games go, I found it just didn't hold my interest.  The tracks weren't nearly diverse enough and working toward new cars and tracks eventually lost its fun.I also found the graphics to be a bit of a letdown.  The replays look very good, but half of that comes from the aggressive camera angles/motions that are used.  This makes it seem more like real TV, but it's just a camera trick.  To be fair, the renderings of the cars are very good, especially when you see reflections on them at night.  The biggest graphics disappointment are the tracks themselves.  The buildings look very flat, making the scenery less lively than I would hope.Overall I did have some fun with this game, but in the end it wasn't for me.

The reason for the success of games \"like GTA\" is because gamers love non-linear games that allow for free roaming in huge environments. Developers have taken notice of this and consequently more games are built using this type of game play. So, don't knock it!! Having said that please note that I do not own Spider-man 2 so any \"owner-bias\" arguments can end NOW.Now that my disclaimers are out of the way I can talk about what a great game this is. This game is truly the best spider-man simulation to date. The web-swinging system (has a bit of a learning curve) gives you more control over where Spidey swings than ever before. The fighting system has been bulked up with tons of unlockable combos. The game itself is not chained to the movie in that you will a lot more of Spidey's traditional villains then just Doc Oct. The game is challenging but not \"controller hurlingly\" so. You are able to swing around all of New York which is a plus for those familiar with the city. The voice acting is done well but somehow I will never get used to Toby McGuire as a wise-cracking Spidey.Finally the only knock I have against the game is when it comes to the fatality of water. What, Spidey can bring down the largest of super-villains but he can't swim?!!

Yoshi's Island shows a lot of evolution in Nintendo's oldschool games.

They each have different strengths and weaknesses, and there are two per world, which should make for an interesting challenge.  Although, in my opinion, they are quite easy.  Something else I like about Yoshi's Island are all the different enemies; there are dozens!  Each one is unique as well, and adds a lot of diversity to the game.The graphics are some of the best I've seen for the SNES.  While they do look a little cartoony, they look like wonderfully hand-drawn canvas pictures.  The paralax scrolling is nice as well.  The music for each level is extremely catchy, like the jungle theme.The story is also interesting; it takes place when Mario is a baby, and your mission is not to save Princess Peach--it is to save Baby Luigi from Kamek and Baby Bowser!Overall, this is an extremely unique Mario game.

There isn't much new here. Infact as much as I liked this game the first hour it didn't hold. Games like GTA4 and Oblivion. These are titles that define advancment. GoW3 is a dying breed. I hope. There is really no skill to it. There isn't much in terms of exploration and just like a game from the 80s enemies just apear. Your character can do amazing things that would make the game easier; if you were controling him. Skills seem to come and go like that. The ever so lame button press. L1, L1, oh wait press O, O , O!!!! Your controls are ever changing, and don't feel real. Thats being said, this is a amazing looking and sounding game. But this corny Sony game lay out is getting on in years. What year is this? I played the others, and like them. But now with free roaming games that hold a ton of replay I feel this title is like 3:10 to Yuma and The good the bad the ugly is what its up against. If you don't get my drift, this game is worth a one time beat the game attitude, but I will never revist it. I hope we arn't stuck with a one dimentional character like Kratos again. I was really hoping he would grow here, but didn't. Revenge, revenge. This character wasn't made by a muscle man who gets laid thats for sure. He seems in this one to be overly tuff, like Im trying to hard. Sometimes hes cool, and other times... Well you see what Im saying. But if want historical mythological stories you can just turn around. The myths are set as a back drop, and all fused to gether for more depth.

{"product_name":"B003H0CBYS","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Martin","summary":"A Good Game, but flawed","reviewText":"By now you've heard all of Bulletstorm's gimmicks, like the leash and the kick mechanic. They really do serve to freshen up the first person shooter genre. But the ultimate question is, is it worth the 65 bucks it costs to buy it brand new?For me, no. To warrant paying almost 100 bucks for a video game, I need a little more than a 6 to 8 hour campaign. These days shooters make up for their short main storylines with added multiplayer, which adds serious longevity and value to them. I don't care how mind blowing a game is, how many new things it adds, if it takes me an afternoon to be done with it, then it's not worth 65 bucks.There are some great set pieces and moments in Bulletstorm, like the huge grinder wheel that you fight early on, battling the t-rex, and just the gameplay in itself is all top notch. Very unique things Bulletstorm throws at you. Graphics are great, the vistas are gorgeous to look at, character models are nice and the set design is pretty good. The story, is pretty interesting, given how much of it there is. The dynamic between characters is nice as well. This isn't a sprawling epic by any means, but it works and keeps you interested in playing.But back to why it isn't worth a full price purchase, for me anyways. Like I mentioned before shooters tend to be short affairs for whatever reason. Games like Borderlands & Fallout served to add some longevity to the genre with a more RPG like approach. But as great as they were, the combat lacks the face paced, visceral enjoyability that games like Call of Duty and Bulletstorm have. Fallout combat is so dull and wooden that you begin to lose interest. If only we could get some sort of merger between the two, we'd truly have something special. As it stands now the games with the great fighting gameplay you can finish in a mere afternoon, and the games with great stories and sprawling epics, combat is lacking and dull.Modern day shooters solve this by their online play, which in bulletstorm is lacking. We get two modes, \"Echoes\" and \"Anarchy\", and both feel a bit tacked on. Echoes is essentially replaying the main game levels without story elements to rack up \"high scores\". Which is great but ultimately feels hollow and pointless. Why would I want to play random levels to compete on faceless \"leaderboards\". Then there is Anarchy mode, which lets you play online with a group of people and fight against waves of enemies. You have to get to a certain score count to advance to the next \"wave\". For me, the waves ended too soon, were too easy, and had connection & game joining issues. Maybe that's because the game just came out, but joining games took me awhile and when I did the gameplay was laggy. There is no splitcreen mode for the campaign, none for a local Anarchy mode where you can fight waves of enemies with your friends. I realize having the leash mechanic playing death matches may require some creative thinking to implement, it seems like such a waste to not have better multiplayer mode offerings for such a game with great gameplay.As it stands paying 65 bucks for an 8 hour campaign just doesn't sit with me, no matter how innovative the gameplay is. Overall this is not quite a rental, meaning it's defintely worth a purchase, but more at the lower price like 40 bucks or so. Even a rental from gamefly would suffice as I can't quite see myself playing the campaign again or popping in for some laggy Anarchy. Had there been some sort of real competitive multiplayer, a more meatier, longer campaign, this would be sure purchase. As is I would say wait till the price comes done or rent it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Fairly good throughout but not keeping up with modern designs","reviewText":"When I first played FF7, I fell in love with it and the RPG genre in general. Throughout the years, I come to expect that each version of FF will offer both an awesome cinematic experience, and intriguing game mechanics. FF13 offers the awesome cinematic experience, but the game mechanics seem to be out of date.When FF12 came out, I felt it was an interesting approach: it offered the same cinematic experience, but at the same time it attempts to keep an open world going and a sense of modern-ness.With FF13, it's a bit of a step back from everything. The familiar ATB system has returned (though a form of it was used in FF12), the familiar touch-the-enemy-to-battle is back, the linear gameplay straight-shot-A-to-B is back, and the game is severely simplified to the point of near mindless repetition. Comparing to FF12 it seems the series has taken a major turn for the worst. Not saying that FF12 is the best, but I am saying that with FF12 at least they were attempting to recognize innovation with modern times.When I think of an RPG, I think of one thing: control. Controlling how my characters develop, controlling where to go, what sort of equipment I need, how I should fight an enemy, etc. While most RPGs base off these ideas, FF13 has severely hindered user control and instead replaced it with automation. Nearly everything is automated:1) You can't control other characters. You can select what character to be your \"main\" at any point, but once it's battle time, you can only control your main, but you cannot switch to other members mid battle. You MUST allow the AI to control it and it normally does a good job. Also if your main dies, the game is over. You cannot revive your main character, but you can revive the other two. This was one of the worst feature I have ever seen in a game and felt like I was playing Persona 3 or something.2) You can only have weapons and accessories. That's right, that's all you get! By the end of the game, you'll probably have 3 slots open for accessories, but even then it really doesn't matter as you can defeat the game without it. But it offers no variety to game play set up.3) You have defined roles and they're unlocked at various points in the game. Basically the game breaks down into a job-class system. You got your attacker, magic user, healer, buffer, debuffer, and tank. The problem is each character's jobs are given to you at some point in the game. Like at the start, each character has 3 jobs, and as the game progresses, you're able to make them stronger by investing points into each of the jobs. After each battle you get certain points that you can use to invest into each job class. The problem is the game is broken up in chapters and on each chapter you can only have a certain number of points invested into your jobs before it's maxed out - and it's easy to max out. So basically if you max out a role at some chapter in the game, you just have to wait until later to unlock further into the class. In other words, the game controls when and how you can develop your characters. Until the end of chapter 9, you basically have very little control even for your jobs, and even then at the end of the game you won't be able to unlock the final stages of your job until you load the clear file. So in other words, you have to beat the game once just to unlock an entire job.4) The battle is OVER simplified. Basically you can either input controls automatically or you can allow \"auto-battle\" which will either attempt to find the best attacks against the enemy, or attempt to figure out what the best attacks are (depending on if you did a scan of the enemy). So this basically means you can Auto-Battle your way through, and even if you manually enter your attacks, you'll find it very repetitive. So every battle, you're doing the same exact \"Auto-Battle.\" You could Auto Battle your entire game and not worry ever about wasting time. The main strategy in battle is to make sure your characters are in the right roles. Like for example, my main battle party is Lightning, Hope and Fang. I usually have Lightning and Hope as magic users and Fang as a warrior. This combination works well 99% of the time.6) No leveling! Besides the role leveling, you don't earn experience and level at all. You can only go off your stats. Interestingly if you unlock a stat in one class, it's applied to your character. So this means if you have health increase to your magic class, it's applied if you choose a warrior class. Only specific abilities is tied to a class.7) You don't earn money in battle. That's right, there isn't any form of currency after battle. Of course, this presents a problem for casual people, but for those who seriously need money for upgrading or whatnot, can get money from items. For example, some monsters drop an item that by itself is worth nothing, but when you go to a store, you can sell it for large amount of money.8) No interactions! FF13 is set in this huge world. You're an outcast though, so it makes a little sense, but overall, you have very little interaction with the inhabitants of FF13 if at all. I don't think there is any way to initiate a conversation and throughout the entire game you rarely speak with others, even your own team. They may make comments about the environment from time to time, but other than that, they do little to no talking.Overall the game is simplified too much for me. At first, I felt like giving it up, but I kept playing. Overtime it sort of grew on me. While the game is over-simplified, I sort of grew attached to it. The story itself is rather generic, but I sort of fell in love with the main character: Lightning (the woman on the front cover). She seems tough and neat at the same time. Quite possibly the only interesting character. I have my xbox with the Lightning wallpaper and if you 5 star the last boss, you get to unlock her picture as your profile picture. I felt this was cool and I managed to unlock it and now my theme is complete! As far as other characters, they're rather annoying. If I had to line up the degree of annoying, I'd go with: Vanille as the top annoying character due to her voice and her \"happy\" theme but at the same time just annoying, Sazh since he's such a cry baby, Snow as this guy makes little to no sense at all, and then last is Hope as he's just going around trying to act tough but at the same time, I'd just like to put him and Vanille in a box and drop it off. Fang is pretty cool character, but she looks like an oily surfer/beach goer of some sort. It's almost like if you stood next to her and breathe in you'd jerk in reaction to the salt contents. Then again, the only thing kept me going was the Lightning character as she's the most interesting. Plus she got her sister, Serah, who she's trying to protect which makes her pretty cool in my book.So overall the game is overly simplified. Great cinematic, one cool character Lightning, and that's just about it. I rank that it's fun to play Lightning even though it's too simplified, but it's still wonderful experience for anyone playing. I played for about 70 hours myself and had a great time. However, others can complete the game in about 30-40 hours if even that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Sam Allen \"A zealous individual\"","summary":"Call me an idiot fanboy if you must, but I loved it.","reviewText":"For me, Final Fantasy XIII was a slightly disappointing departure from some classic elements of the series, but also introduced several new innovations that had me glued to the screen for hours on end.Gone were the massive dungeons that demanded exploration through every nook and cranny to find every hidden treasure you could get your hands on, and the game's highly linear structure and almost platform-gaming styled environments served as a further reminder that the \"World Map\" concept of getting from place to place had been dead and buried starting with number 10. To some, these would be enough to turn them off of wanting to play it whatsoever. But I was open to a little change; I have no problem with platform gaming, and I don't think any dungeon in any game in the series could ever be as cool as Ultimecia's Castle in FFVIII.When discussing the new innovations, one MUST begin with the battle system. Unlike the traditional ATB system that was fully established in FFV, the turn-based system of FFX, this rights the problems with FFXII's MMO-styled combat system. The active time gauge returns, and you can chain abilities together based on how many ATB slots a character has. Abilities are determined by Crystal Points (won after every battle) that give you the ability to level up your character and teach them new abilities; the system is similar to the Sphere Grid of FFX, but a HUGE step up on the execution factor. Six character classes, universal to each character eventually in the story, are featured: Commando (for physical attacks), Ravager (for magic attacks), Medic (for healing), Sentinel (for bait and defense), Saboteur (for status magic to hurt the enemy), and Synergist (for status magic to help the party). I personally much prefer this over the job system of FFIII, FFV and FFX2.While you only control one player's actions at a time, you control what actions all your party can or cannot use by mixing up the character classes to what best suits the fight you are in, known as the paradigms. You can create up to six paradigms at a time, and change at any time during the battle. The stagger gauge is also a big new feature; you can build it up quickly using attack magic and keep it from depleting quickly by using physical attacks, and once it's filled, you can let rip on enemies for big damage. Sometimes it takes a long time to fill, but it definitely adds a new level of depth never seen before in the game's battle system.In addition to this whole new combat system, there are some of the presentation values to discuss. They are simply jaw dropping, from the environments, to character designs, to sound effects, and everything in between. The music is somewhat less impressive than in some previous installments, and the voice acting is a little annoying sometimes, mainly because of Vanille's voice, which takes some getting used to due to its overtly perky nature. The plot is what kept me playing this game for hours on end without ever wanting to quit; every twist, every shocking moment, keeps you glued to the set.The few negatives mentioned is why it does not get a perfect overall score, but there was plenty of fun to be had when I played through it all the way, including a rewarding ending. There is no doubt I will be coming back to it one day down the road, just to relive all the brilliant moments of the story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2010"}

It is very satisfying going up against the various enemies.  There is one major flaw with this game and it is a problem from beginning to end.  From the moment you are given control of the character texture pop-up is noticeable and unfortunately is a constant plague throughout the entire game.  In case you don't know what texture pop-up means, it's when the graphic details are drawn on the screen right before your eyes.  So if you are facing forward, for example, then turn left, you can literally see the graphics being drawn on the screen.  This is not a problem with your machine.  This is a problem with the programming of the game.  There are plenty of videos online that showcase this flaw.I watched video of John Carmack, id's lead programmer, speak at Quake Con 2011 and he did mention the texture pop-up and blurred up-close graphics, but he made no indication this would be fixed, rather that this is how it is and why.Once you step outside, at first glance, the world looks beautiful and impresses that this game will be awesome.  However, as you look around the texture pop-up flaw is painfully evident and distracts from the beauty.Another plague of this game engine is that close-up textures are archaic, blurry and extremely low-res.  This is an early 90s technique and is far outdated.  In the world of HD gaming, this technique should not exist, at least not on AAA titles.There is no real story or plot, rather you are told to perform tasks and go about your business.  You can explore the world, but there is little to discover or reward for your effort.  The game does run fast and has good first-person shooting with plenty of gore.  The characters look good and character animations are well done.  The driving is easy with an arcade feel.  The ending is short and seems cut-off leaving the player with disappointment rather than satisfaction.I recently read a magazine review of this game rating it 9 out of 10.  This review failed to mention the texture pop-up problem and it is my opinion that the rating was so high simply because it is an id game.  If a lesser known developer had released a game in this condition they would have been torn to shreds in a review.  I have seen this same magazine do just that in the past.I had fun playing the game, but I'm biased when it comes to a graphic problem of such magnitude, especially when it is not fixed with a patch.  If more effort was put into a great story, and graphic pop-up problem was fixed, this could have been a monster of a great game.  As it is, I don't put it in the AAA category where it should be.  I'm not saying not to purchase this game.  I'm merely stating my opinion.  It may be wise to rent it if you're interested.Due mainly to the graphic problem, this id fan was disappointed.Rage","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0017HIIWW","description":"Transformed and unleashed, Sonic races to save the world...and himself. Sonic the Hedgehog is on an adventure unlike any other. Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"SegaGuy217","summary":"Great day levels but the Wherehog kills the mood.","reviewText":"Sonic Unleashed is the first 3d sonic game I have purchased since the Dreamcast days and its a pretty good game that does somethings right and well to be blunt a few things went the wrong direction. The story is pure stupid. A little kid might find more value in the story than I did. The only plus to the story is the cutscenes do look good.Graphically I think the game looks good enough but I think the Wii can handle a little bit of an effort. I will give this game the benefit of saying the character models do look good. As far as sound goes there is nothing really wrong with it but the voice acting did get on my nerves a bit. Again if I was a little kid the voice acting probably would not have bothered me as much. The interface is pretty basic but it is designed nice enough to get the job done.Gameplay wise the day levels are nothing short of the word great. Where the game falls into mediocrity is the Wherehog levels. They are not terrible levels but there are way too many of them. I have been playing with the classic controller so the controls do work pretty good and you get a few different options including Gamecube controllers as well. I think if the game had more day levels and maybe half the amount of Wherehog levels this game could of been great.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Just About Perfect","reviewText":"A remake of an early-90s classic, 2k and Fireaxis's \"X-COM: Enemy Unknown\" certainly does its predecessor proud, innovating and refining the series' classic gameplay.X-COM: Enemy Unknown is, in short, a game where you run an organization defending the earth from alien invasion. The game's single-player mode is in essence a long-term campaign of survival consisting of two major aspects. The first aspect is \"strategy\": you develop a base, research technology, recruit and equip soldiers, and monitor goings-on in the world.Compared to the original game, the remake is somewhat lackluster in this field - for example, the original game allowed you to build your base bit by bit, and aliens would periodically invade the base (thus making layout an important game concept). However, most of that aspect is done very well. Choosing which projects to research and how to allocate your funding are important decisions, because while there isn't a hard time limit, the longer you take accomplishing objectives, the worse things will get. There are even some more personal touches - you can see your soldiers exercising and chatting in the base when not on a mission, and there's a memorial for any fallen soldiers as well.When an incident pops up - a UFO is spotted, or alien abductions are reported - then the game switches to the \"tactics\" mode. Tactics mode is a grid-based, turn-based system wherein you command up to six soldiers (taken from a larger pool, as replacements will become necessary as soldiers die or are wounded). Most missions are simply \"kill all enemies\", but periodically scenarios will arise with other goals, such as protecting a VIP, defusing a bomb, or rescuing civilians. Combat is fluid and well-executed: units have two actions per turn, and once an action is taken it can't be undone. Line of sight is very important, as there could be hostiles around every corner. Therefore, every move must be executed with care.The wide variety of enemies also means that you must be prepared for anything, and losing at least a few soldiers over the course of the game is inevitable. It's a uniquely tense experience, especially on the longer missions. It's more than just a tactical military game - in its own way, it's also sort of survival horror.One of the most interesting parts of the game is the optional \"Ironman mode\", wherein there is one auto-updating save file for that particular runthrough. This means that it's impossible to save and load manually, preventing someone from saving before a mission and then loading the save file if things go south. Whatever happens, you have to deal with it. It's a great concept and turns the game into one big, long survivalist exercise. Every decision you make affects that playthrough. If you lose a bunch of your troops, you have to either tough it out or start over. It's certainly not for everyone, but I really appreciate the option being there.The game's graphics and sound are a compromise between the overt cartoonishness of the old X-COM and a more realistic, futuristic aesthetic. The sound design is underplayed yet memorable, with unsettling tracks that you might not overtly notice but still do an excellent job of setting the stage. From a technical standpoint, the game's problems lie not in design or concept, but rather the abundance of minor bugs that exist - cinematic scenes that last just a bit too long, or glitchy cursors making it difficult to select a different space. However, these are relatively minor, and can be patched - as a whole, the game is just about perfect. X-COM: Enemy Unknown totally deserves a 10/10.We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0088I7L76","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Justified","reviewText":"Injustice: Gods Among Us is a pretty bold fighting game.  Nether-Realms, the developers of the new Mortal Kombat reboot and Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe set out once again to create a very different kind of fighting game.  Unlike their previous efforts, however, this isn't a game for the Mortal Kombat catalog.  Injustice: Gods Among Us is its own thing.  And while shades of Mortal Kombat are here in some of its mechanics, there's really not much that's wrong with that.  The fighting system in and of itself is really good.  More than that, Injustice is a blast to play.The story, like Mortal Kombat's, has you going from one scenario to another taking control of certain characters at certain times to deal with certain battles.  The difficulty of some of the battles can be tough, but Injustice adjust the difficulty if you're losing too much.  The game is pretty insistent that you experience the story.There are other modes to experience, but it's the fighting that you're probably more curious about.  This is where Injustice comes to life the most.  The fighting is pretty intense with characters being able to pull of some pretty awesome combos and techniques.  Every character is more or less the same.  Sure, each have their own set of pokes and juggles, but more than that each character just happens to feel unique.  This isn't like other fighting games where mastering the basics of one character will easily allow you to hold your own with another character.  Instead, Injustice is a game where you'll need to sit down and practice with each new character you select for a bit before you get the hang of them.But fighting can be pretty intense.  In particular you'll be dying to see each characters special moves.  Every character has them and it's fun to see them each at least once.  They're a little over the top (for instance how Batman's batmobile comes from absolutely no where or how Aqua Man's shark just happens to be anywhere), but it's all in good fun.  The nature of the game itself is still fairly serious to a very large degree with it's fighting.  You'll also be able to interact with certain things in the environment and use them.There are other game modes and unlockables you can get, but most of them are not that particularly exciting.  There is a mission like mode that begin with you doing things like learning certain character moves and slowly going toward other objectives such as taking on hordes of enemies, but this is no where near as in depth as Mortal Kombat's challenge tower.  For those who need to learn the game, however, this isn't going to be much.  While there is a practice mode it isn't quite as intoxicating or absorbing.  Many other fighting games have some pretty good training options, but Injustice... not so much if you're new to the genre of fighting games.  If you're a veteran of the genre you probably won't need the training anyway.  Injustice is an in-depth fighting game and it's pretty self-aware of this.  It is a game that seems to hope you understand the genre.  If you do you'll be able to jump right in and do fine.  If not, the learning curve will take some time.  There's always the rumor that button mashing in a fighting game is all it takes to learn and master it.  This isn't true of the genre and Injustice is going to crush it.  Button mashing gets you no where.  Even though it can be hard to learn for newcomers, it is most certainly not impossible.Presentation wise, Injustice has a very straightforward and gritty look.  It's also made to look as incredibly over the top as it plays.  The arenas in particular.  With characters throwing around objects and grabbing them to smash others with, you can bet that Injustice isn't subtle about anything else.  Characters will get smashed through walls, fly off buildings and ricochet from one object to another.  Injustice is over the top and isn't afraid to show it.  It's got a washed out gritty look to it as well, but it actually works.  Many of the animations look pretty fluid as well.  The game also sounds good, but you can't say that entirely for with the story.  The story isn't as well written or well constructed, but it's not bad by any means.  You'll just have to get through some pretty bad lines from time to time.  That aside, however, the game looks and sounds pretty good.  The fighting is also pretty fluid in the long run as well.There isn't much that keeps Injustice down.  It's a pretty solid fighting game.  For those looking for a good throw down (or just to settle their \"Batman vs. Superman\" arguments) then Injustice: Gods Among Us is a great fighting game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Neoncloudff","summary":"Nintendo's \"Game of Thrones\" does not disappoint in the slightest","reviewText":"Fire Emblem has always been a series close to my heart.  Ever since my early explorations into the SRPG (strategy RPG) genre, I have always come back to Fire Emblem as the genre standard.  Never did Fire Emblem forget what it did best: rock solid gameplay, great story and characters, and classic intensity.  It's been a while, though, since Nintendo fans have received a major upgrade on the formula.  Despite new systems and technologies, Nintendo and Intelligent Systems seemed reluctant to put that final coat of gloss on the past few Fire Emblem titles.Enter Fire Emblem: Awakening, the next installment in the long running franchise.  Going back to the series' roots, Fire Emblem was built from the ground up to utilize all new graphical technologies and presentation values to create the most immersive and advanced Fire Emblem title yet.  Did they succeed?  Absolutely.First off, you'll probably notice the heightened presentation values.  Full 3D models for your characters and the enemies you fight, fully symphonic soundtrack, character voiceovers to an extent, and a multitude of anime cut scenes to tell the story.  These heightened presentation values are Awakening's greatest strength.  With these new graphical advancements, Fire Emblem has become more visceral than before: each battle features that same heart-in-throat feeling as your characters take hit after hit.  These new presentation values help bring Fire Emblem alive: each character, each battle, each conversation; FE:A's presentation values make the world jump off the screen.Going on, a game wouldn't be any good without a great story.  Fire Emblem's \"game of thrones-esque\" story drives forward the action, while intense twists and unforgettable moments pepper the adventure.  The characters you meet, while a large cast, all have their own unique personality.  From the stoic yet loveable Frederik to the hilarious \"invisible\" knight Kellam, Awakening's cast of 30 or so shines bright as one of the reasons to see their plot through.Fire Emblem offers a challenge to all kinds of players, from series veterans to newcomers.  With 3 selectable difficulties and the choice between Classic (where when a character dies, they die permanently) and Casual (where a fallen character is simply K.O.'ed), there is a challenge available for everyone.  New gameplay elements such as Partnering, Marriage, Supporting and New Classes offer all kinds of incredibly deep new systems without being obtuse or intrusive to the experience.  Players can fine tune their experience with all kinds of options: transparent grid, classic combat, skip animations, no voice overs; there are a plethora of options for players to tailor-make their experience, and such options (while seeming insignificant) are important as each player, as they progress through the world differently, can make their experience just as they want it.Other elements are strong in FE:A as well: the soundtrack is gorgeous, massive, and sweeping.  It easily adapts to the story and augments the more intense moments.  Online Spot/Street-pass features are incredibly deep, offering plenty of incentive to play past the end of the story.  The 3D is also fantastic, offering a \"panorama\" view of the battlefield.  As someone who has yet to be impressed by the 3D in a 3DS title, this is the first game where I feel the 3D augments the experience, but doesn't get in the way.  The characters truly pop off the screen, fights become more immersive, and the overhead battle map has some fantastic 3D elements.  Among these, there are a handful of improvements to the formula, all augmenting the experience into something rich, dynamic, and incredibly immersive.I could praise Fire Emblem: Awakening all day because it does everything right: Story, Characters, gameplay, challenge, online, 3D, presentation...everything is a massive improvement over the past Fire Emblem titles.  It's a massive title with a ridiculous amount of depth.  To the hardcore, welcome Fire Emblem: Awakening with open arms.  To the casual, prepare yourself for the best experience on your 3DS yet.Where as games for the 3DS, and games in general, have dumbed down fan favorite franchises to appeal to a wider audience to boost sales, Fire Emblem rejects that entirely.  Awakening is the \"easy to pick up, impossible to put down\" title that the 3DS has been desperately deprived of.  Now that it's here, it's time to jump in.  Awakening is the best title yet for the 3DS, period!+ Fantastic presentation values+ Deep, new, and involving systems are refreshing+ Intense and well written story featuring an incredibly memorable cast+ A plethora of extra features and enticing content+ Fantastic Soundtrack- Sometimes seemingly random reinforcements can completely ruin a hard fought hour long battle- Not fully voiced- It endsFinal Score: 9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2013"}

That was over 1,360 days ago (as of this writing).  Safe to say, I waited almost 4 years for this, and looking at the final product...I just have to shake my head in disappointment.  I try not to over-hype things too much, and I didn't do that to myself with this game, but even so, this game has some major flaws that I can't believe weren't adjusted in FOUR EFFING YEARS.First off, the graphics - they are pretty average at best for a late gen PS3 game...in fact every game in my PS3 library (outside of maybe some Sonic game) has better graphics.  But whatever, I don't let graphics determine a game for me, for it all comes down to the game play itself, and that's where the mess really begins.One problem here is the camera.  When you're fighting two or more enemies, and you wanna go into \"blade mode\" (the games bread and butter), the camera always seems to line up just right so you can't actually see who's in front of you or what you're aiming at with your sword...now throw in multiple enemies who randomly appear right behind you and attack, and you can see how this can easily become very frustrating.  So then you try to adjust the camera, but then you also have to remember that you have to keep holding down L1 and controlling the other analog stick in blade mode, all while frozen in place AND trying to parry so you don't keep getting hit and losing life...it pretty much just becomes a giant mess that fails in every aspect.  I seriously haven't seen a camera act this bad since Sonic 2006, no joke.Second, who's bright idea was it to throw QTE's into this game???  I'm the biggest Shenmue fan you'll meet, and I love Heavy Rain, so I have no problems with QTE's when done right....but when you're in the middle of a fight, and all of a sudden an onscreen instruction pops up telling you to press the circle button, followed by instructions to mash the triangle button....you're just left scratching your head.  Totally ruins the flow of the fights.  I thought this was supposed to be a hack/slash game where you could cut your opponents anyway you wanted, not a game where you defeat enemies by following some QTE's mid battle.And then there's the stealth issue...yeah I know it's not Metal Gear SOLID, and I know stealth really isn't part of the game, but developers promised that you could act stealth if you wanted in this game...well okay cool...so you walk up behind one enemy, in fact you can SPRINT up behind the enemy (because apparently they're so deaf and blind that they can't sense you behind them) and stealth kill him....but then seconds later, some random enemy 3 miles down the level spots you right after you kill his buddy, and you have the whole flock after you then...it makes no sense.  Pretty bad AI design if you ask me.  But then again, this isn't Kojima productions, it's Platinum Games...should I forgive?Whatever, I'm pretty much done with this game.  I'm thankful that Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Last of Us, and Beyond are all coming out this year....I hope those games can actually deliver some fun solid entertainment and game play, because Revengence cannot.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006JN5O","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Be Bond...almost","reviewText":"James Bond 007: Nightfire was EA's second Bond outing on the current consoles, and released alongside the Bond film Die Another Day. It's actually quite fitting, because both film and game share several similiarities. Both are polished Bond adventures with high production values; both are entertaining, and both share equally absurd plots. But like Die Another Day falls short of Brosnan's best, GoldenEye, Nightfire still can't compare to the GoldenEye game from Rare a half decade before.The plot of Nightfire has something to do with nuclear missiles being used for world domination, and borrows from all the Bond staples while tossing in a bit of Moonraker for the finale. As a game, Nightfire is also the same as EA's previous effort, Agent Under Fire. You have first-person levels, driving levels, and rail-shooter levels. The graphics look great in all three, and the controls are equally responsive (though gadget switching is still a royal pain). The Bond theme is used liberally, and it plays every time you do something cool (the game's special Bond moves). Voice-acting is decent - the actor dubbing Brosnan sounds like Bond, even though the script is horrible and tosses in too many bad puns. And of course there's multiplayer, which always adds to the replay value.However, EA's Bond titles still come up short. While the game puts you in Bond's shoes, you never get the sense that you actually *are* Bond. Rare's GoldenEye made you feel like Bond because you had to think through every mission, do things with care, and get yourself out of sticky situations. In Nightfire, everything feels too pre-packaged with fancy gadgets, linear objectives, and erratic AI. You don't respect the enemy like in GoldenEye. Here you fail because the AI was programmed to shoot accurately, not because it actually shot intelligently. The game is still a challenge, but it feels like you're playing a Bond video game rather than being immersed in a Bond adventure.I still highly recommend this to Bond fans, because it's a high-quality production and worth adding to your Bond library. For non-Bond fans looking for a good first-person shooter, this game doesn't really offer anything that others don't, and I'd suggest a rental first.Note: Bond completists should also pick up Nightfire for the PC. Despite being inferior to the console version, it features alternate levels and cinematics, and is worth taking a look at.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2004"}

I did install the latest patch before playing.  The graphics can be adjusted higher than the default that it starts with.  In over 100 hours of playing I experienced 2 freezes and 1 crash.  Other reviewers have complained about quests that didn't \"finish\".  Since I never try to complete every quest that wasn't a problem for me.The game is very much in the style of the first KOTOR.  Select male/female, a few faces and hair styles, create a name, assign values to attributes, skills, etc.There is a nice variety of environments and a good variety of followers.  (select any 2 at one time as your companions)  The designers didn't try to reinvent the whole game, they just made a few improvements.  I especially liked being able to preset two weapon sets for each character and then just hitting an icon to switch.The card game and swoop racing are back as nice diversions.  There are several points in the game (including the very beginning) where you are controlling a character (or 2 or 3) other than your own.  That was a lot of fun.The game is very well balanced between exploring, fighting, and conversing.  My only real complaint is there is way too much loot.  That is true of almost all rpg's including the first KOTOR.  By the end, you just click on stuff without bothering to read what it is.I would recommend the game to anyone who likes classic role playing.

{"product_name":"B002ELCUUG","reviewerName":"Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"","summary":"I WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG (Updates)","reviewText":"LittleBigPlanet is an amazing accomplishment and a groundbreaking platformer that is unlike any other game, period. The level creator is brilliant for those who can fully utilize it, and the unique objects, environments, and stickers sprawled throughout the levels are heartwarming, creative, and original.I have played 19 of the single player levels and the DLC monster level. The controls are great and the physics are very impressive. The incredible graphics make the textures of objects (cardboard, thread, wood, wool etc.) look like their real life counterparts. You will do a lot of running and jumping, and the facts that sackboy \"slides\" at the end of his \"moon gravity\" leaps, doesn't help when you are trying to ace, or not die in a level. If you're fresh off of a Mario sidescroller, LBP may take some getting used to. Physics and momentum are present, so you must play carefully and jump wisely, unlike Mario.The story levels are filled with so many objects, decorations, stickers, and real-life textures that I'd be willing to call this game modern art. Originality is an understatement. This game DEFINES what original means. Some of the SP levels may be a little boring compared to the PSP version, but MP is encouraged. MP changes the game entirely. Keep in mind that I am not much of a MP gamer. I am kind of old school (although I'm only 18), and I prefer a strong story and/or strong single player experience over online play. I also am not very interested in creating my own levels because I lack the patience and creativity as a level creator needed to take on such a task. I have played 20 levels from the \"story\" so far.Of the bonus community levels on the disc, I've played 6 or 7. They're laughably bad. I recommend looking for the highest rated community levels, because they are much better than those crap community levels they chose to put on this disc. The Metal Gear Solid levels are absolute essentials to LBP because of the inclusion of the paintinator.This is not my first run in with LittleBigPlanet however. I am a proud owner of LittleBigPlanet PSP and I find the single player in the smaller, MP-less, and much graphically inferior iteration (best graphics on the PSP though over Peace Walker and COO)to be a tad superior to what I've played in the console version as far as single player is concerned. Some parts on the PSP version are VERY HARD. The levels on the PSP have better music to match the vibe, and there is much more of a challenge. The PSP version is what actually made me purchase this one. Cambridge topped Media Molecule in some areas with the single player, but its a good thing because the lack of MP on the PSP called for a STRONG single player.I will not conclude my review yet. I will continue to play the rest of the game and all of the included DLC. This game shows glimpses of brilliance, and there is SOMETHING waiting for me in the later levels. I CAN FEEL IT. I will continue to explore LBP's SP.UPDATE SEPTEMBER 24th 2010:From what I've played since publishing this review a few days ago, the levels are a bit funner after the first 20 dull levels (as expected). There is much more of a challenge now, which is bad and good. Good because I craved the rush of a challenge, but VERY BAD because you only have 4 lives before you have to restart the ENTIRE LEVEL. That almost breaks the experience. I switched back to Killzone and God of War 3 a few times because I DID NOT FEEL LIKE RESTARTING THE ENTIRE LEVEL. ANYTIME YOU TURN OFF THE GAME AND REFUSE TO CONTINUE ITS BAD. KEEP THAT IN MIND MEDIA MOLECULE. They should have an option to have infinite checkpoints. I will update again with the final verdict once I've finished all story levels and DLC levels.UPDATE OCTOBER. 21st, 2010You see, I went from 3 stars, to four, now 5. This game is an absolute classic. It is the beginning of a genre and I'm proud to have been a part of its start. At first I was spoiled by the PSP iteration, and still today, I believe its single player is just as good (at some points superior) to the original PS3 version. I beat the game, went back to ace levels that I had previously disliked and had an absolute BLAST. I must say if you are trying to Ace and collect all the goodies then you will have a ton of fun. Don't even get me started on MP. My buds helped me solve PUZZLES in order for us both to get the gifts that required two or more players.

This old, overlooked two-disc pack for the PSone had been literally gathering dust on my shelf for years before I bothered to even test it out, and I suppose that complete lack of any kind of previous expectation was a big part of why I was so totally impressed and engulfed by what I found within the game itself. Unfortunately, by overwhelming me so effectively in its first American offering, my expectations for the future of the Star Ocean franchise went through the roof. In a way, it's funny; I loved the precursor because I expected nothing of it and received everything I ever could've wanted, and then subconsciously built up the sequel to the point that nothing it could muster would ever be enough to appease me.To start with, the story is beyond terrible and the characters are even worse. When I first met Fayt and Sophia, the two leads, I couldn't help but grimace. They're so paper-thin, so incredibly dull and intelligence-insultingly bland, I initially mistook them for a heavy-handed satire of the role playing genre in general. This is, honest to god, the most uninspiring cast I've seen since console RPGs were just gaining their footing in Final Fantasy I back on the NES. They'll say and do things that'll just make you stare blankly for a few seconds and then explode into unrelenting laughter. Fayt, in particular, is the very epitome of a stereotype. He has no flaws, and as a result he makes an incredibly boring leader. The characters seem so out of touch with reality that nothing ever seems to carry the kind of magnitude you'd hope for, even when entire worlds are exploding and individual races are being completely wiped from existence. By the time the third act comes around, bringing with it the one really interesting revelation in the storyline, you're forty hours in and have cemented your opinion of the game as a whole. Before that, it's cliche after cliche, with absolutely no originality thrown in to keep things halfway interesting.Like its predicessor, TtEoT's gameplay is its greatest triumph. The battles have remained every bit as enjoyable and strategically brilliant as I remembered, and the controls are incredibly easy to comprehend. You'll have, at most, three characters in your party at any one time (which is a major gripe I've had with the RPG genre in general for years now... why would six people stand by and watch their three buddies struggle in a fight with monsters, rather than joining in and cleaning house?) and they're all performing individual actions at the same time, to say nothing of the monsters on the other side of the battlefield. At a glance it would appear to be mildly organized chaos, but in action it's really pretty simple. Before, after and during the battle, you can set a specific attack style for the characters you won't be directly controlling, so they aren't wasting all of their strength on a meaningless enemy while a tough boss fight is just around the corner. If you want your weakest character to avoid physical confrontations and concentrate on healing, it's as easy as changing a setting. Usually, two members of your party will be following these instructions at any time, while you'll be directly in control of the third. Yet, despite the seemingly-obvious directions, the computer AI will occasionally find a way to screw up. Whether they're running headfirst into an explosion with low HP or repeatedly casting heal on a teammate who doesn't need it, your comrades will generally leave a lot to be desired. I even ran into a few instances where I'd found myself single-handedly taking on half a dozen enemies while my two teammates stood off in a corner somewhere and cheered me on.Aside from the cutscenes, this is generally a visually uninspiring game. The characters look about as stale and unexciting as they act, and the environments and spells are nothing that hasn't already been done better by a previous title. To be frank, the Sega Dreamcast could have more than likely produced graphics equal to the ones seen here, and that's a tremendous knock at this stage in the PS2's life cycle. With the PS3 peeking over the horizon, this should be the point in time when game developers are really starting to stretch Sony's aging console to the limits with amazing graphical effects, not leaning back and kicking out weak, flat displays such as this. Occasionally you'll run into an enemy or dungeon that's up to par visually with its contemporaries, but on the large I wasn't impressed. The graphical direction and wardrobe designs are solid enough, but it looks like a lot of the charm was lost in the translation from pen and paper to fully interactive three-dimensionality. As I alluded to earlier, the cutscenes are outstanding, but you'd expect that from a Square-Enix RPG.This current-gen revisiting of developer tri-Ace's shining star feels like a hollow, emotionless shell more than it does a sequel five and a half years in the making. Rarely have I been more disappointed in a big follow-up title than I was with this one. It's strictly average, with passable graphics, weak voice acting, horrible characters and a mind-numbingly slow story killing any forward progress made by the battle system, which is still quite a blast. I feel dirty for considering this as a contemporary to The Second Story, although I'm beginning to question if even the PSone rendition was actually as good as I remember it. I don't think the ultimate goal of a sequel should be to force its fans to re-evaluate their feelings about the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2005"}

Some Lameness","reviewText":"I've never played the other GTA games, so if you're looking for a comparative review, check one of the other 300+ reviews of this game on here.First and foremost, GTA 4 is super-addictive and loads of fun.The story telling is top notch for a video game, and I found myself to be very invested in Niko's relationships as well as his quest for fortune and revenge.The controls are intuitive and easy.  The only exception would be that I do find hand to hand combat and non-projectile weapons to be a bit awkward and inconsistent.  However, Guns and grenades are very easy to control and their parameters clear.The driving mechanics are a bit tricky at first, and you've really got to spend some time mastering a dance between the brake and the e-brake to drive fast and fly around corners without flying out of control.  However, it's pretty satisfying once you've gotten the hang of it.  Driving motorcycles is (for me anyway) nearly impossible, and I always groaned when confronted with a motorcycle-necessary mission.There's only one aspect of the game that makes this a 4 out of 5 star game (instead of a 6 out of 5 star game), and that's the fact that you can't restart from a checkpoint -- you have to restart each failed mission from the beginning.  Let's say you're on a 20-30 minute mission, and just toward the end you get killed.  Well, you've got to start all the way across the city, steal another car (or motorcycle, police car, etc), drive for however long (stopping by the gun shop to get more armor, etc.) and go through the WHOLE THING again.  This seriously hamstrings the pace of the game and, at times, makes one want to scream, cry or commit murder from shear, unadulterated FRUSTRATION.  Now, I may be crazy, but intense frustration is not the experience I am looking for when I buy a video game.However, the other elements of this game are so satisfying, so rich and so undeniably exhilarating and fun that I found myself willing to slog through some of the more tedious missions to get to the other side of them.  From what I understand, the newest installment, EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITY, has remedied the no checkpoint aspect of the gameplay.  So if you haven't played GTA 4 yet, and you're the impatient type, you may want to just give 4 a pass in favor of Episodes from Liberty City.  I must say, though, you'll miss out on a darn good ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}

It just has a WEIRD feel to it.  Maybe it's the non-stop frigid planet...Or the obvious Japanese flavor to it...Or the cuss-inducing Boss battles that alternate with simple pushover Boss battles...Or the chief Japanese villain most oddly named \"Dennis Isenberg\"...Or the near coma-inducing cutscenes...Or the whole Mechs vs bugs thing. Perhaps it's ALL of those together. It's just STRANGE.However, that doesn't mean it wasn't FUN. Lost Planet has some really enjoyable aspects. The rocket-fired grappling hook allows you to move vertically in addition to the normal horizontal play of most shooters. The mechs (V-S suits) add another dimension to the battles. You also have to continually locate T-ENG to avoid freezing to death in the elements. And any game with gattling guns, rocket launchers, shotties, laser and sniper rifles, homing missles and plasma guns can't be all bad...There are even BIG versions of these weapons too that can be shot from mechs or by hand.If you like Boss battles, then there are 3 or 4 of them in this game that will give you a pretty good challenge. They're practically impossible to win on the first try on just normal difficulty. In fact, it will take a dozen or more tries for some players. There's one (the Giant Worm) you CAN'T DEFEAT no matter what you do...You just end up throwing your PS3 out the window or giving up the game or running away (the correct option here). As a rule, I don't like games that put invincible Bosses in them. It can take a great deal of time and effort just to finally find out there was nothing you could do to win...One of the more annoying parts of this game were the cutscenes. There are some that truly sound like the voice talent were all in the same room taking turns READING their lines with a complete absence of emotion. This makes it really hard to get into a game. In addition, your character just fought through a large portion of bug and pirate-infested frozen tundra to reach another area, then he magically appears back at the command post in an involved discussion during the next cutscene...WTH?!?! I found myself DREADING the next cutscene, repeatedly. Talk about phoned-in performances...The controls were mostly GOOD. But I kept running into a frustrating exchange problem when trying to replace weapons on the mechs. For example, you're in the heat of battle and jump the mech over to a rocket launcher you want to place on the right side of it. If you're SLIGHTLY out of position, it shows up on the left side ready for pickup, then you get hit by Boss fire and have to maneuver back to do the same thing again, all the while taking damage. Another example is just walking up to an empty mech in a Boss battle. If you are slightly off to the side, the screen may briefly show press \"O to enter\", then you press O and end up removing the weapon off the side mount. So then you have to press \"O to attach\" it again before entering or enter first then pick up the weapon, and some of these annoying delays can make the difference in a heated Boss battle. Having another button other than just \"O\" to enter, remove and attach weapons to mechs would make more sense to me.The end cutscene was really pretty weak. Maybe I should say EXCEPTIONALLY weak. In fact, if it's late at night, you might just fall asleep to it. And that kind of sums up my experience with Lost Planet EC. I mean, your hero character loses his memory at the exact moment he shoots the bad guy. Apparently his friends who were watching the exchange just left him there when he went face down in the snow instead of taking him inside for medical care. Then he wanders around in a roughly 1/2 mile radius outside of the main base (where his friends are inside and warm & toasty) so he can bump into them when they finally come outside several months later. Just a HORRIBLE ending that was obviously tacked on in the final moments of development. You end up saying, \"THAT WAS IT?!?!\"The whole game has the feel of a newbie director who was going for a summer blockbuster in his first directing gig, but ends up with a late night cult classic \"B\" movie instead. Some parts were enjoyable...Some parts deplorable. That's what you get with Lost Planet EC...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"The Definitive Way to Play Metroid","reviewText":"In 2002, Metroid pretty much returned from the dead with Metroid Prime.  The game was amazing, with some of the best visuals of the time and intoxicating gameplay.  The series had gone to a first person perspective.  Nintendo defined as a First Person Adventure, and not a shooter.  Yet it worked for Metroid perfectly.  Metroid Prime 2: Echoes came out in 2004, and while it didn't match the flair of the first one, it was still a pretty good game in and of itself.  In 2007, however, the Metroid Prime Trilogy got an overhaul in controls.  The motion sensor controls actually worked really well with Metroid Prime 3.  Even then some of us were probably thinking, \"Wouldn't it be great to play the first two games like this?\"  And now Nintendo is letting us do just that.  You can now plow through all three Metroid Prime titles.  The entire trilogy is on one disc and they've got those added controls for those who enjoyed them in Metroid Prime 3.  It might bring into question as to whether or not it's worth it for those who played the previous two games.  That depends on if you want a different experience.  It's worth considering, though, because you're getting three games for the price of one.If you've never played Metroid Prime before--any of them, then this is a good way to introduce yourself to the games.  There isn't a whole lot to discuss with Metroid Prime.  They're beautiful games that put a huge emphasis on exploring and adventure.  All three games do this while telling a story.  Story isn't really a strong point with Metroid, however.  Not nearly as much as exploring corridors, collecting upgrades, fighting colossal bosses and backtracking.The Wii remote lets you play the first two games in the same manner you played the third.  Giving you the Wii Remote as your gun.  You'll move around using the analog stick and point, shoot and turn using the Wii Remote.  Metroid Prime works with these controls because there aren't exactly a million things to do, or a million different weapons to switch between.  Since just about everything stacks it can work well enough.  If you didn't like the controls of Metroid Prime 3, however, then you're probably not going to here.  It's essentially the same thing for every game now.  The controls on the Gamecube weren't clunky, but there is something smoother about using the Wii remote for certain tasks.There are more than just controls added to the experience, though.  Metroid Prime 1 and 2 now have the same rewards system as Metroid Prime 3 had.  When you perform certain tasks or meet certain objectives, you'll get a credit which can be used to exchange for unlockable content.  More than that, the games also get a slight improvement in graphics, including a wide screen presentation and improving on some graphical textures.  The Metroid Prime games were beautiful enough on the Gamecube.  Essentially the games look just like their Gamecube counterparts, they just have a few smoother textures and a widescreen presentation.The big question is whether or not to get this package if you already own the games.  That depends on whether or not you think playing with the motion sensor controls is worthwhile or not.  The control scheme in and of itself is actually quite good, but you're not getting a different game.  They're the same games you've played before.  Metroid Prime 3 is unchanged from what you originally got before.  This also means you might suffer from similar problems.  The motion sensor controls are good, but can sometimes be a bit sensitive.  Most people might have already experienced these controls before if they played Metroid Prime 3.  If you liked what you got, then yes, it's worth investing in this to use those controls with Metroid Prime 1 and 2.  In part because it's a good deal.  If you weren't a fan of Metroid Prime 3's control scheme, I can't imagine why you'd want to pick up this collection.  Even if you don't buy the collection, it might be worth checking out for those who are curious to experience Metroid Prime 1 and 2 in a new light.In other ways it feels like a more definitive way to play Metroid Prime because the controls do work rather well.  It might not be a brand new experience for those who mastered the Gamecube titles, but it will certainly be different.  And getting three games for the price of one isn't so bad at all, either.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"M. VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"One of the Greatest Games Ever Made for Fantasy Fans","reviewText":"Recently on G4 Tech TV I was watching \"Filter\", and they were counting down the top 10 underrated games of all time, and to my amazement and joy, Vagrant Story was rated the #1 most underrated game ever. There could be no title more worthy, and it saddens me that it has a 4 star average here on Amazon, though it's not really suprising.Vagrant Story was one of the final Square games to come out for the PS1, and went by almost unnoticed. I didn't actually play it until it was a couple of years old. The graphics are without doubt some of the best ever seen on the PS1. I wish we could have had voice overs in this game, but such things were still pretty uncommon on the PS1. The sound is very good, light on music and heavy on creepy, atmospheric sound effects that really enhance the feeling of being lost in the huge mazes of buildings, tunnels, and dungeons.As it is, the dialogue is absolutely exceptional, and the story is complex, twisting, and really makes you think. Good and evil end up not being quite what you think they are. The story has a heavy emphasis on a religious, crusader/inquisition type group of characters, as well as incorporating sorcery and magic. I could never explain how great the story and characters of this game are...it's just magical. The world just sucks you in.The entire game takes place in an old abandoned ghost town on an island called Lea Monde. It is one of the most phenomenal environments ever created for a game. Much of the game takes place underground in old tunnels, vaults, caves, storage areas, and a huge variety of buried rooms, but there are also many areas where you emerge and have to explore the city aboveground. The feeling of the game is very lonely, and the old abandoned town of Lea Monde is amazing to explore.The amount of detail that was put into this game is just incredible, and it is evident at every moment just what a labor of love it was for those who made it. Not only is the game itself exceptional, but the plethora of details they incorporated makes it an all time classic. For example, on the map screen, every single room in the game (and there are a lot) has it's own unique name. There is one dungeon where every room (and there are at least 30) is named after an implement of torture! It's just great.There is a huge variety of enemies, and an in game encyclopedia that fills up as you encounter them. Combat is very difficult, and it seemed to me at first even too difficult, but once you get the hang of it, this game has one of the most fun, and definitely most unique, combat systems ever devised. With each swing you take, you can choose where to aim on the enemy (left or right arm, legs, body, or head!), and depending on the enemy, armor, and what type of weapon you are using, you will have a different %chance of hit and damage. There are about 6 or 7 types of weapons (blunt, piercing, slashing, etc.) and a HUGE variety of different weapons within these categories. Within this there are different gems that can be attached to your weapons to make them more efficient against certain types of enemies, give them elemental attributes, etc.Truly, this game has an almost intimidating amount of detail, but that's what makes it so great. You can armor all parts of your body, and every single weapon and every single piece of armor is customizable by combining lesser weapons and armor in workshops that can be found among Lea Monde. Materials range from course materials like wood and iron early in the game to silver and platinum materials later. Weapons have to be created and specialized in for different creature types. For example, I usually had a spear I used against dragons, a holy mace and a holy dagger for undead and zombies, and an axe that was most effiecent against humanoid creatures. Plus, you can actually name every weapon you create, which adds an awesome finishing touch to your arsenal.There is so much about this game that is great that I could go on for another hour and hardly scratch the surface. This game is thought provoking, its deep, and it is CHALLENGING. Not for wimps! There is so much to explore, so many hidden features, such endless customization, this game just never gets old. And, it has a new game plus feature, so you can replay it with all the skills, equipment, and magic you've acquired. Damn, I didn't even touch on the magic...there is a huge variety of magic spells you can learn as well!I've played through it probably 3 times over the past few years, and it remains fun every time I play, and I still haven't maxed out Ashley Riots potential.This game may not be for everyone. It is hard, confusing, and very deep. But for those of you that love fantasy games, a good story, great characters and dialogue, tons of character/equipment customization, and a big challenge, give this game a try. You can get it for cheap now, and even though it's a little dated, it may be one of your best game purchases in quite awhile.On a final note, I'm thrilled to know that the people who are responsible for this game and for Final Fantasy Tactics are the main creative force working on Final Fantasy XII right now. It should be phenomenal! I can't wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2005"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D. Edwards \"Avid Aesthete\"","summary":"Offers great features and customization options for the serious gamer!","reviewText":"Prior to getting my hands on this G700s dedicated gaming mouse, I've done all of my gaming with standard mice - all of them Logitech, since they've proven to be the best mouse manufacturer, in my experience. While the average, everyday mouse is perfectly fine for gaming, THIS mouse, as one would expect, clearly blows the others out of the water!For the cool hundred note (at this writing) that you'll drop for this mouse, you get up to five gamer profiles that will automatically load into the mouse via the software that you can download from Logitech's site. Searching the site blind does not automatically lead you to the downloads associated with this mouse, nor does the Logitech G700s specifically come up for registration purposes (you can register your mouse simply as the Logitech G700, but the image, and, I'm guessing, specific mouse you're registering, is NOT this one), so that's something to keep in mind... But, once you've tracked down and installed the gaming software, the customization options for this mouse are wide-ranging, and pretty much all-encompassing...While in the gaming software, you can highlight each individual button on the generously-sized mouse for assignation of any of a long list of options from the drop-down menu. And there are plenty of options, just as there are plenty of buttons to put to use here. The setup is quick and, for the most part, easy, but, while this worked for the perhaps more-intelligent, less-buggy games that I play online (Guild Wars 2, Tera, and The Witcher 2), some others that are not intended as hard-core games (such as The Sims 3) didn't take the settings quite as quickly and easily. Since I'm one of those, just-wanna-pick-up-and-learn-on-the-fly sorts, I still have to do some tweaking of my button settings, and I feel that'll be the case for anyone else that's new to a proper, worth-every-penny dedicated gaming mouse, but for those of you that have already set up and used a dedicated gaming mouse, adjusting your G700s will probably be easy as pie for you.Overall, this mouse has plenty of options to offer for anyone that's looking to take their gaming to the next level. You'll want to take the time to properly set this mouse up, though. My Windows 7 x64 system detected the mouse automatically, but only as a very basic mouse. My driver updating program, DriverMax, also detected it, but not with its specific settings, and ended up installing a basic universal driver for it as an update - that driver removed all of the gaming functionality of the G700s, so I had to roll back from it. Until you update and/or install all of the software associated with this mouse, it will move super-slow as you try to navigate around your desktop, but, once the dedicated software is installed, you'll be up to faster speeds and responsiveness than you've possibly ever experienced with a mouse.In the hand, this mouse completely fills mine with its large size, and it's definitely meant for manipulating it claw-style. There's even a small lip or platform for the rightie to nest his or her thumb below the four navigation buttons on the left side of it. For the desktop user, the included USB cables provide all that you could hope for in maintenance and length for this mouse - the Eneloop battery mine arrived containing had a 2/3 charge to it, and after just about two days of everyday and gaming use, I needed to attach the micro USB charger to it. Since that cable is plenty long, I had no problems gaming and navigating with the mouse while it was charging, and it didn't take long to get back to a full charge - just a few hours. The surface texture of the mouse also makes it very comfortable in the hand, and makes it easy to grip, even should you be one that ends up getting sweaty palms over the course of your gaming sessions. The laser sensor also seems to work well over multiple surfaces, going by my experience, although I can't speak to effectiveness over clear glass surfaces... I suspect it might not quite be able to tackle clear glass, but I'm really not sure, so don't quote me on it... It also glides pretty well over most surfaces, but I've felt it snag a bit on a spot or two on my mouse pad where I see nothing to impede its movement.The packaging of this mouse is really well-done, and, from the moment you pick up the non-clamshell closure box (thank GOD!), to the unpacking and utilization of this mouse, it leaves nothing to be desired. it really does cover all the bases that I think any gamer out there, and any user, in general, could want. Logitech has delivered for me with every product I've ever purchased from them, their customer service and warranty exchange policies have always left me more than satisfied, and I have no doubt that this mouse will prove to be the best I've ever used! So far, so awesome!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Sunshine is a step down, but still fun","reviewText":"When I first saw the screenshots of this Mario, I freaked out thinking \"What the crap is Nintendo thinking? Mario with a hydro jet-pack?! Getouttahere!\" But, since I'm a huge Nintendo addict and buy everything Mario (besides the Super Mario Bros. live action movie), I ended up reserving it for a cool Nintendo PC disc with a bunch of awesome Mario things and getting the game. I was really stoked the more I read about this game. When I actually started playing the game, I discovered it was a nice add-on to the Mario series... but I'd still prefer the classic jumping plumber over a weird water pack that helps you fly/rocket/etc.The story is a bit different from the other Mario adventures. You are going on vacation and a graffiti punk begins to tag the resort with groovy colors. You're adventure takes you on a rid... a rid of washing paint of everything in sight! Now, I bet you're thinking \"What in the...\" but it's a fun, great Mario game. Still, I feel for you. The premier of a Gamecube Super Mario game should have been Mario in Mushroom Kingdom jumping on Goombas, using Yoshi to eat things, running from football turtles, and beating up on some Koopa kids. But, not here, although `someone' does make an appearance for you to beat the mess out of.Graphically, this is a good looking game. Mario looks like he should in the 3D world with loads of polygons, loads of animations, and his classic red/blue apparel. Every other character you encounter looks really good too. The basic bosses are well done and that's where the classic Mario shows in the game. For instance, in one area, you fight a giant parana plant, who is really well done (really, really well done). The maps are really well thought out and look amazing. There's an instance where you have to battle on a roller coaster. The game never lags so everything on this ride of how the visuals showcase are in full proportion and really fast.The game supports Dolby Digital surround sound. Mario + Surround = Awesomeness!! There's a few scenes where they actually did some good voice acting, staring Princess Peach, Toad, and Mario. I really have no complaint about the music at all. As for controls, this game is easy. The only time the game gets hard is the time they take the jet-pack off and you have to navigate some weird jumping puzzles. The reason it's hard is because you're used to the relaxing jet-pack and loose your ability to jump around. Intentional? I don't really know but those puzzles are really dang hard. Camera is the same. The camera is almost perfect in most areas (although some levels the camera is the thing that kills you).There is some replay value to the game since you get to unlock an alternative costume, a more beach styled costume, to play through the second time. The game is well done so you may want to run through it again, just not right after you finish it.Overall, I say get this game. It's probably $20 right now and well worth the money. I have never really disliked the game itself, just the fact that Nintendo hasn't released a classic Mario game for the Gamecube. The game though is well done and very fun. Also, in today's high-def age, the game still fairs well overall in the graphics/sounds category. Just don't expect the grass to move.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

They have, however, completely succeeded with Kingdom Hearts.  The Zelda-esque control schematic allows for very easy-to-pick-up gameplay while allowing for more complicated, RPG-esque thought-engrossing play.  Both the standard interface and the battle system are well thought out.The storyline and character development itself moves at a reasonable pace, although you're sort of thrown in abruptly at the beginning of the game without much explanation in a typically Squaresoft fashion.  The incorporation of Disney characters into a Squaresoft universe is done flawlessly; all borrowed characters look and act exactly as they should, without seeming extraordinarily out of place (after the initial shock).  The game's music and voice acting are both incredibly well done - after all, you can't go wrong with such big names as Utada Hikaru &amp; Haley Joel Osmont.If you're a closed-minded Final Fantasy junkie, don't get this game; you'll hate it, and it will hate you.  If you're looking for a fun, enjoyable leap out of Square's usual fare and a solid gaming experience, pick this game up immediately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2002"}

We take some of the characters from the Final Fantasy worlds: Cloud, Aeris, Yuffie, Squall, and Sephiroth.  These characters are not playable but serve to drive the story at times.  As a longtime fan of the Final Fantasy series (starting back from the very first game on the NES), it was nice to get to visit with these characters.  I wish that some of the earlier FF heroes were around, but that isn't even worth a complaint.The story progresses through various Disney worlds, each very well done and each with a playable guest character (Tarzan, Ariel, Peter Pan).The game itself has beautiful graphics, but the greatest fear was in the voice acting.  Many games with voice acting fail in this regard.  It seems like a good idea, but if not done correctly the game would be better off with text dialogue.  Kingdom Hearts has the best voice acting in gaming (along with the Metal Gear Solid games).  Success.How does it play?  The control is excellent.  Kingdom Hearts has a control feel like the Secret of Mana/Legend of Mana games.  It is a RPG with an action battle system.  You still have the ability to use magic, items and summon creatures to aid you (a useless feature in this game as i didn't need to use it once), but the action comes fast and furious.The main flaw is the camera movement, which at times gets in the way so that you can't see the enemies that you are attacking.  It is a pain, but not enough of a drawback to really detract from the game.The bottom line is simply that the game is fun.  I enjoyed playing through Kingdom Hearts more than i have nearly any other game in quite some time.  Don't be distracted by people saying Disney and Final Fantasy shouldn't mix or that one company is bad...the game is the important part here, and the game is simply fun to play.  Even with the Disney name, this is not a kiddie game.  It is fast paced and has a dark storyline.It is also one of the best games of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2002"}

I remembered how Super Metroid was such an improvement over the original and I was hoping that this game would be even greater. Now Metroid Fusion has all the trimmings of an excellent Metroid game, with its detailed graphics, good soundtrack, and improved story. However, one aspect of the game is a bit off, and unfortunately it is the most important aspect of all, and that is the gameplay. More on to that a bit later, so read on my friends.The graphics of the game are excellent, and is by far the strongest point of the game. Nintendo did a great job using the Game Boy Advance's full potential for this game, and it really shows. The backgrounds and lighting effects are all above par, and should make any Metroid fan happy. From boiling rooms erupting lava, to sub zero rooms overflowing with ice, to artificial jungles, to the basic save and recharge room, the games graphics are very detailed and vibrant. Nothing negative to say about the character designs either. Each enemy has a classic Metroid feel to it, and Samus has never looked better...If you enjoyed the sound from Super Metroid then you will like the sounds of Metroid Fusion just as much. The only gripe I have is the the music is recycled, and usually repeats whenever you enter a different sector. It is disappointing that each sector doesn't have its own theme music, but you really can't expect too much from the limited power of the Game Boy Advance. However, the sound effects of the game are fine. Explosions, evaporating enemies, flips, nature effects, etc. are all above par, and sound fine.Unlike the sound and graphics, the gameplay of Metroid Fusion is sadly disappointing. Instead of the great exploration that took place in the previous Metroids, you are left with a game that instead, tries to walk you through it. The game play's in a mission based format, and forces you to take on different objectives. While this may seem interesting, this is a direction that the Metroid series shouldn't have taken. The primary problem with this is that the game gives you a map, too detailed descriptions of what you are supposed to do, and you are even told what exact area you are to go to. Instead of exploring the different sectors to complete the objectives, you are left with an annoying computer giving you too much information in every single level. This aspect makes the game too linear, and takes away the thing that made Metroid so great. The primary flow of the game is get a mission and map of the sector you are going to. Then use that map to know exactly where to go in that sector, finish the objective, and go back to the computer. Even more annoying is sometimes you will backtrack to previous sectors, a gameplay element that seemed to flow into Metroid Prime as well. Now while it is fun to blast enemies, and experience the new elements of Samus, the fact that the objectives of the game are so linear is a let down.Apart from the story and objective part of the gameplay is the actual action based fighting part. Just like the traditional Metroid games you have your laser cannon, bombs, missiles, and the energy tank. A new idea thrown into the game was the parasites, which when absorbed allow you to recover your health or missiles. The interesting part of this is how if you don't absorb the parasite it can sometimes transform into an enemy. This quick aspect of gameplay is another interesting idea thrown into the game. Also, you can find upgrades in the game to increase their power, or add for more of those weapons to be stored. Despite the fact this game is mission based, it is still fun to fight enemies and search for some secrets hidden in each sector. The classic Samus gameplay, hidden secrets, and fact that the game is not TOTALLY linear, is why this game is still a fun game, and didn't turn into a total disaster.Sadly, the replay value of the game is poor, as in this case correlates to the challenge of the game. This game is very easy, and can be completed in anywhere from 4-8 hours. The game's lack of levels, linear gameplay, and small amount of secrets will be the primary reasons you most likely will not go through the game again. The key reason that the challenge of the game is so simple is of the fact that the map feature was included. The mission objective story would have blended so well had the game not been so linear. The things that made the Metroid series so great was that every time you went in a level you could explore it differently than you had before. You could go to levels in any order you wanted, and the freedom kept you hanging, yet constantly interested. It is a shame that this game couldn't have gone in the same direction.Overall, this game is just missing something.  It could be the linear gameplay, simple premise, or lack of hidden secrets that made both Metroid and Super Metroid so fun. I still enjoyed Metroid Fusion, but after beating it, I just wanted more. Those that don't care for the Metroid series don't even give this game a second glance. However, I recommend fans the series to give this one a go. All in all, Metroid Fusion is an interesting result of the new steps Nintendo was trying to create. However, these new steps is what took away the gameplay that made Metroid what it was.  I can only hope that the next Metroid follows the path it should have took.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

The mysterious storyline easily draws you in. I liked that we could explore or choose options that affect our outcome in the end, but you don't have total free reign and still have to stick to the plot. You also get to control multiple characters in the game and experience the storyline from their points of view. There were no action scenes (that you control) or fighting which also surprised me. There are only directional button sequences you have to follow during key events... Kind of strange!!

I remember wasting hours and hours on this console, even skipping school to stay home and play. I don't remember when my console died but it was quite some time ago, I never bought another Genesis, and playing through a PC emulator never seemed quite the same.I took a chance and bought this, and I'm very glad that I did. Some of the games are 20 years old, and yet they have better gameplay and replayability than most modern games that I buy. Playing Streets of Rage with my nephew who has never even seen a Genesis, and having fun with it just proves that good games are timeless, and graphics are completely overrated. Speaking of graphics, you will be happy to know that this looks awesome on HDTVs despite the obvious technological time gap. The games are playing in a windowed mode, which avoids horizontal stretching, since these games were obviously not designed with HD resolutions in mind. The text in most games (haven't played them all yet) is very clear and easy to read. there appears to be no graphic problems whatsoever.Although this collection misses some really good games it is definitely worth getting. I am hoping SEGA makes more of these, and starts to re-release some of their awesome Saturn games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"One of the essential Xbox 360 titles","reviewText":"Gears of War, one of the first big titles out for the 360, had the unenviable position of justifying the console to gamers who were still months away from Halo 3, the main reason they all bought 360s in the first place. Despite these astronomic expectations, Gears came through, and came through in a big way.The first thing you will notice is how good the game looks. Although lacking in vibrant colors (not that you would expect them in a post-apolyptic world), the graphics are superb and seamless. You truly feel as if you are playing the starring role in an action movie.And if it was a movie, it would have a hard \"R\" rating. The game features lots of profanity, gore, and all-around violence. Those of you who are squeamish or have sensitive ears should avoid this game. After all, what do you expect when you give a roided-out guy in armor an assualt rifle with a chainsaw on it and tell him to go fight aliens?The most unique feature of the game, in my opinion, is the intuitive cover system. This game plays like a real firefight, not the circle-and-crouching-fights you would find in something like Halo. One of your buttons is context-sensitive, and if anything looks like cover, it can be used as cover. You can blind-fire around the corner, or peek your head out to get a more accurate shot. This adds a whole new dimension to the realism. Players lack the ability to jump and only have a limited crouch ability, so it truly is take cover or die.This game is a pure firefight, so don't expect to do a lot of sneaking around (though flanking is a good idea). Despite this, the game never gets old, as you are constantly facing new enemies, gaining new weapons, and fighting in new environments.Bottom line, as long as you can tolerate all the stuff that gives Gears of War its \"Mature\" rating, get it. This is almost everything a shooter should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Had masterpiece potential, but...","reviewText":"...The ocean came along! Yeah, this is really, truly a great game. Let me break this game down...PROS...-  The graphics are superb (some of the best I have ever seen in a video game, and it isn't really a cartoon, it's more like a CG sequence from an early PS1 game, it actually reminds me of the CG sequences from Wild Arms, which is a good thing. So yeah, the graphics are brilliant and flawless.-The characters show a lot of emotion, something that is welcomed.- The storyline may seem odd and uninspiring at first, but as you venture throughout the game the mysteries of the ocean are uncovered, making the storyline so much better.- Battle system is great, and you can do more moves than ever.- There are LOTS of areas to explore, and a lot of heart pieces to collect.- The items are MUCH better than the failure which was Majoras Mask, more resemblant of Ocarina of Time.- Everything else, except what is listed in the \"cons\" list...CONS.....-Okay, I'm sure you've heard about it...but THE OCEAN. It is horrendous, making you constantly take out your Windwaker to change the fricken wind direction, something that gets old very fast. Also, the frequency of this is very high, as you often will sail by things too fast and have to turn around, only to have the wind hold you back!....So you have to take out the Windwaker again!! Also, the ocean is W-A-Y T-O-O B-I-G. I mean, there are about 49 squares (at least I think so) to cover, sound like a lot? You have NO idea. Every square on the map is HUGE, and takes at least a few minutes just to sail across. Many times, it takes 10 minutes or so just to reach your destination, and thats only if you arent knocked out of your boat by a suprise shark attack or having to take out your good friend the windwaker to change the wind direction 20 times. Later in the game, you have to find 8 or so triforce maps, and after each one, guess what? You have to search for the triforces!!!! This task takes ages, probably at least 5 or 6 hours, because you have to go to EVERY square and get the map drawn out by the fish. Honestly, I gave up on the game at this point. I dont want to waste 4 hours of my life searching for triforces just to finish this game up. If i do find them all, all thats left is the final dungeon...which probably wont be all that fun considering...- The dungeons are pretty boring and tedious. Each dungeon takes a staggering 2+ hours to beat, and thats with the fact that the puzzles are very easy, and the bosses are a piece of cake. I often defeat the bosses on my first try, and with a lot of ease. The later dungeons require you to play the \"command \" melody and play as a different character. Sound fun? Well, it isnt. First of all, playing the song over, and over...and OVER is tedious as it is, and second, if you even get hit with the other character (and its easy, they have no weapons and move at a slow pace), you switch back to link...and have to play the song AGAIN!!!Overall- This game could have been a masterpiece, really. Everything about it was great...until you uncover the cons. I wish I would have enjoyed it more, because ive always loved the Zelda series. Majoras Mask showed the series going down hill, and this game prooves it. Like others have stated, it would have been SO much better if it had an auto- sail mode. It would have been easy, you just switch the wind to the direction you are headed and sail there, or the game does it for you... But no, they wanted us to explore every inch of the sea till we are sea sick to near death. This is still a pretty good game, well worth the money, just dont be surprised if you give up near the end like I did....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2005"}

Prepare foods, combine raw ingredients, cook the meal and present your culinary masterpiece to Mama for your final score.","reviewerName":"L. J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"Mesmerizing Monotony","reviewText":"The problem I've noticed with a lot of DS games is that they totally lack any kind of replay value. Out of the five games I've bought since I got this hand held, I've only kept two of them. The main problem I've noticed is that the games where either too repetative or the difficulty was skewed towards being too difficult or too easy. Cooking Mama embodies both of this common problems, as once the novelty of the touch screen control weares off, there is very little substance remaining.Cooking Mama is about cooking, of course. As you complete recipes, new ones become available for a total of 76 unique dishes. After unlocking of those, you can combine two recipes for even more complex and difficult culinary challenges, and practice certain cooking skills. It may seem on paper that there is a lot to do here, but in reality there really isn't. Each recipe is broken down into a series of steps, each step representing a beat the clock mini-game. Here in lies Cooking Mama's main problem. The mini-games are really repetative. You'll see seeing a lot of the same one's over and over again, sometimes twice in the same recipe. Cut the vegetables, boil the ingredients, slice meat, dry fry the food. The recipe unique games are few and far between. And goodness help you if really hate one of the games that pop up frequently. I can't stand the game where a series of intrustions scrolls across the top screen and you must perform the action just as it passes over this little line. It's not hard or anything, just annoying and sometimes you can do it up to three times per recipe.The DS cartridge is capable of holding ports of 3D Nintendo 64 games so there really is no excuse why Cooking Mama only seems to have about 30 mini-games total. Some of the challenges are utterly ridiculous too. One game has you imputting the number of minutes Mama tells you to onto a microwave. It's no challenge at all, and its the kind of activity that belongs on a Speak-N-Spell. In fact most of the mini-games really aren't very challenging. The only one that I ever found difficult was the game where you have to coat meat in bread crumbs because it takes forever to do it.Cooking Mama is okay for its low price, but after a few days I imagine you will put it away and never look at it again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2006"}

I liked the idea of training your own army of Pokemon to do battle against other users or the PC. Pokemon Platinum doesn't fail to deliver, but there are some upsides and downsides to the game. First, Pokemon Platinum is not really a new game. It is a rehash of Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl.  Apparently Nintendo likes to do this with its Pokemon franchise. There are only 210 or so Pokemon you can catch using just the Platinum game. In order to catch all 493+ Pokemon, you must have access to the old GameBoy games and be able to insert the cartridge while playing. That  means if you only have a Nintendo DSi (like me), then you're up a creek without a paddle. But wait, you could theoretically trade with a buddy assuming your WiFi security is crippled to allow only WEP pass codes. If you use WPA2, you're up a creek without a paddle (again) if you want to use Nintendo Wi-Fi connection inside the game. It just won't accept a WPA2 passcode even if your DSi will connect (using the advanced setup for WiFi). Long story short, if you want to catch and train every single Pokemon possible, make sure you at least have the capability to load a GBA cartridge, have a buddy with access to the hardware/games, and use a crippled WiFi connection that depends on WEP passcodes.The graphics are awesome in my opinion. I love how many of the Pokemon are depicted in a warm and friendly manner. Even the fiercest of Pokemon look relatively docile in the artwork. The sound and music are apropro for the game, while the controls are very intuitive. If you've played a turn-based RPG game like Final Fantasy, Pokemon Platinum will be almost second nature.I took my time and was able to defeat Cyrus within 40 hours of gameplay. However, there's also the Elite Four of the Pokemon League along with other side quests to capture legendary Pokemon. The level grinding took the most time. I also do not like how I have to buy health replenishing items or status healers. Games like Oblivion have done away with the need to buy 30,000 health potions. Using healing magic or abilities would have been nice in Pokemon, or even health regeneration. Running back/forth to the Pokemon centers became a pain in the butt. Granted, the Pokemon game engine was developed more than a decade ago, but Nintendo could have put the effort to refresh it a little. I do not have time to play Pokemon all the time, so I delegated level grinding as a chore whenever I have to fly on business. The countless hours spent waiting at the airport and sitting on the plane are now put to use leveling up my Pokemon.Pros: Awesome artwork! The Pokemon look very friendly, cute, and huggable. Great sound effects although they could have made it more like the cartoon using actual audio (Pika Pika!). I'm not sure how large the capacity of the DS cartridges is, but seeing how I can easily get 2GB-8GB SD cards that are  the size, it's a matter of Nintendo keeping up with the times. Simple combat interface.Cons: Level grinding, buying health and status healers, and sometimes it isn't obvious what you need to do to progress the story. The menu system is often cumbersome - depositing/withdrawing Pokemon in Bebe's PC takes too long, saving sometimes takes too long.You need to invest in the older games, a DS/DS Lite (not a DSi), and have a buddy ready to trade in order to catch every Pokemon or at least get their data into your Pokedex. Also make sure your Wifi is capable of inferior WEP security in order to use Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Overall: 4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2010"}

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"Final Fantasy VII- -an epic story of Cloud Strife","reviewText":"If I don't play this game for a period of time, I go through withdrawl and I'm not kidding. This game features so many epic events and cinematic sequences. You start the game out wondering what it's about, then you come attatched to it and you can't quit. Soon you are one with the game and you understand every little detail and you feel you are Cloud Strife, the main character. From the Assault On Reactor No. 1 to The Northern Cave to save the world from Sephiroth, this is beautifully thought out and planned. I believe there is not a better game out there. This is the game that made me an official RPG player. I didn't even know what an RPG was before this! My first time playing this was on a japanese demo now out of print and very rare...it came with the Tobal No. 1 double package. This demo had Final Fantasy 7 demo, Final Fantasy Tactics (cinematic), and Bushido Blade (cinematic). I heard about this game, and good things about it, so I decided to try it out. I played it, and it was very different from the regular game, for instance you start out with Aerith, Cloud, and Barret and magics (Bolt, Bolt2; Ice, Ice2; Demi, Demi2; Fire, Fire2, and Leviathan Summon). It was the Assault On Reactor No. 1, then it ended.  I soon became addicted and I played this demo every other day, and played it more than Tobal by far. I became very intrested in this game and everyday I played the Reactor level. I found more and more things, and I didnt have enough money to buy it, so I had to wait a whole year, and finally bought the 3 disc epic for playstation. Now I play it at least every two weeks, and I have beaten the game 3 times, and find a new secret and learn something new every time. This game is absolutely amazing. With a five-star rating, and not a four-star rating in sight, you know this HAS to be a good game, and it doesn't lie. I love this game to death and it will soon be out of print, so pick your copy up today before it does.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2001"}

While the sensation was pleasing, I never got the impression I was actually playing an installment of the Fallout franchise.Fallout 3 follow the trials of the most recent Vault Dweller of Vault 101. The introduction is incredibly fun and well thought out, with enough points to make playing with it not seem like a chore, and a nice deviation for the standard setup for creating characters.After leaving the Vault, you wander through a desolate wasteland filled with wondrous creatures that all possess telescopic X-ray/night vision and have a magnetic attraction to your tasty, tasty flesh. This doesn't seem to matter, as you can lay weaste to all in your path with a trusty baseball bat and your wonderous ability to attack at a similar pace as that of the Agents from the Matrix. Rather than be used for the total combat system, AP is now the sole property of the new precision targeting system, VATS, which freezes time and allows the player to make multiple attacks within a single breath, and then continue attacking as if you had not just swung a sledgehammer 4 times in .35 seconds.This lays out the biggest flaw in Fallout 3, the combat. The combat scales with difficulty, going from quadraplegic easy all the way up to very easy. When you're able to vanquish a super mutant in hand to hand combat at level 1, all is not well in the greater metropolitan wasteland. They had a few brillaint ideas, namely making ammo and a few select helth items be secondary to the rest of the games equipment and items, which means you can loot to your hearts content and not worry about having to choose between a new toy and toys that keep your blood in your veins.The only other glaring flaw is the skill system. Previously, your abilities were based on skill level. At 25% lockpick, you could pick simple things and maybe jimmy your way through some doors, but safes were out there. In Fallout 3, everything is based on dull, pointless minigames. And while the minigames aren't terribly annoying, you're locked out of anything above your skill level, as if you can't figure out that this is indeed a safe, and that yes, you should pick it with the same hairpin and scredriver you've used on everything else. This wouldn't be as annoying if it wasn't for the fact that if you're 1 point below the required increment (25, 50, 75, 100), thats 1 point of you can go pound sand. The games are sadly easy, and can be attempted as many times as desired, barring a long run of bad luck. Thankfully, only lockpicking and computer hacking suffered in this incarnation. I was desperately worried that you'd have to play some warped form of Operation to repair wounds, but its still at least somewhat straightforward of remove shrapnel, bandage arm, inject magic chemicals. Guns are a bit overdone, as you're able to turn just about everything in sight into piles of ash or bloody limbs once you're around 30-40% skilled, and can hit a headshot with every shot. Lastly, sneak is about as useful as a blinking neon sign. Unless you tailor your character as a sneaker, its more like hide, as moving  anywhere above a crawl draws the attention of everyone in line of sight.Ron Perlman continues his top-notch voice acting, but they must've budgeted him last, as he has no epilogue outside of a cookie cutter 1 2 3 sequence of the ending, with none of the character or location mentions that were so entertaining in Fallout 1 & 2.The remainder of the characters have fairly unique voices and interesting personalities, and act like real people, though crime is still a bit of a killbuzz. Quests are entertaining, though a few are strangely put together, the majority are well thoguht out and storied. The central storyline feels a bit short, and there are some bugs fi you play your cards right, but you actually feel compelled to help your father, as he has more personality and depth than normal pivotal robot NPC's.The last annoyance was Dogmeat, whom I have yet to encounter despite 25 hours of playing, and wandering around half of the Tri-state area.Despite my whining about how this did't fullfilled my personal nerd fantasy for Fallout, the game itself is solid, with beautiful scenery, many entertaining quests and locations to explore, above average voice acting, and an overall fun feel to the game. Theres just no real feeling of accomplishment, as you feel like Rambo or the Terminator after you wade through a horde of Super Mutants with a Louisville Slugger. If this game had been titled differently, my complaints would've mostly fallen apart, but having the name Fallout implied a style and setup that just wasn't there. The reason I give this 4 stars however, is that the game is fun, and the stories in it were good. It had the same appeal of Saints Row 2. While the physics were annoying at times and the police setup didn't make much sense, you were having enough of a good time that the flaws didn't stand out. The fact that this was called Fallout made those flaws shine through the surface.Also, I love how its been tagged enough as \"Oblivion with guns\" to be first pick in the hotlist.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"cracka \"jd\"","summary":"5 stars for vice city, 2 stars for gta 3","reviewText":"I don't have the Gta's for XBox only for PS2, manly because PS2 is better and the only reason I have a XBox is because my cuz gave it to me for nothing but I think the idea of sony giving vice city and gta 3 to XBox is wrong on the count that sony would have made more money on not giving it away because people would buy a PS2 for the games, but lets get to the point, Vice City rocks, GTA3 sucks.1st Gta3, the grapics are o.k. but the fingers don't move like a PS game, your chracter dosen't talk and the weapon veriaty sucks, but the fun things you can do IN THE GAME I REMIND YOU GANGSTER WANTABES is that you can car jack people, flickoff police, buy weapons and ecsplore the city.Now Vice city the things that you can do in this game you can't do or have in the other,Unlike GTA3 this game has a little bit of a stroy line.

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Love this game!","reviewText":"SEGA is leading Sonic in the right direction with there new \"Hedgehog Engine\" which makes a whole new awesome setting in standard 3D Sonic games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","summary":"A welcome update to the F.E.A.R. franchise but requires Steam to play","reviewText":"FEAR:2, the long awaited sequel to the original Fear Trilogy (not really a trilogy, but there were three games: Fear, Fear: Extraction Point, and Fear: Perseus Mandate) is finally here and it doesn't disappoint. Walking the footprints of giants in the horror game genre isn't easy, especially when one of them was your previous incarnation, the original FEAR. Gladly, they got it right, and in fact, even better than the original in many ways.First off the level design is much more imaginative than in the original F.E.A.R. There are a wider variety of environments (No more endless office corridors!) and they are all very nicely done.Second, the shock value is as good or better than the original with new affects, startling moments, and fast paced action akin to Doom 3. Slow moments are mixed in, complete with visions of the dead, 1st person cut scenes that move the story along, and a few nice nods to the earlier game.One of the things I liked best in the original F.E.A.R when it was released was the way the weapons worked. They just felt 'right' and meshed with the environments to create clouds of concrete dust from bullets hitting the walls and support beams, fires, etc. That's been taken to a whole new level in FEAR:2. The combat feels cinematic with you controlling the action. It's amazing. Sometimes I wanted to just sit back and watch what was going on, but couldn't because I would have gotten hacked to pieces by one of the swarming zombies coming my way...This is a fairly short game, and replay value is average. Once you've played it for the story and been shocked out of your socks at a few places, the intensity level will be lower. However, the game play and visuals will keep you entertained nonetheless.One of my biggest complaints with the game is that they did a poor job of tying FEAR:2's story together at the end. It will leave you with as many questions as answers, in the same way Fear: Extraction Point frustrated me.I am a huge advocate for DRM free games. I've written many of those 1 star reviews that so many of you dislike. I will continue to write them, because I believe draconian DRM schemes like SECUrom are terrible for the consumer, and unnecessary as well. However, in the case of FEAR:2 and STEAM, I actually am coming down on the side of STEAM (to an extent):1. Steam is DRM, but it isn't malicious like Securom and does not enforce limited installations on your computer. It does not take root level control of you computer, and does not attempt to disable other software, nor does it potentially screw up hardware profiles for CD/DVD drives. It is in short, about as benign as I can imagine DRM being, and while it does have its problems (see below) it is a compromise that I can in good conscience make.2. I already have a STEAM account and have had one since HL1 days, and have a completely satisfactory experience with it, including installing multiple games on a series of different computers over time.3. STEAM does not attempt to control my computer. It does a simple check with the server and then releases me to play my games. In fact, contrary to common belief, you can unplug your computer's internet and play Steam games all you like once they are activated.However, STEAM has some real negatives as well:1. Potentially violates the \"Doctrine Of First Sale\" which guarantees my right to re-sell something that I've purchased. STEAM allows a 1 time transfer of the game to another account, but once it is moved, that's the end. No more transfers. I understand why STEAM does this: to prevent massive rings of gamers swapping games back and forth using their servers to achieve it, bogging up their download severs, etc... While I agree that is a problem for them, I think that limiting transfers violates my rights, and destroys the second hand game market.2. Requires 'One more program' to be run on my computer. I'm pretty selective about what I install on my PC, and I hate being forced to have yet another program running just to access some of my games.3. What happens if Steam goes out of business? Will I still have access to my games? How? None of that is spelled out in any documentation from STEAM or VALVE.So basically I've come into this one with my eyes wide open. It's not that I love STEAM and think it is totally without faults. I just think that its faults are not enough to limit me playing a game as good as FEAR:2. STEAM itself has proved itself reliable in the last 7 years, and so I'm willing to use it to play a game I really, really want to play. The key distinction is that Securom DAMAGES my computer and TAKES AWAY MY ADMINISTRATIVE RIGHT, as well as ENFORCES LIMITED INSTALLATIONS. STEAM does none of those things.Overall this is a great game. If you can't live with STEAM, I understand, and I honestly probably wouldn't get involved with it either if I didn't already own a bunch of games on it from years past, before I learned about DRM schemes and began to care about such things. Go in with your eyes open, and if you think it's worth the potential risks, the game itself won't disappoint you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2009"}

I love the new weapons like the saw and railgun but am disappointed the revenant from Halo Reach was removed.  Its also great that being able to run is something you can do anytime instead of having it be a specific ability that must be chosen over other better abilities.  The campaign was quite fun and what I would have expected from a Halo.  I love spartan ops, and I understand that it was meant to remove firefight, but I still miss firefight from Halo Reach.Overall a good game.  I only have one major complaint that really pisses me off: what 343 is doing with the weekly gametype changes.  You're telling me that one week I can play team snipers and the next week the gametype is nonexistent!?  Seriously WTF!!!! Why can't you just leave all the game types up all the time!

The spartan ops campaign is solid, but why is there not an option to play any of the levels online instead of the 5 per week that they choose.

Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"Great game, but have I played this before?","reviewText":"Okay, this is a awesome game. It has wonderful graphics, the airplane details are superbly represented, and the sound is really good. One of the signature differences between this new title and the previous Ace Combat 4 is the addition of the CGI cutscene movies, whereas the Ace Combat 4 used the storyboard type representation. If you have played Ace Combat 4, this game is easy enough to pick up and jump right in to the action. Minor changes have been made to controls to allow for the \"wingman\" control scheme with the D-pad. This enables you to direct you wingmen to either cover, attack, disperse and use their special weapons on a target. You can also use the dpad for the standard yes no reply to questions that your wingmen will ask you throughout the game. It does add a nice touch of realism to the game with all the chatter you hear over the radio.Now, since it has been 3 years since Ace Combat 4, I must say that I really did expect more in the way of advancements, but it truely feels like the same gamestyle, typical storyline, and overall general feel. Of course that is not berateing this game one iota. The graphics are much sharper, the land elevation scenery is much more detailed with trees and brushes now visible. The buildings are also nicely detailed with a higher polygon count. Perhaps the best change made for me is the missile animation you now see when you launch a missile. The missile stream is now much more realistic with the way it curves and actually winds through the air.If you enjoyed Ace Combat 4, you won't regret buying this game. If you never played Ace Combat 4, then you will truely love this game moreso than the typical veteran Ace Combat player. Great visuals, good storyline and good sound design make this a winner in anyone's book.Just to mention that you can either play the campaign mode or arcade mode. Arcade mode will have you reprise your role as Morphius from the Ace Combat 4 game. The campaign will carry you in the role of flight leader and allow you to fight with and control your wingmen. Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2004"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Wild West fun","reviewText":"This is the first Western Rockstar game I have played and I guess I was expecting the same amount of detail as Grand Theft Auto, but although I had a great time playing Red Dead Redemption, I never felt totally blown away.The parallels between the two games are very obvious. Here, you play John Marston, a thug with a chequered past and some scores to settle...,you work your way through the Wild West by making alleigences with various corrupt officials, helping out folk and looking for old enemies. As in GTA, the game world is a giant, free-roamable space, with certain areas conveniently blocked off until the point in the game when you are allowed to move to a new region. In RDR this comprises of a large Southern US state, which eventually leads to going over the border to Mexico, and then finally into a northern mountainous region which holds the largest town in the game.The first thing to praise is the look of the game. I was hugely impressed by the landscape that you are free to explore and admire as much as you like. Great sprawling prairies, rocky mesas, cactus strewn deserts and snowy mountain forests, it really does live up to expectation. The weather and night/day lighting effects are also pretty awesome. You will never tire of the scenery around you in this game.Next comes the actual gameplay. Well I have to announce my first disappointment here in that is is not really that challenging. The missions are almost all the same thing: ride somewhere on your horse and shoot down a load of bad guys. That really does make up about 75% of the gameplay here. I really enjoyed the few changes of pace such as facing a large fire in a neighbouring ranch, and a couple of missions spent riding a moving train were good fun (the train looks great, I could have had plenty more of this). The reason for the repetition is partly because of the transport: horses. Now I read that there are different horse breeds in the game with different abilities, but in practice this makes 0.01% difference to playing the game. All you have to do is find a horse and jump on. The difference to the variety of transport to GTA (many different cars, trucks, bikes, boats and helicopters) is very obvious, and I honestly never cared which horse I was ever riding, they were just a means of getting from A to B.The fighting element is pretty well worked out though, there are several different guns of different types, although why there are quite so many of the same class (all those rifles?), I don't know. The game's gimmick of Dead Eye (like Bullet Time) is fun but it was never the make or break part of winning a fight for me. Duels were a different matter, though - I was terrible at them, they really should have made a clearer turorial for doing these, or maybe I just didn't get it.Other disappointments were that the game was a bit glitchy, I often found items and/or people floating in mid air or trapped in an animation loop. Sometimes I lost missions becasue of glaringly unfair glitches - at one point a bunch of about 4 enemies spontaneously materialized almost on top of me and shot me down before I could even aim at them! There are several mini games but the rewards for doing them are not great and they weren't that interesting. Picking up herbs or shooting various types of wildlife is only mildy diverting. Although I did try and do all the \"stranger\" missions (meeting random people who ask you to do small quests/chores for them), as the characters you meet throughout the game are fantastically realised. Voice acting is spot on, and the appearance and animation of the people in the game is very realistic. There are a lot of weirdos in the world, so it was definitely worth doing all the \"stranger\" missions to have a laugh and/or see some quite creepy goings-on.In a change from GTA, you can pretty much decide whether to play as good or bad in RDR. In GTA, the Police were ALWAYS your enemy, but here you can choose to be honourable and help the law, or be a low down criminal and make everyone hate you. This is very similar to \"Infamous\", which also had a \"saint or sinner\" scale that was affected by your choices in the game.To sum up, this is a breathtaking game to look at, but the missions all seemed slightly mechanical. The random trials of everyday life spiced things up, things like passing a hold-up and deciding to help out, escorting lost people found in the desert to safety, or saving passers-by from attacking wild animals. This all added up to a fuller experience. I also enjoyed playing Texas Hold 'Em and Liars Dice at the various saloons, and breaking in wild horses. So I was never bored, but all in all I never felt like I was eagerly awaiting the next mission to see what new challenges awaited me - they were all pretty much alike. But the sounds and scenery mean the game really oozes authentic atmosphere so I definetley recommend the experience of playing it to everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2010"}

The world designers deserve the very highest marks for making such a huge and not repetitive world.  There are a few places where you will see the same architecture used but by and large each area is fantastically unique.  You will find yourself wondering just how many people were on the design team in order to make each area fell so wildly different.  The world plays much better than Fallout because there are so many places to explore and the travel between locations is relatively fast.  Nasty load and getting stuck bugs from Fallout are nearly gone.  My son and I have played totally different character builds and both work extremely well.  So, unlike Elder Scrolls 4, which had some builds that worked very well while others failed, this game is exceptionally well balanced.The down side is the number of bugs in the quests that result in your inventory being full of useless items.  There are an incredible number of quests and relatively few problems but they are significant.  For example, there is a quest where you kill somebody and get a sword which leads to the next step.  For whatever reason, the quest was not marked as complete for me and the guy who drops the sword is also needed to get his heart.  In trying to get the heart later I now have 3 copies of the sword filling up my inventory and a heart that I found elsewhere but I can't finish the quests. So, I have LARGE amount of my inventory full of items that I can't get rid of and I can't clear the quest.  In other places, I found items before I got assigned the quest.  So, again extra junk in the inventory.  In other quests I killed the required boss before the quest and the quest arrow leads to the place where the now decomposed body was.  Again, that leads to some items stuck in my inventory.  Other places, I found items, before they were requested, got credit for the quest but the items are in my inventory.You got the idea the inventory management and quest bugs stink and happen over and over again.So, there is one major design flaw in an otherwise truly awesome game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

The game is simply beautiful, exploring and coming across caves and rivers and a thousand other things just has a certain magic to it.  The combat, while still not perfect, has gotten a large improvement from Oblivion.  I enjoyed most of the quests, and the faction quests steal the show yet again.  The replay value you get in this one is immense, and if you use a \"dollars to hours\" ratio, you can get a lot of entertainment for just a few pennies per hour (my game lasted about 150 hours).  This is a game I found myself clawing for more time to play.  Sitting for thirty minutes or an hour often accomplishes you nothing, and marathon sessions are the way to go if you really want to be immersed.  A small disappointment was the quality of the loot (sort of a moot point considering the strengths of the game).  In Oblivion you could find items that gave your permanent night vision or let you walk on water when worn.  I hoped to find similar items here (they may exist but I've never found them) but more often than not you only get some gold and weak  items from caves/dungeons, especially considering the fact you can craft your own powerful weapons and armor from a few raw materials.  I did have 10-15 complete freezes during the course of the game, and they were annoying, but I tried to save often which lessened the headache.Overall an amazing achievement and must-buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}

Allen","summary":"Best ps3 title to date","reviewText":"I bought the Deluxe Edition off amazon when the game first came out near the end of 2009. I played it very briefly but then had to go out of the country.Coming back a little over a year later to complete the title, I have to say that this is one of the very best ps3 titles out there and the deluxe edition makes it even better with its awesome guide that is overall thorough but missing few information.To give a bit of background, I don't own a lot of ps3 titles. I picked up the old ps3 that runs ps2 titles and that is pretty much all I've been playing with my ps3. Only a few exclusive titles have been on my list which includes Metal Gear Solid 4, Heavy Rain, and Yakuza 3. I tried the Japanese Final Fantasy 13 when it first came out before stateside.Overall, Demon's Soul is probably one of my more favorite titles.What makes this title so great for me is the mixture of RPG of action, along with the fact that the game is extremely difficult and you have a limited set of tools to go against it. I suppose in other games you can do fancy moves and so fort, but with this game there are rarely any super moves only simple ones. For me the game is rather difficult only after the initial worlds mainly due to the fact that you have such limited supply of items and weapons that you just can't properly defend yourself. Once you get to perhaps the third level of the game, you begin to have an easier time with the game and find that you don't die as often.The game starts you off in this thing called the Nexus. You get infinite lives, but don't let that fool you. In order to progress your levels you must have souls and if you die, you lose your souls but you can recover it unless you die trying to get your souls.The game lets you choose from various classes. At first I was a bit overwhelmed in my selection, but I think any class is good. Probably have a better starting equipment with a Solider or Royal/Mage. Again, the classes don't really matter, what you should look into is what you get to start off with and what sort of attributes you start with. Once the game starts, your character can do anything you want but if you want a specific build, you might want to consider what roles your characters are going for. Overall what you start off with doesn't necessarily dictate what role you play in the game.The game is rather difficult. It's hard to explain why it's hard but once you get used to the system you can easily maneuver and evade attacks. At first you're going to have trouble with this. Also there are some things in the early game that makes it extremely difficult. For example, you might find a dragon sitting on a hill and you want to grab loots but suddenly you die from its breath of fire. Things like that at first. As the game goes on, it becomes easier due to the fact that you find better equipments.There are two modes of play. One is offline, which suggests you just play by yourself, or you can play online. The major benefit of online is that you get to read messages all over the game world. For example, there is one level with many pitfalls and players are kind enough to leave a note before the fall so you can keep an eye out. The one thing the game doesn't tell you is that when you go online, this thing called \"World Tendency\" which is sort of like saying whether you're in good standings or not with the world you're in, gets shifted according to everyone else. So this means certain valuable items, like a sword or shield, is impossible to obtain unless you go in offline mode.The one thing this game lacks to me is a story. The world is very interesting, but cut scenes and so fort are rarely seen and rarely do justice. For example, there is one world where a very said maiden comes to help poor people. It's all very sad and yet no story to really bind it. Another thing is that the game never fully explains the worlds you're in and why you're in it. It's sort of like, \"Here you are, go in here, do this, and something will happen.\" I had trouble at first determining my progress because after you defeat the final boss of a level, nothing really happens except you returning to the Nexus.Another thing that I sort of dislike about the game is that as you progress, it's very easy to make critical errors in the story. For example, before I left the country, I didn't know about weight of your equipment. I just grabbed stuff, but had to drop things. When I couldn't carry something, I would return to the Nexus but then lose that item because I touched it. Also, some critical plot items like meeting a certain person gets lost if you contact that person, then died, and later realized you have to now contact that person every time you load the level. Some other things like simply making a mistake will reset you and it gets frustrating that you can't save inside the level. Overall though, I like how the game automatically progresses and saves you. It sort of adds that extra layer to having a good idea about what to do and how to do it rather than blindly going in, then reloading a save and then getting things. You have to get it right the first time or you don't get it at all with this game. You can't reload a save either once it's done. You have to progress or restart all over again.Overall the game is a blast to play. It's very difficult but you will have fun. The deluxe game comes with an awesome guide but it only misses out on a few details like online mode or a few issues with the layout and references.I say this is a must have for any ps3 owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Whoa, where&#65533;d Sonic go?","reviewText":"What does a dedicated Sega fan say when he sees the Sega logo slapped onto a GameCube game? Slowly it registers into his sluggish brain, then the dupeweed mutters, \"ugh, Sega and Nintendo. . .collectively together?\" Flabbergasted, he questions it to no one particular. He is frozen in wonderment. \"Ummm. . .no freakin' way, dude!\"Sorry to break it to you, pal, but the Sega Dreamcast, may it rest in peace, has slumbered in its grave for two years. At the present the total considerable force of Sega has just launched to unleash a potential, ferocious beast. With an arsenal of Sega games deploying in every respectable console, the future is shaping up as stunning as never before. Among the foremost games to illustrate this contemporary, beautiful relationship is Sega releasing Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the ever impressive GameCube. If you previously settled in the nest, incubating thrills with the Dreamcast version, I wouldn't suggest buying the game because basically, you get the same hatchling with an exception of the minority of sound upgrades. Nevertheless, if your hands haven't poked fun into the blue hedgehog and the rest of the bigger gang, then that's a different story. . .or is it? Does an unshakable hindrance knock Sonic's velocity off the tracks and into the grimy mud? Indeed it does.Yes, it should be a merry stroke of grace to see Sonic the speedy hedgehog and his few buddies alongside him. Well. . .make that a bundle of buddies. A solid lineup of characters have been summoned into flight, bringing the likes of Amy and the Metal Sonic, plus others from the ancient, ephemeral cartoon. Amid the cast are a pair of newcomers, Shadow, a darker version of Sonic, and Rouge, the rip-roaring, blood-sucking bat.Hosting a crazy degree of swifter gameplay, the single-player distributes everything from the Dreamcast precisely and imbues it in the GameCube equation. Players are to select if they are to rescue the planet on the Hero side (Sonic, Tales, etc.) or overpower it in the ominous path of the Dark side (Shadow, Rouge, etc.). In it's current repute, things echo a reasonable magnitude, but the unforgettable parts of Sonic Adventures 2 Battle is playing as Sonic or Shadow, and no one else. Moving in inconceivable speeds, the two take wing over flashy cities, pyramids, and through other realms within the 30 stages. Both the hedgehogs dole out the elfin sparkle of the game. In those seconds, the game felt like a Tony Hawk game on steroids, grinding cars, rails, and into the extremes of jaw-dropping visuals. The added characters on the other hand, lose appeal after due time. Tails and Dr. Eggman, who ride fat machinery, basically play like a shooter in lackluster, cyclic fashion. Remnants of play tilt on scavenger hunts and duller missions. There is diminutive accentuation on what made Sonic on the Sega Genesis treasured. Deficient on sweltering action, the respect for Sonic is now in evanescence.Stages are technically trouble-free, retaining a difficulty of a walkover. Yet, the biggest grievance, the mammoth of all disasters in the game is the camera. It's so problematic, sticky, and infuriating that it'll aggravate a two-year-old. If you thought Sega would return to their blueprints for the GameCube port and fix the disorder, your hope is crushed into futility. The camera direction, so weakly constructed, gets plugged up into walls, runs all around the screen, and stays frozen in some structures.As for the trappings on the GameCube, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle is quite a flare on the multiplayer spot. Expanded nicely over the Dreamcast, the game features 12 playable characters in new fiery head-to-head competition. The games includes a multitude of extremely worthy action such as kart racing, hunting, and other splendid, but not groundbreaking, multiplayer goodness.Next stop, the graphical estate. The GameCube port looks much, much superior over the Dreamcast. Running on a breakneck 60fps, it's surprising my TV hasn't been caught on fire. Texture wrappings are clear and beautifully bright. Slow down is abandoned where it belongs, no where. The stages are presented in several kind of themes such as military bases and flaming places. Despite the horrid camera disease, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle lives as one of the uppermost wow factors on the platform genre. On its audio turf though, the game fails to devise something worth listening to. Putting the loud, crisp sounds of gathering coins, or splashes into water, the music is terrible, lifeless popish music. The tender and placid music really makes me want to pound the electricity out of my TV set. And as you may have suspected, it gets shoddier with the voice acting. Written pointlessly, the story is just a heap of even more ....Who would have thought that the two rivals back in the 32-bit days would combine forces? Hell, I never expected it. As for Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, in my book it's worth a try but doesn't come up as a certified must. Fond of my 32-bit memories of the blue speedy, mohawk-styled hedgehog looping through endless tunnels, the newest installment ranks below expectations. I was expecting the glory of Mario's jumped from the SNES to the N64. With a horror show of camera displeasure, one has to really why Sega has not revised it's biggest franchise when they apparently had the time. If they had installed improved camera behavior, this would have been a commendable possession on the fly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2002"}

Personally, I smile upon games like this.  I mean why should a beautiful princess always the target of the kidnapping, rather than the heroic plumber?  Apparently Nintendo wondered the same thing, which resulted in this.  Now Bowser get a taste of girl power, a bitter pill that's hard to swallow!  Like in my other reviews, I will give you the bad and the good, in that order.The Bad:1.  The game is slightly too easy in some areas.  It isn't the hardest to beat, due to the fact it's rather basic and straightforward2.  No real closure on the second storyline.  I see two storylines in this game.  The first storyline is that Mario and Luigi, as well as a bunch of toads, have been kidnapped and it's up to Peach, and a talking umbrella named Perry, to save them.  The second storyline features the mystery of Perry himself.  After all, it's rare for umbrellas to talk, even in the Mushroom Kingdom.  There isn't a very good way to explain this, seeing as it would spoil the story (I'm not too huge on spoilers), but it lacks closure.  You will learn things about him throughout the game, a couple of facts may even surprise you!  Truth to be told, though, Perry's problems are never resolved in this game (perhaps Nintendo wishes to make another game to wrap that up).  Which is a letdown.3.  Peach picks now to develop emotional powers after all of the times she's been kidnapped?  Maybe this is merely because she is on Vibe Island, but I can't help but suspect that maybe we girls are being made fun of... It also doesn't make sense that with all these powers she couldn't defend herself from a spike shelled turtle all of those years ago...The Good:1.  I think that this game may give girls some respect!  I mean, why should a girl always be the one whose kidnapped?  This game helps teach that even boys sometimes stumble.2.  Good stylus fun!  There are many mini games and 'events before boss fights' that require the stylus.  These games are oddly fun!3.  Peaches vibe powers are fun to use!  Peach can either cry with the gloom vibe, start fires with the anger vibe, fly with the joy vibe, or even heal herself with the calm vibe.  It's entertaining, and the music forces itself to match with the current vibe.4.  Teaches basic problem solving, including puzzles.  What will give you a hard time in this game, is you will need to think outside of the box once in a while.  Some problems are simply solved, but the idea is difficult to come up with!  Your problem solving skills will surely be fostered!5.  Areas are various.  You can be on a beach one second, and be in a glacier the next!6.  The bosses are fun, and require their own bits of strategy.7.  You can see every enemy you have creamed in the glossary, or listen to music you managed to pick up in the game!Overall, this is a fun game!

The game shows that the WiiU can indeed hold it's own to the PS3 and Xbox 360 both with gameplay and graphics and the tablet controller features actually made the game more entertaining then the previous one did,case in point unlike with the Xbox 360 version where it shows you a locational map the WiiU version allows a more detailed location map as well as sonar map which uses the tablet screen instead of having to switch many times from map to gameplay like with the 360 version.Another new gimmick is the B.A.T function, with this version Batman has a armor/hightech suit that absorbs melee attacks and when it reaches a point allows you to after a push of a button become invulnerable and kick major butt for a short time very handy in some of those more stickier situations.Still overall the gameplay is pretty much the same from gliding around the city to kicking groups of thugs around the block.Still if you have a WiiU I say this game is well worth adding to your game library and for those who already have the game either on the PS3 or Xbox 360 and also have a WiiU I say that while this is repurchasing the same game it's still worth a look into.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

I'm pleased to report that this is no exception.Yes,it's more smashing objects, completing missions, smashing objects, unlocking characters, smashing objects, collecting studs (for the curious, this time you get &#34;True Believer&#34; because of course you do), and smashing even more objects. It's a formula that works, and if this game lacks any sense of real innovation (though there are actually times when it benefits you to have the Hulk turn into Bruce Banner), it makes up for that with a good sense of fun.In the game, our heroes deal with Doctor Doom and Loki, who have teamed up to recover Cosmic Bricks left by the Silver Surfer. Within the first mission and cut scenes thereafter, you see not only those three characters, but also Sandman, the Abomination, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Maria Hill, Agent Coulson, Nick Fury, Captain America and Mister Fantastic.The game is good clean fun, and suitable for ages six and up, roughly. The violence is far less than what you'd get with the average kids cartoon, and the puzzles may baffle the youngest players, but the older ones will do just fine.I'm overall extremely pleased with this game.

The graphic and special effects, while well put together, and not cutting edge. This game looks like an expansion to the original Neverwinter Nights more than a entirely new game. Personally if I pay a new game price I expect a new game in the box, or an extremely polished and improved continuous of the original. Looking at this game and the original side by side you would be hard pressed to explain why this needs the extra muscle it does.Like many of the other reviewers I found the story for the campaign in NWN2 to be quite boring. So boring it was hard to even play through. The voice acting is okay as are the cut scenes but the story is very boring and cliche. Like the original the one thing NVW2 has going for it is the ability to download and play adventures created by other users. This is where this game shines, there is a wealth of custom content and adventures available on the internet for NWN2, and if you have invested in the game this is the best way to put it to use.Out of the box NWN2 is an okay game, but there are better. With the wealth of custom mods on the internet for it though it is as good as the original to me and maybe a bit better. There is a good amount of potential in this game and luckily there are those devoting time and attention to bring it out.

{"product_name":"Logitech G600 MMO Gaming Mouse, White","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Look out Razer!","reviewText":"I was an early adopter when Razer first came out with it's Naga MMO mouse. I paid full price right up front because I just had to have it. If you play MMO's like WoW, you immediately understand why you need this mouse when you look at all the buttons! While I love my Naga to pieces, after a little over a year of moderate use, it started to fail. I have never had a mouse fail on me before, much less one I spent $100 on, so that was a huge disappointment. When I realized it was failing (cursor was jumping all over the place randomly or not responding at all) I decided to upgrade and get the wireless Naga Epic. I had been using that until this guy arrived.Performance wise, I see very little difference between the G600 and the Razer Naga. They both glide easily, are extremely responsive, and have all the buttons your heart desires. The only real differences are really in the design. They both have the same 12 buttons on the panel, however the G600's buttons are larger and more raised where the buttons on the Naga are more low profile and easier to slide your fingers across. Which one is best really depends on you. It does take some time to get used to both, but the adjustment time to really get good at the Naga may be more difficult because it's harder to discern which button you're pushing without looking at it initially. Over time as you gain the muscle memory, this isn't an issue. However, I can see how the more pronounced Logitech buttons would be easier to navigate without looking. It's worth mentioning that Razer ships their Nagas with rubberized stickers that you can place on the buttons to help you navigate them if you desire. I didn't use them but in essence it achieves the same thing as the larger, more defined G600 buttons though some may not like the idea of stickers. Again, neither one is better, it depends on your preferences.Where the G600 may have an edge is the new \"ring finger\" button along the right side. Being totally honest, this was a pain to become adjusted to because I am used to using that side as part of my grip. It was difficult to adjust to the Naga's side panel at first also because I was so accustomed to using that as part of my grip as well. But, I adjusted and I do very well with all the practice I've had. That being said, the G600 has this issue two-fold. You have to adjust to not using either side in your grip, instead guiding the mouse with pressure from the top and back of the mouse alone. Again, it just takes getting used to and whether you want that extra button is totally personal preference. I hold down the shift key to double my number of buttons, but I do think having an extra button on the mouse can only be a good thing. However, if you can live without the extra button, Naga offers grip customization via different panels you can swap in and out on the mouse. I would tend to prefer the extra button as I can get used to almost any grip, but I can't add an extra button down the road.Both also sport the two buttons behind the wheel. These are typically your forward/back buttons with the browser that many mice have these days. The original Naga had these buttons on the left side above the panel, which is the typical placement. With later versions, they moved these buttons behind the wheel like the G600. At first I haaaaated this so much, and then I realized, hey, this is actually so much better! I don't have to lift my index finger off the main button to activate it anymore as I can just push it with my knuckle now. Sounds difficult perhaps, but it's really so much simpler and I wish they had thought of it sooner. I typically assign these buttons to something that needs to be used often and within a small window of time, such as Kill Shot for a hunter in WoW or my \"Oh no!!\" button that contains a macro with all my life-saving abilities, priceless for PvP! Which one has the edge? The G600's buttons are more raised and require a bit more pressure to activate. The Naga's buttons are nearly flush with the surface of the mouse and require slight pressure, enough that you don't activate it on accident but not hard enough that it's difficult to push. I prefer the feel of the Razer myself.I really don't want to compare the Naga Epic (the wireless version of the Naga) to the G600, but I think it's worth mentioning that there is a wireless option, albeit for nearly twice the price when not on sale. I got my wireless Naga Epic for only $20 more than the G600 and I absolutely love the feature. The way they have integrated wired, wireless and charging is simply awesome. When comparing the price of the two, it's clear to choose the cheaper one as the quality of both is excellent. However, if you find the Naga Epic on sale, it's really a no brainer for me. I utilize the wireless option all the time when I hook my gaming PC up to my 50\" plasma. You can't play on a big screen with a corded mouse! Not without a sore neck and headache, anyway. I really miss this feature in the G600, but again, when not on sale it's hard to justify the extra money for the wireless option.In the end, both contenders are such great performers, it's impossible to fault either of them. With the regular price of the G600 $10 less than Razer's wired Naga, you'd not be missing any features and you'd save yourself some money. However, when they are so similar in every way, the final decision comes down to design for me. While the black G600 has an acceptable albeit very \"normal\" appearance, the white G600 is not at all appealing to me. If they had done it all in white, it would be different, but I do not care for the two tone effect. The Naga's sleek, all black, rubberized texture is beautiful and I'm not above the fancy glowing effects on the body and wheel of the mouse in addition to the buttons. Both feature the ability to change the panel colors, but only Naga has the awesome glowing logo and glowing wheel. If you're going to be spending this much on a gaming mouse, you may as well get one that looks great! The $10 difference is worth it to me to pick up the (in my opinion) more attractive Naga. The wireless Naga Epic also features a spectrum option, where the colors cycle and fade in and out. Quite awesome, but I know there are people out there who will say \"Who cares?! You're not looking at your hand while you're playing a game!\" and this is true, but I still like the sexy style and feel of the Naga. I like function and style, and with so little difference in price, I don't see the need to make the sacrifice.The G600 gives the Naga a run for it's money. Even though it's not the prettiest mouse, it matches Razer's Naga on every level and even boasts something the Naga cannot, the extra button. You can't go wrong with either choice. Highly recommended! :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2013"}

The city is gorgeous but the faces are terrible, but given the overall quality of the game its certainly forgivable.A nice variety of activities like fighting, driving, you name it.

Once I got online I tried the gravity rush demo and after playing it through I was sold.This is one of the best games I have played in a while. I generally lean towards RPGs and away from any JRPG/anime styled games. In fact this game has two of my main strikes for games that I should hate it.1. Anime style. The graphics are in the style of anime, which as a whole I have come to loath. There are exceptions. This does fit into the more realistic drawing style anime rather than saucer eyed freaks who all have the same character model, aside from costume and hair.2. Under age protagonist. I have never been a fan of the teenage hero trope you see prevalent in JRPGs. And unless I am wrong the main character Kat is 15-17 years.That being said I loved this game.

It should have; it's now been almost nine years since the studio first reconstructed the Star Wars universe in endearing virtual Lego bricks. In video game terms, that's light years.Fast forward across the entire lifespan of PS3, and Lego Marvel Super Heroes is about to put to bed the console generation it helped welcome, and you can tell TT Games has made an effort to give a proper send-off.If you're any kind of serious Marvel fan you'll probably have already Googled this game's character list. It's simply immense - there are no fewer than 155, and that excludes DLC. Bursting at the seams, it has more Marvel characters than the original Pokemon Red and Blue games had critters. Merely unlocking them all is half the fun, because you are collecting characters from entire universes - The Avengers, X-Men, The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man and loads more.Despite the complications in dealing with multiple star franchises, the game's single-player campaign manages to pull it all together with an amusing plot. At the outset, it launches into chaotic Lego brick-exploding battles, rapid-firing super heroes at the player as if they came free with packs of Cheerios. Spider-Man, The Hulk and Iron Man kick off proceedings with a fight against Sandman and Abomination at Central Station. Then Mr. Fantastic and Captain America join the fray. Then Human Torch, Thor, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Wolverine - they just keep coming.As the campaign unfolds, you head from one iconic Marvel landmark to another, from Stark Towers to Asgard - tackling super villains at every step. You'll take on Doctor Doom and his mighty 'Doom Ray of Doom', before showdowns with Doctor Octopus, Loki, Magneto, M.O.D.O.K and even the Statue of Liberty. Yes, the actual statue.Clearly, the series hasn't forgotten its sense of humour. Slapstick cut scenes and a script full of consistently charming wit are amusing enough to make even the most hardened cynic crack a teethy grin. Younger gamers are bound to find it hilarious.All of this is grounded within an open-world hub in the form of bustling Manhattan island. Before each mission starts, you're let off the leash to explore, skydiving dramatically from the SHIELD Helicarrier to the streets below. From there you can commandeer vehicles from helpful citizens, compete in timed races, take on sub-missions offered by numerous NPCs or just explore the open city seeking out tokens (which can be spent to unlock more characters).It's fun to burst around the city as Human Torch or Iron Man, but this is where some small niggling issues arise. Flight in the open-world setting is given increased speed to compensate for the distances you're required to cover, but the controls can be touchy. Car handling is also twitchy and imprecise. Navigation through the town can be cumbersome because of this.The main missions are triggered by entering the building, or area indicated on your HUD, and it isn't long before the game settles into its fixed gameplay patterns. Players enter a building, moving from one room to another, activating a series of character-specific switches while constructing and operating Rube Goldberg-like Lego machines as your angular heroes chase a villain towards a major showdown. Each set-piece is beautifully realised, and the waves of enemies and giant bosses ensure the action remains intense throughout. As always, drop-in-drop-out co-op also serves to enhance the fun.Lego Marvel Super Heroes certainly starts with a bang, but the campaign begins to show a lack of imagination. Repetition quickly sets in, and will inevitably begin to take its toll on core gamers who won't see many deep nuances in the experience. At it's heart, when you strip away all the superhero-themed fat and fanfare, this is essentially a 12-hour conveyor belt of switches, packaged with a bundle of clearly labelled keys shaped as Marvel characters. It's the same level design formula you've come to know and expect from TT's Lego games, but now feels like it's at an evolutionary dead-end.Signposting is comprehensive and persistent, so getting through its intricate array of mechanical Lego levels requires little strategy or skill. Winning is simply a matter of identifying the next switch (be it a Shield switch, a claw terminal, a breakable wall, a buildable contraption or a blockade of ice), selecting the character required to bypass it and pressing 'B'. To that extent, the shiny, Marvel-branded outer shell is merely a vehicle for churning out this rather basic and repetitive gameplay mechanic over and over again.Don't expect the formula to change. Simple, lighthearted and approachable fun has been the mantra of the Lego games series since the critically-acclaimed Star Wars trilogy, and Marvel Super Heroes is no different.The lack of challenge makes it perfect for younger players, while the Marvel characters will only broaden its appeal. It's destined for success.But for everyone else, it's a shame that a game based on one of the world's most creative toys and set in one of the wackiest collections of fictional characters ends up being so predictable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}

Its not as bad as you would think although I think I could play a bit better with a street fighter controller. Not significantly better! only a bit.2.35 characters!! Yes some do play similar to one another but they have been tweaked enough that you can tell they have different strengths3. One of the things I loved the most about street fighter 2 was learning how to use certain characters and now it feels like its twice as hard! For me thats not a bad thing at all. The game has gotten more complex but it still manages to retain the street fighter feel4. Silky smooth online play! The bad thing about online play is that everyone seems so good at first. It feels like your dropped into a tank of sharks!! lol But you have to be patient because playing people is much harder than playing against the computer. Its also more rewarding! It took me around 10 fights till I finally won my first match and I used to kick butt back in the day! lol*Cons.Only ONE! Arcade mode is a bit dissapointing. I have gotten hours of fun out of it! Except you don't really fight a \"boss\" till the very last fight. (In street fighter 2 you fought a total of 4!) And somehow the stories seem weaker than before. Not sure how thats possible but it is dissapointing because there are not many things to do if you do not have ONLINE play.* Complaints (as a fan but not so big they are a con)1. Others have stated that there is no assigned stages and yes I do miss it too. Sure it would be like 20 more!! lol But its not like if the technology was not there!2. The music does not seem to be as memorable as it was before. But its definetely better than that Jazzy stuff they toyed with before in Alpha!3. Blood seems almost non existent! How can part 2 have some blood and part 4 have nothing? The game looks like ANIME! At least some kind of option.4. I wish I could have my own music playing in the background like I can do during GTA.

Not only is Dead Space 2 one of the finest survival-horror games I have played, but one of the finest games I have played period.  This sequel and continuation of Isaac Clark's fight with the necromorphs and his insanity is a fantastic, horrifying, and intense experience.While I really enjoyed the first Dead Space, I wasn't too keen on the constant back-tracking and the lack of distinction between environments. I was very happy to see that Visceral rectified that greatly and refined many other areas of the game as well.This time, Isaac Clark is a fully voiced character.  While him being silent in the last game detracted nothing from my experience with that game, it definitely adds something to the overall experience here.  Isaac is not only fighting the terrifying necromorphs but also his quick descent into insanity.  Hearing him converse and argue with his hallucinations is harrowing and makes the game that much more intense and interesting to play.  The voice acting is superb.  You quickly sympathize with him thus making you care about his situation and what happens to him.While the original Dead Space looked great, Dead Space 2 continues to up the ante in the visuals department.  This is some of the best use of lighting in a game I have seen.  Isaac in his suit looks as detailed as ever and just looks awesome.  The necromorphs are incredibly detailed and are as terrifying as ever to encounter. Overall, this is just a sharper looking Dead Space.  It's a very tightly crafted game and one you rarely see a flaw in any aspect of its design.The gameplay is as fun and intense as ever.  New weapons and enemies are introduced to encourage more experimentation(even though I just stuck with upgrading the plasma cutter and line gun). If the necromorphs from the original Dead Space didn't really give you goose bumps, wait until you meet the necromorphed infants and children for the first time.  Their tormented wails and cries as they crawled and sprinted towards me made me shudder and cower in fear multiple times during the game.  Fortunately, the aiming and firing of your weapons is smooth and accurate allowing you to severe the necessary vital appendages of your enemies easily.Of course, no survival-horror game can do without a great audio experience.  Dead Space more than delivers on this front as well.  The voice acting is excellent all around.  The music fits perfectly with the game.  The sounds from the environment are used perfectly and each necromorph has their own terrifying sound.  All of this comes through clearly and powerfully especially with a sound system.I can't recommend this game enough to action/survival-horror fans.  This is an expertly crafted game that everyone(if you're old enough to stomach the extreme gore/violence that is) should give a chance.  It's extremely thrilling and purely entertaining.  Very worthy of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"Abhilash.R \"The Sagittarian\"","summary":"The first to reward you for crashing....spectacularly !","reviewText":"The racing style of Burnout 3 is new to me. The Need for Speed series was extremely popular, yet it was just another racing game that offered only a little in terms of overall versatility.The race is only confined to just out-speeding your opponent to win rewards.  But the concept of Burnout 3 is different and surprising, to say the least. This isn't a game where you out - gun your opponent by stepping on the gas pedal and sveltly moving your car. Here, you are rewarded by actually taking your opponent down !. You gain points by crashing into your opponent and send him flying out of the circuit. By doing so, you gain special energy in the form of 'Boost\" which when activated, simply propels your car to breathtaking speeds. The end result, is a game that offers you purely satisfying experience and leaves you wanting more.....Gameplay, Graphics and Sound....The real star of Burnout 3 is undoubtedly its gameplay. You are pitched against other cars and you gain points or win the race by crashing them into various objects like civilian vehicles, road-bends etc. You earn 'Boost' by doing so. When activated, 'Boost' speeds up your car exponentially thus giving you the potential to out-race your opponents or causing greater damage when taking them down. You increase your Boost meter by taking down others, or you lose your meter if your opponent takes you down!. When you crash, you can slow down and slightly  steer your car to make an 'After touch' takedown that, if successfully accomplished,  maintains your Boost meter intact. Takedowns are real fun and the variety of ways by which you can do so is immense. This adds a lot to replay value. In the career mode, you start out with basic cars and by winning events around the world, you unlock new events and better cars. Each event has its own charm and not all events are the same. Some have pure racing, some have just takedown counts, while others focus on you to crash into incoming traffic in a way to gain maximum points. Thus you are never given the same mundane stuff. Rather Burnout 3 offers something new. And as you unlock yourself all the way through to the Super car series, the levels of speed you attain is freakish and eye-popping.The graphics are secondary to Burnout 3 but they are not far behind to gameplay. Rather, if it wasn't for it, then the game would have looked perceptibly dull. It surely is the best around in business, but slightly less detailed than say Project Gotham Racing 2. It has been specifically designed to showcase the speed of the game, and at no point in the game will you find the frame rate dropping below 60fps. Your car is brilliantly detailed. It will look hazy and blurred at the back when propelling forward, showing you the real sense of speed . The sudden fall back of the environment when you Boost is jaw-dropping. Also the effect of cars whizzing past you when you Boost is tremendous if not downright astonishing, giving you a thrill unseen in other titles. However, the civilian traffic and the surrounding flora and fauna are a bit blocky but passable. Whose got the time to stare when you're nitro-ing at over 200 mph!.The real beauty of the game come into fray when you crash. Your car will tumble across, hitting incoming vehicles, which in turn get ripped apart around the surrounding vehicles, dealing truly spectacular damage. The crash physics is phenomenal and the most complex in any game to date. What makes Burnout 3 so good is that you have not only pure adrenaline driving, but you can just about smash into anything and everything to bring out memorable moments of traffic mayhem. And the game rewards you for it, which is a brilliant concept.The sound is great. The roar of the engines is deep and the ambient sounds are but satisfactory. Crash sounds are tremendous. The only annoying addition is a radio station called Crash FM, hosted by Stryker. In the beginning , he is okay, but then you'll get annoyed when he says the same thing over and over again. Just turning him off will do the trick. He isn't in the league of class as Lazlow of ChatterBox in GTA3. Also, the custom soundtracks are good, but not great. All are upswing in mood, generally reflecting the gameplay. Overall, they do a decent job.Conclusion :If you are into racing dangerously and always living on the edge, then go ahead and buy this game. It is worth it. The XBOX version is hands-down the better one.  Burnout 3 is stellar and offers you pure adrenaline pumping experience that is refreshing and rewarding. It delivers you a sense of speed unmatched by other racing games. The game offers enough scope for re-play and the multiplayer option will keep you busy long after you put your car in the garage.Enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2004"}

Online???","reviewText":"This is a very fun game. This game really makes you feel like you are playing in an epic story, such as Star Wars. Maybe, the music reminds me of Star Wars. The graphics are phenomenal. There were some cutscenes, which showed some of the characters up-close  and they looked sooooo real. As far as the gameplay, some people gave this game a bad rating due to the controls. Well, when I played the demo, I found that the game had several different control settings. If some of you are used to playing COD4, use the Alternate 2 controller option!!! Other than that, the controls will just have you confused. Once that is done, the gameplay is some very intense warfare, which is reminecent of COD4. There are times, which the firefights are bloody and long. There are a lot of explosions and chaos going on. I love the weapons and how they shoot. A lot of it also remind me of COD4.The Helghast soldiers are like an enemy that you have never seen. The AI of the Helghast soldiers is superb. It is rare to catch them slipping. A player cannot always get a hand on how to deal with them. I say this because their are different types of soldiers. Some will go for cover and slowly try to flank you. If the chance presents itself, they will run straight towards you. This seems to happen, while reloading. Anyway, the whole MO of the Helghast is to shoot, move and communicate. Sometimes, they'll just come out of nowhere and start shooting. They are constantly repositioning themselves. Even their supression fire is accurate, at times. The Helghast with RPGs need to be dealt with rather quickly. To hear the Helghast soldiers communicate amongst each other really sounds grimy. To hear their voice and getting up close to them, is a bone-chilling experience. The boss battles are very intense, as well. Wait until you hear their voices. The Helghast can be comical, as well. You shall find out how. I'll give a hint. There will be a weapon that you will get off of one of the bosses. Watch some of the Helghast  reaction, once you start to shoot it at some of them!!! Overall, I do not consider the game a five out of five, like the cover would suggest. Still, the game is definitely worth purchasing.The jury is still out on the multi-player experience. It is nowhere near as fast-paced as the CODs. Of course, you start out with the basic ISA weapons. The firefights are a little hard. I mean, it is hard to make kills. You have to just about empty the clip. Then, once you get a kill, you do not even realize. On the CODs, at least you can see when you get a kill or even an assist. The multi-player is so broad, in every way. There are so many symbols, which I must learn. I do not know what anything means. I do like the fact that you squad up. I mean, every level is at least 32 players. You really feel as if you are a part of an army. I like playing as the Helghast soldiers. It is just something about playing the bad guys. As far as my lack of multi-player skills go, I guess that I will just have to do the way I did on the CODs. I started the same way on each version, but I started killing and got better. On CODWAW, I started out really bad. Now, my killing ratio is in the 90s. Heck, I was not even that good on COD 4. I vow to get better on KZ2s multi-player.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2009"}

I was looking for a good RPG (which the PS3 was lacking at that time, and still is, to some degree), and I decided out of all the meager options, that I wanted this game - and Eternal Sonata.  I chose this game because at the time, Eternal Sonata was quite expensive, and this one was much cheaper.  Warning! Bargain bin alert!  Sometimes games are cheap for a reason; and sometimes, I'm pleasantly surprised.  So, how does it fare?  Well, let's find out!Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics are not bad.  There are good points and bad points.  First off, the backgrounds are quite lovely; there are scenic vistas of rolling hills and beautiful blue skies that are quite nice.  Also, there is a good amount of graphical detail (for example, seeing individual leaves and blades of grass in a forest).  The in-game character models are not exactly great in the faces, but the cutscenes look awesome.  Unfortunately, there are bits of graphical laziness here and there.  For example, there's an area where you are on a cliff overlooking an ocean.  The water doesn't move, ripple or sparkle at all.  It's just a giant blue unmoving blob.  I mean, come on guys!  Even games on the PS1 had some kind of moving texture on water to give the illusion of movement.  This game also seems to suffer from what I call \"DQVIII Syndrome\" - there are numerous and embarassing re-uses of the same NPC character models over and over again.  Once I even saw them use the same character model for two NPCs speaking to each other in the same scene.  Wow.  Overall, though, the negative points I mentioned aren't really so distracting that they outweigh the good parts of the graphics, so this section gets a 7/10 for \"average\".Music (score 6/10): Well...  Let's see.  The voice acting isn't exactly thrilling, and the music is kinda bland and forgettable.  First, let's talk about the voice acting.  It's not very good.  It's not the worst I've ever heard (that honor forever belongs to the first Grandia), but it's not top quality work either.  In fact, I'd say it was average, or slightly below.  There is a notable exception; Yuki's voice is the most annoying thing I've ever heard (worse than Momo from Xenosaga II).  However, her voice seems to grow less annoying over time - either the voice actor decided to do a better job on her later recordings or I've gotten used to it with repeated exposure.  Now, as for the music.  It's not terrible, but not great either.  Most of it won't grate on your ears or make you wish you were deaf, but it's not very memorable either - and some of it's rather repetitive.  There are a couple tracks that are irritating (the song that plays in the resistance hideout comes to mind), but there really aren't that many of them.  You're not likely to recall any of the music after you are done with this game (other than music that irritated you), and you won't feel motivated to go out and buy the soundtrack or anything.Characters (score 6/10): Oh boy.  Here it comes.  What do you suppose is the most important part of an RPG?  Yes, the story, I know.  But what's the second most important part?  The likability of the characters!  I'm not sure that Enchanted Arms is succeeding here.  Let's start off with the first people in your party - Atsuma, Toya, and Makoto.  Atsuma is your main character, and boy is he stupid.  The game makes it glaringly obvious that he is possessed of a lesser intellect.  Since he's your main character, players can find this kind of insulting, and thus dislike poor Atsuma.  Toya is deeply intelligent, having what I call the \"calm, dispassionate logical mind of a philosopher\".  I rather like Toya, and I can't help thinking that he might've made a better main character (and let Atsuma be the sidekick best friend character).  It's rather unfortunate that Toya and Makoto are removed from the story about an hour or two into gameplay (not much of a spoiler since it happens so early).  Oh, in case you're wondering why I haven't talked about Makoto yet, I'm saving him for later (you'll see why).  So, since Toya and Makoto leave your party, who do you think will replace them?  Likable characters that you instantly identify with, right?  Wrong!  The first person you meet (who will obviously join the party later) is a young girl named Yuki.  She possesses an extremely annoying voice, and a spoiled bratty personality to match  (I kept wishing she would die).  Strangely, the second she joins the party she stops being less of a brat -but that really isn't good character development since it's incredibly spontaneous.  So, who does join the party first?  Karin and Raigar.  Raigar is an okay dude, kinda quiet and mature, so maybe that's why I don't mind him.  Karin immediately makes it known that she is a b*tch.  She does develop into slightly less of a b*tch, but she is still annoying at points. So, let's take a tally so far, of the four people who wind up in your permanent party, how many are likable?  Well, there's Raigar, and maybe Atsuma (he never gets any smarter but you do start to sympathize with his plight).  And maybe Karin, if you find her argumentative personality endearing.  And, nothing can save me from Yuki's voice actor, so there's no helping her character.  Are you beginning to see the problem?  Out of four characters, the only one you can really like right off the bat is Raigar.  As for the villains?  Well, the Devil Golems (sort of robotic monsters) seem like stock one-dimensional villians to me.  Furthermore, other villains have personalities and dialogue that really drives home what douches they are in a very stereotypical and clich&eacute; way.  Subtlety, what's that?!  Okay, now that that's all out of the way, let's talk about Makoto.  Yes, he's gay.  This seems to be the most talked about point concerning this game.  I kind of have mixed feelings about Makoto.  I was excited to play an RPG with an openly gay character (it sounded progressive), but then I was disappointed to find that Makoto is a blatant stereotype, complete with just about every gay clich&eacute; there is.  So, basically, he's only here as comic relief fodder.  In addition to that, he has a fawning immature crush on Toya and he spends all his time jealously bickering with Atsuma.  Toya must have the patience of a saint to put up with those two.  The strange thing about Makoto, though, and the reason that I have mixed feeling towards him is that after awhile, he becomes less annoying (and he does say some genuinely funny things!).  In fact, by the time you are in the first dungeon of the game, he's actually the voice of reason.  Furthermore, (THIS NEXT PART IS A SPOILER SO WATCH OUT!) at the end of the dungeon, you're party is attacked by the Ice Queen Devil Golem - she knocks out Toya and does some sort of mind control thing to him.  Makoto actually attempts to fight the Devil Golem with the last of his strength, and is crushed under a block of ice for his efforts.  I was actually touched by the fact that rather than just having an immature crush on Toya, Makoto actually loved him enough to risk his life to save him.  So, I've decided that I like Makoto.  RIP, dear friend.  As for this game being progressive towards gay people, it's really not since Makoto is a walking stereotype.  Unfortunately, I think it'll be a really long time before an RPG featuring a serious gay character is ever made, due to the fact that we haven't quite progressed enough as a society for such a thing to happen.  I'll be the first to buy it though, if I live long enough to see such a game.Story (score 6/10): Well, the story starts off innocently enough.  A group of friends decide to cut class and go to a festival.  Everyone's having a good time until everything's suddenly thrown into chaos.  By the end of the events, the entire city is destroyed by an ice golem.  The rest of the plot basically revolves around trying to prevent other cities from being destroyed in a similar fashion.  I think the main problem with this game has to do with the way that the story itself unfolds.  Good stories show things, not just tell them.  This game's main method of advancing plot points is to have character's loudly talk about them.  It feels like every other conversation is merely exposition explaining some important plot point rather than genuine character development.  This is especially bad in the villians, who spend a lot of time standing around explaining their evil plans to each other just so some character hidden in the room can overhear it.  One villian actually spends his entire death scene just explaining the concepts behind how devil golems work and all of his motivations for being evil.  A good story would've gradually shown us his motivations over time, not have the character exposit it all at the end.  Gah!  Well, what can I say?  This game's not exactly very deep, but I still had fun playing it and the story, while kind of poorly told, still held my interest enough to keep me going.  As for the ending itself, it leaves some questions unanswered, but I was satisfied enough with it.Battle System (score 7/10): Hmm... This game has one of the more unique battle systems I've come across in an RPG.  You basically control characters on chess-like battle grids.  Every time you get into a random battle, it takes you to a grid, one half is the enemy side and the other is your side.  Each character has attacks and healing abilities that have a certain range of squares.  In order to hit an enemy, they need to fall within your range, obviously.  There's this gauge that fills up over time called the \"Combo Gauge\".  Basically, if your combo gauge is full, and you manage to line up several character's attacks on the same enemies, you get a special combo that does much more damage.  So, the battle system is very tactical.  This should please fans of strategy RPGS.  The downside to this is that battles move at a slower pace now because you are constantly moving people around the grid and lining up attack ranges and such.  This can become very tedious after awhile.  Fortunately, there is an \"auto\" option that will automatically run the battle for you if you are level grinding or something boring like that.  Surprisingly, it works very well; I was shocked at how well the A.I. here performs.  Most in-game A.I. is horribly stupid, but in Enchanted Arms, it's really quite competent.  So, hat's off to the developers.  Also, if you hold down the Triangle button, battle animations will speed up.  There's one more thing I'd like to talk about, that's the element system.  Lot's of RPGs have the concept of elemental weaknesses and resistances.  In Enchanted Arms, there are six elements that oppose each other, fire and water, wind and earth, and light and dark.  That means that if you have a fire person out against a water person, you can do much more damage to the water person.  However, the water enemy can do super effective damage to you as well.  This basically means that exploiting elemental weaknesses puts your character in just as much risk as the enemy.  That's no fun.  I mean, Final Fantasy X had diametrically opposing elements too, but the difference was that your main characters merely possessed elemental magic, they didn't have elements imbued directly into them.  That means that they could exploit an enemy weakness without having any particular elemental weaknesses themselves.  It would've been different if Enchanted Arms had employed elemental properties similar to a game like Pokemon where each element had things it was good against and things it resisted (ex. like having fire be super effective against ice type, but having it be weak to water, but resistant against grass type).  As it is, though, when you try to use an elemental advantage, which one of you survives comes down to who has more HP and stronger attacks, which kind of kills the strategical quality of it.  The only strategic thing you can do with the elements is to bring out characters of the same element type to get the defensive bonus and then use non-elemental attacks (ex. Bring a water type to fight a water type enemy, you'll get added defense).  So, the element system is kind of disappointing.  One other thing I need to mention - there is no defense stat in this game, and no equip-able armor.  Because of this, the only way to get better at weathering attacks is to increase your HP.  No defense stat at all?  Strange.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I don't have many complaints here; the camera isn't bad, the movement works fine, interacting with your environment is simple and intuitive.  I also really like the pacing of the game; they did a very good job of pacing out non-combat portions between the dungeons.  Also, this game is very forgiving.  If you die in battle, it lets you try that battle again, and it heals your party to full HP and EP after a battle.  On top of that, your reserve characters get full experience (they just don't get any Skill Points).  So, you ask, if you are all fully healed after each battle and you get to retry battles you lose, what makes the game challenging?  Well, there's this thing called VP.  For each turn in battle you take, you lose VP.  If you reach zero VP, that character is rendered useless - they are stuck in a state of only having one HP and they cannot attack.  So, obviously, if you are stuck in a long dungeon, and you run out of VP, you are hosed (oh, and if you run from battles, you have an automatic escape, but you lose VP for it).  I mean sure, you could run from every battle, but if you reach the end boss with zero VP, there's no way you can win.  How to overcome this?  Well, there are only two methods to recover VP that I know of.  One is the VP recharge station, and the other is an item you can buy later that heals VP.  So, in the end, it's not that bad if you stock up on that VP healing item.  Speaking of healing items, there's my other complaint, you can only hold 9 of any particular item.  That blows.  Also, you cannot sell off old Golems or weapons, so they start to clog up your inventory screens.  This becomes a very irksome problem by the end of the game.  Other than those things, I don't really have any complaints.Overall (score 6/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Hmm...Well, overall, I liked this game.  It's got a lot of flaws, but I had fun playing it, and that's what counts, right?  Still, it doesn't deserve any higher than the score I've given it.  If you are desperate to get an RPG on the PS3, then you might want to pick this up (it's gotten even cheaper at the time of writing this).  However, if some of the flaws I mentioned earlier are pet peeves for you, then you might want to pass on this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"Ni Nu Kuni: A Unique JRPG","reviewText":"It has been many years since a JRPG has come along to make me love the entire gaming experience the product offers. Lets start with the story. The story is fantastic, heart tugging, and fun to absorb in. The characters are fun and interesting, and offer easy investments into what they are doing and why they do it. The sound and music is also engrossing, easily immersing you into each location that you are in, with each character's voice matching their person perfectly. The art direction of the game is incredible, beautiful, and extreamly detailed, blowing me away each time I put the disc into the game, with the music instantly getting me excited. But what makes a game or breaks a game is how it plays, and this game nails it. If I had to easily describe this game, it is a mixture of Pokemon meets Tales of Symphonia in terms of gameplay and action. This is because in each combat scenario, you start off with a choice of either playing as one of the three main characters (you can switch between each on the whim of the battle), as well as each characters \"familiars\", which are kind of like Pokemon in some ways. Each character can hold up to 3 familiars at one time, and have three on backup, so a total of 12 familiars can be on hand once all three characters have been gained. Once the action gets underway, each character has the ability to attack, defend, access provisions, and change tactics if you wish the rest of the party to behave in combat a little bit differently. Each character has their own special abilities though; Ollie is a wizard, so he has access to spells and magic, Esther uses her harp to play songs (she is also the only one who can \"capture\" familiars), and Swaine uses trickshots with his pistols. Each familiar also has their own abilities, which get learned over time as they gain abilities (and they also gain ability slots as they level up and metemorph to more powerful forms). Just like Pokemon, familiars gain experience through combat (even ones that don't participate, but the ones in backup form don't gain experience), they can be stored for later use via Familiar Retreat, they can evolve and become stronger, and they use abilities. However, familiars can hold and use upgrades to themselves via items, such as swords, shields, axes, ect. to make themselves stronger, faster, and so on. They can also be upgrades by treats, with each treat a specific upgrader (attack, defence, ect.), and each familiar has their favorite treat. The more treats given, the more familiarty between them and you grows, which allows them to gain a high cap for upgrading their stats. Back to combat, when you face enemies you can pick which targets right off the bat, and the rest of the party picks different targets then you do (unless there are less targets then there are of you). The combat is fluid, and revolves around a real time timer for how long you attack and defend for, how long your abilities take to recharge, and so on, and you can move your characters around a three dimensional environment at will, avoiding enemies all the while you are mobile. This kind of combat system if very much like Tales, if I had to describe it quickly. With all that out of the way, I can tell you quick that this game is very fun. There is much to do, such as plent of side quests (help the broken hearted, find people, bounty hunting, ect.), the story is a great length with plenty to see and do, as well as plenty of different species of familiars to fight, tame, and power up, as well as many trick shots, songs, and spells to find in your adventures. I recommend this title to anyone that is a fan of JRPGs, or want to try something new out because it is defiently a unique combination of excellent franchises, and yet still feels fresh and fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"Nice game","reviewText":"Yes, i admit that this game is fun and beautiful and the whole Studio Ghibli charm is all around. i remember starting this game on an analog television then 3 days later got my HD set and found myself staring at the details in the trees, the movement of clothes and whatnot.At times i felt bored and annoyed at how they baby you and hold your hand through the game (Mr Drippy will tell you to do the most obvious things and that just got repetitive for me).The game does have some crazy difficulty spikes and i guess people like the challenge--i actually over-leveled my characters to breeze through most fights.The game's story is okay...works itself to good in a creepy sort of way--think Fullmetal Alchemist hehe.I think creature design is poor, i mean come on man, there's a duck-looking thing with a trumpet for a beak--get it to it's last stage of growth and his ears become trumpets as well (-_-)But then again, the game is still good, i hated all the walking between the towns at the start, but then i took to the skies and i'm more than 60 hours in game now.Some people will start this game and put it down, a lot will enjoy and a lot will play to finish. Give it a try, might be what you've been looking for.***Update***105 hours into the game, beat it around 80 or 90, i have not been so frustrated by a game in such a long time. The way the game just forces you to grind in order to complete it. Checked info on taming familiars and none had a catch rate higher than 10%. Creature rewards (drops) for alchemy recipes were even less. I paid for it, so i grinded and i've got a platinum now. I really do not wish o play anything like this again, not with those percentages. I still think the story was okay and the main characters (familiars were poor in design in my opinion) we're good. Dark Djinn transformed was probably the best thing i saw while playing, still, for all that grinding, i admit it...i hate this game. I would rather go platinum Remember Me twice over(another stinker)than grind for so long.Check it out, might be your thing. Don't let my rant get to you, should you read this message. You might be 1 of those hardcore perfectionist gamers and this is just what you need.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BY0G0YU","reviewerName":"Fizhy","summary":"Good Game","reviewText":"As a note, this is exclusively on FFX, I will be starting FFX-2 soon. Exactly what you would expect out of the FF series. It is plenty of gameplay hours (I have just finished the first game and will be working into the second soon and am close to 45 hours). If you want to accomplish everything, it will be a long time. I would guess about 120 hours with getting final weapons completed and dark aeons battles (optional) and a hidden dungeon. The draw backs, you have to play blitzball for a bit, they make it impossible to win early in the game, then hard to lose late game. There are so many cutscenes that it is ridiculous and very few of these have the HD update. Some of the characters become worthless mid game and stay that way no matter how hard to try to keep them relevant. Especially the way I built my team, only 4 playable characters... The story line is the most linear (non open world) FF I have played. No real freedom until you are about to finish it.

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"JTW \"JT\"","summary":"Nothing special","reviewText":"RE5 is good, but it's nothing special.  It does look and sound really good.  The visuals are stunning.  The controls are slow and awkward like all the other RE games, but you can adjust them somewhat to your tastes.  You still can't move and shoot at the same time.  My main gripe is the partner.  Just like every game you play with an AI partner, they're always in the way.  It seems like during the whole game I'm running over her, trying to see around her, trying to shoot over or around her, etc., etc.  She is good to carry stuff, but I would rather the main character just be able to carry a few more items.  I've not played online co-op yet, so it may be a little better.  I wish Capcom would have added a feature where the partner was an option.  The partner just doesn't seem to add much to the game for me.  The game isn't very scary at all.  The other RE games did have a few moments where you jumped, but you see these guys coming a mile away and most of the action is in daylight, too.  I know it's been several years since RE4 and I would have thought Capcom could have come up with something better than this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"","summary":"Definitely not worth $500","reviewText":"I won't harp on the (hopefully) day one glitches of the Xbox One but I will explain the issues I've experienced first.The Xbox takes forever to install a game, at least 20 minutes for a game like BF4, and you can't play it until it is installed. When I was installing Forza 5 it not only took forever but it also presented me a whole bunch of error messages for problems that didn't exist... On top of the installation troubles I have found it is almost impossible to play Battlefield 4 multiplayer, whether this is an issue with the game or the Xbox I'll let you decide but it constantly freezes and kicks me back out to the menu. If you manage to make it into a game be happy. And oh yea, that whole \"we've got tons of servers\" thing is a total lie. 64 player games still don't work; it's laggy and glitchy beyond belief. I have 150mbit internet so I can assure you it's not me.Ok, so those are the issues that my Xbox One has had that hopefully will be resolved. Now let's move on to the other faults.First off, the Xbox One cannot be stood up vertically (unlike the PS2, PS3, PS4 and Xbox 360 before it), Microsoft's explanation is that it has something to do with the disc drive type, pretty sure that's a lie considering the PS3 and PS4 use the same disc slide-in methods as the Xbox One... This issue was near and dear to my heart because as I'm sure you're well aware, the Xbox One is ginormous.If you don't have a lot of horizontal real estate near your TV you had better think twice about getting the Xbox One, in some ways it is indeed bigger than the first-gen Xbox. Another of the many design flaws is that the Xbox One still has a power brick, what year is this again? 2005? I mean, if the PS3 could make a go of it without a power brick on their first try why on earth does the Xbox One still have a damn power brick? To sum it up, yep the Xbox One is HUGE and yes it also requires a power brick. Did I forget to mention the Kinect is also huge? I suppose Microsoft operated under the assumption that you would own no other device to connect to your TV and thusly you have ample space to store bulk of the Xbox One and all its crap.Now, on to the next annoyance. These controllers still require AA batteries (Microsoft was at least kind enough to supply you with the first two). To get a rechargeable controller you will have to spend another $25.00 to get the play n' charge kit. This aside from the enormous size is my biggest complaint. A clear money grab from Microsoft, Sony has had rechargeable controllers since the PS3 and the worst part? The controllers cost the same. Sounds to me like the Xbox One controllers should be $25 cheaper since apparently that's what Microsoft thinks a battery costs.Those are the big issues I have with the Xbox One, so let's get to the performance. Personally I wouldn't recommend anyone buy the Xbox One unless there are some next-gen only titles you're really looking forward to. The graphics in BF4 and Forza 5 are only marginally better than they were in BF3 and Forza 4 on the Xbox 360. I don't even notice a difference, for $500 you will be very disappointed... On top of the graphics as cool as the voice command functions are, the Kinect is still a gimmick, head tracking is actually a detriment to anyone that plays online and if you use it you will do worse (it's got plenty of glitches), meanwhile navigating the menus without a controller (although possible) isn't seamless at all. Not to mention the UI is not very intuitive or well designed in my opinion.Ok, I think that covers all the bad things, like everything there are is some good. For me the one glimmer of hope for the Xbox One is the ability to record game moments and upload/share them online. I don't know if the PS4 does this but it's a pretty neat feature, I can't count how many times I wanted to record a moment on the Xbox 360. Like I said earlier the voice commands are also pretty neat.Other than that the console is actually fairly quiet, still louder than the PS3 but way quieter than the Xbox 360. Some people were touting the Xbox One controllers as \"the best ever\"; honestly I don't know what these people are talking about. These controllers are better than the PS3s, Better than the PS4s, but definitely worse than the Xbox 360's. I'm sure like all things it will just take some time getting used to it but it certainly is no magical controller.The Xbox One comes with:ConsolePower BrickController(2) AA BatteriesHDMI CableWired HeadsetKinectIn the end, if you have the Xbox 360 or PS3 and there are no immediate \"next-gen\" exclusives you are really looking forward to I would stay away from the Xbox One and wait until they work out the kinks and/or they drop the price (and they will drop the price). If you skipped the last generation then I would certainly recommend the Xbox One if you're ok with the things I mentioned, the graphics aren't much better than the Xbox 360 or PS3 but they are worlds better than the first Xbox or PS2. Unless you have a reason to go Microsoft over Sony (mine was that my friends all chose the Xbox) I would seriously consider buying the PS4, it's cheaper than the Xbox One and definitely provides more value. Plus I've got a feeling it's a little better put together.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"but is it better than a PS4?","reviewText":"Let's face it, you're likely looking at the Xbox One or the PS4. If the decision is based solely on the power of the console and currently exhibited performance, just get a PS4. With the 1080p fiasco raging, if nothing else we know the PS4 is easier to program for, as otherwise every game would be 1080p on both systems. And I think, personally, that's the issue - optimization tools aren't in place for the Xbox One, which means even if the PS4 is in a similar state, it can STILL do 1080p no problem.Of course, the PS4 still has the leg up in terms of power over all, so if all you want is the best graphics, go with the PS4. And yes, there are other factors to think of, but if graphics and exhibited performance are your thing, you need the PS4.In terms of the Xbox One, I am basing my review on my own preferences and decisions and why I went with what I did.I went with the Xbox One because I like to play games with my 66 year old father, and he was sticking to the Microsoft box for this new generation, so I did as well. And I'm guessing there are others in this situation as well. So for me, if you are looking to step into the new generation, check with your friends and see what system THEY want to play on and follow them. You will be happy with either system.Unboxing:The Xbox One comes packaged like a high end piece of stereo equipment. Wrapped in black, it really gives you the feeling that MS wants you to feel like you are receiving an experience.Setup:This is where your configuration might be different. If you just want to play, and don't want the Kinect, this is simple to setup and configure.If you decide to use the Kinect and connect your TV set top box to the Xbox One, setup is still fairly simple over all.The nice thing is that they very clearly mark the input for cable TV and the Xbox One's video output for HDMI. You can't really screw if up unless you don't read the label.The configuration, once everything is connected, is straightforward and simple. Well, once you finish installing a Day One update that is.And there's the rub for me. 500 MB download, then another 15-20 minutes to update my machine. I received it via UPS and just wanted to play. I had it connected and ready to go in less than 5 minutes. Then I connected to the Internet, waited 5 mins for the download and another 10-15 for the install process to complete.If you don't have Internet capability, there is an &#34;offline&#34; option that you will have to call Microsoft to get the details on. The problem is, this &#34;offline&#34; option still requires you to be online at some point to download the update.So once it was all said and done, the setup and update process consumed about 30-40 minutes of time. Boo to that.Controller:I really love what they've done to the controller. It's essentially the same in terms of layout to the 360, but refined. The analog sticks are longer, so they feel more accurate. The triggers have variable rumble to them, which means you can really get a feel for how your car is handling in something like Forza 5. I thought this would just be a gimmick, but man, it really adds to the experience.The batteries now sit inside the controller, instead of sitting like a wart on the back, which means it feels a little less &#34;cumbersome&#34;(for lack of a better word) than the way the 360 battery pack hung out. I never had a problem marathoning on the 360, but I think this is just a little more comfortable.Kinect:Love it or hate it, it is included. It adds to the price of the system. And if you aren't using the One to watch TV, it's kind of a gimmick at the moment.In terms of using the Kinect for TV browsing, it works and it works really well for me. I sometimes have to repeat the name of the network I want to watch, but overall I would say it hits my target 95% of the time.It also is a lot, I mean a LOT more accurate than the original Kinect. The One Kinect, when configured to recognize people walking into the room, takes seconds to pick up who it is and log them into the system if they have an account. This works flawlessly for me.The only place I've been using the Kinect otherwise is in Ryse. There are instances where you can tell soldiers to launch arrows or attacks using voice commands, or just push a button. I use voice commands because I'm already in the action, and this works flawlessly as well.Skype video chats are really, really nice on the One w/ the Kinect. Highly recommend using it for that if you ever have the need to use Skype. And Skype can be used to dial home and cell phones, so in theory you could also use non-video Skype calls as wellOver all the Kinect is a really nice device that is just a gimmick at the moment.Games:Something very important to note is that Xbox 360 games are NOT compatible with the Xbox One. There is some rumor of a possibility of a cloud gaming service to play games, similar to what the PS4 is supposed to have eventually sometime next year, to play 360 games, but this is just a rumor.In terms of the launch line up, I would say it is a really strong launch line up, but there really isn't anything included that is MUST OWN. So in reality, it may be better to just wait this out and maybe ask Santa to buy you one next year, unless you are like me and want the latest and greatest and want it now.Graphically, I'm not as wowed this generation as I was in the last generation's launch titles. Those games seemed like a much bigger leap, whereas the graphics on the One just seem to be a refinement. We get better frame rights, higher quality textures and higher quality audio, but nothing is such a major leap over the &#34;last&#34; generation that really makes me say &#34;man, this is the best thing ever.&#34; This is part of why I gave the system 4 stars. Sure, 6-12 months we should start to see games targeting each of the new systems, instead of games utilizing game engines designed for the PS3 and 360, so we should see more graphically intense titles, but that's 6-12 months from now. That's not NOW.Overall:In the end, what you buy should likely come down this:1) who will you play with2) do you want the extra functionality the Kinect brings (TV viewing, voice commands, etc)3) Do you not mind spending an extra $100 because of the Kinect (compared to PS4)And most importantly:4) are there any games in the launch line up that are exclusive to the One that you MUST own?If your friends will move to the Xbox One, and you answer yes to any of the other questions, then the Xbox One is definitely worth it and I highly recommend it. If you don't answer yes to the first question, and answer yes to 1 of the other questions, I would say you might be better served to wait. If you answer no to the first, but yes to all the others, then buy the One now.Recommended, with caveats.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

Let's just say that this game really earns every last good score that it gets.I'll begin by saying that this is the best adventure game ever created.  Now I know all you Zelda fans are going to come after me, but once you play this you will understand.  It is an adventure in every sense of the word.  There is just as much mystery as there is excitement and energy.  The mystique that this Japanese title brings to the console is unique.Mystique...that's the right word.  This game starts out as a dark spiritual story.  As the spirits begin to discuss the situation with you, you will gain the sense of just how small you are.  It's humbling, and that is what is so special about this game.  The colossi in this game are enormous, as the term colossus implies.  The smallest colossus you will encounter is about the size of two bull African elephants sewn together.  The largest...the largest......Absolutely grand.  Everything about the game is huge.  The landscape is so vast the horizon disappears not through the lack of pixilation, but by distance.  Few games have ever accomplished this.  The temples, the bridge (you will love the bridge) the mountain passes and the colossi are simply overwhelming.  Mountains feel like mountains...if you get really close to them and look up they look like they are engulfing you.  The trees are big, the horse Agro is big, the rivers and streams run for miles, the canyons are abysmal, the lakes look like oceans, and the colossi are huuuuuge!  The bigness of the environment and the smallness of the Wonderer (the main character) are truly humbling.  Take in the view; it is truly amazing, certainly nothing ever seen in videogames except for in its prequel ICO.On to the graphics.  The graphics don't represent the full potential of the PS2, however I believe there is a reason for this.  First off, the slightly dirtier graphics match the atmosphere that ICO brought.  This is very important since the focus on both games is atmosphere.  Also, the expansiveness of the environment would not be well represented if the up-close graphics were insane...plus the load times would be brutal.  There are practically no load times in this game.  This isn't to say that the graphics aren't great, however.  The textures look real, especially at a distance.  The horizon and the objects in it look real and far-away, yet the feeling that you can touch these objects is never lost.  The use of light and shadow brings the location to life.  If you stand on the top of an altar, I advise that you spin the camera; you might just believe that it is you that is spinning around really fast and seeing everything.  So good, so good.The gameplay!  THIS IS AN ADVENTURE BEYOND ANYTHING THAT HAS EVER BEEN PRODUCED!  Climbing the colossi is an event that is both powerful and humbling all at the same time.  It's a passionate puzzle that can kill you, but then again you probably won't die more than five times while playing the entire game.  It takes a lot of patience and awareness to figure out some of the puzzles, but it is a lot of fun.  Fun fun fun fun fun!  Climbing up and up and being shaken around by these beasts as you pound on their vital spots makes for an incredible ride.  It's intense...it will rock your soul.  It's the kind of experience that will make you feel.  Not like a first person shooter that scares you with a grenade blast.  No, this is different.  Ascending and killing a walking mountain releases so many emotions and so much adrenaline.  At first focusing on climbing to the apex, but then looking down as you are about to fall off and realizing just how high you are just as you snag the last patch of hair on the monster's arm is CRAZY.  Looking down while at the height of glory is exciting and real...so real it is almost painful.Solving puzzles in such an atmosphere is very different.  The thing is, the game doesn't have a bunch of little battles between bosses.  There are 16 bosses and no battles between them, just traveling on horseback and observing the view.  It's so gorgeous.  Each battle is unique and has its own way of killing you.  Figuring out these puzzles is a lot of fun, and once you figure them out the game gets pretty easy.  A lot of it you will do through logic and some by trial and error, but it doesn't matter.  Slaying the giants is rewarding any way.  Don't fret if you can't figure it out, Dormin (Nimrod spelled backwards hint hint to the Biblical connection to the story) who is your spiritual guide will instruct you.  Imagine a LEGO person armed with half a toothpick climbing up your body and pounding your pressure points until you suddenly die.  That is the job of SOTC.  Just like that.  It is a lot of fun.The soundtrack is unlike anything in any game.  Games with excellent soundtracks such as Mercenaries and Final Fantasy Tactics are pretty much crushed by this one.  The game is quiet when it needs to be, and emotional when it needs to.  When you enter battle, the music informs you of the danger.  When you struggle to figure out the puzzle, the music emphasizes the feeling of hopelessness.  When you figure out the puzzle and start smashing heads, the music will celebrate your triumph and urge you to climb to the top towards victory!  The completely orchestral soundtrack is so emotional and fits the game better than most do.  The game itself, the atmosphere, the graphics, the gameplay, and the music all mesh together like a well-made, very tasty pizza.  Hopefully an individual soundtrack of the music will be released.  Music that inspires emotion is what makes a game great.Finally the camera.  The game is extremely cinematic.  Sort of like a war movie, but even more cinematic than that.  During the cutscenes you can control the camera and focus on certain things.  It does have a tendency to spring back to where it really should be focusing on.  This movie aspect to the game adds to the realism, however it does sometimes make for some odd playing moments.  It is tough to run away from an opponent and keep it in view, since the camera wishes to point itself either behind the Wonderer or in the prettiest direction.  Sometimes the camera tilts in a certain direction to hint a weakness in the opponent.  Remember this.  The camera does twist at some odd angles and the springiness does sometimes get in the way, but eventually you will get accustomed to it.I know I said finally before, but let's not forget Agro!  Agro is your horse, the most faithful horse ever.  So cool.  Agro is perhaps the best sidekick in all of gaming.  He's such a darn good sport.  Takes a beating in every battle.Bottom line, Shadow of the Colossus is worth every penny.  Make sure you play ICO before you play this so that you can realize and appreciate the depth of the story.  The depth is what makes the story so special.  Note the Biblical and mythological connections of the whole thing (Dormin, Nimrod; Gilgamesh; Greek Mythology).  You will be reeling from this game's realism for days to come and amazed by the amount of spiritual impact that it has.  MAKE SURE YOU PLAY ICO!  It is really important.  Happy gaming.  This is such a good game, and you are sure to enjoy it.  I promise you won't have a sucky time even if you don't finish it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2005"}

You're not out there to observe and take notes. You're not a scientist hoping to get on the cover of magazines. YOU'RE A HUNTER!\"In a nutshell, you're supposed to shoot, shoot, and shoot some more.Tutorial mode? There's no tutorial mode....YOU'RE A HUNTER! Get in there, Van Pelt!GAMEPLAY:There are 5 types of challenges offered in this game:(1) NUMBERED:  Kill a certain number of animals, such as:- Kill 5 deer  in 2 minutes.(2) TAGGING: You must use special ammo to \"tag\" a particular animal, such as:- Tag 7 does in 2:30 minutes(3) AVOIDING: Avoid shooting a particular kind of animal, such as:- Avoid killing 3 red does in 2 minutes(4) SNIPER: Perform high skilled distance shots, such as:- Kill 5 Dodos in 2:30 minutes. Don't let the animal get too close; use the scope mode to shoot at a distance...(5) VITALS: Player needs to kill a certain number of animals by hitting their vitals only, such as:- Kill 5 gazelles in vital points in 2:00 minutesThere are also 4 boss battles for each area of the game.SO...HOW ARE THE GAME CONTROLS?In a word?FRUSTRATING.The controls in this game are horrendous. There are 2 control schemes, which I will list below.If you use the \"Touch Screen\" controls:Left hand: L trigger to shoot, the up key on the Control Pad to reload weapons, the right/left keys on the Control Pad to change weapons.Right hand: holds the stylus to control the targeting.This makes it difficult to reload or change weapons during a round.If you use the \"Circle Pad\" controls:Left hand: use the Circle Pad to control the targeting.Right hand: R trigger to shoot, X button to reload weapons, Y or A buttons to change weapons.If you take your thumb off the Circle Pad, the gun sights return to the center, and this makes it next to impossible to target animals precisely.TROPHIES:There are 3 trophies to earn for finishing this game in easy, medium, and hard mode. When an animal is shot, their image appears in the trophy room. Finishing the game and shooting at least one of every animal will unlock all the images.PROS: Since I like collecting things in 3DS games, I enjoyed the wide variety of animals available to hunt down. I almost wish there were more!The music during most of the stages was very soothing, and the music they chose for the boss battles sounded very similar to Metal Gear...they were designed to get your heart pumping for the ultimate battle between human and beast!CONS:I admit, this is the first hunting game I've ever played, but I was willing to give it a fair chance. I played through the game in medium and hard modes over the course of 4 days, it took me 12.5 hours (total) to unlock all the skill points, defeat all my enemies and unlock all the animals in the trophy room.But in the end, I didn't really enjoy myself. Why? Well, let's go through the cons I mentioned earlier:(1) Low replay value - There is really no incentive to finishing this game more than once. Since the control scheme is difficult to get used to, when (or if) you finish this game, it'll gather dust on your shelf until you trade it in.(2) The 3D in this game is nauseating because your visual field is constantly changing while looking for prey. I turned the 3D off within 20 seconds, and never turned it back on.(3) One of the great functions for some 3DS games is the Nintendo StreetPass. With this function, I can get additional missions for several games, such as Resident Evil: Revelations, which I always look forward to.This game does not use StreetPass, so no extra missions are available.(4) \"Scope Mode\" is simply an exercise in frustration. During \"Sniper\" missions, you are expected to use your sniper scope and kill enemies before they get too close. I was able to finish this game on Medium and Hard difficulty settings without using Scope Mode at all. I found it was harder to hit my target while using it.(5) There were a few times when the game would lag, and there was stuttered graphics while playing. I had to turn off the game, remove the cartridge and restart my 3DS to clear up the problem. NONE of my other 3DS games have ever had this issue. I also noticed that in \"Tagging\" rounds, sometimes the tagged animals stayed on the screen and this kept other animals from appearing that I could tag.(6) If you don't shoot the bonus icons, they will disappear. I didn't realize this was necessary until I shot one by accident. The instruction booklet does not say you have to shoot the Bonus icons to activate them.(7) I have been writing this review for roughly 45 minutes and during this time, I have been in multiplayer mode, waiting to join a game. Not one game has popped up on my screen. All I can say is this...if no one is online to play Deer Drive Legends, I don't see any benefit to their online mode.FINAL THOUGHTS:While the \"numbered\" and \"avoiding\" and \"vitals\" challenges were very simple to complete, the \"tagging\" and \"sniper\" challenges were very frustrating.Add in glitches, an instruction booklet with omissions, the inability to choose your own weapon layout, no online players to play with, and this gives us our final result...a frustrating, mediocre 3DS hunting game.I would not recommend this 3DS title to others.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

It has a fairly good story, it's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next, and it has a gameplay that's unbeatable.  The combat system is very simple and great.  You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake.  There is so much to do in this game that it's comaprable to a good RPG, something that N64 hasn't been blessed with yet.  The graphics are pretty good, especially since they don't use the expanssion pack, and the world is just huge.  One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough, and sometimes, you may feel lost and don't know what to do next. The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game.  This game will defently take a couple months to beat, unless you play 24/7.  After you master the game, then it'll just take a couple of days, like any other normal, or great game.  Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one.  One thing I didn't like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than it's predicessors. I've started playing Zelda games since the SNES days.  Back then, it was Zelda: A Link to the Past.  The game was tough.  I'll admit it, it took me a year to beat that. That game was also HUGE.  But now, 3D has made things eaiser, which I like and don't like.  But another thing I don't like.  They keep on changing the whole story of Zelda. Those of you who played the SNES game will know what I'm talking about.  There, Link didn't live in a forest, and there wasn't a guardian fairy.

Considering it IS a handheld video game, it is far above average. It is addicting as hell and can be very enjoyable. However, with any RPG, I expect a good story and a strong battle sytem and unfortunately, The Lost Age does not deliver.Starting off on a good note, The Lost Age is very pretty for a handheld. The effects and animations are very impressive and the game packs a lot of polish. Also, the music is not bad at all, though sometimes annoying. The sound effects are great. You couldn't ask for much more out of a handheld.Like I said, the game kind of falls flat when it comes to gameplay and story. The plot is not bad to the point where it is unbearable, but it is rather uninteresting and leaves much to be desired. Zero character depth and development only adds to the pain.The battle system is very, very generic. 90 percent of the time you will probably just be pressing the attack button as fast as you can to get the battle over with. Pretty easy stuff, and you will be running into the same monsters over and over and over again.What makes the game fun and addicting though is the exploration and puzzle solving. Pretty much every area or dungeon with enemies is like a maze, or one big or small puzzle. This can become very annoying and quite often frustrating, but you will always find yourself playing until you get past it, rewarding yourself with a sense of relief and accomplishment. The scope of the game is nice as well. Traveling from town to town, speaking to the locals is always nice.Golden Sun: The Lost Age is a great little game. If a handheld can keep you hooked as much as this game can, it is definently worth getting. Just do not expect a great story, character development or depth, even in its gameplay.

{"product_name":"B0050SZC5U","description":"","reviewerName":"Princeps P \"The Princeps\"","summary":"Honest Review, first time Diablo player","reviewText":"Honest review of Diablo 3.  I have not played any previous Diablo games, so this is new to me.  I own World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2. I enjoy Blizzard games and like the community.Diablo 3 is described as an action RPG; I would consider it a water down version of that. I consider an RPG along the lines of WoW and Skyrim.  There are some RPG elements like equipment customization, but not in character builds.  Your stats increase a set amount depending on the character you choose and you unlock specific skills at different levels.  The customization is that you choose what unlocked skills to use at any particular time. I have always enjoyed choosing what skill I wanted when I leveled up, I am not use to having it chosen for me. I understand why Blizzard did this, they wanted to make it easier to play and encourage new players.  However, what attracted me to buying Diablo in the first place was the customization that I read about for Diablo 2.  For me, customization and character builds comes before story in RPGs.  Even though this is disappointing the game is still enjoyable.  The random loot gives a good amount of customization, but leveling does not have the same satisfaction I am accustomed to.  The story is quite enjoyable and the cut scenes are fun to watch, they are timed to not  interfere with the gameplay.  I find the voice acting superb.The game play mechanics are easy to learn and use. The challenge comes in the timing and loads. Basically, you can assign abilities you have unlocked to both mouse buttons and numerical keys 1-4. I have heard complaints about this namely that players want access to all abilities and not limited to just six.  However, I find this adds to the challenge because you have to choose the right load out for the situation. It is easy to change and the cool down time is very short.Replay value of the game is there for at least a couple of play throughs with different characters, but may become boring after that.  Yes, loot drops are random and yes, some aspects of the dungeons are random as well, but if you are not into loot hunting and auction house whoring-the game could lose its appeal. Even with multiplayer players who are not trying to find the next great piece of equipment may get bored after a few play throughs.  At this point, I am not bored and playing with my second character. I am interested to see if there is money making opportunity with the \"real money\" auction house when it is up and running.  I think the lack of player controlled leveling customization may hurt long-term replay value though.I chose to give the game three stars for two reasons.  First, I marked off a star because of the watered down customization, this is a huge issue for me, but may not apply to everyone. I just feel long-term replay value may be hurt by this and past Diablo games have been known for replay value.I marked off a second star for the fact that you must have an internet connection to play single player.  This really does not affect me because I am always connected, but I believe players should have a choice. Battlenet is a double edge sword in my opinion. I like that I can login to any computer and easily download a game I already payed for and play anywhere. Currently I have WoW, Starcraft 2 and Diablo on numerous computers. I like the fact all I have to do is enter my account info and I am off. However, on the other side there is no resale value. I hardly sell games, but I believe it is a player's choice. You buy a car, house, gun, stereo, etc, you can choose to sell. I think games should be the same. Even though it does not really apply to me I stand by the community and thus, marked off a star.As far as the collectors edition is concerned A+, like all the extras. Blizzard always does a great job with these.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"J. Lethal","summary":"not much has changed in Rapture","reviewText":"First of all, I have actually finished the game.  Having done so, and having played the original, I was underwhelmed.  Had I never played the first Bioshock, this sequel would have felt far more impressive.  But as I played the game, I couldn't get past three simple thoughts:1. Unless I used the drill, which is pretty limited by the need for drill fuel, I never felt like a Big Daddy.2. While plasmids have some new upgrades, they're basically the same as before, as are the Splicers.3. Most of my time was spent beating other Big Daddys, adopting their Little Sisters, then escorting them around to gather adam.I opted to adopt and rescue Little Sisters to get the good ending (don't worry, no spoilers here).  Once a Little Sister is done collecting adam it is needlessly hard to pick her back up.  I also routinely had trouble picking up ammo and other items.  The game demands near perfect aim of the camera to acknowledge an object at your feet, which didn't ruin it but was a constant annoyance.Then there's the fact that despite being a Big Daddy, a tough Splicer could bring my health to near empty in three seconds on the normal difficulty setting.  Why are you so much weaker than the other Big Daddys you have to defeat?  For that matter, why do security systems attack you but not any other Big Daddy?  No explanation is ever offered.  A number of major elements in this game simply defied logic and felt glossed over, which was hugely disappointing considering how tight the story was in the original.  Where did the Big Sisters come from?  Why do they show up and attack you AFTER you have saved or harvested roughly every third Little Sister?  Early in the game Dr. Tenenbaum (the woman who acted like a nanny to the sisters in the original) appeals to you to help stop her work from being continued, but then just disappears for the last 90% of the game.  Given that this game's release was delayed, it's stunning how many such holes there are.While overall Bioshock 2 is worth playing, it feels very unfinished.  Given that 2K used the same game engine as the original, that is inexcusable.  It seems like they decided to just shove something out the door to cash in on a popular franchise.  With so many big games out right now, I'd wait on this one until the price comes down.  Fortunately I got great trade-in value for it, and couldn't get rid of it fast enough since it certainly doesn't merit a second play through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

The single player campaign is visionary in the way it tells a story about Aperture Science and the characters you encounter are engaging.

First boss battle is almost impossible because all the \"lackeys\" keep reappearing.  Boss is fast and you are slow.  Companions most of the time can not help you because they are getting pounded too.  Boss would sometimes not get frozen by freezing arrows if hit right away at his arrival.  Can't drink a potion and health dome/protection force field won't work when health is too low?  I am sure their is some trick to defeating this boss but after 2 hours and all these other problems I give up on this game  Good attempt by a movie title which almost always are terrible.  Except for the batman series.  Lacks any free roam feeling because all progress is in a \"straight\" line.  No in game control checking, at least not that I could find so I could not figure out how to run.

Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Sith Warlord \"Sith Warlord\"","summary":"The Perfect N64 game","reviewText":"Perfect dark has THE BEST multi player mode.

It's a tool, a training exercise, and a piece of software that stimulates your brain and tests your responses. There aren't really high scores, there's no story, and there aren't even characters besides the face of Dr. Kawashima, who kindly tells you how to complete each exercise. Really, if you look at it realistically, Brain Age isn't a game at all-it's a tool similar to an educational computer program. If that doesn't excite you, I'm not surprised, but giving Brain Age a chance will reveal its very interesting elements.The point of Brian Age is to provoke and make use of the prefrontal cortex in your brain. If you didn't know (and I don't expect most of you to know anything about neural science), the prefrontal cortex is what lets you use stored knowledge to make decisions in any situation. Quoting the game's official site, it is the \"control tower\" of your brain. The site also says that your \"`practical intelligence,' or ability to apply stored knowledge to your everyday reality, depends upon how well your prefrontal cortex functions.\" The prefrontal cortex is \"the foundation of creativity, memory, communication, and self-control.\" It's been proven, through Dr. Kawashima's research of the brain's activity and blood flow, that the exercises found in Brain Age can increase the ability to use the prefrontal cortex, thus sharpening your brain.Whether this \"training\" is an engrossing experience or not depends on your willingness to do math problems or play color-recognition exercises. There are several different exercises, some of them being much more entertaining than others. I, personally, was a sucker for \"Calculations 20X\", which is a set of 20 simple math problems. The goal of \"Calculations\" (which also comes in a \"100X\" flavor) is to complete these math problems as quickly as possible by writing the answer to each equation on the touch screen. You'd be surprised how tricky the game can be-seeing \"8X8\" and then \"8+8\" in quick succession can be very confusing and will require you to stop and think for a second before answering. Other fun games include \"Head Count\", where you count the amount of people entering and exiting a building, and \"Lowest to Highest\", which is an interesting take on simple memory games.The game I didn't like so much was the \"Stroop Test\". The \"Stroop Test\" is a common brain game where the names of colors (like \"black\" and \"yellow\") are written in a font color different than what the word actually represents. For example, \"blue\" might be written in a red font, and there is a slight struggle when saying the color of the font rather than the actual word. The microphone does a terrible job picking up the pronunciation of different colors, and I personally had a really tough time with \"blue\". This game is actually the only game that does a poor job with recognition of voice or stylus control. Every other game is spot-on.The point of playing these games is to determine your \"Brain Age\", or the level that your brain thinks at. A healthy Brain Age is 20, which means that your brain operates at a 20-year-old's level, which is evidently the optimal level. Perhaps it's because 20-year-olds haven't yet destroyed their brain with legal alcohol use, but that's a different story.There aren't really graphics or sound effects to mention here. The on-screen visuals are mostly numbers and words without much color, and the backgrounds are all gray or white. Each figure is pretty simple, like the little figures that represent people in \"Head Count\". Technically, nothing looks bad, but Brain Age is probably the last game ever that will wow you in terms of production values.Even when the exercises get old, 100 sudoku puzzles don't. Sudoku, for those of you unfamiliar with addictive number puzzles, is a game where nine columns and nine rows make 81 squares, and the goal of the game is to fill in a square with a number from 1-9 without repeating any single number in a column or row. There is only one solution to each puzzle, and some of the puzzles can take anywhere from five minutes to an hour to complete, depending on your skill and the amount of numbers granted to you when you begin the puzzle. Sudoku is difficult to do at first but pretty quickly you'll be hooked, and this additional game alone makes Brain Age a fantastic package. Not to mention, a sudoku PSP game was just released and costs more than $20 WITHOUT all of the brain games!Is Brain Age worth buying? Definitely! It's only $20, and I will vouch for Dr. Kawashima that Brain Age does make use of your brain. I had a headache after about an hour of gameplay the first day I got it, but that was mostly because I was replaying \"Calculations\" and trying to get a lightning-fast time. Doing 800 math problems is bound to do that to your head! Brain Age, if nothing else, is a gadget that further proves the DS' originality and innovation. For that reason alone, it's worth checking out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Douglas Sourbeer \"Latro\"","summary":"A sheep in wolf's clothing","reviewText":"Initially, due to the high visual detail of the environment and the characters, the the game looks impressive. Unfortunately, because of repetition, an overall drabness, (like Quake), and too much darkness, it becomes humdrum.  The Sound effects are excellent throughout although mood music is lacking.  The gameplay itself starts out quite scary but all to soon becomes tedious; again, due to repetition.  You soon know where the monsters are coming from and what they will do. There is no inovation here.  The old games 'Blood' or Duke Nukem are examples of inovative gameplay. For a scary game try the Suffering and for just plain fun even Painkiller is better.  The system requirements are rather steep as well.  With a Radeon 9800 and a p4 3.2GHZ there was signifigant chopiness in many areas. Wait till the game sells for 15 bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2005"}

After completing the game with 112 hours of accumulated playtime and 108 soul levels earned, I'm finally ready to review Demon's Souls. This game is very enjoyable, and sometimes very patience-testing, and I will say with no hesitation, it is DEFINITELY a worthwhile investment of your hard-earned money.PLOT:The plot is simple enough - the far away kingdom of Boletaria has been enveloped by a strange fog. From this fog come demons who desire nothing more than to kill humans and claim their souls. Many warriors have gone to try and lift the curse, but none have returned. Now it's up to you, brave warrior. Will you be the savior of the land, or will the demons claim another victim?GAMEPLAY:Once you start playing, you'll discover that this is no ordinary role playing game. If you play in human form, your strikes and magic do less damage. If you play the game in soul form, your strikes and magic are more powerful, but your life bar is cut in half.As you play through the game, you can gather demon's souls for currency - weapons, spells, miracles, healing herbs, armor, it's all the same currency in Boletaria. If you are playing in a world and get killed, all your demon's souls are now at the bloodstain where you died. If you make it back there and touch your bloodstain, all those sweet souls are yours. If you die on the way, those souls are gone forever and your wallet is empty.There are some online features here that I've never seen before. After playing for a little while, I saw writing on the ground and when my character passed over it, it said \"Beware of the dangerous foe ahead\". I was very cautious from this point and eventually I saw a bloodstain on the ground. When I touched it, I saw a blood-red visage of another character rolling backward through a doorway, swinging their sword a few times, and then dying. From this, I figured out an ambush was waiting for me in the next room.Wow - talk about helpful, I was given two ways to avoid a premature death: a written message and a blood-smeared warning. Awesome!You can also leave messages for other players to warn them of danger - if they find your message helpful; you earn a healing boost. This can help out BIG TIME during a boss battle, let me tell you!COMBAT:One thing Demon's Souls will teach you is variety. Monsters will not attack the same way in all worlds. They will exhaust your stamina, or poison you, or simply try to cleave you from neck to navel. You will have to keep on your toes to survive. You can dodge by rolling, or time a perfect riposte, but you can't button-mash your way to victory.Now we've all been there - we planned accordingly, brought enough healing items, even watched online videos to train up, but somehow we just can't beat the next boss. This is where the \"help\" option comes into play. Instead of throwing your controller across the room, look for a blue stone on the ground - you can summon up to two other players to defeat that boss. Rock on!Now if you're one of those gamers with a lot of confidence, there is one boss battle with a delicious twist: if you play online, YOU WILL BE FIGHTING ANOTHER PLAYER...THEY _ARE_ THE BOSS.Yep, you read that correctly.WEAPONS/SPELLS/MIRACLES:Your weaponry is virtually limitless in Demon's Souls. Knives, rapiers, broadswords, clubs, spears, crossbows, maces, and many more. You can create more powerful weapons by collecting various ores from the 5 worlds you explore. Your options also cross over into the magical - you can learn protection spells for your character, or conjure clouds of poison to slowly turn your enemies into worm's food. There are miracles to flee back to The Nexus, or summon God's Wrath to lay waste to your foes.Some upgradeable weapons/miracles/spells are not available unless you have the right demon's soul, so this means you'll have to play through the game a few times to get all those sweet, tasty goodies.WORLD TENDENCIES:While playing Demon's Souls, the worlds you inhabit can change from your actions. For example:If you kill a demon boss, that pushes your world tendency toward white.If you are in human form and die, that pushes the world tendency towards black.There are some enemies and game events that are only accessible during certain world tendencies.Sometimes the game's server throws events for us. Atlus threw all 5 worlds into pure black (the hardest difficulty) for Halloween of 2009 and before Christmas they changed all 5 worlds to pure white (easiest difficulty). While these events helped some gamers, I'm sure others found this relaxing...like swimming in a shark tank with chum-flavored swimming trunks.CHARACTER TENDENCIES:In addition to the worlds changing, your character can become good or evil with certain actions. For example:If you kill other online players that invade your game, your character tendency goes toward white and your attack power will increase.If you kill other players by invading their game, your character tendency goes toward black and your hit points will decrease.There are certain events that only occur if your character tendency is at full white/black.TROPHIES:The trophies in Demon's Souls cover the full spectrum of difficulty. Some are given for creating the best weapon with rare ores, others are given for defeating bosses, and others are given for learning all the spells/miracles. A regular game from start to finish will usually net you about 17 trophies, but there are 38 total - and this vastly increases the replay value for the trophy-hungry crowd (like me!).CONS:Even with a game this amazing, innovative and addictive, it does have a few faults.It's very annoying to finish fighting a boss and be returned to human form when all of a sudden, you're thrust into battle with another player with better weapons and spells that mops the floor with you. Of course, if you play in offline mode, this won't happen.The game's instruction manual doesn't go into NEARLY enough detail, but fear not, it references the official website which has wiki entries on every subject imaginable.Like many gamers, I am used to taking bio-breaks during my gaming sessions, but Demon's Souls doesn't let you drop your guard that easily. The best option is to clear an area of enemies and then do your business. Don't try this in human form while online; you never know when your game could be invaded!The lack of a voice chat option is really the only gripe I have. Inviting players with the blue stone is a fantastic feature, but without a voice chat option, you're forced to send messages to each other - and let me tell you, you can't be doing strategy planning while the False King is trying to separate your head from your body!Finally, I have to say it...while this is one of the great PS3 exclusives, I feel the very large gaming demographic of Xbox and PC gamers are truly missing out. I hope that Demon's Souls 2 will be available on other platforms, because everyone deserves the chance to play a game this fun, this frustrating and this rewarding.FINAL VERDICT:If you're only a casual RPG gamer, you can take your time and enjoy Demon's Souls to the fullest. If you're a hardcore gamer or a trophy nut, you'll love, love, LOVE this game and find yourself playing it over and over.Special thanks to Adam, AJ, JEQ92 for helping me get the Monk's Collar (with a 5-hour time difference!) and other gamers who left online messages which saved my butt a thousand times over!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2010"}

Another minor but pleasant change from white 360's is the lack of push buttons. You merely touch the eject or power button and it makes a nice beep noise to let you know the button has been pressed.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"AMAZING STORYLINE!! Gameplay....just above so so","reviewText":"I'll try and keep this short and sweet.The story line of this game cannot be praised enough. It makes the game worth any price you would pay for it as it's better than many and most movies I ever seen.The part I feel the game falls a little short is in the game play.It's seemingly closely related to Uncharted, which I loved the game play of. But The Last of Us seems more Tom Clancy like, as I found myself having to sneak around pretty much the entire game. It started to get old halfway through the game having to deal with every encounter stealthy. And if I opted not be stealth 95% of the game I would be dying 95% of the game.It also is unrealistic in the fact that your allies could clear as day run in front of enemies and as long as you yourself were still sneaking around and not making noise, the enemies would not know you were there.And most of all, I feel the game was more geared towards human conflict. It left a major desire for more zombie encounters.The scare factor could have also been much higher. There were so many parts where I thought 'holy crap...if zombies come out on this part I am gonna be so creeped out!'....but the many moments would come and go with no zombies. The 2 classes of zombies are not very scary to be honest. Creepy, yes! but scary....not so much. You can easily sneak inches in front of them and they wont even know you're there because they cant see (no eyesight). The creepiest of zombies (I thought) were the stalkers, but I only encountered them twice in the game for less than a minute.These are just critical comments that will hopefully get read by Naughty Dog and be improved on in the sequel (PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL!!!!)Don't let my criticism lead you astray. This game is AMAZING!!!! and everyone should play it.....EVERYONE! Except little kids. Lots of swearing! :P","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Finding a way through, when the whole world is out to get you","reviewText":"Story:The Last of Us starts out giving us a glimpse into the pre-apocalyptic life of Joel, the games main character. You experience the frightening and strange happenings going on around them for the first time, just as they are. The beginning is more intense than I had anticipated, and plays out like a Hollywood movie on your screen. After some shocking moments, you find yourself playing Joel's character, some years into the future. Unlike the younger Joel you started out as in the beginning, you are graying a bit, and your face and clothes portray the hard life you've been living the last few years. The world you live in has gone from every-day normal, to now just trying to survive.A mysterious pandemic had hit and is infecting people randomly, driving them crazy. Those that are infected act as though they are living zombies, attacking, clawing and gnashing at every living thing they come across. The longer they remain infected, the more dangerous they become. While a regular infected person can be taken down semi-easily, once they have been infected so long they mutate into a \"clicker\", and are even more vicious. Once a clicker has their hands on you, you're dead. Your only defense is that they have been infected so long that they can no longer see, as their head and eyes have mutated into a twisted shape. But they see movement with sound, so you must be stealthy as well as learning how to fight them.You now live life in a quarantined section of the city. The government and military controls everything, including who lives and dies. Everyone left is hungry due to a lack of food, and is subject to random checks constantly to see if they have been infected. You're not alone in this twisted new world, having a friend named Tess. You and she work on surviving together.The two of you find yourselves on a mission to get back some supplies stolen from you. To do so, you must help a local rebel group called The Fireflies. They want you to smuggle a Ellie, a 14 year old girl out of the city. At first you assume Ellie is related to someone important or in power, and has someone pulling strings to help her escape. However as the game plays out, you discover there's far more to her story. The journey to get her to safety is a long one and you are confronted with endless enemies along the way.Gameplay:The manner in which the characters socialize, travel and work together in The Last of Us is very reminiscent of the game play in the Uncharted series. The goal to escape the military controlled containment/quarantine areas plays out similar to that in Infamous, and the journey and collection of supplies without the ability to regenerate health on your own is similar to the less known PS3 game, I Am Alive. The Last of Us has some aspects of it that remind me of the very best parts of some of these other great games, but it is still is very much a unique game in itself.Exploring the all the areas in the game is necessary to find enough supplies to survive. Your health does not regenerate on its own. You need medical supply kits to improve your condition. Bullets are also in short supply. It resembles real life, in that you only have so many and there's not full clips lying around every 3 feet for you to resupply. You will be in situations where you might only have 4 bullets, and there are 6 enemies. You make all sorts of decisions throughout every step of the game on how to proceed. In addition, enemies don't got down with just one shot. You might use an entire clip on one enemy, and then you'll find that you've alerted several more to your location from the noise. To survive, you need to use a lot of stealth and learn how to take enemies down by sneaking up behind them. You will collect anything you can find around you, and turn it into something you can use. Also, weapons don't last you forever. They break down and become unusable, forcing you to find or make another.Graphics:The military controlled parts of the city you start out in are dirty and have fallen into disrepair. Everyone there is just trying to coexist, working on staying alive and out of the way of any soldiers. Just outside of the controlled zones is an area where some residents venture out to, risking their lives since it is occupied by the zombie like infected people. The farther out you travel, the more visually amazing the environment is to look at. The city has long since been abandoned, and is left with building toppled over and rivers running through the streets. Beautiful foliage grows over once dirty city buildings, and the air itself is clearer. There are times in the game where everything is bright, beautiful and covered in sunshine. Then there are times when you're in complete darkness, with no light to see anything, except that which comes from the beam of your flashlight, shining down on piles of mangled bodies, while you hide from monsters all around you. Inside the buildings are the most ominous of foes, the clickers. Throughout the game your life is constantly threatened by all three of these groups (military, infected and clickers), and you find very few allies along the way.Conclusion:The Last of Us is a must-play game for PS3 owners. There is so much more to the game than I've mentioned, but going into further details could give away some of the amazing and shocking moments in the story. The game can be played in several modes, Easy, Normal, Hard and Survivor. There is so much to see and explore, and so many ways in which you can confront enemies (slow and stealthy, or not), that the playing time from the beginning to the end of the game will vary quite a bit from person to person. There are definitely moments when you will startled and be caught off guard, or find yourself practically holding your own breath, hoping the bloodthirsty and animalistic clickers don't see you hiding just around the corner. From beginning to end in this game, everything is out to get you. It's an intense game, with a great story, lots of emotion and an amazing world to go through and explore. Just when you think you've got the game all figured out, you're really just beginning.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Brendan Riley","summary":"Deep character development does exist after all..","reviewText":"Many people are saying that this is the best game they have ever played. I would agree, but with the caveat that Journey is in a class of its own. That makes Journey and The Last of Us tied for first in my book. I'm just going to talk about the game from a technical standpoint rather than give you a synopsis of the games story line. There are plenty of other sources for that kind of information.The graphics in this game are phenomenal. The lighting is tremendous - all the shadows fall exactly how they should and the lighting is affected by the environment. Also, when looking into a light, such as in a gunfight, whether it be a flashlight or a standing halogen light, it creates glare and blinds you. It does this not by just making things white, (like a flashbang in many war games)but by actually creating an overwhelming sensation of brightness. I was very impressed by the lighting in this game and I think lighting is important to creating the ever more realistic games that we crave these days.The environments are lush and detailed, and also very colorful. Many times the color tone is bright and almost cheery, reminders of what humankind used to be. Other times, it is dark and drab and a constant reminder of the current state of affairs. Even the fungal zombies are super unique despite there only being three types of zombies (as an aside, don't let anyone fool you into thinking that this is NOT a zombie game. About 60/40 of the action comes from the fungal zombies and the other survivalist humans that you encounter with the 60% being in favor of the fungus. While fighting humans and generally surviving is very important to not only the gameplay, but also the story, I still felt much of the action came from the fungal zombies).Next is the voice acting. The crew at Naughty Dog and whomever else helped in the making of this game created an immersive atmosphere that was spawned from terrific story telling, INCREDIBLE voice acting, and a believable environment. All this was brought together by the voice acting. These days games are becoming interactive movies and this game really drew me in. I felt tension, anger, sadness, fear, desperation and other emotions throughout my playing of this game. Only Journey has been able to pull me into the world to the point where I actually FEEL an emotion; something that isn't just the sense of entertainment and fun.Finally, I'll briefly mention the story itself without providing spoilers or a synopsis. Joel and Ellie are developed together so well within this story that we, as the gamer, get to see their relationship go from \"moving cargo\" to a quasi \"father-daughter\" relationship. We see that Joel is willing to go to any length to survive. That means doing anything necessary by any means necessary. The ending, therefor, makes complete sense. Did it shock me? Of course. Did I say, \"Whaaaat? It can't end here!\". I did, and the game did end there. Total cliff hanger. This sets them up perfectly for \"The Last Of Us 2: Revenge of The Fungus Amongus\" though. Still, though, I think it is a beautiful ending to the chaos that is the survival the characters go through in this game. To paraphrase Joel, you gotta keep searching for the things that keep ya goin'.The last thoughts I'll offer are thus: This game is definitely worth buying and playing. I just beat it and am about to start it over again (The intro sequence is SO INTENSE!!) so it appears to have replay value. Some people complained that it had too many cutscenes or that they were too long. This may be true if you want to play Resident Evil or Dead Island, but this game is neither. If you don't like stories or long cutscenes in your games, then this may not be the one for you. This does not mean that cutscenes are 20 minutes long, and I personally did not find them abhorrent or too long, but it may be something to be aware of. What is too long is this review, so I'll wrap it up with this: Play this game, you won't regret it (my brother, who owns an XBOX 360, plans to buy a PS3 just so he can play this if that tells ya anything).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2013"}

Yes.Sonic 2006 takes a whole new epic, slightly-more mature turn of events on the story. People who say this is cheesy obviously don't care much for Sonic to begin with. This game was amazing when I played it, and today it's graphics are still incredible, at least for the cutscenes. The overall gameplay isn't bad, just takes some getting used to. Sonic has a few annoying high-speed levels and Shadow's vehicle controls take awhile to get used to, but if ANYBODY has a shred of patience and willing to try out different STYLES of gameplay, then they'll enjoy it.Sonic 2006 has a similar theme to Sonic Adventure 1, spending time running about towns in an RPG-like style, and I like it. It feels like you're more in control of the characters. There's some fun town missions, and overall a great experience as a true Sonic fan.If you wanna whine and complain about it being too clumsy, yes it takes some adjusting, but it's beatable and masterable.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Enthralling, and entertaining","reviewText":"Have you ever played a game that just stayed with you? A game that sets up camp somewhere in your brain, and just stays there. Tomb Raider does that. It's gut-wrenchingly good. Tomb Raider captures the one thing that many other franchises fail to capture, empathy for the protagonist. Many times in big budget video games, you don't really feel threatened or frightened. Most games serve to empower you with fantastic abilities and improbable prowess. Tomb Raider makes you feel decidedly human. Lara is not a one-woman army, she's a girl with some very impressive survival skills. Even then, Lara constantly reassures herself during moments of extreme odds. This is refreshing. Lara does not taunt her enemies, nor does she make cocky remarks. Lara is concerned with her safety, and through that, so is the player.The graphics are beautiful. I have been impressed with other games, but this truly stands out even among the most competitive of titles. Gameplay is phenomenal, as is the level up system. Using the bow and arrow just feels right. I like the pistol, and I like the shotgun and rifle, but the bow and arrow is by far my favorite weapon.The story is enthralling, and moves at a brisk pace. It has some supernatural elements to it that I really enjoyed.Perhaps the most entertaining part of the game is the open world aspect to it. If you are the type of player who simply enjoys playing for the story, and is not concerned with picking up treasure or documents, you are more than welcome to do just that. But, it is extremely satisfying to wander around the gorgeous island of Yamatai just looking  for things. The tomb raiding aspect of the game is entirely optional, but is thoroughly enjoyable. The puzzles are just difficult enough to make you feel like a genius for figuring it out, but easy enough to finish in about 15-20 minutes per tomb.Cutting to the chase, the star of Tomb Raider is Lara Croft. She is the reason why this game is so entertaining. Her unnervingly realistic groans of pain when she is hurt are testament to the effort that went behind making this character believable. The voice actress behind Lara Croft (Camilla Ludington) is extremely gifted. Her lines are well delivered, as well as all of her non-verbal reactions. I cannot recommend this game enough.A word on the collectors edition:For 100 dollars, I'm impressed. The action figure is very well made, the tin box is fantastic, and the map/poster is nice enough to be put up in any room. The soundtrack for this game is just top-notch, so the cd is awesome as well. The patches are cool too. If you're on the fence, just go for it. I think it's more than worth the price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

This story captures you from the moment you pick up the controller to the moment you put it down. As always my reviews are separated into 3 categories. Story, Gameplay, and Characters with more weight to story.Story: 8.5/10Man this story just grabs you and doesn't let go.  You start as a man/mercenary that is trying to find a cure for his sick daughter. She disappears and the man goes to find her to also discover a magical book that talks and claims to be Grimoire Weiss. The two travel around searching out sealed verses that they think hold the key to curing the daughter's sickness. The world is plagued by monsters called shades that seem to have some sort of rational thought and some strange connection to the sickness that plagues his daughter. The man picks up a couple of others that aid him on his quest including a person who is neither man nor woman that is possessed by an evil shade as well as a young boy who is at first cursed with a condition that paralyzes anyone he looks at then later loses his physical form and becomes infused with magic. The three plus the floating book battle on until they discover the awful truth that is the nature of the world.Gameplay 5/10The overall gameplay is pretty basic. It's a glorified hack and slash with just a little bit of RPG elements. You do get experience and level up but you have no control over what to level up. All of your stats just get a bump. When you collect a sealed verse you also get a new magic ability. So you do have some extra magic powers that REALLY come in handy. You also have the ability to find new weapons and collect parts to improve them. This is a really fun and addicting side quest to the game. You can literally spend hours farming materials to improve you weapons. Half way through the game you also get access to 2 handed swords and spears that add another layer of strategy to your game. Graphics are decent but below average for a ps3/360 game. The soundtrack is beyond amazing. One of the better soundtracks I have heard in recent memory. I personally do not like having to beat the game several times to open up more of the ending. I don't like how games do that but with this game it's definitely worth doing so. I also thought that a lot of the black screen/white text story telling was kind of a cheap way to go about things. It would have been nice for Nier to actually have to experience the dreams or actually get to watch Kaine's story but we didn't get those options. Great music, good gameplay, decent graphics and take a point away for the all text story telling.Characters 8/10The characters are unique but basic. The main character is fairly developed. He's a father trying to save his daughter. He's also a mercenary. Brash but driven. Nothing too deep here. The side characters are really where the character development comes in. Grimoire Weiss, the floating book, is humorous and comes off as extremely educated and snobby which interacts well with the brash and driven Nier. Kaine, the \"neither man nor woman\" character takes brash to the next level. You have to beat the game to unlock her back story but nonetheless her back story is sad and gripping. Completely explains her language and look on life. Emil, a young boy cursed with the ability to petrify anyone he looks at is the sweet innocent character in the story. He keeps the others grounded and has his own gripping sad back story that you get to explore in the game. Overall, the weakest character is the main character. The side characters are extraordinarily developed and well scripted. The main character is a little bit shallow (as in not well developed...not as in frat boy shallow) but that is largely due to the story. Overall a superb cast of characters.Overall 7/10This game came out of nowhere. Most people haven't even heard of it. However, it is definitely worth your time. Some of the gameplay elements left you wanting more but overall this game should not be skipped by anyone that appreciates a deep story in their gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

After almost a year of owning the DS this is the first time a game ever gave me thumb pain because I couldn't put it down. Dawn of Sorrow is a classic 2D hack and slasher with a large element of collecting. In this case the main character collects monster souls which can give him new abilities or better weapons using soul fusion. The souls are released randomly so if you want to collect them all it's gonna take a bit of time.The control in Dawn of Sorrow is spot on although the touch screen is used rather sparingly. The main use is drawing symbols when a boss is near death to finish him/her/it off. If you draw the symbol wrong the boss gains some life back and keeps going. There is some debate as to whether the symbol drawing is awesome or annoying. I fall into the later camp.Although the graphics are 2D there are up to three layers of background to give the game a sense of depth. I was a little put off by the small sprites used for the characters but as time went on I grew to like then love the way the game looks. Its slick enough that I may consider going back and purchasing the previous two Castlevania's that came out for the GBA. DS now has two must get titles in Dawn of Sorrow and Advanced Wars.

The missions mode is rather unique and slightly more challenging then I expected, I enjoyed humorous tasks like taking a picture of a lighthouse or putting out camp fires. It was short and slightly repetitive, but fun while it lasted. Plus, if you get good scores you can unlock even more mission categories, which I do not think people have noticed. Free flight mode is basically what you do in Sports Resort. You fly around Wuhu Island for around 2 minutes (time is extendable and will equal the original game's time once completed) and try to find specific locations and secrets. The island trivia is one of my favorite parts. There are also some extras to find that will reward you with 3D models. Those two modes (aside from the model viewing mode) make up the entire game.

{"product_name":"B00F6YD2AK","description":"","reviewerName":"Neoncloudff","summary":"Go Beyond Death (And Have Fun The Entire Way)","reviewText":"Sequel to the widely acclaimed Dark Souls and finale to the &#34;Souls&#34; trilogy, Dark Souls 2 puts sword and shield (or sorcery, or hammer, or axe...) into your hands once again in hopes that you can triumph death and despair in this RPG by FromSoftware.  Bigger, meaner, and more epic than either of its predecessors Dark Souls 2 represents a stunning achievement in design and execution.  It welcomes new players with a friendlier tutorial and improved mechanics, but veterans of the Souls series need not be worried.  Dark Souls 2 is brutal and challenging, testing you every step of the way with tough bosses and overwhelming odds.  But Dark Souls 2 is also beautiful and stunning, featuring a world that is well worth exploring every nook and cranny, from dark and dead pits to harrowing civilizations long lost in time above the clouds.  Dark Souls 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece, through and through.Story, Presentation, and World &#8211; 10/10/10 &#8211; 10The story of Dark Souls 2 is a fantastical tale of kingdoms lost in time, ruled by monsters and hostile forces ready to challenge the player.  Similar to the previous games, Dark Souls 2 is a mildly minimalistic game in terms of delivering information; the player must explore and discover most of the world himself or herself.  It&#8217;s an impressive story and world, with a staggering amount of thought behind its deep lore and characters.  It&#8217;s a world filled with mystery, where the player&#8217;s imagination is key to understanding and connecting the loose ties between characters and their place in Drangleic.  And I&#8217;m sure the ending will be something discussed by Souls fans for years to come.Dark Souls 2 also features a significant upgrade in presentation values.  Things are cleaner, nuanced elements in character building are more clear and menus are designed with a greater emphasis on ease of use.  It&#8217;s all still very much like the previous games, just refined and improved to perfection.Graphics and Art Direction &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5The world of Drangleic is an epic land ripe for exploration.  Half of this experience, though, is the staggeringly huge variety of places you&#8217;ll visit while on your quest.  Decrepit crypts, castles in the sky, and even the garbage bin of Drangleic itself, the art direction for Dark Souls 2 continues the FromSoftware&#8217;s creative trend in developing horrendous creatures and placing them in a fascinating world.  There are tons of unique bosses and enemies out for your hollow head, and each and every one is animated with a certain professionalism only a Japanese studio could produce.  Along with these disturbing denizens of Drangleic, the places you&#8217;ll visit are equally impressive; not simply because of their design but also the character, increased color pallet and pure imagination every new area brings.  To say that Dark Souls 2&#8217;s art direction is great would be a crime; it is simply stunning, and is one of a kind.Graphically, Dark Souls 2 is superior to its predecessors in many ways.  You&#8217;ll be happy to know that the game runs at a steady 30 FPS throughout (PS3) to 60 FPS (360 version is more consistently smoother, PS3 does hit 60 FPS in enclosed and small areas) and technically performs without a hitch.  The big improvement here is the animations, which have benefited immensely from being motion captured.  Elements of your character react with realism, and enemies feel lifelike and move like they should.  The improved lighting engine creates a surprising sense of immersion (although is not the lighting engine we were advertised last year), and the improved physics engine is icing on the cake (character&#8217;s armor, such as loincloths and hoods flow in the wind and react realistically).  Grainy textures and anti-aliasing problems do occur more often than I would&#8217;ve like to see (and are simply limitations of the Xbox 360 and PS3).  The dumbed down lighting engine is a disappointment as well as the grainy textures and various visual hiccups, making a next gen version of Dark Souls 2 all the more tantalizing.Gameplay and Design &#8211; 10/10 &#8211; 10Where as Demon&#8217;s Souls introduced us to the impossibly challenging difficulty the series is known for and Dark Souls improved the online and flow of combat, Dark Souls 2 has perfected what the series is known for.  Tight and claustrophobic combat headlines the game, while rewarding exploration, online PvP, summoning and aiding other players are all improved.  Dark Souls 2 continues the trend of &#8220;endless tactics&#8221; with the numerous amount of weapons, which all feel distinct and fun to use.  Everything has been improved, refined, and polished.  The classic gameplay is still as challenging as ever, too.  Fears of Dark Souls 2 dumbing down the difficulty and level of challenge have gone completely unwarranted.  If anything, this may be the most challenging of all the Souls games, but also the most fair.  Yes, you&#8217;ll die, get punished because of it, and lose your souls (which can be retrieved within the next life) and your human status, if you&#8217;re human.  But Dark Souls 2, unlike its previous entries, clearly explains the effects of items, materials, and penalties.  You die because you&#8217;re unfamiliar with a boss, area, or unique enemy tactic.  You only come back stronger, more aware of the dangers you will face and more capable to tackle them quicker with more precision.  Of the 245 times I died through my play-through, I rarely felt cheated.  Only a few times (fighting optional bosses and online PvP) did I feel this way.In terms of design, Dark Souls 2 is built with the player in mind.  Beginning the adventure is tough, as is every video game.  Healing items are rare in the beginning, and the Estus Flask only offers a swig at first.  But as you explore this hostile and beautiful world, you&#8217;ll be rewarded with new and better armors, lifegems, status ailment healers, new weapons and sometimes the rare shards to improve the Estus Flask.  Exploration doesn&#8217;t get more rewarding than this.  Dark Souls 2 also offers a huge collection of memorable boss battles; everything from quick thinking to pure dodging skill is required throughout the many, many bosses that stand in your way.  And you will take them all out, I believe in you!  Dark Souls 2 is rewarding every step of the way; from it&#8217;s improved, tighter combat, intricate level design and unique character building this is an RPG that sacrifices nothing it&#8217;s famous for, but rather embraces its flaws and only improves upon them.Sound Design and Soundtrack &#8211; 9/10 &#8211; 9.5Dark Souls 2 will immerse you in more ways than one, and that&#8217;s mainly because of it&#8217;s subtle sound design.  Some say the best sound design is one that you don&#8217;t even notice; Dark Souls 2 is accomplished in this aspect.  Swords will clash and spells will be cast, and they all sound great.  The ambience while exploring each area really shines brightly as well.  From creepy distant cackles to hollow and decrepit crypts, everything sounds as it should.  Voice acting, a small part of all the Souls games, has been improved and expanded here and it is all delivered very well.Dark Souls 2 features, hands down, the best score for any of the Souls games.  Each boss fight has it&#8217;s own unique theme, memorable and musical enough to listen to outside the game.  The tragic and intense orchestration and score really highlights each boss fight, making each an assault on the senses and emotions (and the emotional depth of the soundtrack itself is stunning).  And don&#8217;t worry, the classic finale aria is beautiful and thoroughly composed with a purpose.  Mr. Motoi Sakruaba, take a bow.Lasting Appeal &#8211; 10Unlike previous Souls games, once the credits roll there is still more to do.  An altered new game plus allows people to continue to explore past the credits which is excellent for those who want to continue their adventure and clear optional areas.  The game does have the classic new game plus, though, in which you do less damage while enemies do more.  There are multiple new challenges that await players in new game plus, all of which require new tactics and skills.  Aside from that, players can re-spec their characters to try different builds, join and work through multiple covenants, beat optional bosses and work your way through PvP.  Dark Souls 2 offers a lot to do post-credits.Final Score - 10/10Dark Souls 2 took me just about 52 hours to complete (final time - 51:50) and I died 245 times.  Oddly enough, though, every minute within this world was incredible.  Drangleic is a gorgeous and oddly inviting world to explore, and your adventure will take you to the far corners of this hostile place, fighting off monsters and battling players along the way.  It was an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game, and most of all it felt incredibly fair the entire way through.  It is not only one of the best games I have ever played, but it gives reasons for video games to exist.  Only in video games can you receive the same sense of exploration and discovery that Dark Souls 2 offers, and that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s such a grand masterpiece and a testament to video games as a medium.(average = 9.8, rounding to 10 based on 20 point scale)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

It turns out that, so far, this is the most fun I've had playing a game this year. I currently about 10 hours in playing it and have just found some guns. Yes, it does take a bit of time to acquire guns and ammo is somewhat scarce, but this adds a whole new element that melee doesn't. It took me about 2 or 3 hours to get used to the controls and menus and such. Select pulls up your map. Up on the D-pad pulls up your inventory. There is a bit of experimenting to be done with Dead Island before it becomes second nature as the instruction manual is very lackluster and there are no in-game tutorials. But don't let that detract you from this superb zombie game!The graphics looks amazing on my 47\" LED TV. The music is quite diverse and fits the mood of the game perfectly. You can play as one of 4 players, but choose wisely because each one has a different skill path they can embark upon. Let me also say this: This is a MAMMOTH of a game as far as length is concerned. By the time you go through the main campaign and all of the side quests I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it ended up being a 30 hour affair! Fine by me! The more the merrier.To me, what really stands out with this game is how fun and addicting it is. Once you get going and figure out the basics, putting down the controller is the equivalent of a crack addict going cold turkey. I couldn't stand waiting for my copy from Amazon to come via UPS today, so I went to GameStop at midnight last night, got it, then went brain dead(pun intended) for 6 hours straight, slept for about 3 hours and played another 4 more. I'll lose return shipping sending it back, but it'll be worth it knowing I've already gotten to play a large chunk of the game. Needless to say, I had to take a break from my 2nd assault on Banoi Island because my eyes were/are still burning. But what amazing fun the game is and I'm sure will continue to be! There are certain times where you have to use your brain to get out of hairy situations and it will get your pulse racing. The fall onslaught of games is upon us and Dead Island starts off the assault with a BANG!I wouldn't be a bit surprised if this ends up being a sleeper hit, since the developer(Deep Silver?) is not well known and they did have a huge budget with which to promote the game. What they achieved with the limited resources they had is nothing short of amazing. Go buy this now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

I first saw it probably three years ago in a gaming magazine and it grabbed my interest then.  The final product has changed some, but I have to say I love where they have gone with it.Like some I was worried about the graphics prior to playing the game.  Now that I've played it though I think they match the atmosphere of the game and I love them.  They lend another dimension to the atmosphere of the game and this game has a lot of atmosphere.  It really is a game that focuses on the fun, with lots of humor sprinkled in, tons of guns with big explosions and enemies that explode beautifully and run around yelling curses at you.  True to the advertising there are thousands and thousands of guns here.The game plays like a first person shooter with a hint of RPG elements thrown in.  There is loot to pickup but it is all money, guns or ammo.  And that is fine because you won't want to spend all your time looting when it is so fun to shoot.  There are 4 classes to pick from, but aside from having a unique action skill their customization doesn't add any additional abilities and they can all use all of the guns you come across (the skill points you spend are focused on adding damage to certain gun types or boosting your ability to take certain types of damage).  This lets you pick the character you want to play and still play them your way.  Want to snipe with the big guy, go for it.  Want to blow things away with the Siren.  You can.  I wish there were more diversity in the skills you can upgrade, but I can understand why they kept it simple.  Don't fix what already works so well.Like all first person shooters this one can get a little monotonous at times, but I have to admit they have done an excellent job keeping you interested.  You won't find a lot of different enemy models, but the enemies will behave differently and use different weapons and attacks on you, and there is a lot of diversity in how, and with what weapons, you go about gunning them down.  The gunning is just so dang enjoyable that I can shoot bandits for hours without getting bored.  The use of elemental damage (either from your guns, your skill points, or from barrels found sprinkled around the enviroment) is done well and used a lot.  If you find yourself struggling on a hard boss look for a barrel of corrosive poison or combustible fuel to blow up, or equip a shocking or exploding weapon and go to town.While the single-player is loads of fun the co-op is even better.  You can group with up to 4 friends, and when you join a game you have the choice of using a default character or importing one of your own saved game characters.  If you use your own then the loot and experience is saved.  And the game also allows you to play any character you want, so if you all want to be Brick you can.  While grouped like this the enemies will scale up in strength and difficulty and drop better loot to keep things challenging and rewarding.  My only complaint with the mutliplayer is that you can't play split screen on your xbox and still join a game over xbox live with your friends.  I don't know why they don't let you do that, but I can live with it.  But it would have been fun because my wife plays split screen with me, but can't join me when I play with my other friends.  Boo!My final verdict for Borderlands is 5 stars, and I rarely give a game 5 stars.  If you are thinking about getting it I say get it.  This game is great fun and even after you think you are done with it, it is fun to pick it back up and just go gun down some more bandits or skaggs.  Boom! Exploding headshots!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

The return!","reviewText":"(NOTE: I'm actually giving this game 4.5 out of 5 stars, not just 4)PLUS:-RiderNet is a godsend, even if it has already been done before-Great soundtrack as usual-Spectacular tricks and combo based gameplay-Control schemes are well implemented, even offering a \"classic\" control schemeMINUS:-The spirit of the characters seems to have been lost from previous installments-Campaign mode isn't really engaging-Some mountains are a little TOO treacherous resulting in what feels like repeated cheap deathsIf you generally get a kick out of targeting your buddies best scores in any leaderboard based games or you lose sleep when someone has knocked you off of your high score perch and taking them down becomes the order of the day, then you will absolutely adore SSX.The RiderNet setup is the absolute draw here, make no bones about it. I cannot praise this new feature enough. I've never played \"Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit\" but it's my understanding that the Autolog setup in that game works just like the RiderNet system does in SSX, by providing you with real time updates on who's doing what in the SSX world. In short, RiderNet makes this game feel alive. I guarantee that SSX will help create plenty of intense rivalries for those who immerse themselves deep enough in the game, thanks to RiderNet's absolutely awesome interface. I'm aware that I'm gushing maybe a little too rabidly about it but believe me, the recently released demo barely skims the surface of what RiderNet entails. There are a lot of races and trick runs to get to the top of here and RiderNet does a phenomenal job of keeping you up to speed in regards to not only how you're holding up but also how your friends are faring on those very same courses. I found it very easy to plot what it was that I wanted to involve myself in and which course records to shoot for next. Ghosts are automatically uploaded and downloaded and while there's no real time multiplayer involved, you're still getting the best of the experience by racing directly against the ghosts of other players doing their best runs. I'm loving what I'm seeing here in terms of early community interaction and judging from the scores and times already posted, it looks like I've got my work cut out for me on my way to the top of the boards. I really want to see more involved leaderboard systems like this in other games and genres, it's absolutely great and the best thing about the game, hands down.I love the soundtrack and while it's a bit different from what I was expecting, there are a lot of great songs here that I'm sure anyone will enjoy. I found myself using Shazam a couple of times when I missed the artist and track title info, so that should count for something regarding the quality of the song selection. You can listen to your own music as well and the best part about that is that the game messes with the audio of the tracks just like it does with the in-game music, providing a seamless listening experience similar to what the game already gives you.Using the right analog stick to perform tricks takes some getting used to and I'm not going to lie when I say that it's a lot to take in. The trick lies in getting used to the rhythm of the game. The game practically uses several different control schemes depending on whether you're on the ice or in the air and when you're careening down a mountain side and you're in the thick of a crazed trick busting, combo racking run, don't be surprised if you can't mentally process what your hands are doing of their own accord. I'm not knocking this because ever since the first game, this has been par for the course. It's all part of what makes SSX what it is. Like I mentioned above, you can play with a \"classic\" control scheme but I like the revamped style enough to stick with it.On the negative side, I really didn't care for the campaign or story mode, if you even want to call it that. It's an admittedly thin plot that uses varying styles to push the story forward. I loved how the characters were bigger than life in the previous games but here, they've basically been whittled down to selectable characters. Most of them are still here but I miss the outrageousness and trash talk from SSX 3 and SSX Tricky. They've lost their mojo but they still bust out some of the most insane snowboarding tricks you'll ever see, so it's not so painful of a loss. Another slight issue I had with the game was that on several of these mountains, I was dying simply way too much. This was never really an issue in the other games but here, it happens a little more frequently than I would've liked and it kind of stops the momentum of the game every time you go flying off of a mountain and have to start all over. I found the Deadly Descent runs great on some sides and uninteresting on others.I think the wingsuit feature leaves a bit to be desired also but hey, you can't fault the developers for trying something new. Thankfully, you don't use it all that much. Same goes for the rewind feature, which is really only useful for placing `geotags' throughout the world. The geotags themselves are a great and really cool idea (think of them as easter eggs that you leave behind for anyone else to pick up and the longer it takes for anyone to find them, the more in-game currency you receive; it's another great form of trash talking that the game provides) but since the clock keeps running while you're rewinding, there's really no use for it if you're on a serious run.Is this the game SSX fans have been waiting for, for so long? Well, I suspect a lot of fans are going to have gripes with a lot of what I've mentioned and more but you can color this fan impressed. It's not perfect and could use a little more tinkering but this will definitely be my go-to game for when I'm not in the mood to sink a whole day into Skyrim or something else equally as time consuming. Truth be told, the hours melted away on me yesterday when I was posting up as many trick runs as I could before I went to sleep. Regardless of what you may think of the campaign mode, RiderNet will keep you coming back for more and is in my opinion, worth the cost of admission to the mountains of SSX alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

For the small minority of folks who don't fall into that category, I'll get to the point quickly--I doubt that you will be disappointed if you buy this game.  That's the long and the short of it, if you want to cut straight to the point.  I, however, would like to linger on some of the finer points of this title if I may.  I'm giving the game five stars, but it's not a strong five--this title, like every single Final Fantasy game to date, has some pretty large problems that need to be addressed before the release of Final Fantasy XII.The Final Fantasy series is a long one, and it's safe to say that every game to date has been a substantial improvement over the one that preceeded it.  This is certainly true in the technical sense, and continues to be true with the newest installment.  This game is pretty.  The world is probably the most imaginative that Square has generated in recent years.  The FMV sequences are well done, if a little sparsely distributed throughout the game.  As a strictly visual experience, Final Fantasy X probably can't be surpassed by any other title available for the Playstation2.Role playing games, however, are not all about appearance.  While this game is marvelously balanced, with a combat system that finally allows you to economically keep all of your characters in the game, the game's story suffers from a couple of critical flaws.  For one thing, it's massively, overwhelmingly depressing.  The theme of Final Fantasy IX was somewhere in the neighborhood of mortality, and it appears that the good folks at Square decided to take the next logical step into the realm of death.  Unfortunately, that's not a particularly jolly subject to discuss (a fact which makes the characterization of Tidus all the more difficult to understand).  Death is all over the place in this game, and after a certain point, it starts to wear on you.  There's little in the way of (deliberate) humor, as well--I can only watch Wakka take a pratfall so many times before it becomes blase.  In short, this thing's story is pretty heavy, and the designers didn't do anything at all to try and lighten the load for the player.What's more, Square, in typical Square fashion, has once again managed to screw up another ending.  The formula for Final Fantasy is becoming clear--the first thing that you can assume going in is that you will not have heard of the being you defeat to win the game until the last hour and a half of play.  While this game isn't as bad as, say, Final Fantasy IX (I STILL don't know who Necron was) in that regard, it's still got problems.  The ending is sure to leave more than a few loyal gamers disappointed, and any objective evaluation would have to call it a failure.  Endings, after all, are supposed to resolve things, and nobody really changes much after this game's plot runs out.I should make clear, however, that these are simply blemishes on the face of an overall excellent game.  If you want them to, they can detract from the fun, but most of them can be easily ignored.  On the whole, this game is undoubtedly one of, if not the best in the series, and certainly one of the best for the platform.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"A great game, dont listen to the haters!","reviewText":"I thought that some of the game was a fault.  The voices could be sappy and the story could make too little sense at times. Example, the encounter with sin early in the game and then people are in caskets and yuna does a sending like 60 seconds after the attack. By this time I expected people to be finding dead bodies..... in other words the time frame was a little off. atleast I feel that way about it. But on the good side it made me feel good because i could sympathize with the characters, the only other thing i didnt like was Seymour. His story was given away far to soon in the game. 3 stars for what it is, 5 stars if X-2 where factored in and you got it all in one game, also get rid of  the crappy voices and confusing  time line.I dont want to sound like a hater because i finished this game 3 times, and so found it enjoyable and found its faults easily.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"M. B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"The best in the series, and one of my favorite PSX games","reviewText":"Resident Evil 2: Greatest Hits (2000). The re-release of the 1998 blockbuster sequel to Capcom's survival horror series.When the Playstation first started out, one of the first games to put the system on the map was Capcom's first foray into survival horror games, Resident Evil. Aside from the earlier series Alone In The Dark, Resident Evil was the first game of its kind to really bring the survival horror genre to life, complete with various puzzles and zombie blasting action. Since RE1 managed to build up a solid fanbase, Capcom was soon called to make a sequel the following year. Initially, they had 60% of the game completed and it was supposed to be released in early 97, but the creators weren't satisfied with the way it was going, saying that &quot;it needed a huge overhaul&quot;. So the original plans were scrapped, forcing the fans to wait longer. But come early 1998, the wait was well worth it when Capcom unleashed the new and improved sequel, THE must-own PSX game of 98.RE2 was the first title in the series I played, and from the get-go, I was hooked. When I say that it's the best RE title to date, I'm not joking, as just about everything from the first game went through a MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT. I'm very glad that Capcom ditched their original plans so that a better sequel could be made. Now I'm not trying to turn this review into just gushing praise, but honestly there's so much to like about this game that beats out the original.For starters, the graphics are VASTLY superior to the first-generation visuals of the previous game. The character models are much more detailed, the still-screen environments are more vibrant (but dark and pale enough to convey the game's atmosphere), and the crappy B-movie quality intro of the original is gone in place of excellent CG movies. The characters and monsters, while still somewhat blocky, are all brought to life much better now with numerous animations, such as head tracking, and physical gestures during cutscenes. Also, when your character takes damage, you can now tell how hurt they are by the way they walk. If they hold onto their side and limp on one foot, you know that they're close to death. In addition, the newer game engine allows many more creatures to be in the area at one time, like when you stumble into a room with 7 zombies.Secondly, the sound is brought more into the front this time, with howls and screams of the monsters standing out more so than in the last game. It's especially noteworthy when something suddenly jumps through glass or breaks a wall. When this happens, you'll definitely jump out of your seat. As far as scares go, it'll certainly keep you on the edge until the end. Same thing with the musical score. Compared to the last game, the music is quite a bit more chilling and it seems to know just when something will come out after you. And most importantly, the voice acting is thankfully much better this time around. It's not perfect, but the dialogue and characters are very believable. For instance, Leon's character shows real determination, Claire is quite sympathetic yet assertive, and Chief Irons comes off as just plain creepy. These traits help distinguish the characters.The story is also brought out very well. Just a few months after the events in the first game, Raccoon City is overtaken by the T-Virus, and nearly every citizen has been turned into a zombie. Two outsiders, a rookie cop named Leon Kennedy, and Chris Redfield's (from the first game) younger sister Claire, wander into the monster infested city. The two get split up from one another only to end up in the police station. They soon find more characters and monsters to contend with, and discover the deep secrets of the Umbrella Corporation as the game goes on.The controls for the most part remain the same as in the first game, as do the menu options. You still have to backtrack often to &quot;item boxes&quot; to store items you can't hold in your limited inventory menu. This grows tedious, but oh well. I did find that the controls are a bit more responsive this time around. The characters have plenty of differentiation in gameplay, such as how Leon starts with the lighter, whereas Claire can open locks. Plus, both feature different weapon arsenals, so there are plenty of guns.Perhaps the best aspect of the game is the alternate scenario options introduced for the first time. What this means is that if you started and beat the game as Leon, you then play through the same story through Claire's perspective, and vice versa. The alternate scenario takes place in most of the same areas as the first time, but this time you have to contend with the menacing 7-foot, trenchcoat wearing Neo Tyrant. The idea is that he's constantly stalking you and could appear at any time (this idea was perfected with the Nemesis in RE3). The scenario features might make the game feel shorter than the original, but technically you'd be beating the game 4 times to see all the different endings. There's also a few cool mini games and sidequests to unlock, so you've got plenty of replayability here.About the only bad thing I can say about RE2 was the fact that the puzzles were a lot more simple and not very challenging compared to the others in the series. It's a minor flaw though and doesn't take much away from the game.Overall, RE2 is an excellent addition to the series, and expands the original game to new heights. Since it's available on multiple platforms now, it's very easy to come across. NEW FANS SHOULD START HERE, OR ALSO THE GAMECUBE REMAKE, THEN MOVE ONTO THE OTHERS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2004"}

Set between the events ofSuper MetroidandMetroid Fusion, the game features unprecedented access to the backstory, thoughts and in-game interactions of the usually closed off heroine of the series, Samus Aran. Developed jointly by Nintendo and the celebrated Japanese development studio, Team Ninja, the game also features exciting play options, including the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, pointer and sideways Wii Remote controller orientation, stunning in-game cinematics and a classic blend of Metroid action and puzzle-solving gameplay..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Metroid: Other M","reviewText":"Metroid: Other M (Wii)When Metroid: Other M was announced at E3 '09, it caused some confusion. Team Ninja, most well known for their Ninja Gaiden series, were teaming up with Nintendo to bring us Other M. The trailer rocked our world, but can this achieve the same success as the Prime series when Retro took control?The story is a huge part of Other M, and when I say huge, I mean it. It begins where Super Metroid finished, with Samus finishing off Mother Brain, and the baby Metroid sacrificing itself to save Samus. Samus, after leaving the Galactic Federation, then receives a signal from a lone bottle ship in space, and decides to investigate. There, she meets up with former commanded Adam Malkovich and his team, and they continue the investigation together. The whole story is told between flashbacks and real life sequences in the ship. It delves into Samus's backstory with Adam as part of the Galactic Federation when she was very young, and explores her relationship with Adam as a father figure. These are all told in very elaborate CGI-cutscenes, and these look sharp, especially on Wii. Voice acting was a bold move to place into a Metroid game, but sadly, it wasn't the right choice. Samus's voice actress sounds like something from a daytime soap opera, and her boring, expressionless tone leads us to believe that she is nothing but there, and leads to some awkward dialogue. As for the rest of the voice acting with the Galactic Federation, it's top-notch.The gameplay in Other M revolves around third person action mixed in with first person shooting. The game is played holding the Wiimote sideways, and with a 90 degree turn of the Wiimote, it switches Samus into first person mode, allowing her to scan and investigate the environment, as well as shoot missiles. As you investigate the bottle ship, you'll come across hundreds of creatures that can be disposed with Samus's blaster, and a strange auto-aim feature allows for precise accuracy. Of course, Samus's ball-form is back and better than ever thanks to some clever puzzles surrounding it. New to Samus's arsenal is her ability to take out downed enemies using swift melee moves, and these are a treat to watch, especially in mid-boss battles. Samus isn't using her huge weapons and her full abilities unless being authorized by Adam, her commander. There's lots of reason to come back, with hidden doors and passages that can only be explored once you have a certain item.The graphics in Metroid: Other M are beautiful. Environments blend perfectly with mixes of long hallways in addition to breathtaking deserts and ice worlds. The characters look slick, as well. The sound in the game is hardly not there, with just environmental tones and heightening sound effects when an enemy is near.Metroid: Other M is a great return to the Metroid series. Although not as drastic a change as when Retro took over earlier, Team Ninja did the series justice, thanks to a great story and great gameplay.Pros:Great StoryMix of First and Third person gameplayBeautiful graphicsCons:Voice ActingMusic","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0F5I2","reviewerName":"A. Benoit","summary":"Even better than the first","reviewText":"I got Uncharted and Uncharted 2 in a PS3 console bundle, and once I finished Uncharted 1, I was so glad I had Uncharted 2 right there because I loved the first game. The second game was even better than the first. I loved the story, the new characters, the return of old characters, all of it. I really liked some of the changes made to game mechanics as well.Weapons - I liked the expanded variety of weapons. The addition of sniper rifles, sub machine guns, rocket launchers, even crossbows, all with different damage-causing capabilities helped add variety to the shooting experience. I liked the blind firing option as well. Grenades were infinitely easier to use in this game. I never did figure out grenades in the first game.Stealth/Fighting - Stealth tactics were a great addition to this game. I'm a big fan of the Splinter Cell game series, so adding stealth to this game was right up my alley. Being able to sneak up on enemies from behind to subdue them or to yank or push them over the edge of a cliff or ledge added a different challenge to the game than just working on your aim in a firefight. I also thought the hand to hand combat was well done. It wasn't just button mashing but actually required you to pay attention and put some thought into it. There were a couple times when I just barreled through a group of enemies and relied on hand to hand over shooting because it was faster.Climbing - The climbing mechanics were also improved. Not only was the climbing more intuitive, it utilized the environment more. There were ropes, bars to swing from, street signs to climb on, giant moving gears to navigate. The creativity behind the way characters interacted with the environment was excellent.Art - The art and animation was really spectacular. The environments were beautifully rendered, the movements of characters had a realism to them. The depth and texture to everything was spectacular.Story & Characters - One of the great things about a game series is when the creators are able to keep the old characters and mesh in new ones. I was really glad to see Sully and Elena again, but I also liked the addition of Chloe and the other new characters. I enjoyed the way all the characters played off each other, even when Nate was stuck dealing with the language barrier between his Tibetan guide, Tenzin. The overall story was exciting and kept me wanting to know what would happen next, which is obviously good because it kept me playing.Overall Gameplay - The difficulty options are Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Crushing (which is locked, I'm assuming until you beat the game on Hard). Very Easy gives you assisted aiming. Since I did okay aiming in the first game without this, I played on Easy. It was still fairly challenging. I think my only \"gripe\" I might have is that the final boss battle actually seemed a little too simple to me. I only died twice and one of those times was because of careless jumping on my part, not because the boss killed me. The rest of the game seemed more challenging in comparison.Like the first game, I feel this game definitely has strong replay value, and I look forward to playing Uncharted 3. I only wonder how they could possibly improve on the game any further.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000A0EFHY","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"King Kong (PS2)","reviewText":"Nothing can follow The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Peter Jackson will continue to make great movies, but for many of us, The Lord of The Rings will always be King.This Christmas he will release his first film since the Rings conclusion - King Kong. Early clips and teaser trailers sent our anticipation meter through the roof. We could only dream about the intense battles that await Kong and his most lethal adversary, T-Rex. Or will his most lethal adversary turn out to be man?With the whole world stoked the return of King Kong, we knew it wouldn't be long before a video game was announced. Then Ubisoft made it official - Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of The Movie was born.Whereas most games cast you as a powerful hero, King Kong casts you as the quiet screenwriter Jack Driscoll. Jack doesn't say much, partially because he isn't given the chance since director Carl Denham won't shut up. Carl is the island-obsessed filmmaker who brings everyone there in the first place. No doubt you'll notice how much he looks like the actor who plays him in the film, Jack Black. Every time something happens he pulls out his camera and starts rolling. Life? Death? Who cares about those things when you could be filming a real-life phenomenon. At least that's how he looks at it.Playing as a screenwriter and not a superhero means sacrificing many of the things we're used to having in a game. There's no jumping, running leaves you breathless (in sound effect only), and the magical crosshairs that appear in every FPS are nowhere to be found. This is a game of survival. Ammo is not unlimited, and you can forget what a health bar looks like because it's not a part of the experience either. The game defaults to a widescreen view designed for the 4/3 aspect ratio TVs, reinforcing the idea that you're interacting with a movie. (The picture may be changed to 16/9 got widescreen TVs or normal 4/3 for viewing on a standard TV without the black bars.)The controls are a bit dull at first. Movement is typical for an FPS with two exceptions: the gameplay is really slow and you have to hold down the L2 button to draw your weapon. It's not like Resident Evil; you can move when it's drawn. But there was never a point in the game where this seemed necessary. Granted, it didn't harm the experience, I just don't think it was necessary to fool with a standard feature.The slow character movement, although annoying at times, separates this from other first-person shooters. King Kong is primarily an adventure game with an easy-to-follow path and puzzles that anyone can figure out. Combat ensues everywhere, with giant bugs (crabs, spiders, millipedes, etc.) and prehistoric creatures (raptors, brontosaurus, etc., in addition to our favorite, T-Rex) interfere every chance they get. Winning isn't always easy. Unannounced checkpoints are everywhere, softening the blow of unexpected deaths.T-Rex loves a good midday snack. When he decides to bite into Jack, his teeth cut into the screen as the color fades to red. Defending yourself against such a beast means clever avoidance. Utilize the confusion of pillars by running in between them. Take advantage of caves and any structures with a roof. Attack a few seconds before he strikes; if you wait until his mouth is wide open (as you would in most games), chances are it's too late.Ammo is limited but re-fills can usually be found when it is most needed. Since there isn't an on-screen icon to tell you how much ammo you have left, you have to check it by pressing the circle button. Jack will then tell announce how much is left (the number of magazines or bullets), and will assure you that you have plenty if your ammo is full.Bones play a big role in solving the game's puzzles. They're as effective as spears but may be lit to burn bushes and dinosaurs that won't go away. These bushes are thick and cannot be crossed by foot unless you're King Kong. That's how the game regulates where you go and when, and how it prevents you from going past the end of an area where nothing exists.I lost track, but on at least six occasions a lever or two needed to be found in order to open a door. These levers were to be jammed into two pillars; turning them pulls the door up high enough for you to go through it.These puzzles are repeated several times and do not pose a threat for hardcore players. Casual gamers shouldn't be deterred by them either. After all, that's who they were designed for.Every now and then (which isn't nearly long enough) you'll get the chance to play as the character everyone's dying to control: Kong. Kong is an enormous, beautifully designed beast, though it's hard to tell at times with the camera being pulled back so far. This was done to make the action visible from multiple angles. Dinosaurs, including multiple T-Rexes, attack from all sides. This isn't like the beat-'em-ups of yesterday; nobody waits their turn. All dinos have the option to attack simultaneously. Whether or not they do depends on how quick you are at taking care of the problem.My first viewing of the King Kong movie trailer gave me high hopes for dino-throwing and dino-baseball. I still have no clue as to whether or not they've given Kong that much power in the movie, but I can now confirm that he has that much power and more in the game. Pick up a dino and carry it around for a little torture or throw it at the others for a painful, potentially deadly hit.Kong's controls are simple but big and bold. Three buttons (X, square and circle) control pretty much everything you need. The square button is all your all-access pass to swinging, jumping, and climbing on walls. Jumping is limited to ledges and other areas where a jump seems necessary. Attack with the X button, and grab your enemies (and Ann, Kong's true love) with the circle button.This style keeps the game moving forward, which is clearly the intent. Kong's missions are shorter, faster, and more intense. Tapping the triangle button repeatedly makes Kong beat his chest. If he's allowed to do that for a long enough period of time (that is, if no one attacks), he'll go into a rage mode that makes him move faster and hit even harder. Once again this causes a color change, this time to a golden hue that brightens the whites and highlights the screen with beautiful lighting.King Kong does a lot of cool things with color use, a technique that up until recently has been reserved for movies. Keen-eyed gamers will notice the extensive use of green, blue and gray, in addition to the aforementioned colors, red and gold. These colors are enhanced by amazing lighting effects, and in the case of the brontosaurus, some of the most realistic textures I've ever seen. I say this based on my vision of dinosaurs from Jurassic Park. Isn't that how everyone bases their opinion of what a realistic dinosaur should look like?The smaller dinos don't look so good, which is pretty surprising when you consider all the time and effort put into the game as a whole. There isn't much of an explanation for why Ann's polygon model doesn't look like Naomi Watts either. I also must point out that while the lighting and color use are spectacular, and King Kong himself is very detailed, the overall look of the backgrounds is disappointing. The flames from burning bushes appear to be a flat, digitized image that's been cloned multiple times (as opposed to a true 3D effect that and/or one that moves in real-time).Players will notice the visual flaws within the first 15 minutes. By the 30th minute they'll wonder where the game is going and if it's ever going to pick up the pace. King Kong might be an action flick, but this certainly isn't an action game. It's a slower-paced adventure that was made for every man and woman interested in the film. It's got a lot going for it and a lot that, while I wouldn't say it's necessarily bad, doesn't work perfectly in this kind of game. Michel Ancel, one of the designers behind the project, is known for experimenting with unique concepts. His previous creations include the Rayman series and the unforgettable Beyond Good & Evil. In many ways King Kong is a derivative of those games. Expect to be engrossed; don't expect to be blown away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2006"}

The whole Revenge Solves Everything certainly made a good appearance. However, I have seen so many games get hyped up by commercial advertizing that it raises the gamer's expectations so high that the game could never reach them. I got the game on sale, played it, and my final thought is this: AWESOME!!!!For those of you wondering what this game is like, it is a mix between Deus Ex HR and Assassin's Creed, with Deus Ex style of play with Assassin's Creed ways of dealing with your targets. It is a fun fact that one guy on the dev team for this game was actually on Deus Ex HR's dev team, so it takes a great amount of influence from that style. You are simply given a target, a generaly direction, and a wide array of gear and magic. Then the game says \"do it your way\". Many games have emphasized the point of free choice, but Dishonored does a fantastic job at it. There is no right way, though some may be more favorable than others, and even that is relative.The story is simple, which fits well for the game. The Empress is assassinated and you are working with a group of loyalists to take down the ones responsible. That's basically it. The simple story saves plenty on the confusion that complex stories might make. Though Dishonored's story is simple, it does have depth, as long is the player is willing to look into it. There might be books lying around, or certain characters telling stories, plenty of ways to get more in depth on the tale.As mentioned before, the freedom of choice is a great addition. The suitable range of gear is great as well, suting many different playstyles. Also, you are given the use of magic, which can allow you to teleport, use X-Ray and objective vision, or even possess rats or people so you can weave your way past a heavily guarded area. The game is very rubbery in terms of gameplay style; you can mold it to be more focused on stealth, or you can make it just a \"barge in with a knife and kill those who stand in the way\" type. The possibilities are abundant.The only sad things are the shortness of the game and the lack of a New Game+. The game consists of 9 missions only. The actually length comes from more playthroughs trying different styles of play than from the last. The lack of a New Game+ is understandable in this manner: you unlock magic powers through acquiring runes. However, the game doesn't give enough runes to fully fill your array of powers, so you may go through the game without being able to use one. This creates the idea of using that power in the next play through, opening new options and a slightly different challenge. So the lack of a New Game+ is fine, but I would have really liked to continue on with the story.One gripe that I have is the NPC dialogue. I am a stealth driven player unless spotted, but when I am skulking about, I hear different dialogue from NPCs Most of them consist of grumbling to themselves or coughing and the such. After listening to it, I got a little annoyed by it.I own this game on a pc, and the game is very adaptive for your operations system. Even at a low graphics level, the game is still visually interesting.In conclusion, Dishonored is a fine piece of work that certainly exceeded my expectations. Although it is short, I look forward to any DLC that may add to the fun. Until then, I will keep possessing people and walking them into a deathtrap...and maybe feed some guards to rats......hey, I said the game gave you options.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2012"}

I wouldn't skip the campaign if you get this game. 8.7/10ZOMBIES:Same as World at War, only with different maps now. I'm not a zombie fan so this held my attention for about 10 minutes. They should have put some spec-ops mode in this game, zombies is just not a good enough replacement because it gets boring fast. Spec ops, on the other hand, was always fun and took about 30 hours to beat the whole thing. 4/10MULTIPLAYER: (I'm going to split this into a few parts)Player match: Same as every other cod game, so this part of the multiplayer portion has gotten quite stale for me. The same recycled CoD formula just doesn't do it. It's either that, or the maps are too dull. But overall you should like this. 7/10Combat Training: This is tons of fun especially if you put the bots on recruit difficulty. It does get boring after a while and after being level 50, there's not much left to do. But if you put it on Veteran it is quite difficult. I'd say hardened is the most balanced difficulty. I would recommend trying this out if you're getting sick of losing on player matches. 8/10Theater Mode: Yes, I'm adding this in because I love it. You can watch old games and edit clips and whatever. Change camera angles, watch it from other player's perspectives, and a bunch of other stuff. I just can't figure out how to make it slow motion when recording. 9.5/10Wager Matches: This is my favorite. I hate sticks and stones because you always get hit with a tomahawk and then you are put in last place. I hate that game mode so much. Sharpshooter is fun because every game has different weapons. I destroyed everyone on my first match then I kept losing after that. Gun game is good, I won probably 10 out of the 50 matches I played in gun game. It's fun until you are in 6th place for like 10 games in a row. And finally, one in the chamber is the best of them all. You get one bullet and three lives, and you get a life for every knife and/or kill with a bullet. I would check that mode out. It's especially fun if you have a friend over and play it split screen so you can work together and screen-cheat when one of you gets out. 9/10Overall, I would buy this game.Wow that review was a lot longer than I thought.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2010"}

Let's all come to terms with the truth. Call of Duty gets worse every year, it's the same garbage forced down our throats, and I refuse to ever buy one again. HOWEVER, the thing about Black Ops that sets it aside from Modern Crapfare series, is the addition of the Zombies mode. Zombies itself is worth buying this game for. If you have friends to play with, it never gets boring.Some people do like the multiplayer formula (online), and I will admit I was one of them. But CoD is just nothing new. It's boring. I can't recommend anyone to pick up this game for the multiplayer aspect, but if you love zombies this game is more than worth it. Also, even though I dislike the multiplayer portions anyway, the online in Black Ops is better than Modern Warfare 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2012"}
