Son","summary":"Revolutionary in some areas and a step back in others","reviewText":"If you're the type to skip through cutscenes and don't care about having a purpose to what you're doing in a game, don't bother reading any further and don't bother playing this game. L.A. Noire is a captivating drama with intriguing plots and amazing characterization. L.A. Noire used real actors to play the parts of every character in the game including all of their facial animations. The results are absolutely amazing and bring a lifelike appearance never before seen in any video game. This feature serves a big purpose as you will be interrogating many suspects throughout this lengthy adventure. You will play as the ambitious detective, Cole Phelps, who is hard set on doing the right thing, preserving life, and serving swift justice to any criminals in his path. Facial animations aren't the only thing revolutionary about L.A. Noire. L.A. Noire is extremely well-written. The plot is very captivating but the characters are what's really impressive. Phelps' character is exceptionally deep for a video game. I've never seen a character I've disliked so much and yet couldn't help from loving at the same. Phelps is a great guy on many levels and at the same time, most will disagree with his views on many things. Although his intentions are usually good, he's not always doing it for the right reasons. This is what makes Phelps real and what brings L.A. Noire its amazing humanity.As amazing as L.A. Noire is, it isn't without flaws. The shooting can be frustrating sometimes. Trying to take cover can be tricky and targeting criminals doesn't always work the way you want it to. Driving around is even worse. Chase scenes can be down right irritating because many buildings have little parts sticking out and if you clip one of these, it will stop you dead in your tracks. It's also stupid that I'm hitting things like gates and wooden fences that bring my car to a complete halt. It certainly takes some realism out of the game. The next part may ruin the experience of L.A. Noire for you but it needs to be mentioned. Don't read this next part if you want your experience to be better. L.A. Noire does a great job making you think that you're having an impact on investigations and the overall plot. This, however, is just a big ruse. Your decisions and interrogations have very little difference on the outcome of the case or the overarching story. This is my biggest complaint about L.A. Noire. I don't mind playing a game \"on rails\" because it allows for excellent stories such as this one, but I need to feel like my actions have consequences. Especially for a game that doesn't have a lot of action-oriented gameplay. As you play through the game you'll start to realize your decisions don't matter and if you decide to replay a case you'll definitely figure it out.CONCLUSION: L.A. Noire is a wonderful experience. It just needs some gameplay tweaking.PROS:- Revolutionary animating of real actors. You've never seen anything like it.- Exceptional scriptwriting/storyline- The characters are absolutely ground-breaking for a video game- Searching for clues and interrogating suspects is a lot of funCONS:- Driving around can be frustrating- The cover mechanics in shootouts can be irritating- Something I mentioned above that can tarnish the experience","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Castle \"Oregon writer\"","summary":"Amazing historical adventure inspired my sons to read Treasure Island","reviewText":"My young Jim Hawkins loves Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. However, be fair warned as the game is an adult-oriented historical adventure with close combat, mature themes, and some of the spicy language you'd expect from pirates. While the main character, Edward Kenway, is no more a role model than Long John Silver, he is a fascinating, richly-written character who interacts with and fits quite well alongside historical figures such as Blackbeard and Anne Bonny.Of all the Xbox 360 games my sons have helped me review,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flagis the first one that led them to want to read more. With the game set in the early 1700s and much of the gameplay focused on sea-based exploration, my sons asked for a copy of Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Treasure Island,\" considered by many the greatest children's adventure story of all time.With no prior experience with the Assassin's Creed game series, my 11-year old son was quickly able to master the controls. He was enthralled with the open world `sandbox' that allowed him to search for treasure, explore 50 unique locations from Kingston to Nassau, engage in cannon battles and track down enemies with flintlock pistols and dual cutlass swords.One of his favorite things to do is perch atop one of the highest buildings and slowly rotate 360 degrees to take in the breath-taking landscape.Obviously, this is an adult-oriented game. However, the pirate-themed violence is what you'd expect for the genre, yet without overt gore. The sexual situations are surprisingly PG-rated, again with no gratuitous cut scenes.Rating: Five stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Sibelius","summary":"Best Assassin's Creed game to date","reviewText":"First off kudos to the Ubisoft for setting this game in the early 18th Century which is generally regarded as the high point of the Age of Piracy.  Piracy buffs will appreciate the lavish attention to atmospheric detail found in this game through elements like its geography, locales and historical NPC's such as Blackbeard and Anne Bonny.  Those yearning for a true Pirate experience will certainly satisfy their itch with this engrossing and well paced title that stands up on its own even if you've never played previous titles in the series.Here are some observations on the 360 version in particular:+ I loaded the disc contents to my HD before I started my first play through and loading times seem very reasonable.+ AC4 is graphically the most vibrant of the series mostly due to the color palettes of the lush tropical and oceanic settings.  In terms of detail this title looks great and still manages to impress at times and is on-par with another Ubi title \"Far Cry 3 (360 version)\" in terms of fidelity.+Performance is mostly fine but you will notice drops in frame rate performance during busy action sequences.  Its nothing game breaking really but will be noticeable at times.  Also, there are occasional glitches when fighting and climbing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

The first three installments took us to exotic locations and found great enemies. The last Assassin's creed dealt with America when it was in control of the British. Now this installment deals with a subject that almost everyone loves and that is pirates. But is Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag worthy of your attention or should you make it walk the plank?This installment puts you in the role of Edward Kenway who was once a British Privateer and served king and country. Now he serves his own needs as he turned pirate as he commands a ship looking for treasure. If this name sound familiar you will see a resemblance as this character is a father to Haytham Kenway and grandfather to Ratonhnhak&eacute;:ton which are the playable characters of Assassin's Creed III.The setting of this grand adventure is the Carribbean islands which will include the locations such as: Nassau, Kingston and Havanna. You will not only be explore on land but on the great waves of the ocean both above and below. In this installment you will be able to explore under the sea which will give a new element to gameplay. When you do engage the enemy you will be able to dual wield weapons from blades to flintlock pistols. This will give you the ability to take out multiple targets at the same time. One of the neat thing about this game is they incorporate historical pirates in this game. From Anne Bonny and Calico Jack to the most notorious pirate Edward Teach (AKA Blackbeard) these are some of the pirates you will be able to meet in the game.One of the newest additions in this series is the addition of naval combat. Some of the battles will be taking place on the high seas as you are command of a ship named the Jackdaw. You will need to master the way the sea rolls as the ship pitches firing the cannons in time with the ocean. Your ship can be upgraded as well and you can recruit crew to take on this and other ships (but you cannot send those teams on assassination missions).There is also a modern day equivalent in the story as you will be taking on the role of a modern day pirate. As a hacker you will be able to navigate computer systems and eavesdrop on conversations without engaging in any combat.This is going to be one of the most breathtaking and awesome Assassin's Creed games to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

The older GBA SP's werent back-lit, they were side-lit, which means that light came out from the sides of the screen, and traveled across it's surface. Thus lighting the screen. But these new GBA SP's are actually back-lit, they light up just like a TV!It's so wonderful, and so much brighter than the older ones, about 3x as bright to be exact! Plus, because of how bright the screen is, there's less glare or a reflection of your own face on the screen, (and who likes to look at a reflection of their own face when playing a game?)Anyway, the new Pearl blue and Graphite GBA SP's are amazing and I highly recommend buying one if you've got the money, they're well worth it!Pros:Alot brighter than the older models.It really is back-lit this time.The brighter screen is better for your eyes because you dont have to squint at the screen anymore, and it's better for your neck because now you dont have to lean your body or tilt your head to the side in order to see it clearly.The brighter screen lessens the occurence of glare and annoying reflection interupting game play.Cons:It isnt avalible in as many colors as the older models.Battery life only lasts up to 13 hours when the older models lasted for up to 15 hours.50/50:The back light can't be turned off, and it somewhat puts a drain on the battery.Screen attracts dust, but its easy enough to clean it off so who cares?Screen will glare when placed in the path of direct sun light, but once again, that's not really a problem.Final thoughts:If you're going to buy this then I would highly recommend buying a new game to play with it, it's hard to enjoy it as much when you've got nothing new to try it out with.Written by:ShadowMage (The game maniac)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2005"}

Playing fitness games without them can be frustrating when you are waving your controller frantically trying to get a response, while your character is in a world of their own. However, you can easily get away without the motionplus in other games like Metroid or The Legend of Zelda, but it's still a welcome addition nonetheless.The controller works fine and has given me absolutely no problems so far. If you're considering skipping the motionplus to save some money, my advice is not to do so. Most of the newer games are almost required to have the motionplus and it seems to be a trend that will continue well into the future as long as the Wii console remains viable.Bottom line is that this is a worthwile investment if you need an extra controller for your Wii console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2009"}

I have and still do play MANY racing &#34;sims&#34;. Whether it's on PC, Playstation, or Xbox I've probably played it or still do play it.My focus is on physics, AI and the quality of what I get when it comes to this particular series. Typically PC sims deliver quality tracks, physics, and cars...but not a lot of content up front (thankfully there's a good community to add things). Some console sims deliver a lot of content, but lack in quality physics or AI, while others focus on other things.I'd say while Forza 5 has a bit less content than the last entry, due to a rebuild of the entire game engine and some cars, what they have delivered is incredibly well done. The physics, with all assists off, are incredible. Very few racing games allow you to actually &#34;FEEL&#34; as if you're in control of a real car. You can feel the &#34;edge&#34; in this game. Each car feels unique and realistic. The tracks that are in the game (hopefully we get more son) are very well realized. Feeling the wheel (and seeing it on screen) shake and shudder on certain tracks is right on. Great stuff.When it comes to AI...I'd say I've not raced any better. It almost seems like the AI is getting better as I play too. I don't mean better as in more difficult, but better as in &#34;smarter'. It's a really interesting experience. I initially could take most of the AI with no problem, however, in some of the higher class races the AI is putting up some serious battles...with me and between themselves. Honestly, this is GREAT to see. I've become accustom to AI that breaks too early (even in my recent experience with GT6 this happens at ridiculous times) or that simply seems to follow a line behind each other like they're on a Sunday drive. This seems to be fading away with Forza 5. The AI can act anywhere from sheepish to absolutely daring and suicidal....and no, that's not a bad thing..lol.Anyway, this is an excellent racer through and through. I've completed over 100 races and have only used about half of the cars in my garage. I've got so much money I don't know what to do with it, and can't wait to play through all the classes and events.

{"product_name":"B00004S9AF","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"A Rather Muddled RPG, But Still Capable of Delivering Some Enjoyment","reviewText":"As my title states, Legend of Dragoon can only be described as \"muddled\".  This game has several failings that cannot be ignored, but if you give it a chance, you may still garner some enjoyment out of this average RPG.  On to the review!Graphics (8/10): Not the greatest, but not too irritating.  This, of course, is a matter of opinion, but the graphics did not seem too bothersome at all.Music (6/10): Well, the music ranges from not so good to decent.  There's really nothing about the music that would make me want to buy the soundtrack.  The songs are all rather bland and unmemorable, while not being terrible enough to make your ears bleed or anything.  The voice-acting, which is limited, is kind of laughable.  Overall, the bland music and not-so-good voice acting brings down the score in this section.Characters (5/10): The characters really aren't well-developed.  They either have stereotypical personalities or are just plain uninteresting.  Sometimes their actions were not convincing at all.  For example, one person is traveling with the party to find his daughter who ran away.  He then goes on and on about not knowing why she left when you clearly find out in a flashback that he criticized her and slapped her for something she wasn't really at fault for.  Hmmm...I wonder why she ran away?  And then, after hearing this story, the rest of the party sides with him and does not point out the obvious reason she ran away.  Another example of awkward character development is the romance between Dart and Shana. Yes, she's naive and soft-spoken and he's the big hero and they fall in love.  Yes, we've all seen this before.  That's not even my complaint.  The romance between them was badly handled by the game developers.  It seems as though Shana is the only one in love with Dart; he sees her more as a little sister.  This creates some awkward moments between them.  I think the main romantic scene of the game is very awkward.  Instead of Dart and Shana voluntarily getting together, the rest of the party members sort of connive to force them together at a party.  Then, out on a balcony, every time the scene between them becomes serious and they are about to kiss, some random NPC shows up and ruins the moment.  I find this odd attempt at humor to be ill-placed and intrusive.  I never really got the impression that Dart and Shana loved each other, instead I felt that the rest of the party loved the idea of getting them together.  Rose is the only character who seems interesting and has some back story. Overall, the game is riddled with character interactions like those above, this really makes it difficult to care about these characters (other than Rose!).Story (5/10): Once again, \"stereotypical\" is the word of the day.  Guess who's father may be a villian?  No really, guess!  Seriously, the rest of the story feels like one disjointed event after another.  I never felt a sense of continuity with the story, and the final villian seems to come from nowhere.  I never saw it coming, IN A BAD WAY! I mean, the game really could have used some foreshadowing or building up for the final villian.  All that aside, the game's story does have some high points, the \"mythological\" feel of the game is interesting, and although I can't remember for the life of me what all actually happened during the story, I had fun while playing through it.Battle System (7/10): Well, it's turn based. Not much to say there.  My only real complaint was with the Additions.  While I mostly liked the originality of this element, it was somewhat irritating at times.  The goal is to hit the X button at just the right time to execute your attack.  If you miss even one in the string, your attack does pitiful damage.  As it can be quite difficult to get all of them in a longer string, I was often forced to use weaker Additions instead of the stronger, (and longer) ones.  Aside from that aspect, the Dragoon system was fun.  I only wish there were some way to revert out of Dragoon mode, and also to cast magic outside of Dragoon mode.  Despite my complaints, I found most of the battle system to be not too annoying.Gameplay (6/10): Wow. There's alot of backtracking.  This can get tedious; I think I went through some place three times.  Another issue I have with gameplay is that in disc 2, the game forces you to insert disc 1 again to get into some of the towns.  What nonsense is this?!  I don't think I've ever played another RPG that had this problem.  This is what lowers the score most for this section.  Other than the things listed above, I don't have any other issues with gameplay.Overall (6/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  While Legend of Dragoon does not measure up to so many other RPGs out there, oddly I still enjoyed it.  This is certainly not the worst RPG out there, it's just not the best either.  Since it's so inexpensive now (at the time of writing this; July 2008), it wouldn't hurt to pick this game up and give it a chance.  You may at least get some amusement out of laughing at the bad dialogue.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004S9AF","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"Just not very good.","reviewText":"What a generic title. Given the game, that's par for the course. The Legend of Dragoon is certainly the most generic game I've played on the Playstation. It's sort of sad, in many ways, that it was released by SCEA only months before Chrono Cross and Final Fantasy IX, and over a year after Final Fantasy VIII.What's generic about it? Damn near everything. The main character is a spiky-haired blonde dude whose small village is destroyed by an evil empire, and who is designated the \"chosen one\" by a pendant, previously possessed by a mysterious stranger. Can you even name how many other games that borrows from? Do numbers go that high? And I forgot to mention, his representative color is red. Of course, the empire is still on the prowl, and Dart has to chase them with a diverse group of heroes.And that's not even touching the translation- The Legend of Dragoon boasts some truly embarrassing translation errors. Square learned this lesson after Final Fantasy VII, which took a lot of flack for its stereotypes and writing, but that game had an interesting setting and strong enough characters to make up for it. The Legend of Dragoon wasn't just several years behind, it was at least two games behind by PS1 jRPG standards.While the story is generic and perfunctory, it's not really the problem. Let's talk about the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's basis for combat is a series of timed button presses known as \"additions.\" When one chooses the attack option, a reticle focuses in on the enemy, and a button must be pressed to time with the animation. While this basic idea has been done in other games, like Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VIII, and the Mario and Luigi series, The Legend of Dragoon makes it the core of combat, and that's a fatal error. While timed button presses were integral to the games I mentioned, the important thing is that they didn't slow down the combat. The Legend of Dragoon's combat forces you to do this chain of animations every time you click attack, and when you miss, you get to see your character freeze in place as a number appears only once in front of the enemy. Random encounters, which are the majority of the game in RPGs, take forever and feel clunky. The Dragoon transformations- a flashy sequence comparable to Power Rangers- are also longer than necessary and the Dragoon attacks do little to change my complaints about the rest of the game.The look of the game is very generic as well. While the pre-rendered backgrounds of the game look fine, the character models outside of combat are simplistic and poorly animated. The in-combat look is marginally better, and while the Dragoon transformations look good, the default character models aren't very detailed, and neither are the enemies. The combat environments look especially poor- many of the floors and walls are a single polygon with a blocky texture applied to it.As far as I'm concerned, the great-looking cinematics don't count when we're talking about graphics, though it is worth noting that the ones in The Legend of Dragoon look great. But you might as well jump on youtube and watch all of them instead of playing the game, or rent Advent Children or The Spirits Within, or Shrek for that matter, if that's all you care about. The art design of the game doesn't lend itself to Playstation's technology.I hesitate to speculate on matters like this, but The Legend of Dragoon strikes me as an attempt by Sony to cash in after the success of Final Fantasy VII. The game looks an awful lot like that game, with a fantasy setting substituted for a steam/cyberpunk one. I wouldn't call that an improvement.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2011"}

Compared to today's graphic standards, Resident Evil 2 is a joke with extremley pixalated characters and blood, not to mention the characters mouths dont even move. You really wont be amazed with the graphics at all unless you are looking for some nostalgia like I was.The sound effects and music are still awesome. The guns still sound powerful, and the voice acting (except when Leon screams \"ADA!\" at the end of the game) is still really good. The sounds of zombies moaning, Lickers' claws tapping cement, and the other ghoulish SFX made by the monsters still spook me a bit. The music is interesting to say the least. Sometimes you are given a welcoming, soft tune one minute then turn around to be trapped in a devastating, soul shattering, haunting tune. I love it!To end my review, I really suggest if you haven't played Resident Evil 2 by now then the Gamecube version is perfect for you. To other RE fans, you may just want to rent it to say you played it again... I on the other hand loved this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

The campaign is an awesome ride that you can share with 4 other friends online or 2 player couch co-op. This is the only game in the series that has allowed campaign co-op. I thought after this title was released we would see more Call of Duty games allowing this feature but so far we have not. Playing through a story with a friend or three makes the game so much more enjoyable. Now the game is not any less enjoyable playing by yourself , this is without a doubt the BEST World War 2 game out there. The story is very good and engaging and keeps you wondering what will happen next. This is also a VERY violent game. You might say well \" its a war game \" , well this game takes it to a level no other game has. When you shoot someone , their arms , legs , head ,etc ,etc, might come flying off into a squishy mess , especially when you blow them up with something like a satchel charge or grenadeBesides the campaign there is still after all these years plenty of fun to be had with the multiplayer. For a while the multiplayer was just about unplayable because of all the hackers ( cheaters ) that were in the game , but now it seems they have grown tired of this game and moved on leaving us with an enjoyable experience once again. you will run into a hacker once in a while but it is as simple as exiting the game and starting a new one , fast and simple . There are ALWAYS plenty of people online to find a match. My friends and I poped the game in a few days ago and had a blast for hours with only the occasional ( maybe 2 ) hackers in the game , but like I said before , we backed out of that match and found another quickly and continued to have fun.One other feature of this game that keeps my friends and I comming back to this game are the Nazi Zombies mode. This mode can only be found on the Call Of Duty games that are made by Treyarch ( the Developers of this game ) . I can't tell you how many addictive hours of my life I and my friends have lost to this game and this mode in particular. There were 4 map packs released for this game and in each map pack was a new Zombie map as well. This is a game of survival and you and 3 of your friends can play together to see just how far you can go. This mode takes lots of stratagy on your part as well as your friends. You can play this by yourself but I would advise at least playing with one friend or hooking up with some random people online. .This game is simply one of the best , if you have not played it, I can trully say you are missing out on a great gaming experience.Call of Duty: Black Ops - LTO Edition -Xbox 360Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Xbox 360Call of Duty 3 Platinum Hits -Xbox 360","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}

I understand that this was done for the cinematic thrill but this was better done in Stranglehold.  I do however like the Last Known Postion for the AI as sometimes when you really need to get to point B from point A you may need to cause a disturbance elsewhere to pull the enemy AI away.In an early level, where I found that bursting through a door was a 'good' direct approach, bashing it down, not entering and climbing out an open window paid off a lot more than running and gunning because the distracted enemy concentrated near the door.That's another thing that players should be aware of. This is NOT a run and gun kind of game. If you don't use stealth (and I love that it's not a 'sticky' stealth game like Gears of War) you will find yourself repeating many levels because you tried to Rambo your way through. Moreso you can approach a level so many ways that it's not truly linear.Sometimes, if you are lucky, you can sneak through a level with a minimal body count.Every now and again the hand to hand combat doesn't play right and you have to mash the B button to get it to work but when it does you get a few sequences that get old after time but that is how you also earn your M&E.;Also by performing certain things like x amount of headshots or stealth kills you earn bonuses to weapons as well as upgrades.Graphically, it's a great game to look at although it lost major points with the DC level as there has never been a huge carnival allowed on The Mall, yes I know it's just a game but that just stuck out to me for some reason being that I live in this area.Lastly, you will find yourself breezing through the game because it's mostly seemless. No loading or waiting and Michael Ironsides' voice is still iconic for this game. It's not a great game but it will keep you occupied for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2010"}

He is the last of a noble and respected line.

Lucas has been taught the art of combat in the ancient and deadly style of the Legion. Lucas is a skilled swordsman, and a master of two combat stances. He can fight with a sword and shield, which allows him to attack quickly, deal heavy damage, and interrupt and stun single targets. When outnumbered, he wields a massive two-handed sword. While slower to swing and less practical for one-on-one combat, it can strike multiple foes and knock them back, making it an ideal weapon for crowd control.AnjaliAnjali is an archon - a legend, come to life.

But Anjali was raised by friends of the Legion, and she does not know how she came to this world, or what happened to the others of her kind.Anjali can shift freely between her human form and an incarnation of elemental fire. In human form, she fights with a staff or a spear, allowing her to fend off multiple attackers while leaping in and out of the fray.

Months after release and playing more than 200 hours as well as trying out the other Action RPG competitors, I am glad the direction that Diablo went in. Compared to the previous installment, they did streamline the game to not feel so \"nuts and bolts.\" There are some things that this allows and prohibits. The one major downfall is that every character levels up the same. This limits the dynamics of the characters. Once you have a Barbarian or Demon Hunter already created, creating another is superfluous. However, it allows for a focus on skills and skill selection. Also, there are options to test different builds to one you like. Attributes are automatically distributed when you level, so the game becomes a little more results based.The drop rates are way better than months ago and Inferno difficulty is manageable than there were even 6 months ago.Multiplayer can be fun and as time went on, there are more options for those that don't participate. Patch 1.08 will enhance the benefits of multiplayer more.The RMAH was a bad idea and is now recognized as a bad idea by Blizzard. The auction house can be nice sometimes to open up different options. There is a sense of community that I don't see with the competitors with the online DRM, auction house, multiplayer etc. that I like, but most find these to be the greatest detriments to the game or the areas that need the most improvement.Unlike many games, this game is continually updated and revised. I've put countless hours into this game. It is a wonderful value since it requires no additional costs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Real Raleigh Reviewer","summary":"Ruined by DRM","reviewText":"I was a HUGE Diablo fan back in the day and have been waiting with barely-contained excitement for this game to be released. Only a decade between installments... let's all collectively hope that Diablo IV comes along sooner than 2032.The game itself is cool; the physics is great, the environments and immersion, the sense of force and motion. Obviously it is the proper 2012 rendition of the classic. Although they didn't really change up the formula much (shortcut keys on the keyboard, mouse control, hack and slash RPG dungeon crawler), it definitely has lots of little \"oh neat\" features and designs. I hope the developers never read this, because of the level of effort that clearly went into making this game, but I could only really give it a 3/5 for fun because... it's not different enough. It's like the 2004-2010 Jaguar XJ. When it came out, all the critics said, \"technologically brilliant, high quality, beautiful, but... at a glance, is it really different than the last two generations?\" So it goes here. And for whatever reason, the story line so far is kind of schizophrenic, generic, \"old stuff, magic, old stuff, magic\" recipe. In a way, the simpler, dumbed-down stories in Diablo and Diablo II made them somehow more eerie. Here it's just hard to appreciate how so many people lost staffs, hid keys, broke swords into pieces, and how many distinct but equivalently pathological evil magic people/creatures could be working so hard to execute some kind of evil plan. In the original(s), there was a bigger bad guy, a boss, and you had to off him before you kept going. No strings attached, no frills.Now where the other two stars disappeared: DRM. Battle.net ruined this game. I didn't even play it on its first night. I never experienced the \"can't connect\" problem. But what you find when you play is that you HAVE to go online and sign up for battle.net, regardless of whether or not you have any intention of playing cooperative games. Strike one. Then, you have to sign in with your credentials before the game starts (and can't even save your password... seriously? Is a gamer profile really so important that you can't store your password on your own computer if you want to?)... strike two. Strike three is: if you sit idle in the game for 5 min. or so, battle.net kicks you off and your game ends. Next time you log in, your game reverts TO THE LAST CHECKPOINT. There is no way to save your state. You can quit the game before you get up, but that ALSO reverts you to the last checkpoint. Occasionally you can lose 10, 15 minutes of progress in a larger map, especially if you're trying to explore every corner. So what you do is, get up and go do what you're doing as quickly as possible. I also occasionally keep going by the computer to unpause then re-pause the game just to keep it from kicking me off battle.net.Additionally: wait until you experience the pleasure of a laggy connection or over-loaded battle-net server. Your client shows that you're swinging at a baddie again and again and again, but not hitting it... while they're striking hits on you. Wait until you get a laggy connection in the middle of a huge fray with tons of monsters and your screen freezes and drops to 0.5FPS. Wish you had control? Wish it was actually just running on YOUR computer, since you're playing single-player? Oh yeah, you bet. So you just get hit, and killed, and re-start, and hope the lag goes away after a few more re-spawns, or if you stop and re-start the game.This shortcoming is just horrendous, unforgivable. Nobody in product development or QA could have gone through that and said, \"OK, no biggie, the typical player won't care.\" This is not only a poorly-executed feature - it's a huge DEFECT, and a MAJOR mistake on behalf of the product people. Single player isn't single player. If you're connection is out, you don't play. If you're on the go, you don't play. If your connection is laggy for any reason, you don't play.Seriously. Let me play offline. Let me play on my laptop in the car if I want to, or at a cafe without an internet connection. I shouldn't even have to be online at home to play. I shouldn't have the game kicking me out every 5 minutes when I'm just getting up to get the kids something to eat or change a diaper or whatever.So my 1-star rating is actually a 3-star rating for good gameplay (maybe even 4 stars if your expectation really just was for an updated version of exactly the same recipe, no surprises), minus two stars as a punitive measure for hobbling the overall experience so badly with the damnable DRM.Oh look... battle.net kicked me off again while I was writing this. I wonder how much progress I lost this time...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

The combat triangle between the three classes (Recon, Engineer, Rifleman) is a little unbalanced in my opinion, but not horrifically so.

If I were to use some adjectives to describe it, I would use \"frustrating\", \"tedious\",  \"boring\", \"repetitive\", \"inconsistent\".The game genre is that of a \"puzzle\" game.  On that end it fails miserably.  If you're looking for a great puzzle game, I'd get Portal.  That game was very well implemented and engaging, and the puzzles were challenging and enjoyable.  This game, in comparison, is a labor of frustration.  It's not fun at all.On the positive end, the graphics are good.  The audio is acceptable.  The free flowing movements of the character are well done.  In fact, I really enjoyed the jumps, wall walking, slides, rolls, etc., especially when they are strung together in very fluid movements.On the negative, the many puzzles are difficult to figure out and, unlike Portal, after a time or two of redoing the puzzle it becomes extremely boring and tedious.  A puzzle is supposed to be challenging and engaging - which includes trying various approaches to figure out.  But with Mirror's Edge it is just very repetitive which becomes tedious and frustrating very quickly.Here is an example of a puzzle:  Your character is running up stairs to escape pursuers.  After rounding several stories of stairs, you come to a door.  You smash open a door and run across a building roof.  You leap over the edge of a building and land and roll on another rooftop and continue running.  You come to a crate to \"spring jump\" off of in order to make it over the gap to another building.  Although you think you timed the hop jump on the crate, you don't get the spring you thought you would and you fall to a painful death.Take Two:  You start again at the bottom of the stairs.  You run all the way to the top again and smash open the door.  You run across the rooftop and leap to the next building.  You run toward the crate to spring jump off of and, this time, it works and you spring to the next building and land with a roll.  You continue running to a point where to need to wall run and jump to ledge - which you do successfully and continue running around a corner to meet a guy with a gun.  You go into \"slow motion\" mode and wait until the guy raises the gun.  As soon as the gun flashes \"red\" (as a signal when you should disarm) you push the disarm button to grab the gun.  But for some reason the guy is not disarmed and he shoots you dead.Take Three:  You start again at the bottom of the stairs.  You run all the way to the top again and smash open the door.  You run across the rooftop and leap to the next building.  You run toward the crate and spring jump off to the next building.  You run and wall run over the gap to the ledge on the other side.  But you miss the ledge and fall to a painful death.  Why didn't it work this time?  It worked perfectly last time!Take Four:  You start again at the bottom of the stairs.  You run several stories to the top and burst through the door.  Your run across the roof and leap to the next building.  You run toward the crate and spring jump off to the next building.  You run and wall run over the gap to the ledge to the other side, but again you miss the ledge and fall to your death.Take Five:  You start again at the bottom of the stairs.  You run several stories to the top and hit the door open.  You run across the rooftop to and when you get to the ledge you leap off and land on the other building.  You run toward the crate and spring jump off to the next building.  You run to that pesky wall and wall run over the gap and grab the ledge.  It worked!!  You run around the corner and meet the guy with the gun.  You go into slow-motion and wait for him to swing the gun around.  When he does, the gun turns red (to signal when to disarm) and you quickly push the disarm button.  But, again, for some stupid reason he is not disarmed.  You try to move away.  He shoots and missed.  You have another chance and FINALLY, you disarm the guy and knock him out.  You keep going.  Around the next corner is another guy with a gun.  But you have the shotgun and you shoot the guy in the legs first and then the torso.  Nothing!  He shoots you dead.  LOL  Why didn't my shots kill him!!Take Six:  You start at the bottom of the stairs . .You get my point.  And if you think READING it is tedious, it's a lot worse actually PLAYING it.  If it were just once or twice then it would be okay, but this type of thing happens ALL THE TIME in this game.  There are some parts where you're stuck in a room and try for a good ten minutes to figure out what you're supposed to do.  (In fact, sometimes I lost my patience and had to go to an online guide to figure out what in the world I was supposed to do).  Even if you KNOW what do you, it will likely take several tries to actually accomplish the objective.At least with games like portal, if you fail, you can approach the objective differently and try something new until you figure out what is needed.  But with Mirror's Edge, it's doing the exact same thing over and over until you can string together ALL of the moves and, with some luck, they actually WORK and you can move on to the next tedious objective.The bottom line is that is it just not fun.  And what's the point of playing a GAME if it's not fun to play?  Personally, I don't think it's worth the $8 I paid for the game.  But live and learn I guess.  Usually I'm not very picky about games.  Borderlands was great!  Modern Warfare 2 was fun (but short).  But Mirror's Edge is just tedious - at least for me.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"an enjoyable game to play","reviewText":"The latest in the Uncharted series of adventure-shooters, Uncharted 3 provides more of the same content that the first two games brought.To open up, let me say this: If you've played Uncharted 1 or 2, you know what you're getting for Uncharted 3. It's the same game in new locations: shoot bad guys, solve puzzles, have periodic exciting chase scenes. Even the plot is basically the same overarching concept connected to new treasures and artifacts. Again, if you've played a previous Uncharted game, you know what you're getting with Uncharted 3.For those not familiar with Uncharted, it's a third-person shooter that combines run-and-gun gameplay with parkour-style climbing and occasional puzzle solving. In essence, it's an Indiana Jones movie in game form, and it goes out of its way to be as cinematic as possible. The story of each Uncharted game thus far has been about finding some ancient treasure that turns out to hold a terrible secret; naturally, this game is no different. Overall, the game's single-player is linear but reasonably fun; the story's nothing to write home about, but the combination of character writing and action sequences will keep most players interested.In addition to its single-player game, Uncharted 3 has both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. Both of these use a Call of Duty style RPG system, where different perks and traits can be unlocked. While the nature of the unlocking is kind of annoying (because you can't really take what suits your playstyle until you've unlocked them all), it works to provide some additional incentive for playing.The game handles pretty well as shooters go, but it's evident that run and gun is way more emphasized than careful cover shooting. Fisticuffs are a surprisingly effective option as well, but moreso in single-player than in multiplayer. The game stays reasonably fun and frantic, though some parts near the end of the single-player campaign can just be annoying. It's hard to give a more detailed analysis of the gameplay because it's (a) simplistic in general and (b) the same as previous Uncharted games. You duck behind cover, you shoot at people, you run up to someone and punch them in the face, and then you repeat this until the game is over.The game looks incredible, both in terms of actual graphics and setting design and in terms of how the camera is used during gameplay. The game's developer, \"Naughty Dog\", puts its usual amount of care into the design of ancient temples and crypts, and the game's globe-trotting story ensures that there's plenty of different environments to see. The character models are also incredibly detailed, making the cutscenes feel near-real. One touch that I liked is that during melee combat, at least in single-player, the camera zooms in more and gives it more of an actual fighting game feel. There's some dramatic slow-mo when an enemy is taken down, and the choreography of the fights (while a bit repetitive) is pretty impressive.Overall, Uncharted 3 was an enjoyable game to play, albeit one that seemed a bit standardized at this point. The clearest mechanic I can provide is that if you enjoyed Uncharted 1 & 2, then Uncharted 3 will be a lot of fun. If you didn't, then nothing about UC3 will really change your mind. 8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

No, the graphics aren't spectacular. No, there is no great overarching plot. Yes, the entire game is confined into 36 townsquares (numbered from A-1 to F-6). However, Animal Crossing will continue to bring you back over and over again.When I first put the game into the console, I was disappointed. Run errands for townspeople to pay off a loan? Boring. Write letters and send presents to my animal friends? Inane. Catch fish and insects as they appear? Well, all right, this seemed like a lot of fun, but who had the patience to wait a year to catch a total of 40 insects? Or fill a museum? Or build a savings account which could be used for nothing? Or collect furniture, clothing, wallpaper, and flooring? Or wait around at certain times of the day/week/month/year for special events?And then, I was hooked.I mean, that Totakeke guy only appears on Saturday night, and if I miss him, I'll have to wait another week to get a song! And hey, if I run an errand for one of my neighbors, maybe, just MAYBE I can get an old NES game for my trouble (my collection is up to 10 now)! And when does that black marketeer Crazy Redd come back to town? I mean some of his stuff is so rare it won't show up at my little town store, which I've actually seen improved to a thriving megastore! And the list goes on.And the best part is that you can put as much or as little time in as you want, and still see the reward for your work. No, you may not buid your savings account to the staggering amount of 999,999,999 (which is required to get one of the rarer items in the game), but you don't have to. In fact, a greater reward is received when you play every day for about fifteen minutes as opposed to once or twice a month for 15 hours.I am sad that my review will not do this little jewel justice. The fact is, this is a highly fun game that works around your schedule, as long as you'll work around its schedule. I would certainly recommend it to anyone, particularly at 20 bucks.

If you've never gotten into the Metal Gear series, this would not be a bad place to start, after all, it's also the latest and greatest for PS2. Snake Eater will take you for a good ride in both gameplay and story.Story 4.5/5: The game tells the \"origin story\" of a central character in the Metal Gear series known here as \"Naked Snake.\" As a top field operative for the CIA, you infiltrate a remote facility in the Wilderness of the Soviet Union during the Cold War to take one of their top weapons developers into custody. You quickly find yourself in over your head, as your mission is complicated by other cloak and dagger operations at work. As a result your mission changes to prevent the Soviets from getting their hands on technology that could end the Cold War and bring about a nuclear holocaust. Through the course of the game you will encounter other operatives and adversaries that will reveal plot twists, causing you to question who you can trust. The twists and turns can be elaborate and hoaky but given the fact that it's basically like a spy novel, that's to be expected. I enjoyed how events played out and on the whole really liked the story's revelations.Gameplay 4.5/5: The gameplay of Snake Eater is very well designed and ultimately I applaud the designers for providing us with a stealth tactics title that allows for so many control operations. Since the point of this game is to complete your missions without being seen, it poses some interesting challenges. However, you are given a lot of moves/weapons/tactics that can make this possible.Your moves include: crouching, crawling, stalking (walking quietly), peering around corners, peering over objects/on tiptoes, leaning, grabbing enemies from behind, choking enemies unconscious/neckbreaking/throat slitting, and ofcourse hand to hand combat/grappling.Your Weapons: A highly useful array of silenced pistols and rifles, smoke and stun grenades, mines, and mostly useless power weapons that make far too much noise to be handy. On top of this the game allows you to trap live animals including venomous snakes which in turn can be used as a silent weapon to toss on unsuspecting enemies. While dressed incognito, you can also make use of some snazzy sleeping-gas loaded cigarettes to puff unsuspecting enemies unconscious.Tactics: This is where the game really shines. Use your imagination, because the game gives you a LOT of room to improvise. The developers have created all sorts of fun ways to evade and defeat enemies. By catching enemies off guard you can sneak up on them and interrogate them by threatening to slit their throat. They will give lots of helpful information including radio frequencies to call off enemy alerts/requisition artillery fire, locate munitions and rations depots, or just give hints on how to handicap the enemies resources. Knock out comms officers to prevent enemy radio support. Sabotage a provisions storehouse then leave poisoned/rotten food for enemies to discover and choke on. Sneak in and destroy weapons storage to limit the enemy's ammo supply. Toss empty clips to create a noise and get the enemy to look the other way. Shoot beehives from tree branches to get swarms to attack nearby soldiers, carry a cardboard box around and hide under it as enemies walk by. Wear a crocodile head a la James Bond and peer around corners on your belly to frighten soldiers, or just swim with it on to prevent nearby enemies from realizing you're close. Use local flora and fauna to feed yourself and heal stamina/dress and clean your wounds. Collect different camouflage uniforms for use in different terrains to make it harder for enemies to spot you. Hide in: tall grass, logs, hollows, tree branches, air shafts, lockers, and under tables, gas tanks, cars, etc. Knock on a door, and when the enemy opens up, jump him!!Your vast menu of equipment will be very useful in spotting enemies before they spot you. Use infrared vision to see camouflaged enemies/ spot fresh footprints. Use standard binoculars or a rifle scope to view the area ahead. Hide with a directional microphone and aim it till you locate footsteps/hear an enemies breath patterns. Use radar and/or sonar in various situations to pinpoint adversaries without giving yourself away. Inject yourself with pentazamine to stop your aim from shaking when attempting that lucky shot from a far off distance. In effect you can be as harmless or as ruthless to the enemy as you wish and still have complete success in the game. I have yet to play another game that allows the player to display this much versatility in execution. To me that's game play.My only complaint is the camera control are limited and sometimes choppy particularly when pressed with your back against a wall/peering around a corner. The camera shift can often happen at the worst moment possible, in effect reversing your controls and causing you to go from hiding securely to running out in the open where enemies are free to punch you full of holes. This problem has not been solved since MGS2 either. Come on guys, fix this!Graphics 5/5: I really haven't seen much better for the PS2. The jungle scenes are well designed and really make you feel like you're roughing it trudging through the mud and weeds. The place is crawling with all sorts of tasty/digusting things to kill and eat. From poison dart frogs, flying squirrels, or mountain goat, to Snakes favorite meal, SNAKE! The rendering and animation is well done for all of these. Nothing like stalking through the weeds on your stomach ready to pounce on an unsuspecting officer when suddenly a King Cobra slithers in front of you and raises up on it's tail ready to strike. The atmospheric effects are well done and really put you in the moment. The greatest achievement is the character animations which are tight and realistic and the look of the characters are beautifully realized.Sound 5/5: No complaints here. There wasn't a single off sound in the game. The ambience in various settings whether it's industrial or in the wilderness gets the job done. High production values here, and the music builds mood without being intrusive. Voice over dialogue is well cast and except for the guy who voices Sokolov (he's in other games too, I hate his voice, sounds like a monster truck announcer, check imdb for more info). Everyone else is good though, and David Hayter does his usual gruff and macho Snake voice with gusto.Replay value: Yes. The game is packed with side objectives/easter eggs/special challenges to give you reason to come back to the game after you beat it. There are several difficulties to raise the stakes and make detection harder to avoid.Conclusion:If you've never played an MGS game, play this one first! It won't ruin anything for you as it is technically a \"prequel\" so you won't need to know any back story. The story is also better and the characters are more interesting. The gameplay is some of the best I've seen and you can really get into the spy/thriller mood of the game. You won't be disappointed by the graphics and sound, and you can spend hours finding new creative ways of passing a mission. In short, I classify this as a must-have for the PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Damn good","reviewText":"A long time ago I picked up a role-playing game at Gen Con titled \"Abyss\" which was a reimagining of \"Dante's Inferno\" on steroids. It was gloriously violent, decadent, and imaginative.  When the Open Game License was released for Dungeons & Dragons came out, I was convinced this was the chance for \"Abyss\" to triumphantly return and, after tracking down the license holder and a publisher, wrote an entire book for the game.  But then the 4th Edition of D&D; was released and the publisher's interest waned. \"Dante's Inferno,\" the video game by Visceral Games, is what I imagine that tabletop game would have looked like.When I completed my manuscript I sent it to my cousin, arenowned scholar)on \"Dante's Inferno.\"  He demurred criticism, explaining that he had never played a video game before (it was a tabletop game remember) but that he appreciated the effort.  I imagine that's the response most people familiar with Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" will feel about this game: it's not very accurate, but if the kids are interested in literature that's a good thing, right?In the video game, Dante Alighieri (Graham McTavish) is transformed from an Italian poet to a Templar Knight on the Third Crusade. A deeply flawed warrior, he manages to break his vow to Beatrice (Vanessa Branch) before slaughtering Muslim prisoners of war at the city of Acre.  Sin and death surrounds Dante, from his doomed fellow crusader and brother-in-law Francesco (Tom Tate) to his brutal father Alighiero (JB Blanc) to his forlorn mother Bella (Pollyana McIntosh).  Dante's disillusionment is central to the belief that as a Templar his soul is untouched by the murders he commits - it is a credit to \"Dante's Inferno\" that it takes on such weighty matters as the Papal Bull of the Crusade. But Dante is one tough mother, so when he is stabbed in the back and death comes for him, Dante wrestles the Geiger-like scythe from him and proceeds on a quest to return to Beatrice...only to discover that Satan has absconded with her soul into hell.  Thus begins Dante's descent, accompanied only by the poet Virgil (Bart McCarthy).And that's the part we've all been waiting for: fighting in literature's most infamous hellscape. The nine circles of hell are lovingly (hatefully?) inspired by Hieronymous Bosch and other medieval artists: ferrying with Charon, battling Minos, resisting Cleopatra, slaying the many-mouthed Cerberus, facing his father's greed, and overcoming the gigantic fire demon Phlegyas.It's impossible not to learn about the original text by playing \"Dante's Inferno\" - a quote flies at you every time you die.  There are a variety of damned souls throughout that can be saved or condemned through mini-games which in turn gives you new powers, all of them drawn from the poem.  You can't help but admire a game that's willing to teach you a piece of classic literature even as you beat it up.There are a lot of flourishes in \"Dante's Inferno\" that have nothing to do with the poem and everything to do with its predecessors, \"Devil May Cry\" and \"God of War,\" from the big honking scythe to the fact that Dante can fight for up to ten seconds in mid-air, from the completely unnecessary tassels that dangle from his arms to the power-ups that reward you for button mashing.  This is a game where strategy is not so much rewarded as beaten out of you. And yet \"Dante's Inferno\" is also a jumping, puzzling game, brutally uncompromising in sending Dante to his doom.  The medium difficulty is just about right for fighting but makes many of the other challenges too hard; the easy setting makes the various puzzles surmountable but the fighting too easy.By the sixth circle the creative team behind \"Dante's Inferno\" seems to have run out of steam.  Whereas in the previous circles we were gifted with whirling two-headed demons that spilled gold, corrupt infants with blades for hands, moaning temptresses with tentacles unfurling from their abdomens, and shuddering behemoths of disgusting filth, the sixth circle just starts repeating itself.  We get horned demons, then horned demons with axe and shield, and then horned demons with wings and two swords that can turn into flames.  The eighth circle with its ten \"bolgie\" is the worst, as a narrator explains the sinners and sins rather than actually showing them - after spending hours with wailing corpses flailing, boiling, and skewered, it's obvious the design team ran out of ideas and budget. Things don't pick up again until the last circle, when you face down Satan himself.  Compared to earlier battles, the final fight was a cakewalk.The end of \"Dante's Inferno\" isn't the end of course - in the game or in the poem - but it will be interesting to see if Visceral Games can make Purgatory just as compelling.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}

I just found with this game, and others, I was left wanting more. That being said, it's a very good entry in the Ratchet & Clank series, and does resolve some of the issues from Tools of Destruction.

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Nintendo's Best 2D Platformer","reviewText":"This game's few shortcoming are the overly difficult rocket barrel stages, the weakness of its multi-player and the prizes you get for collecting puzzle pieces. Otherwise it is the most solid 2D platformer I've ever played. The game provides a real challenge that reminds me of oldschool platformers. And the control scheme teaches newbs to play with their thumb on the run button at all times. While New Super Mario Bros is a great game, this is simply a more enjoyable and worthwhile experience overall. The controls are tighter, the game looks better, the kong letters are more challenging to collect than the large yellow coins in New Super Mario Bros, and the replay value is much higher. A great deal of the fun to be had here once you've done almost everything in the game is to play through the time challenges. And the bonus stages collecting all the kong letters earn you are very much worth the effort. There is no good reason to not own this game if you call yourself a gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004Z4ZKL6","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew \"Andrew\"","summary":"Good, but still contains some game-breaking issues","reviewText":"Update:- I'm changing the overall rating for this game to 3 Stars:The Customization is worse than I thought.  After paying for some of the creation center content I found out that the Creation Center is almost unusable.  Just search for \"error downloading user generated content\" for Fifa 12 on Google and you'll see the issues brought up by users.  EA basically took payment and did not deliver.- Career/Management mode is broken.  Causes PS3 to freeze up when using Team Management options (i.e. formations, tactics).  This is pretty bad for a modern game.- The issue with AI runs I mention below, however, slightly alleviated by changing the AI Sliders within Customization, so it's better, but don't expect overlapping/diagonal runs such as in PES.- EA sports needs to treat their product with more respect.  Be wary of purchasing at full price expecting the Creation/Customization features to be intact.  Customization is great for sports games, it's something that has kept PES alive for ages, but EA's still not on board.  All the attention is on Ultimate Team right now since it generates funds for the company.Original Review:I'm basing my review on a pre-order valued copy of this game (approx. $45 value).  For $60, I would say this game is incredibly overpriced if you own Fifa 10 or 11.  For 45ish, it's a good deal.Good:  The new precision dribbling in my opinion is the one big plus, allowing for close dribbling and tight control.  No longer are acceleration and skill moves the key to winning and evading the defense.  Basically, you can now play a style akin to Messi.The tactical defending isn't too much different as most people say it is, however, I do think it is a lot better than the \"homing tackling\" of the past.The graphics and animation are second to none, if PES series had Fifa's animation it would be the best football game no questions asked (and I can finally go back to buying PES)Creation Center allows for your own custom teams and teams that aren't in the game (although the number of teams/players is capped). [However content is full of bugs when creating/downloading/using]Ultimate Team is now free and on the disc.The Bad:For a full priced game you can expect the usual DLC from EA Sports, and I'm not talking about new features for the future, but simply features that already exist but are locked until you pay EA some more dough.  The worst example of this is that you cannot use a created team from the Creation Center within the Career Mode unless you buy a \"Career Mode Pack.\"  Many of the better creation center features are also locked out until you pay for the \"Serious Creator Pack.\"EA's servers are prone to dropping you in the middle of various online modes. [this has improved a week after release to no drops, however my play sessions are short so I'm not certain it's fixed]The AI players are reluctant to make diagonal runs, or many runs at all for that matter.The AI defenders will also never foul you under the current Tactical Defending system, causing games that have zero free kicks. [Game Breaking]Fifa removed 2 entire leagues (Turkish and Czech), and I think the loss of the Turkish league is a big negative.The Skill moves are overpowered, it should be realized that quick turns of pace and directional changes are incredibly fatiguing to athletes, yet in this game a skilled player can do FIFA Street'esque moves non-stop for the entire 90 mins.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"A unique experience","reviewText":"Yet another game that shows the talent that Sega has over Sony. PS2 has no games like this, rather rehashes of yester-generation games. AM2's Shenmue represents another new change in 3-D gaming, just like the change The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time had over previous adventure games. It also shows that Sega is just as creative in making new kinds of games as Nintendo.Shenmue is the brainchild of Yu Suzuki, who has created the most expensive game ever and a new type of gameplay he calls FREE. Of course, it follows a storyline, but the world of Shenmue is to explore the city of Yokosuka to get to where you want and when you need to. It's a complete living world. It has days and nights and the city is complete with your everyday usual stuff. Not since Super Mario 64 have I played a game that gives a new experience.The reason why I gave this game four stars is because the game is not one game, it's only the beginning, therefore once you beat it, you'll have to wait (and wonder) what's going to be in Chapter 2. Also, the game is too realistic here and there; for example, to call someone you'll have to individually press the digits on the phone pad, and as for the day and night feaure, the time is always consistant. You can't skip to the next day when you want to.Though with these flaws, there is no way Shenmue can be overlooked. It's a new type of game, and the majority of gamers won't care about its flaws too much because of all the possible things to do (when Super Mario 64 debuted, no one cared about its flaws like the annoying camera control, because, as stated, it was a new type of game and experience). Get a copy and enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2000"}

Knisely","summary":"Over hyped","reviewText":"This game was WAY over hyped.First, the lack of real co-op is incredibly frustrating.  I feel like this is the same as Brink in that they put forth \"our game has co-op\" but what they really mean is \"our game has 2 player missions\".  Co-op comes with the assumption that, like in Gears of War, the campaign is playable cooperatively.  I feel too many gaming companies are getting away with selling a bill of goods with respect to the description of \"co-op\".Second, the weapons are pretty basic.  Everyone keeps saying that if you like Borderlands you will like this game.  That's a negative, Ghost Rider.  Borderlands featured an endless variety and depth in the field of weapons, AND it had true co-op for the entire campaign.This is basically a single player first person shooter with some cool battles and big bosses.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An amazing sequel to one of the best PC games ever made","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent production values, keeps RTS simple, lots of variety in missions, upgrade system really works out, gripping story, astounding multi playerThe Bad: Units take forever to build, too simple for some, no extras, no huge changes over the first gameRTS games of old were just all about buildings units and killing the enemy, and thankfully StarCraft II keeps this in mind, and let's RTS fans of the 90's get another taste. Liberty has you playing as James Raynor who is an outlaw to the Dominion Republic, and must stop the alien Zerg, the Dominion forces, the Queen of Blades (Sarah Kerrigan), and the Protoss all at once. The story is pretty riveting especially for an RTS thanks to excellent voice acting, dialog, and plot twists.I'm not going to explain how an RTS is played, and if you played the original game you know what you're getting here. The game is very simple with the premise of just building you army and completing objectives. There are only two resources in the game: Vespian gas and minerals. Don't like it then go back to Company of Heroes or Dawn of War (I'm not saying those are bad games). You gather these with SCVs, and you build you main buildings such as factories, starports, barracks, and anything that other units require and have at it. Yes it's that simple, but there are many changes and enhancements from the first game.Firstly there are a ton of different units, and you really have to think and strategize how to beat each mission. Each building has several units, but the game focuses on air and ground units. There are weaker units such as marines, reapers, and firebats, but then maruaders are the strongest. The factory holds goliaths, different vehicle units or the strongest one being a Thor which is a giant mech. The starport has several different types of ship units with the biggest being the battle cruiser.There are also defensive units that SCVs can build such as missile turrets, detectors, and mind control units for the Zerg. There are so many units you have something for every situation and you end up using every single one quite often since they are perfectly balanced. Some units have special attacks that do extra damage, but use up the units' energy supply. Some units can transform from ground to air, or turn into defensive units. There is so much when it comes to this that it would take forever to describe them all.The missions are great and varied and you will never get bored. They offer a fair challenge and even the later missions were fairly balanced. The game is just full of so much variety, but it's so simple and easy to play and understand that is really pulls you in. Throughout the 26 missions you will slowly earn more units to build, and be able to build larger stronger armies. The literal goal is to just build dozens upon hundreds of units and attack or defend, and complete the objectives.The game's only real flaw is that building units takes forever, but this also balances the game out so you really think on what units you need and use them wisely. There are small band-aids for this such as the mercenary compound. You can instantly call down highly skilled units for a large price, but there's cool down time. You can also build multiple buildings or build a different lab to build two units simultaneously, but you can't build more advanced units without the tech lab.You can upgrade most units with credits earned during missions, but you won't ever be able to by them all so choose wisely. You can also use research points to pick one of two upgrades on a ladder. One side helps your army and the other is research against the Zerg. Choose wisely since you can't pick the other or go back. This upgrading system is great and adds lots of strategy even off the battlefield.Aside from all this you can click around and listen to dialog from key characters, and this adds to the story and interactivity of the game which is excellent. There are no extras, however, such as behind the scenes footage or anything which would have been great. The game just has so much variety and content, and is so perfectly balanced it really feels those 12 years were put to good use.The multi player is what will keep you coming back. I'm not a huge fan of RTS multi player, but Liberty really shines in this area with Battle.net. With the human opponents and four different factions to play as you will surely pour dozens of hours into this part of the game.The game also looks amazing. If you have the rig to play the game with all settings to their highest you will be treated with beautiful visuals, excellent lighting, and well done animations and effects. Everything looks amazing, and the game just plays brilliantly. I highly recommend this for StarCraft vets, but people who like their RTS complicated and with a lot of depth will be disappointed, but there is something here for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

While I enjoy that puzzles have a time limit, you do get to start over and 'redo' very often without any real penalty for starting over.  This makes the game coast by.  Granted, I wouldn't want to have to go back and redo puzzles I just figure out, but perhaps restarting puzzles, or spending too much time could have affected the ending or something?  Maybe some way to keep track of how quickly you solve the puzzles?  Hmmmm...Also, once you figure a puzzle out and the order of activating items, there is really little left to do in a replay.  So replay value is really low.Moving the screen around is often tedious, and using the stylus to switch from the real to ghost world can be a pain.  You get used to it, but it lacks the fluidity of other games when switching screens. Though at least it's not as much of a pain as the 'tracing' in Okamiden or the ridiculous styles/microphone puzzles in the DS Zelda games.But annoyances aside, the game is gorgeous. Easily the best animation on the DS.  The story plays out very film noir and is pretty dark and gritty.  Some of the violence takes on a spy vs spy look.  Which I found amusing at times.  The characters are likable and you genuinely want to finish the game and see if you can save the girl.If you have a DS it is a worthy title.  There are deeper and more complex games out there, but this is a good action oriented puzzle game that won't disappoint.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

The cutscenese are beautiful, its like watching a movie on your psp.  The music in this game is also pretty good, and isnt annoying or bothersome in the background which is a definately plus.  You get the full final fantasy experiance for the most part; the towns, the battles, ect.  The battle system is pretty good and I really like it.  It is sort of la mix between FF10 and FF12.  In this regard it is like FF10 in that the battles are random but it is like FF12 in the regard that the battle mode itself is in real time where you can run around, block, dodge or attack as you need.  The character development, the characters and the story in this game are actually really good and this is a great prequel to FF7.  I am glad there is a hard mode, although believe me, easy mode will keep you plenty busy with all of the side quests you have to do.  I like the fact that you can go to a save point and you can do missions and side quests from the save point and you can also buy items, however, I hate that the save point does not heal you.. but more on that below.  Finally the materia system is pretty cool,  but it can make you a nervous wreck.  Once you pass the secret factory level, you will be able to combind materia and spells.  This means that you can take blizzard and fire and make something else.. you can do this with any combination imaginable.  This is absolutely awesome, but it starts to make you nervous that you are making the wrong choice.The Bad:Ok, so the bad..  My biggest issue with this game is that there are no weapons... FF is all about getting tons of weapons, armor, helms, axes, spears, swords, ect.. Well.. not this one, you only have your sword and you hack and slash your way through the game.. Let me tell you that was a HUGE disappointment.  Another horror.. The slot system.. OMG this is the worst.  Your leveling is based on this instead of exp which is a nightmare, you want to fight tons of enemies and level up so you can blow through a boss battle? too bad, the computer dictates what you do, not the player.  Secondly, the slot system contorls your power attacks.. you want to use a super move on a boss instead of a little foot soldier right? too bad, you always get the super mmove when you dont want it and you never get it when you need it!  There goes the dictator computer again.  My next complaint is that you cant replenish your health through the save points, this is another thing that seem sto be random.  You come out of a mission and have 1500/1000 hp??? wtf?? but than when you want to save and you have 1/1000 hp it does not heal you.. ugh! nightmare! I finally, the side quests are sooo repetitive, it is do the same thing until you get the dumb materia or the useless item.. why am i doing the side quest if i'm not going to get a bigger sword or a deadlier ax??

The other Lord of the Rings game is based on the book, and just on the FIRST book. It's VERY short and a puzzle-adventure. In comparison, The Two Towers is based on the first TWO MOVIES, NOT the books. And it is a straight button-bashing fighting game. The up side of both of these games is that they're great Aragorn-fun. The down side of both of these games is that both are WAY TOO SHORT.At least in this one you really CAN play all three characters. After the first two levels (a prologue and Weathertop) you can now choose, on each level, to be Aragorn, Gimli or Legolas. Each character has his own fighting style, from Gimli's little battle-tankness to Legolas' great double-sword action, to Aragorn's lean ranger fighting. Yes, I love Aragorn's fighting style :)This game, being based on the movie, has TONS of detail from the movie. They worked with the actual actors for the voices, and got their hands on the actual movie models for the game sets. You can see the attention to detail. There are all sorts of 'special features' where you can watch interviews with the actors and see photos from the second movie. So it's sort of like an interactive preview of Movie 2!It is SHORT thought. You can run the game through on a character in about 5 hours. Then you just run through again as the other 2. There's a secret character and level, but that's about it. There are no puzzles, no quests, it's all just bash-through-the-enemies-and-then-bash-at-the-boss. Either the boss is easy - if you find his weakness - or he is REALLY NASTY and VERY VERY FRUSTRATING. A bit of tuning needed to be done in here. And again, where the other game had at least a bit of thinking involved, this one is solely mash-mash-mash those buttons.Still, it's really great to be \"in the movie\" and hear the familiar soundtrack and voices around you. A must have for any Lord of the Rings fan - and if it's short, just spend the rest of the time trying to get a PERFECT score on every level, and watching all the videos that come with the game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002KSPKRS","description":"The Ear Force X41 is Turtle Beach&rsquo;s top-of-the-line XBOX 360 headset featuring 7.1 channel Dolby surround sound, XBOX LIVE chat and a digital RF wireless connection for crystal-clear game audio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview:Combining outstanding comfort with a stunning 360 degree sound field and enhanced online communication, the X41 puts you in the middle of the action so you&rsquo;ll enjoy a gaming experience that&rsquo;s second to none.Playing your favorite XBOX game with the Ear Force X41 is like having a &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; in your arsenal. You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Makes gaming a whole different experience","reviewText":"These headphones perform . They sound crystal clear and the 7.1 surround effect is accurate to a pinpoint. I've used the X31's at my brother in law's place but I think the X41's flat out blow them out of the water. The first game I tried out with them was \"Dead Space\" and believe me, the sound scape of this game is even more layered than you might believe. I was hearing details that you just can't pick up on a full home surround setup. Hard to believe that a game I've finished more than half a dozen times became even more terrifying due to these headphones. I played several other games and they all sounded stunning. Halo: Reach, Red Dead Redemption, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Dead Rising 2 basically became different games now. Halo: Reach especially blew me away. I had to keep looking at my wife, thinking that I was disturbing her with all the noise.The setup for this baby is very, very simple and straightforward. I was up and running within two minutes and I didn't even look at the instructions, it was that easy. The headset itself runs on 2x AAA batteries. The transmitter doesn't run on AC and connects to the Xbox via USB, which is nice. A packaged optical goes from the Xbox to the RF transmitter and there's an optical connection going out if you want to run that to a receiver without losing your home theater setup in the process. A cable comes packaged that connects the headset to your controller, that way you can chat. It'd be nice if it was strictly wireless but Microsoft doesn't give up their secrets so readily.I am more than impressed with these headphones and I'd recommend a pair to anyone who appreciates surround sound in their gaming, which frankly, I can't do without. A big thumbs up to Turtle Beach for releasing a stellar product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00008URUA","description":"Join Yuna in mission-based, non-linear gameplay, as she and her companions travel across Spira in this epic Final Fantasy adventure.","reviewerName":"G. Guberlal","summary":"Final Fantasy X-2","reviewText":"Final Fantasy X-2 is a brand new world in the beloved series. While it is based on, and set in, FFX's world of Spira and containing the core characters of Yuna & Rikku, and a plethora of the supporting characters seen previously, it as much different as it is similar.Some 2 years have passed since Yuna, Wakka, Sir Auron, Rikku, Kimahri & our lost dream (and Yuna's love,) Tidus defeated Sin to bring the eternal calm. For anyone that hasn't played and beaten X, it's a good idea to pick up a copy and play it through first simply because X-2 doesn't give you a lot of backstory, instead alludes to things and moves forward.Storyline:Yuna is now a Sphere Hunter with the Gullwings and travels with her cousin Rikku and a brash new character, the Gothic female Paine. Rikku arrived on the Isle of Besaid and gave Yuna a sphere containing a video of someone that looks like Tidus trapped for trying to use some kind of weapon. I can't elaborate more or I would spoil most of the adventure. So, Y. P. R. (as they call themselves) are hunting every sphere in Spira trying to find out just who this is. Along the way, they are constantly hounded by the Leblanc Syndicate (another Sphere Hunter group) and the rise of New Yevon. If X's tagline was \"This is my story,\" (meaning Tidus,) than the tagline for X-2 is appropriate as \"This is Yuna's story.\" In fact, it is a deep story as I have come to find out and far moreso than the brief synopsis by Square-Enix. (This is a good thing.)Graphics:The same source code was used for many of different area's seen in FFX, but have been tweaked and updated to bring the world of Spira 2 years forward. Some area's look exactly the same, however, with new people and places to explore. Graphically, FF X-2 is better looking and superior to X because of these added elements.Graphics II:The character models are sharp and gorgeous. The speech to mouth movement has been overhauled and plays out smoothly. You'll notice the incredible graphics while in battle and especially while changing dressspheres.Gameplay:This is where X-2 differs so much from FFX. Instead of the linear world of moving from place to place, you now have a beautiful airship to roam wherever you want to, when ever you want to. In short, you can play this game any way you want too as there's no preset way to go. The world map has returned and with your airship you pick where you want to go instead of waiting until deep into the game to acquire the ship (as was the case in previous FF titles.) Also, instead of one defined mini-game, like Blitzball & Tetra Master, there are many (sorta like the things you could do at the Gold Saucer in FFVII.)Gameplay II:Ah, the battle scheme. It is easy, and it is tough. ATB, \"Active Time Battle,\" seen in Final Fantasy IX has returned and you can change job classes in the middle of battle. Be careful however, changing classes in a tough fight could leave your party vanquished. Gone is the usual fight stance and style where one party stays on one side and the fiend on the other. X-2 presents the battle in a realistic form. You may surround the fiends once, or they may surround you. Also, I can't leave out the mentioning of the \"Chain Attack,\" a cool feature done in other games and now bringing a great strategy to FF's turn-based battle system. (You'll notice in X-2, that it doesn't as heavily rely on turn-based as previous FF's and could be an Action RPG like Summoner 2 if was loosened any further.) Again, a good thing.Sound:The voice acting is suberb by the same cast as the original. The music is upbeat and lively and bear's no, and I mean NO, resemblence to Nobuo Uematsu's awesome scores and themes. This may be the games only drawback and is sorely missed, at least by me.Overall:X-2 is presented as a game in itself with ties to X. The mission-based gameplay, free roaming world and familiar meetings make the game an incredible RPG. Square-Enix has outdone itself. Don't expect to be replaying FFX, this is a forward-driven, exceptional new chapter as much as a sequel.Note:I have left a lot out in this review, simply because to divulge too much would be to give away spoilers. There is something at every turn in the game that is new and connecting the 2 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

Actually I was surprised by how much it really made the Wii POP the way it's supposed to. The white and the black systems just don't give off as much flair and really make you long for that Nintendo experience the way a gamer should. Beyond that, this isn't all that different from any other Wii bundle. And, while I find it a bit odd that they've included the new Motion Plus controller here without including a game requiring Motion Plus, it still ends up saving you money. After all, these bundles normally come with Sports Resort instead. And you can buy Sports Resort for $30 without the controller, but the New Super Mario Bros game will still run you $40. It's not much of a savings, but a savings nonetheless. And these are probably the 2 main games that your family will want to dive right into after hooking the Wii up. Therefore I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2010"}

I find myself admiring the menu screens because the color and artwork is so well put together.The songs are good, for the most part. I suppose part of it comes down to personal preference, but the songs by Testament and Metallica I could have done without, as well as Drain You by Nirvana and the Beastie Boys track.However, those are rather small annoyances in the context of the overall game. Stuff like Lazy Eye by Silversun Pickups alone make it worth having. Before this game was released I was planning to buy both it and Guitar Hero: World Tour. And I still may, but now I just am wondering what the point would be? There's no way GH: WT's tracks are going to match Rock Band's.Anyways, back to the review. The game intelligence is fantastic. It reads if you have downloaded songs, and then uses them for some of the song sets. New the game are Challenges, which is basically just a tiered set of song sets. But it's cleverly done. For instance, I have downloaded quite a few Who songs, some by Oasis, and The Smashing Pumpkins, so when I reached a certain tier, there were four new Challenges to play, the Oasis challenge, the Smashing Pumpkins Challege, a Who's Next Challenge, and a Who's Live At Leeds challenge.Also, it's much more fun now that you can play Tour mode with just one person.

The last 2 reviewers compared it to Pure. I bought Pure after playing the demo, and actually didn't see what was special about Pure as compared to the demo. Pure was just the demo with similar environments, and not much added. I was expecting to see the same with Split Second, but saw that the developers weren't so lazy this time. The S/S demo features a car which is a lower end car, in which drifting is difficult, and not very fun. In the complete game, you are rewarded cars that are easier to handle through drifting, and makes more sense. The tracks (not in the demo) also make drifting more conducive.There are 72 races in this game with 12 episodes and 6 races for each episode, some with new environments. There will be a couple of different challenges you have to complete to move onto the next episode. In one of the more fun challenges, you must pass semi-trucks while they are dumping barrels of oil, and avoid the oil barrels. The other main challenge featured is an elimination mode, in which the car in last place gets eliminated when the timer hits zero.  Some of the other challenges require no drifting, and focus on avoiding hazards which actually brings a new type of racer to the game. The challenges are various, and much more fun than I expected.(There is also a 2 player mode which offers a split screen, but I haven't played in this mode to comment on it.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"A Link to the Past's Second Quest","reviewText":"In the original Legend of Zelda, you unlocked a \"Second Quest\" after completing the game. A Link Between Worlds is like a Second Quest for A Link to the Past. It has the same bosses, overworld, and same general storyline, but all of the content in the world is new.For starters, there are only two or three cutscenes in this game, and you can skip them! Only in the beginning must you follow some predefined path of fetchquests, and that takes all of five minutes to do. Everything that has dragged recent Zelda games on for days and weeks on end is absent from A Link Between Worlds, and the game is SO much better because of it.The exploration is great in this game, and it doesn't even matter that I've trounced across this same overworld hundreds of times since the 1990s. Being able to go wherever you want is exciting, and after so many hedged off Zelda games like Skyward Sword, it's a breath of fresh air. The open world exploration is great, but what's even better is that it's coupled with non-linearity. This is the most non-linear game in the history of the series, surpassing even the original Legend of Zelda in terms of the amount of different ways you could complete the dungeons.Related to this is the subject of difficulty: Is A Link Between Worlds easy? Or Is it hard or somewhere in-between? It really depends on the order in which you complete the dungeons. There appears to be an unmentioned difficulty curve to the dungeons, and based on one and one half runs through the game, I'd say that it mirrors the original recommended path of completion in A Link to the Past. But whatever the case, if you go to the \"wrong\" dungeon, there are enemies that can shave off three of your hearts. And if you're playing that dungeon first, there's every chance you'll start with three hearts after a Game Over! So, this game can be hard if you don't actually take the time to prepare before entering a dungeon.But in addition to this, A Link Between Worlds really shines in the area of items. Because you can access all of your items fairly early on, most of the enemies have multiple vulnerabilities and many of the puzzles have multiple solutions. In addition to creating replay value, the whole things comes across as really slick. You can even hit guards over the head with your lantern! I never knew I wanted that, but I did! :)There's a lot of potential for replay value here. After you beat the game, a quadruple damage Hero Mode unlocks. It's pretty hard, even if you take the time to prepare with fairies and potions. You need to use your knowledge of the game from normal mode to rush toward those helpful items, at which point it becomes much more manageable. But even after you complete Hero Mode, there's still a lot of replay value to be had with the game's non-linearity. There are so many different strategies you could try out in this game.I'd recommend A Link Between Worlds to anyone. It's astonishing just how good this game is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}

Picking up right where God of War II left off, God of War III finds Kratos and his attack on Zeus and Mount Olympus hitting a bit of a snag.  Then again, if death itself can't put Kratos down, what can?  A technically marvelous and just plain incredible achievement, God of War III grabs you by the throat from the minute you fire it up.  Big time production values, spectacular graphics, a stunning score, and some of the most brutal combat you will ever find in a video game period makes God of War III an instant classic.  It's challenging and concludes one of the best stories to ever be found in a video game.  Not to mention that for a game of this size and magnitude, there are little to know load times from the minute you fire the game up.  Seamless gameplay like this is nigh-unheard of, and helps make things all the more special here.  If this is indeed the end, then there couldn't be a better way to send Kratos off, and if you own a PS3, God of War III needs to be in your hands right this moment.  This game is one of the best reasons to own a PS3, and even if you're a newcomer to the series, it deserves your attention regardless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2010"}

Airborne continues this trend and it's dead obvious how little effort they put into the game.You play as a soldier named Travers (like we care at this point) and you go through various WWII scenarios that you have probably gone through dozens of times before. The first thing you will notice about Airborne is how repetitive it feels in comparison to other WWII shooters. It doesn't do anything new and re-treads the same ground that we are sick and tired of. EA tried to make us feel different about this with a new approach to level design. You play as paratroopers that jump out of planes at the start of every level onto green flares. These are safe zones and contain crates of health, ammo, and grenades. Once you hit the ground you will notice that your mini-map is pointing to various objectives. No longer do you follow a linear routine and take it one at a time. Pick a direction and run, but that's when things start going bad.Every map plays out the same, shoot some enemies, push forward, rinse and repeat ad nauseam. The enemies will keep coming in different pockets of the maps until you advance and take them out. This isn't a new trick, and just gets old quick because that is all you do. Place a charge on this AA gun, blow up this equipment, blow up these thanks. No thanks. I have done this countless times already so why do I want to do it here? The whole \"non-linear\" map idea doesn't really work because it makes the game ridiculously difficult and you will die dozens of times every level. Every time you die you jump back out of the plane loosing not objective progress, but advancement progress. If you just pushed back a huge group of enemies and die you have to do it again. Your objectives are just checkpoints, and this gets frustrating beyond anything you can imagine. The game throws way too many enemies at you, but there are even problems with weapons.The game has a nice upgrade system for doing so many kills. For example, the MP40 will upgrade with a double clip, reduced recoil, and a knife melee attack. This is the most interesting thing in the entire game, but EA for some reason made the guns inaccurate to accommodate for upgrades. Guns jump around more than you are used to and no matter how well your aim is you always miss about 60% of the time. Once you hit the less recoil upgrade it isn't so bad. All the same WWII era weapons are here (except the Sten) and it is yawn worthy.Thankfully the game is short with only 6 levels, so you can beat the game in about 6 hours. No matter how you slice it the game is just extremely hard, repetitive, boring, and unoriginal on every level. They even went back to the health pack system which is just archaic in design. You would think at least jumping out of planes is fun? Not really because if you don't grease or flare your landing you botch it and it involves a nauseating and disorienting animation of your character wobbling around while getting up and pulling the weapon out in a weird way. While this is happening guys are shooting you and you will recover with one health bar left. Nice job EA for screwing every single thing in a game up that you possibly could. Even the graphics are pretty bland and aren't anything special.Overall, Airborne is probably the worst Medal of Honor game I have ever played. Monotonous shooting, ridiculous difficulty, screwed up paratrooping mechanic, failed level design, and a retread of a genre everyone is tired of. Do yourself a favor and skip this unless you really need a WWII shooter fix. Forget about multiplayer as well because there are only 6 maps and no one is playing online anyways.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

It is harder than most games, even on the easier difficulty settings, and on the hardest setting, it's comparable to the hardest games, even on pace with Dark souls, in some ways.  I'm nearing the end of my first play through, and I've gone the solo route, but I'm looking forward to some co-op play the second time around.  For anyone who prefers to go it alone, I can assure you it works just fine by yourself.  The story is great, and the graphics continue to thrill in this series.  If you bought mass effect 3, you will have access to the N7 suit, which is quite helpful, and also looks pretty cool.  They've actually got a quick save feature this time around, instead of the save hubs from the previous games.  I actually prefer the old way, though, since recourse management is so important in this game.  Every time you go through a new door it seems to save, and that kind of sucks if you've used a lot of health packs in a tough area.  All told, that's a minor flaw, and on par with most other new games.  It's a bigger game than the first 2, and thankfully it ditched the crappy multiplayer from the second game.  I got all achievements in the first game, but couldn't play the multiplayer in the second game, which kept me from getting some achievements.  I'm looking forwartd to completing this game, which is exciting.  Like the first 2 games, you can get through this in a few days.  But the firsat game took me over a year to fully complete, with some obvious off time for frustration!!!  I'm ready for the torture again, and if you know what's good for ya, you should be too.  Grab your controller, strap on a diaper, and get ready for one of the scariest, toughest, funnest games you'll ever play.

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"A fun throw-back to simple FPS times.","reviewText":"After years of thinking this game wasn't going to come out, if finally hit. This is the real sequel to the original Duke Nukem 3D, a terrific example of how great old school shooters really were. Sure, we had several console games, such as Duke Nukem: Zero Hour and Duke Nukem: Planet of the Babes, but this is the Duke Nukem the gaming community has waited for. The question is, does it make you hail to the king, or should Gearbox blow it out their... well, you get the point.Before we go into a lot of details, people need to realize who Duke Nukem is. I know a lot of \"professional journalist\" have deemed this game insanely crude and offensive. It demonstrates sexist attitudes and Middle school jokes, some of which push it too far. Let's clear this up right now. Duke Nukem is a sexist. He's has the bio genetics of several macho men from the 80s and 90s that a lot of us grew up loving. He's the one man army Rambo character, and because of this, all of the ladies love him. He's a parody of the macho men. Women are dumb in the game. They're unable to save themselves. And in the Duke Nukem universe, they're all whores. This is all in the name of offensive parody, sure. So we need to keep this in mind to review this game properly.The graphics are outdated, using an older version of the Unreal Engine. It looks very similar to another 3D Realms title known as Prey. It almost feels like it would have been just fine in 2007 or 2008. For the most part, at least the frame rate doesn't drop and is generally pretty steady. I kept hearing reports of this occurring, but for me, that was never the case. However, this isn't the ugliest game I've ever seen and is very playable if you're not a completely graphic nut. As goes for the sounds. They're cheesy, and the voice acting is 'meh', but this didn't concern me. It was liking playing through an interactive B-film.Loading times in the game are horribly long. I had my notebook with me during the entire game because of the extremely long wait between levels. Even after a level is loaded, when you die, you have to reload back to the checkpoint. Fans of Call of Duty know that dying should be as easy as a 3-second wait and then you're back in the action. There was one boss fight that the loading screens became so annoying, I actually had to take a break so I wouldn't want to break the disc.The story is the real cheese, but perfect for this universe. It's another 'aliens have landed' with the Duke Nukem twist: they have stolen all the defenseless women! So the United States calls upon this one man army to help destroy the wormhole that is stealing women and summoning pig cops and other insane alien scum. You'll go through different avenues of areas throughout the game, ranging from an outrageously fun burger joint to a more dark alien hive area.One thing that really stands out is the way you can interact with the environment. Most shooters today are strictly shooting galleries with little (if any) interaction. Duke Nukem Forever manages to add a bit of this old flare back into the shooting. However, in this same category, you'll be a little disappointed if you're looking for a complete return to how the old shooters were. Most of the interactions are mini-games and a few odds and ends that you can mess with. It doesn't feel like they evolved interactions the way they could have done. Most multiplayer interactions are missing from the game. In older PC shooters such as Redneck Rampage even, you could play a bowling mini-game during a deathmatch. Where is this type of creativity for multiplayer? Maybe next time, Duke.This is definitely a kick back to old school shooters, but it does have some newer features that is so anti-old school, it takes the nostalgia merit away from the game. For instance, the game has a two weapon carrying limit. This is nothing like games of our past. It really limits the fun during parts of the game when you have to decide between a shrink gun or a rapid-fire rocket launcher. Another thing that ruins part of the game is regenerating health. Shooters from the 90s (since this is what the game is trying to be) would have had a health pack system, and maybe an armor system. (Also, where is the use of a jetpack?).The biggest disappointment is from the levels themselves. They're linear, and that's just not how games were done back in the golden days. They're not so direct there there's no way to navigate differently through a level, but the giant maze fields you went through in the past are gone. I'm hoping that Gearbox actually pays attention and returns the game back to it's roots even more next time.  Hopefully in a more timely manner.Multiplayer is a blast and is arena as arena gets. There's even ranks and different costumes you unlock through ranks. However, no weapon unlocks. Every player starts with a pistol and you pick up weapons laid throughout the map. The only problem I had with this is you have to hold down a button to pick up weapons. It would have made more since if they would have addressed this by just removing the two-weapon holding cap. However, it's great fun and very action oriented. There's even a throw back level from the original Duke Nukem 3D that makes you beg for more of the same.My final thoughts are that while the game isn't near as good as the original 3D, it's at least fun and worth a shot. Gearbox's worst hit to the series was making this title $60. It's not really worthy of that price. But it's not the completely broken and offensive mess the \"journalist\" are making it out to be. It's a Duke Nukem game with some changed elements. Hopefully, Gearbox listens to the complaints of the gaming community (and not these so-called critics) to fix the issues found in this title to make the game much more like the original.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2011"}

It's also my favorite video game of all time. When I played Final Fantasy X, I thought that it was the best Final Fantasy. For a few months, I believed that Final Fantasy X was the best because of how good the graphics, storyline and voice acting was. Then I played Final Fantasy VII and loved it more than any game ever. I always thought I'd love Final Fantasy VII the most. Then I played Final Fantasy VIII and it was then my second favorite Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy VII was still my favorite Final Fantasy. Then I wanted to try out Final Fantasy IX and heard mixed thoughts about it. I decided to try out my friend's game and from the opening FMV I really liked it. Then I decided to buy my own copy. It wasn't until my third game of Final Fantasy IX that I realized that I love Final Fantasy IX more than anything. Even Final Fantasy VII, which is now almost tied with Final Fantasy IX. After playing my third game of IX, I did start a fourth game and more and have played just about every Final Fantasy I THROUGH X-2, Final Fantasy XII-XIII, Tactics, Crystal Chronicles but IX will always be my favorite. Well here is why it's my favorite game of all time.Gameplay: 10/10The gameplay for Final Fantasy IX is my favorite out of all the Final Fantasy games I've played. It's a very cool system that I think is the best in the series. Every character is unique because not one character can learn the same ability. Everyone is different and that's one reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. There are basic abilities like auto-haste that everyone can learn but everyone has their own special abilities. Zidane is a thief and he can only have the steal and master thief ability. Garnet and Eiko are summoners and white mages but the summons are completely different and only a few of the white magic spells are different. Vivi is a black mage and he is the only one who can learn black magic. Quina is the only one who can learn blue magic, Amarant is the only one who can throw items and weapons, Freya is a dragon knight and has these cool dragon knight skills, Steiner is a Knight and he has a very unique and cool purpose when in the party with Vivi. Steiner can use magic sword. That means that when you command Steiner to use something like Fire Sword, Vivi will cast Fire on Steiner's sword so when Steiner goes to attack the enemy not only will he deal great damage with the sword, but also will deal fire damage. Steiner also has very unique sword abilities. In Final Fantasy IX, the characters learn abilities through equipment. You equip up to five different pieces of equipment and they have abilities that the characters can learn. In battle you gain experience points and Ability Points. Once a character has learned an ability, you can change their equipment to learn another ability and you'll keep the previous ability regardless what equipment you have on. The way you equip abilities is you get these blue stones which is limited by the characters level and every character has a different number of stones. This makes it so that you can't have every single ability equiped at once. As the characters' levels go up so does the number of stones which makes it possible to have more abilities equiped.Also, the number of characters in battle has been brought back up to four. In battle, there is a wait bar that fills up and when it is filled, that character can take a turn. There is also a limit break system called Trance. A bar under the characters' wait bar fills up a little more each time the character gets hit. Every character has a different trance ability. Trance is a characters' devastating attack. There is also an ability to make the character go into Trance faster.Another part of the gameplay is there is a ! symbol that pops above the characters' head whenever you find some treasure. You can have a curser appear whenever you enter a place but that can be turned off in the config menu.Something that not alot of people know about is that two people can actually play this game. In the config menu, there is an option to having which characters' are controlled by which player. Two player is only used in battle. If controller one is set for a certain character then controller two is set for another character, only the person who is using that certain controller can use that character. There is no way one person can level up and the other person visit towns at the same time but it's still a unique feature of Final Fantasy IX that I didn't know about until my third game.One more thing about the gameplay that's different from most Final Fantasy's. When Garnet or Eiko summons for the first time, you will see the full summon animation. After the first time only the full animation will be at random times. The only way to see a full animation all the time is to use the boost ability. But I usually have boost because I like watching the whole animation. Also, the shorter animation deals less damage.Story: 10/10The main reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite. The story is most interesting story i've ever seen in a video game. From the very beginning FMV to the end credits, the whole story is incredible. Never once was I bored with the storyline or leveling up. I have spent 13 or 14 hours at a time playing Final Fantasy IX because the story is so amazing and interesting. You have Zidane who is a thief and he's the main character of the game. Then you have Garnet who is a princess and she is also a summoner. Eiko is a young summoner. Vivi is a young black mage. Steiner is a Knight. Quina is a blue mage. Amarant is this fighter. Freya is a dragon knight. I'm not going to say a whole lot about the story because I don't want to ruin the game for anyone but I will say that this is most deepest, in-depth, engrossing game i've ever played. There are castles. There are dragons. There are Kings and Queens. There are chocobos. There are tons and tons of moogles that say Kupo! There is no voice acting in this game but Zidane, the main character, has more character depth, personality and character development than any other Final Fantasy's main character. I have seen so many different emotions throughout Final Fantasy IX than any other Final Fantasy. Final Fantasy IX is the most humorous game that i've ever played. I find myself laughing throughout at least 70 or 80 percent of the game. The characters in the party and even the NPC's are the most interesting and most funny that i've ever seen. People that say you need voice acting for more depth is wrong. Because I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have actually seen more in IX than any of the other Final Fantasy's. The story keeps you hooked from beginning to end. There were times where I just didn't sleep because I couldn't put down the controller. I totally love the story and it will always be my favorite of all time!Sound: 10/10The sound and music of the game is also the best i've ever heard in a Final Fantasy game. When a character attacks, you can hear the attack. Also magic and summons are very well done. I love the sound effects of the water, wind, lava, just everything you can think of has sound and it's amazing. This music in this game is the best music i've ever heard because not one track is ever out of place. You never go to an area and feel the music shouldn't be there. In fact, just about every area, cut scene, FMV has a different piece of music that some tracks you only once in the game. There were so many musical tracks for this game that they had to make five discs instead of just a four disc soundtrack. Because the four just has the basic music in the game but the fifth disc the FMV music. Nobuo Uematsu really put alot of effort into the music of Final Fantasy IX and it shows greatly. I love every piece of music in Final Fantasy IX and never get bored of it. The music totally fits the game perfectly. My favorite piece is \"You're Not Alone\" which is played near the end of the game and it's a powerful track when Zidane is feeling completely worthless.  \"Rose Of May\" is another favorite, it's so beautiful.  They even have a bunch of different chocobo songs. The same song just the tempo is different for each one. Even the music in Black Mage Village is a variant of the chocobo theme.  Awesome soundtrack! Also the moogles make a really cute sound.Graphics: 10/10The graphics for Final Fantasy IX is the best i've ever seen in a playstation game. The environments are so realistic looking that it's incredible. There are many places where you see water flowing and it's so smooth looking. The characters are also done awesome graphically. You can see alot of detail in the characters such as eyes blinking, the moogles pom-pom thing on their heads moving effortlessly, the way the camera will change to focus on a single character when it's their turn and of course the FMV's. The FMV's are the best FMV's i've ever seen. The way Vivi looks in the FMV's, you'd think he was real. You'd also think the moogles are real because if you really pay close attention you can see fur. I love the graphics of Final Fantasy IX.One other thing about the graphics: The world map is the most incredible looking world map. There are castles which of course look cool from the inside but when you go out on the world map, you can see the castles perfectly. The castles look amazing from the world map. There is also a couple places with waterfalls and to just take a second to watch the waterfalls, the views are breathtaking. I'm not kidding. The world map is more than just a place to walk on, travel, ride chocobos. It's pure beauty. I love going out on the world map. The forests and mountains are also amazing. You can definitely tell that Squaresoft put tons and tons of effort into this game.Side Quests: 10/10Final Fantasy IX has got to be the game with the best side quests. I have found myself spending over 50 hours just doing sidequests and they are so fun and addicting. My all time personal favorite sidequest is the Chocobo Hot and Cold game. Not only do you get to ride a chocobo all over the world map but you get to play a treasure hunting game. There are a few different locations where you search in an area for treasure. Also you get to find treasure on the actual world map. And don't worry, you get pictures and hints so you're not running all over the world map trying to find a specific treasure for hours on end. There are tons of treasures including ultimate weapons to find in this amazing sidequest. AND, in this amazing game, the chocobos can get to actually fly!!  Yes, you get a flying ability and it really makes this game so unique because of this alone, let alone everything else.  There is also a really cool frog catching game, a jumprope game for Vivi and Eiko, a really fun and cool card game called Tetra Master which is alot more fun and easier to get the hang of than the card game of Final Fantasy VIII. There is also a coin sidequest which you get some cool items which one of them is needed to get an item for Final Fantasy IX's second ending. Yes Final Fantasy IX has two different endings. I love the sidequests. There are more than I listed but those are the best. Another reason Final Fantasy IX is my favorite.Good points:Awesome, funny, deep, very in-depth storylineAwesome GraphicsIncredible music and soundFun sidequestsamazing, most developing charactersVery cool gameplayBad Points:NothingOverall: 10/10I know what you're thinking. You're wondering what is bad about the game. To be totally honest, I find nothing bad about the game at all. To me, it's perfection. To me, it's what Final Fantasy is supposed to be and whenever I think of Final Fantasy, I think of Final Fantasy IX. If I had to pick one Final Fantasy that was a true Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy IX would be it. Final Fantasy IX has everything I could possibly want out of a game. The way I feel about this game is like no other game. It's like Squaresoft made Final Fantasy IX just for me because there's not one thing in the game that I don't like. I love everything about it. To me, it's the perfect game.Rent/Buy: BuyBuy this game right away if you don't have it and play it if you do have it and just haven't played it yet. Trust me, you will not regret it. This game is a must have for any Final Fantasy fan. If you love the old-school Final Fantasy's then you'll love this and if you are not really into old-school, this game is sure to change your mind. Please go out and buy this game. It will be the best buy you've ever made!Replay Value: Very HighWhat I am about to tell you is very important so please, please take my advice. I have played Final Fantasy IX four times now and have realized a very important element that's not really been used before in Final Fantasy. I decided to use different characters for different party's, situations in my third game and seen something very exciting. The dialog changed. For instance, when I used a character the guide suggested, certain dialog came up. When on my third game, I decided to use different characters for the situations and found that I got more story than just using the same characters for some of the situations. And you'll know in the game when they ask you to pick a certain party. Also since this game has two endings it's definitely worth replaying.The number one reason I am stressing to play this game multiple times is I didn't find out alot of a characters' past until I replayed the game and I was on my third game. Trust me people, play this game at least four or five times. You always find out more in a replay game. And you understand more and more each time you play. I know this from experience. The only way to fully experience everything and get the most story is to play Final Fantasy IX multiple times and for me I love the game so i'll probably end up playing it as long as I can for years to come. Bottom Line: Best Game Ever!!! Thank you Squaresoft!! You've outdone yourselves.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

But that aside this game is still brilliant.The characters interact with eachother well and when Vivi's friends are attacked that's just as heart wrenching as Aeris ***Spoiler***. Kuja is second evilest villain ever (below Sepiroth) and all the characters have their own individual skills so you don't have to worry about teams being unbalnced. One thing I would say is a disadvantage is the trance system, for some people it's very good (Zidane has some cool dyne moves) but for others it is completely pointless (there isn't much difference between Summon and Eidolon) besides that though the combat system is great.Buy this if you have FF7. If not buy that first as it is the best game to get you into the FF world, universe, dimension etc...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"Acoma","summary":"Good game with a few problems","reviewText":"For the second iteration of KOTOR, I have a few comments. The gameplay was practically identical to the first KOTOR which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed the first one at the same graphic/interface level and the main enjoyment was the developing storyline. KOTOR 2 mostly delivers this, and by mostly there are a few parts in the game that just sort of \"happen\" without any interaction primarily near the end of the game, where your control is extremly limited and bounced around from area to area with not a lot of explanation or transitioning. Indeed it feels like the end was rushed and hastily thrown together, there was hardly any transition time..it was *poof* you are there.The minor enhancments to the engine I liked. The ability to influence your companions to go light/dark through your actions and even train them as Jedi was pretty good. The upgrading gear was enhanced as well, they did a good job with it. You can really upgrade your weapons into total death machines in the later part of the game. I would definately recommend uping the difficulty in KOTOR 2 as 90 percent of the fighting is no challenge especially as a Weapon Master, even in the ending parts, Sith Lords were chewed through in like 3 seconds without even using a medkit.I did expierience some random crashing and I have a very new system. The crashing for me was in particular areas, not necessarily a continuous thing. Some patching to tweak this and the game should be slightly less annoying.The storyline for KOTOR 2 is much more complex than KOTOR 1, with a hefty increase in dialogue and character interaction. Rarely is anything major in the game straight forward, it's a web which I think mainly stems from the old woman that travels with you (Excellent character). The storyline like the gameplay felt very hurried in the end which was not so good.Character development was fairly decent. The Old Woman being at the top with the most interesting character. The initial Han Solo type character was pretty uninteresting and sterotypical, being at the bottom.Overall I enjoyed playing it, the crashes were a bit annoying but manageable. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 due to the crashing and the parts which felt they just hurried to make a deadline.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2005"}

This collection contains 3 of the best games I have ever played and a gateway to numerous fond memories from my childhood. I tried playing them on the PS2 again recently, but the graphics were not good and it felt outdated. The updated graphics are very colorful and sharp, and you almost can't tell that these games are from the last console generation. Of course the textures remain non-HD and you won't see it like Battlefield or anything, but I was impressed at how sharp and colorful the game was, and how great it looks. For those of you who haven't played these games, they have great characters, voice acting, collecting, platforming, combat, and missions. The games are overall just fun experiences with a great feel. Also, there is a lot of cheesy humor. Luckily for me I love cheesy humor so it's just icing on the cake. I'll put it simply - if you played these before and liked them or enjoyed them, you will only enjoy them more on the PS3 - and only $40 for all 3! Also, if you've never played them and don't mind slightly dated textures/detail and physics, but with sharp graphics then I highly recommend you check this out. It doesn't have much coverage online for some reason, but I assure you almost any gamer who plays the Jak games will agree that they are amazing games! The more people who buy this, the higher chance that Naughty Dog will try again to create Jak 4!Edit: Oh and there are no load times (so far) since the PS3 can MORE than handle these titles. There are also no installs. As another reviewer pointed out the port isn't the best, but it's nothing specifically WRONG with the port, it's just that they didn't anti-alias it (remove jagged lines.) I'm assuming it has something to do with Naughty Dog's style of creating the game or something, since Naughty Dog is known to do things differently. but it could just be laziness at Mass Media's end.

S.","summary":"Frustrating gameplay","reviewText":"There is exactly one reason that I hated this game:  poor AI (artificial intelligence).  In this game you control one character in battle, while you are accompanied by two other characters controlled by the computer AI.  These computer players are more of a reliability than anything.  You have a few choices for their behavior, but none of them seem to have a significant effect on how they fight.  It's really only two settings they have: rush recklessly into battle and die, or DO NOTHING.  First of all, why is there even a setting for doing nothing?  At least make them dodge enemies or something...  This was retarded.  Other than that, they always recklessly rush into battle and won't even dodge obvious attacks or back away from enemies when they're in danger.  So, they die off within one or two battles.And if you expect to heal them, think again.  They won't protect you, so you'll likely be interrupted by enemies when you try to heal them.  So they'll die, and then you can't even heal yourself because it takes too long to cast without someone protecting you from enemies.What this all means is this.  You're going to have to grind levels and fight for an hour on ridiculous enemies to move the story on for 20 minutes.  Then you'll repeat.And trust me, the enemies are ridiculous.  In one of the first dungeon areas, you fight these men in robes who yell out things like \"No, my money!\" and \"I hate you!!\".  These are fat men in robes in some ruins that are supposed to be inhabited by bandits.  WHAT ARE FAT ROBED MEN DOING IN BANDIT INFESTED RUINS?!  I'm sorry, it just is too ridiculous.Here's some of the good in this game.  The roleplaying aspect is pretty interesting, though awfully shallow.  By this I mean, your roleplaying doesn't change the story too significantly.  The exploring is OK... but still pretty lame.  Most treasure chests are filled with only healing berries (really lame).  There is a lot of voice acting, but it is pretty horrible.  The characters are shallow, and their actions and dialogue are unrealistic.Overall, it's just poorly designed.  Bad gameplay, story, and characters.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2008"}

Rhodes","summary":"In 24 Hours, This Game Can Be a Headache","reviewText":"The hit television show finally gets a game.  It's not a horrible game by any means, but it does have a lot of problems, mostly in the gameplay department.  The good news, however is that if you really love the show, you'll find yourself immersed in the game's overall good plot.Once again, Jack Bauer is about to have a harrowing 24 hours.  They'll be full of stealth, terrorism, and all around butt-kicking.  All within the time-span of 24 hours.  It won't take you 24 hours to beat the game, of course (more like eight or nine hours), but they do a pretty good job emulating the show.  The cutscenes have split screens and fast paced action.  The storyline never slows down.  Ever.  For those who love the show, this aspect of the game is to die for!  Not only that, but the story is instantly absorbing.  If you're not familiar with the show though, you might be asking yourself a lot of questions.  Many characters and references made are linked directly to the show.  In other words, the game aims itself at the right crowd: Fans of the TV show.I wish the gameplay could be as absorbing.  While the cinematics do a great job in keeping to the show, the gameplay is nothing to get excited about.  It feels like a run and gun, and to an extent it is.  At first the gameplay is pretty easy.  When you go into a firefight, the game automatically selects the best weapon of choice.  In a stealth mission it will automatically select a silenced weapon, while in firefights you get the strongest.  This works out well for the gamer.  The enemy AI is also lackluster.  Most enemies will just stand around waiting for you to take them out (at least until they spot you) and some of the accuracy of these enemies is off.However, as I said, that doesn't mean the game is easy.  For one, in a firefight, you actually do want to keep your distance.  While they may not be that smart, they do gang up on you rather quickly, and because of the weird, subpar camera angles you can't pinpoint where the person shooting you is.Melee combat isn't very rewarding either.  And the only reason it isn't is because the same buttons to perform melee attacks also search downed bodies.  It really sucks when you go up to punch a guy and you end up searching the dead guy next to him.  You're left open for attacks.It is cool that they integrated the split screen into the gameplay.  Mostly it's just to show you what the bad guys are doing, but it's not so bad.  It works.The puzzles and mini-games are also nothing special.  It's mostly hacking out codes or interrogating enemies.  Some of them are fun (the interrogation game is especially fun), but for the most part, they're not challenging.  That's sad, given the complex appeal they try to give it.The driving levels are also frustrating.  The enemies (and allies) spend a lot of time running into each other and running into you.  You'll also find yourself knocking them off the road.  They're just not very fun levels.  They could've been so much better.Graphic wise the game is just... okay.  There are glitches.  Mostly they're parts of the bad guys sticking through the wall.  This only lets you know that there are bad guys ahead.  The frame rate sometimes slows down as well.  The cinematics, however, look devastatingly good.  Like I said, it emulates the show perfectly.  The audio is pretty good too.  The music keeps up with the action, and the voice talents are a spot on match.  Although sometimes the voice acting sounds off, it's presented in a fairly good way.What it boils down to is what you want from the game.  If you're looking for a fast-paced in-your-face storyline, 24: The Game has got it!  If you're really looking for the gameplay, 24 doesn't handle itself all that well.  Fans of the show might be able to forgive the setbacks in gameplay, but serious gamers may find it to be a problem.  So the game isn't horrible, but it isn't spectacular either.  The good news is that it certainly isn't a waste.  Because of how it expertly recreates the show, it uses the license perfectly.  I just wish the gameplay could've been more organized.The Good+Fans of the show will love it+Fast paced action+The story never slows down or gets old+Great sound+The voice acting is pretty good+It does a really good job recreating the show, perfect execution.The Bad-Driving levels suck-Enemy AI isn't all that great-The camera angles are annoying-The mini-games don't provide enough of a challenge-The overall gameplay mechanics just need work.

{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"D. K. Malone","summary":"Pure brilliance, fatally flawed","reviewText":"This game is about to get a lot of attention, more attention than it's had in the years since its Spring 2000 US release. Final Fantasy XII looms on the horizon, and it's the creative vision of Yasumi Matsuno. Vagrant Story is another of Matsuno's brainchildren. Once FFXII has been out for a couple of weeks and everybody's beaten it, a lot of those people are going to find out about Vagrant Story for the first time and go scrambling over to eBay to get a copy. This review is for them.Almost everything about Vagrant Story is par excellance. The story, the script, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack... The English translation is especially spectacular, due to its masterful coloring with \"Olde English\" which adds so much flavor to the tone and atmosphere. This is one of the ultra rare cases where the English translation is arguably far superior to the original Japanese script. Unfortunately, all of these shining examples of fine craft and \"video game design as true art\" is all for naught because of one single fatal flaw: The game simply isn't fun to play.Where the game ultimately fails is in the game play. First of all, the game is extremely focused. It's all dungeon crawling and fighting. There are no towns to explore and shop in, no NPCs to talk to, no minigames. Once you enter the dungeon, that's it. You will progress through different areas and get a change in scenery from time to time, but there is almost no variety in the gameplay. You move from room to room, you solve the occasional crate puzzle, and you fight enemies. End of story.The battle system in and of itself is fine. It's an interesting hybrid cross between standard real time action combat and traditional RPG turn based combat. The problem is, at the very heart of the battle system is an abysmally UN-fun weapon and armor system. There are several (eight?) classes of enemies in the game- Beast, Human, Dragon, Undead, Phantom, etc. The enemy classes are paired off into diametric oppositions. e.g. Using your weapon against a human enemy will make it stronger against humans, but weaker against phantoms. (sic) On top of that, there are specific weakness ratings. An enemy might be weak against blunt weapons, but almost totally impervious to edged weapons or piercing weapons. And then there are the usual elementals as well- fire, ice, earth and so on. Finally, each of your weapons has its own \"wear\" rating. The lower the rating, the more worn out the weapon, the less damage it does. You must repair your weapons in workshops, which are few and far between in the game. Another thing you can do in workshops is disassemble your weapons and reassemble the parts to make new weapons. Whether the new weapon will be better or worse than the weapons you sacrificed to make them involves much trial and error. The end effect of all of this is that as you play the game, you are literally constantly changing weapons. Yet the creators of the game didn't bother to implement any sort of quick menu for weapon switching, a la Secret of Mana. You have no choice but to spend 45% of your game time opening the main menu, opening the weapon menu, finding the right weapon, opening the accessory menu, changing the elemental jewels on the weapon, etc. etc. etc. All they had to do was come up with some sort of quick menu for changing weapons, as Seiken Densetsu 2 did seven years earlier. As it stands, Vagrant Story is a micro-management nightmare. To call the game tedious is an understatement of epic proportions. There are those who insist that a viable alternative is simply slogging your way through the game using whatever weapons you happen to have, whether they're effective or not. It can be done, but it makes the game even less fun. Why anyone would want to take on a boss with several thousand HP by doing only 1-3 points of damage per hit is beyond me.As is always the case, no matter how flawed a game may be, there will be a small niche group of vocal supporters who insist that it's the greatest game ever created, and that people who don't like it just don't \"get it.\" Beware of misguided fanatics. But hey, then again you just might end up being part of the 5% of people who play this game and come away thinking it's the bee's knees.EDIT- Apparently the star ratings aren't displayed exactly as they were input. I gave Vagrant Story ** (2/5) for \"Fun\" and **** (4/5) \"Overall.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2005"}

This game really does get your heart pumping and it tries to work every part of the body.Once you're done with the two workout programs you can create your own workouts from a selection of 70 exercises and tailor your workouts to your needs.As other reviewers have said, the warm-ups don't really do much to warm you up rather than just stretching your muscles, simple solution is to jog in place during the loading screens (in between exercises). My other beef with this game is that the sensors can get frustrating from time to time. When it has you do lunges or squats, it can take a while to register... Regarding the heart rate sensor it's fairly accurate when your arms are straight, but I've found that the heart rate drops when you run or do hammer curls or other activities where your arms are bent.I don't remember if Amazon said this when I bought the game but the online features for this game no longer work. For some reason EA decided they needed to \"shut down the servers\" for this game after only a year and a half of the game being released... In this case, if you're paying half price for the game like I did then good, full price probably not worth it since you lose half the functionality the game was supposed to be sold with.My final complaint with the game is a small one in that you can't rename workout once you've made it. So either make a whole new workout or deal with it...In the end, I'm glad that I got this game because I have lost a good deal of weight and by it keeping track of your progress and goals it makes you keep with your exercising rather than just giving up. If you find it hard to stay on track and motivate yourself to workout this game is for you. Short of a personal trainer I think this is the answer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"P. Hardy","summary":"Where's a good writer when you need one? (Revised)","reviewText":"Being no SQUARE ENIX or WALT DISNEY fan (any longer), I was weary about this game when my sister bought it. I figured I'd play it since giving it the benefit of the doubt. I really have to say that this video game really doesn't use what it was given to its full potential aside their from big company crossover-esque. The storyline in this video game apparently was never thought out completely, it was finished in a halfhearted way so to speak. Three children, Sora, Riku, and Kairi all dream of going on an adventure to find out what's beyond their shores. Unaware of the danger approaching they prep themselves to escape the tiny island they live on. One night after naming their ship ---which was decided by a race between Riku vs. Sora--- their island is attacked by a nemesis type creature later known to be called \"the heartless\" (real original). Creatures that seek to destroy the hearts of universe and its inhabitants. Sora battles the heartless as best as he can but to no avail. Riku, Kairi, Selphie (Final Fantasy VIII), Tidus (Final Fantasy X), and Wakka (FFX) along with his island ---\"Destiny Island\"--- are swallowed by the heartless. Sora is somehow or another spared by the cataclysm and is transported to a refugee world called \"Traverse Town.\" He wanders about the vast town, lost and confused. It is there he encounters Leon (Squall Leonhart of Final Fantasy VIII), Yuffie (of Final Fantasy VII). [They're companions, Cid and Aerith are met earlier and later]. They explain to him the dire situation surrounding him and what little information on the weapon he wields. The Keyblade. Upon being attacked by the heartless a second time and separated from Leon, Sora finally meets Goofy and Donald Duck. The duo are on a mission to search for their king, Mickey Mouse after discovering a letter given to them by Pluto. After some careful convincing Sora joins the Disney duo to travel across the cosmos in search of Mickey, Riku, and Kairi. To do this they must travel to various worlds to restore the original order of the universe with the aid the Keyblade.Probably the most fun part of Kingdom Hearts is the simple fact that you are literally traveling to worlds straight out of various Disney films. Worlds such as Olympus Coliseum from \"Hercules,\" Wonderland from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" Deep Jungle From \"Tarzan,\" Agrabah from \"Aladdin,\" Hundred Acre Wood From \"Whinne the pooh\" (as a mini-game), the whale Monstro from \"Pinocchio,\" Halloween Town from \"Tim Burton's The nightmare before Christmas,\" and Atlantica from \"The little mermaid\" are at your fingertips avaible for venturing. The finale worlds are two ENIX originals; \"Hollow Bastion\" and \"The end of the world\" which is the final level of the game in which you battle the villain (I won't spoil anything, its pretty obvious who he is though). Along the way you meet Cloud Strife, and Sephiroth, also from \"Final Fantasy VII.\" Most of the FANTASY characters, save Leon -- who arguably as the largest role to play through the course of the game -- have minor roles within the plot of the game that do nothing to move the story forward.As the game progresses you discover a less than stellar subplot within the world of \"Kingdom Hearts.\" Sora discovers he must also must save seven princess of so called heart. Jasmine, Sleeping beauty, Cinderella, Snow white, Belle, Alice, Alice and Kairi. As an added twist, he must deter several Disney villains; Maleficent, Jafar, Hades, Ursula, Oogie Boogie, and Captain Hook (Clayton, Queen of hearts, and Cheshire Cat are nonaffiliated with the heartless) from opening the final Keyhole with the princesses hearts and unleashing DARKNESS on the world.From there PLOT-HOLES big enough to run a semi through ensue. For instance the subplot concerning Riku being corrupted by darkness was not completely thought through. He speculates that Sora has abandoned Kairi and his friendship over Donald and Goofy's. They try to riddle the game with an implied romantic rivalry between Sora and Riku in their search for Kairi's heart. Kairi herself is an unnecessary character. While her presence in the game is not completely useless, she's basically a sort of catalyst for the rivalry between Sora and Riku. Sora (who doesn't seem so excited to be venturing around the worlds as he was at the beginning of the game) is so worried about his two other friends that, his mother, Wakka, Tidus, and Selphie are forgotten and never seen again until the game when the credits roll. How is it that the parent (the forever existing figure in your life) is forgotten for your friends, who could dump you in an instant? This is just a small complaint from someone who is close to her parents.That aside: The Ansem subplot is what brings most of the loose strings in Kingdom Hearts together. Once you gather \"Ansem's report,\" the game's storyline finally becomes clearler, while it sorta implodes on itself. Thus becoming all kind of anti-climatic within the storylines theme: \"Light and Darkness.\" The ending is basically a cliffhanger that makes you wait for the sequel to come out. The music for the video game, composed by Yoko Shimomura has its hits and misses; Most of the time its exceptionally good for a video game (mostly during the battles). Other times its so generic in most levels that you'll turn the volume down and play the game on silent. The theme song \"Simple and Clean (PlanitB Remix/Original Version)\" composed and performed by Utada Hikaru is not so sappy as I originally thought. If anything it sounds better in its PlanitB remix as opposed to the slower original version does.The gameplay is at one point of the game exiting to through. Sora's all round hack'n'slash combat moves and special abilities are probably some of the coolest things you can do in a game. Each move you obtain with the more AP (action points) you gain for each character you're able to play with can be strengthened, you also gain more Keyblades with each world you complete. The A.I. controlled Goofy and Donald Duck actually help you out with each battle you engage instead of standing around expecting you kill every enemy in sight. However, most of the time they're following you when A): You either run to heal yourself; or B): Run to get out of the way danger. This isn't the case with the minor enemy A.I. The heartless will beat you down more than once if you let them. The Bosses for each world you complete are lacking in challenge in either mode (Normal/Expert). You can beat down each one with insulting ease with the right Keyblade and selected items. If you're beaten its just as easy to beat them a second time! Just be sure to stock your characters to the limit with healing items. The side quests, what few there are, are the bothersome part of the game. Collecting \"Ansem's report\" -\"Collect all 101 Dalmatians\" - \"Acquire all Trinity marks\" -\"Find all pages to the hundred Acre woods\" and etc, throw you off the sensation of the game as you try to get through it. The turnaments at the Olympus Coliseum are where you have to beat four levels of enemies (usually Heartless) for the cups [Pegasus - Phil - Hercules - Hades]. The twist in the game is simple: After each world you lock you have no choice but to go back to the coliseum to battle in the tournament (to gain hero licenses) in order to move on to the next world. Its a useless way to make the game seem longer than it really its. Believe me, its a short game.Which is problem with most of the game levels. Most of them feel as though there should've been more to it than what you got. More world's you should've been able to go to. Cinderella, Snow White, and Beauty and the Beast universes would've been a real trip to visit. It also makes me wonder if what they could've incorporated into the Hercules universe with a little more constructive writing. Another major problem within the gameplay are the camera angles. They constantly move in the wrong direction when you jump, thus causing problems within the platform hopping. When you want to see something beside you the camera shifts back and forth as though it were a billiard ball hit by a pool stick. The fighting in the game slowly becomes repetitive when one too many enemies emerge in every single room you enter, threatening to overwhelm you. The U.S. voice acting manages to be excellent, with actors and actresses from various movies and television. The most prominent would probably Haley Joe Osment as Sora; His semi-youthful vocals lend a sort charisma the character lacks in facial features during 3D-cut scenes. David Boreanaz and Christie Carlson Ramano as Leon and Yuffie were on par with their Final Fantasy characters; Boreanaz lends a sort of Angel-broodiness to Leon that fits the character so well, that you can think of no other that could've pulled the characterization off so well. The same can be said about Ramano; However, both have their weak points, noted usually at the beginning of the game. David Gallahger as Riku was an excellent choice on the developer's part. He really brings out the sort of sinister demeanor lying dormant in Riku's personality. Hayden Panettiere as Kairi was another good choice. She manages to come off through the character as girlish without the overkill element that is usual apparent in most female voice actors in video games. Among those mentioned are other notable actors and voice actors you'll easily pick out of the group of Disney/ENIX characters.Finally, the CGI graphics for the beginning and ending as well as the 3D scenes are done pretty good. SQUARE ENIX could of course, work on their CGI which suffers from a plastic sort of appearance. The motion capture could be tweaked a little as well. The most apparent problem with the 3D scenes were the character's mouths. One moment they're moving like something you'd see in SONY'S RPG first \"Dark Cloud,\" then it movies almost too fluently and doesn't match the vocal pattern.  All in all \"KINGDOM HEARTS\" - despite its flaws in the storyline was a pretty enjoyable game in terms of gameplay (the playing part) itself. It could've been better, if they included the \"Snow White\" - \"Sleeping Beauty\" - \"Beauty and Beast\" and \"Cinderella\" universes to add more longevity. Maybe.  -------[a 3 out 5]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Walt Disney Would Be Proud...","reviewText":"First off, I originally bought this game on a whim, since it was only $20.  I must say, I am very impressed with the game overall.  A note: I am not a die-hard Final Fantasy fan or a role-playing fan per se.  Well, this game features Sora, the main character, and he teams up with Donald, the magician, and Goofy, the knight of the Traverse Town (Disney) Kingdom.  Control-wise, this game is fantastic.  The controls are easy, and it was made for children.  Additionally, the role-playing system is also easy to understand.  The plotline essentially revolves around the Heartless (basically the children's version of Sin in Final Fantasy X), and the Heartless are attempting to take over the Disney Worlds, with some villains in Disney movies (e.g., Maleficient, Jafar, Ursula, Oogie Boogie, etc.).  The graphics of  the game is also pretty decent, with a combination of Final Fantasy and Disney infrastructure.  There are two major cons in this game.  First, frequently, the camera is often too close, and Sora gets blindsided by enemies off the screen.  Second, some of the level designs in some levels is particularly convoluted (e.g., Hollow Bastion and Wonderland).  Overall, this is a particularly great game for anyone, even children.  The game is not too difficult nor too easy for children.  With the exception of some of the hidden bosses (e.g., Clock Phantom and Sephiroth), the game is actually fairly easy.  This game is highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}

Being a long-time fan of COD series, I thoroughly-enjoyed MW and MW2 and felt confident about this game from a single-player perspective. I am glad to say I was NOT disappointed.Being primarily a fan of single-player/campaign games, I found this game to be very well-crafted and well-paced. There is a good mixture of varying gaming elements such as vehicles, turrets, and the typical on-foot FPS action. Controls are slick and smooth as you would expect from a COD title. The plot was actually a pleasant surprise in that it is much more cohesive than MW or MW2; I found it to be much easier to follow despite several twists and turns. Clocking in at around 8 hours, I found it to be just right in terms of overall length; you will find no fillers here, as each mission/stage is designed extremely well.Now for multiplayer -- Having invested many many hours into MW, MW2, WaW, and BFBC2 online, I consider myself not a great but decent, experienced player who is familiar with the variety of games that's been offered out there. After a few hours of playing online, I found multiplayer in BO to be disappointing. Fans of the series are likely to see it as a very slightly-modified MW2. There are some minor enhancements but the overall gameplay is flawed in certain aspects. One example is match-making; when starting out at Level 1, you are required to endure many hours of humiliation by those who have nothing better to do but skip school and play this game all day long and talk trash. Yes I'm talking about the Level 40+ folks. In 10 or so matches within a span of 1 hour, I was matched up against less than 5 players (total in all matches) who were ranked less than 10; this means 90% of the players are far more superior in their perks and weaponry than me, and I stood no chance whatsoever. This is a significant flaw that I cannot understand; developers should know how to match similarly-ranked players together by now. I would rather be kicked to the lobby if there are no players with a rank that is somewhat close to mine (which would be hard to believe given there are always thousands of players online), than to be destroyed by players who make it their life's mission to humiliate others. In my opinion, this match-making flaw is inexcusable, and coupled with lack of depth and variety such as the \"Rush\" mode in BFBC2, I sadly cannot find any entertainment value here.In my opinion, this game is worthwhile for its single-player but definitely NOT for multiplayer.

An excellent variety of characters, beautiful animation, accurate hit detection, perfectly balanced gameplay...it was the king of weapons based fighters. Soul Calibur 2 takes those features and stretches them to their limits. However, while in terms of graphics SC2 blows away the arcade versions of the first 2 games...it offer little in terms of new characters and styles of play. Raphael is a sensable addition to the Soul Calibur roster with his unique fencing style. Talim is also a welcome addition...a petite female character who's lightning-quick movements will give even Taki players a run for their money. That's it for entirely new characters though...Cassandra, Yunsung, Necrid, and Charade are all modifications of older characters with updated moves, ect. Heihachi plays well in the PS2 version, but somehow feels out of place (I would have liked to see Namco get ahold of the rights to Dante from Devil May Cry or perhaps Final Fantasy's Tidus for the PS2 exclusive character). Also worth noting for PS2 owners: There is some minor slowdown when fights get intense, and the load times are slightly longer than the X-Box/Gamecube versions...but it's not so noticable that it's worth whining about. I also felt that the stages were not quite as creative this time around. I guess if you've never played any of the previous incarnations of Soul Calibur before, you will thoroughly enjoy Soul Calibur 2. If you're a veteran of the older versions however, you may notice there are few improvements that have been made. Still, if you're looking for another great fighting game to master, there's no better choice than Soul Calibur 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Good Game, Not Great","reviewText":"I remember when the first Infamous came out it was pretty decent, although I've never been a huge fan of the franchise. To me the game looked good, but a lot of the gameplay was pretty repetitious, well not much has changed. The voice acting is great, and isn't as corny as you find in a lot of games. Also the cutscenes do look really good.The best thing IMO about the game are the psychics, pulling down bridges, flipping cars etc. are really fun ways to fight off enemies. And I prefer the close up combat with the chains as opposed to just shooting the DUP with fireballs. Though there are different power ups as well. Story wise it's well, pretty bland, but then again who is really engrossed with the story in a game like this. It's not Uncharted, (which I'm desperately) waiting for. The graphics are strong, but being from &#34;sucker punch&#34; the same people who designed Sly Cooper (great game btw) they aren't the most realistic. In fact in a lot of ways it's very cartoonish. I'll admit the landscapes look good, but it lacks in real textures, and detail, and many of the city sights look very plain or bland. I also found that a lot of the by standers look very cardboard like, similar to what you might see on a Tiger Woods PGA Tour game. Especially when you run into them accidently. But then again it's focused more on your enemies at hand.So I would say it's a 3.5 but I just really can't, it's a good game, but not really worth the 60$ you pay. Speaking of which I got mine from PSN Day One Digital, and the file size was 21gbs. Not bad for a game like this. I have a good high speed 50mb connection, so it's also to bad there is no multiplayer. Then again what would you do? Also I need to mention this (like Tomb Raider, Battlefield 4 and Assassins Creed) will put a heavy load on your system when you download digitally from PSN, as opposed to installing part of the game from a disc and then playing the rest of the game &#34;using&#34; the disc. Which makes for the fan to be much louder then usual. Puts more pressure on your hard drive (like a computer) because you're playing the entire game from your HDD. Also this does effect framerates on certain occasions. Not huge deal though.So I think the game is good, not great. And the graphics are pretty overhyped, though it does look good it's far from the best Sony has/ or will have to offer I can assure you. I actually think Tomb Raider DE looks much better compared to this. Even though it's just a polished up last gen game. But I love my PS4 and don't have anything bad to say about it. It's definitely the best system out there. I am a little spoiled by PC graphics too I suppose, this is about as close as you'll get. Xbox One won't can't even hold a candle to a game like this. Maybe Ryse, which was mostly quick time looking cutscenes with horrible gameplay. This game even with 3 stars is far superior. So that's my review, pretty plain and simple.

{"product_name":"B0050SY9WC","description":"","reviewerName":"Nanohead \"nanohead\"","summary":"Just one of those games...","reviewText":"Someone here described Syndicate as \"generic\".  I can't think of a better description.Syndicate reminds me of dozens of unremarkable games I've played, that were neither terrible, nor great.  Games like SiN Episodes, Binary Domain, Singularity and Timeshift.  There's a thread of something going on, but its hard to grapple with all the distractions and compromises.  I always wonder why these games got made, when most likely plenty of others most didn't that could have been better.I never played the original Syndicate games, so I have no point of reference to the original story line.  The whole \"giant mega evil corporation takes over the world and oppresses everyone\" storyline has been told and retold a gazillion times.  And the post modern twist of \"and they put chips in your head to control you\" has been added to plenty of those stories, especially in video games.  And its not just Deus Ex (which I played all three installments several times each).There's nothing preventing this generic story from being told well, and having it be an exciting and fun game.  But these guys who built Syndicate weren't on their best form here.  While the story is certainly serviceable, the  gameplay is totally meaningless and unremarkable.  There's one new concept here that I haven't seen before, which is the pretty morbid \"suicide\" power, where you make an enemy kill themselves.  Its pretty original (to me at least), but I felt a bit ashamed each time I used it (in a video game shame kinda way!)Its also one of those tragic games, where you never really know whats going on, and you never know exactly what to do.  It randomly mixes cliche video game styles, such as vent crawling, remote control, time slowing, jumping, smashing, and enemy waves in a somewhat nonsensical blend.  Sometimes, you know exactly what to do.  Other times, you are completely stumped, as there's no real path to take.The upgrade system is completely borked, as I never really had any idea what was happening (you pull a chip from an enemy's brain and you get a new power).  The skill tree is just bizarre.  And then there's the whole tutorial nonsense that appears every couple of chapters.  You are stuck in a simulator, and you have NO idea what you're supposed to do...so you sit there and try a zillion things till you either give up, or randomly figure it out.  Oh boy!And finally, there's the insanity of the visual quality.  Like there is none.... Bloom and blur like you've never seen before.  It destroyed what was left of my middle aged eyes.  I could only play if for short bits of time, and I even hacked the .CFG file to try and get the visuals to be less harsh, but to no avail.  I can't believe that in the age of $100 1080p displays, that the guys at Starbreeze couldn't have at least gotten the darn graphical display quality to be solid.  What a waste.On the good side, the voice acting is terrific, especially the venerable Brian Cox, who plays the generic and cliched CEO.  And there are other competent actors as well, that I'm sure showed up to the recording studio, read their lines, and never played the game. Lucky them.In conclusion, what a waste.  If each component of this game was 10-15% more thought through and polished, it would have been a solid 4 star game (like the unloved Alpha Protocol).  So much for rebooting the franchise....","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options.

It depicts war as a theme park ride. It has a ridiculous plot with a middle eastern and russian bad guy, and an anglo good guy. It celebrates gun culture.All of those are some of the worst aspects of life in America. But you know what? They're also part of American culture. So it is what it is.now, as a piece of art, this really impresses.The level design is really smart, inventive, and imaginative. The way that the game engine is used to depict experiences like climbing up an ice wall is exhilarating. You go on high speed chases, you make daring escapes. The events depicted in this game are out of reach of Hollywood, but are possible here thanks to the magic of digital design.The weapons in the game are...guns.They're not really accurately depicted. Recoil is minimal. setup times are arcade-like. You have tons of bullets and are never in danger of running out of ammo. When you reload a half-empty magazine you get all the bullets back.But somehow they're depicted better than Battlefield 3. BF3 by the way has superior technology all around. But in COD, when you aim down the sights of the gun, part of it blurs out of view, just like what happens with a real gun. In BF3 this isn't the case. The guns in BF3 also sound like a zipper when fired.The BF3 comparison actually is an illuminating one, because in contrast, COD is more artistic, and there are so many small little ways that they use their inferior engine more intelligently than BF3.Anyways, about 2/3rds the way through I just played stupidly and ran around shooting without bothering to aim.What else...the MP is okay, but not that compelling for me. There's mostly just team deathmatch, and I'm not the best at it so I get around a .5 k/d ratio. There's some level up system, but again, not really interesting. The thing is it's so arcadey that it's not interesting. Like, you never really have to count bullets, for instance, or worry too much about recoil. Also, you'll hear plenty of 12 year old boys talking in between matches and that's annoying. I actually find Red Orchestra 2 more enjoyable MP.Anyways, get the game for the single player campaign. Don't take it too seriously. This game is basically like 24 meets God of War. It's definitely worth playing through.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004QEWVTO","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Absurd, Ridiculous, Depraved, Perverted and Amazingly Enjoyable","reviewText":"I really loved Saints Row 2 as well as GTA 4.  Those two came out around the same time and while GTA 4 excelled in graphics and physics, SR2 was a big winner in customization and comedy.  I read through a lot of the reviews for SR3 and what I noticed is that nearly EVERY review that rates under 4 stars is a complaint about the download/disc situation, not about the game itself.  That should tell you something.  I paid $16.49 from Amazon for my game, and it would have been worth it even at 3x the price (though you shouldn't have to pay 3x the price at this point, the game has been out for a year now).This is by far a super fun game.  There's a few issues and complaints, but I still highly highly recommend it.  Here are my thoughts:Good:1. TONS of gameplay.  You can probably get 50 or 100 hours of play out of this, maybe more depending on what you do.  There's a ton of really cool activities, side missions, main missions, etc.  This will keep you occupied for a seriously long time.2. Originality.  This thing is so over the top its really funny.  While GTA takes a more serious tone, this game is all about the absurd.  Where else can you attack people with a giant purple dildo?3. Voice and Sound.  Very nicely done, voice acting is terrific.  The writing is the jewel here.  It's clever, unexpected, unpredictable and always entertaining.  One of my favorite sources of enjoyment is just listening to what people say including my own character.4. Customization.  As in SR2, you can create your own character, dress him/her in outfits ranging from dangerous to sexy to absurd and more.  As a huge fan of customization, I can never have enough and hope they add more customization options in future sequels.  I guess its because most people who play these kinds of games are guys, and while I'm fine to play a game with a male character, I definately prefer being able to have a female.  What can I say, I just identify better with her and while games like GTA I'm stuck with whatever they give me, with Saints Row, I can play a character I identify with better.  Plus I love the different personality options.5. Excitement.  Well, its certainly not boring!  Everything is fun, everything is exciting, I was never bored.  It gets very absurd very quickly, like a bad movie in which you just turn off your brain because you say well, that's just ridiculous.  Except in this game, they know its ridiculous, that's why its there, its poking fun.  The cutscenes are also very well done and frankly I think the story is really engaging and interesting and well done.  Good job!6. Open World.  As with SR2, GTA, etc, you can run through missions, activities or just drive around and find trouble on your own, there's plenty to get into and part of the fun is discovering all the hidden little jokes and silliness that is all over the place.7. Download from Amazon worked perfectly.  Yes the download took longer than I expected, but it wasn't ridiculously long.  It installed thru Steam which was fine, I have nothing against Steam really.  Everything installed perfectly and I have no complaints about the purchase, installation or gameplay access or settings.8. Nothing is censored or sacred.  I truly love and respect that they poke fun at everything.  From Mexican wrestler gangs to BDSM and sex toys to good old fashioned blood, violence and murdering the innocent and the guilty, its depraved, disturbing and perverted and I wouldn't want it any other way.9. My understanding is that SR4 is in development and on its way, so if you enjoy this one, you might not have to wait long to renew your experience.Not So Good:1. The driving is a little too over the top, almost cartoonish in terms of what happens when you hit things.  I think I prefer the more realistic driving physics that we got in GTA4 and even in SR2.  The driving is a little hard to get used to and its a little irritating because the physics are so out of whack.  This has to be my number one complaint.  Over the top story and silliness, good...over the top driving and out of whack physics...bad!  I'm also not such a big fan of all the camera shaking and how the camera goes sometimes when you hit something.2. No Multiplayer Mode.  SR2 had a multiplayer mode, so did GTA4 and they were fun.  This has no multiplayer.  The closest it comes is a co-op mode that will allow you to play through the missions with a friend, etc, and while that can be fun, its not quite the same as having special maps/missions specifically for multiplayer.3. Its a little resource heavy.  I have a quad core i7 with Windows 7, dual switchable graphics cards and a boatload of ram and I get minor frame delays and blurs.  Its not a big deal, not too frustrating but I think if I had a lesser computer it may have been an issue.4. Graphics.  I thought the graphics were nice but I felt that they were maybe 1 level under GTA4.  I thought SR2 was 2 levels under GTA4.  That didn't bother me because SR2 came out at the same time roughly as GTA4 so I figured they were just a little behind the graphics curve.  So yes progress has been made but since its been like 3 years between games, I would have thought more progress would have been seen in the graphics department.5. Vehicle Damage.  I felt like vehicles took and showed damage better and more accurately in SR2 and GTA4.  Maybe its a symptom of the over the top driving physics that annoy me, but I feel like you don't get a real feel for the damage.  Sure, pieces fall off and you see dents and scratches, but I go from missing a door to the car blowing up pretty quick.6. Challenge.  Even on its hardest setting, the game isn't very challenging.  That having been said, I suppose if you really wanted a challenge, you could simply not do the upgrades and that would make things a little harder for you.  Besides, I get the feeling that the point of this game isn't really to challenge you in the way that many shooters and driving games do, but rather to entertain you.  I wonder if the point then is to provide a stage in which to share all the over the top jokes and fun and you go through it and play sure, but is not so hard that you can't stop and really enjoy all the absurd wierdness going on.  if that was the thought process then maybe this isn't really a con.  It's kind of nice to just go through in a less stressful way such that you can pick up on and enjoy the silliness.7. Shaundi.  I loved the slutty funny Shaundi in Saints Row 2.  In this version she's a lot more serious and a lot bitchier.  For SR4, please bring back the old Shaundi who was had a great sense of humor no matter what.In conclusion, if you enjoy GTA or SR games in the past, GET THIS GAME!!  You will have SO much fun and be so entertained for so long.  You will get your money's worth and then some!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

While I played this game, I thought \"This is the game I've been waiting for...\" and didn't want it to end.  It's an emotional experience far more than any zombie slaughter game could ever be.  I became attached to the characters (everyone is different)as if I were one of them in the group, and made decisions about the direction we were heading and planning what to do next.  The voice acting and characters were very good.  However, it's the excellent story that kept me moving forward, intent on the safety of everyone in the group.  It's a rare game that can bring out \"the better angels of our nature\" like that.  In other games I don't think about whether or not I \"care\" about characters- ally or enemy: kill or not kill is all the same.  Like I said, it's great writing that did that.There were some problems with lag time but I never had to restart the game- it's a minor gripe.  The combat controls weren't the greatest but that added a little more difficulty, which is fine, since it's not a combat based game anyway- reminded me that these characters weren't mercenaries with high powered weapons with scopes, but normal people.  Please comment if you know of any other games like these upcoming or already released.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Not your typical COD experience","reviewText":"Yes, you ultimately end up shooting at wave after wave of enemies. And yes, the campaign is still short enough to finish in one day. The multiplayer is still populated by hundreds of thousands of players. This is Call of Duty. You do not fix what is not broken. You tweak it, you modify it for the better, but you do not fix it. I am an avid Call of Duty fan. I truly enjoy picking up a controller and playing a few rounds before or after I finish up my homework. I have come to expect a certain type of game from Call of Duty. A fast paced, well made, intense first person shooter that is accesible by casual and hardcore gamers alike. As of late, I have heard the same complaints that follow every single Call of Duty game before and after release.  Namely, that this Call of Duty game is a carbon copy of the one that preceded it. The multiplayer is too generic, the campaign is too short, etc. etc.I honestly believe that this Call of Duty game is a cut above the rest. Let's look at this game objectively. The campaign has branching story lines, with multiple endings. It has a new type of mission called Strike Force that allows you to take control of a squad of soldiers and mechs. Prior to a mission, you can modify the weapons you take into combat. The story (while not perfect by a long shot) attempts to humanize a villain. This is not a villain that is evil for the sake of being evil, this is a villain that is evil because of the circumstances that led him to this life. There are actually cutscenes in this game, not just before action reports that notify you of some crisis happening on the other side of the world. It just felt different to play this game. Playing Modern Warfare 3 truly felt like I was playing some added missions on Modern Warfare 2. Black Ops 2 did an excellent job of distancing itself from Black Ops. Yes, there are recurring characters, but this game just feels like a creation all its own. Not too mention the fact that this is the first Call of Duty game that is set in the near future. The soundtrack is great, and graphics are actually pretty impressive in some areas. The cutscenes with Frank Woods are VERY impressive in terms of graphics. So this is a different Call of Duty campaign. Yes, the basics are still there. But how much can they change the basics of the game before they just deviate completely from what makes a Call of Duty, a distinctive Call of Duty game?The multiplayer has been given a few significant changes, for the better.  There are now two types of online matches that you can participate in. You can do your regular public matches, and now you can participate in league matches that rank you with players in similar skill sets. This of course allows you to participate in matches that are close and very intense. The type of matches that are neck and neck at any given moment. Creating a class has been given a complete face lift as well. Creating a class now works on a 10 point system. Every perk, weapon, piece of equipment, and attachment costs one point. So if you're the type of player who largely ignores your secondary weapon, you can forgo equipping a secondary weapon in favor of an extra tactical grenade, or an extra attachment on your primary. You can potentially run into battle with nothing but a primary weapon and 3 attachments and a whole slew of perks. This level of freedom with customizing is pretty impressive in a Call of Duty game.Zombies has been significantly expanded as well. You can now participate in two different types of gameplay. Tranzit, which has a bus taking you from site to site while you mow down legions of zombies. You still have your traditional zombies mode where your stuck in a map and your killing hundred of zombies in waves. It's still fun, and ridiculous.So, what's the take away here? Treyarch did a good job of creating a different type of Call of Duty game. It's still familiar enough that it welcomes current fans, but it changes things just enough to give it a breath of fresh air. I thoroughly enjoy this game. It's fun, and for the first time ever, I actually want to replay the campaign just so I can see the different endings.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

Although the game is not without its problems that are irritatingly noticble now (a horrible translation, bad grammer, etc) for its time this game was revolutionary. Square made great use of FMV technology to progress this very anime like story line. FF VII is one of three titles argued to be the best of them (VI, VII and VIII), and is the game that started the RPG revolution that made Playstation what it is today.These days this game is sorely dated and this game should be remade using GCN technlogy. I do not believe that they should make it realistic. Idealy I'd like to see them use toon shading in this remake idea to replace the 3D monstosities which were featured in the game originally. The original charcter models were inconsistant and largely overly blocky. However the battle scenes and major FMVs offered a whole lot of anime potential.

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"Very Gripping Campaign","reviewText":"The only games I own by Ubisoft are the AssassinsCreed series (all 5) but I've never tried any of the other titles until I bought this one. Open world games are extremely fun in my opinion, and the ability to &#34;free roam&#34; and do quests in any order you like is a major plus with me.  Let me start off by saying that I was been blown away by the amount of content this game packs ...... there is just so much to do here. What's also great is what so many other reviewers have mentioned already, you can strategize in so many different ways to complete your objectives. Stealthy ? .... then sneak around and throw rocks and take your enemies out w/a close range takedown, or go in full bore throwing grenades with guns firing away. My favorite style is using the Sniper. I would say the most satisfy part of the game is doing the Out Posts, what a blast !!  I think someone wrote about this already, but being able to hide crouched in the bushes and shoot open an animal cage, then watch the predator maul everyone in camp is pretty cool stuff. Ubisoft did well in this area, just a great job.The hunting can be very rewarding and I compare it to Red Dead Redemption & Assassins Creed 3. What separates FC3 from those titles is the 1st person perspective. The predators strike w/o warning sometimes ... I've been attacked by alligators, sharks, snakes and EVEN some dogs !!  Because crafting is such a vital part of upgrades, and the &#34;need&#34; to carry more ammo becomes more important, devouting some time solely to hunting every now and then is beneficial.I've put in many hours already and I have not dug very deep into the campaign but the story pulls you right in immediately. Being captured on a remote island and being put into a position to rescue your friends and escape may sound like its been done before, but the story writers really know how to draw you in and make you CARE and get after the bad guy .... he's heartless and I look forward to taking him down.Controls: If you've played any of the Assassins Creed games you'll notice a familiar feel with certain parts of the game. In AC you do all of the viewpoints to open up the map and reveal locations, in FC3 you need to do Radio Towers to do basically the same thing.  I had some issues with the controls because I've been playing Halo 4 recently. Grenade controls and Melee attacks are opposite, I'm finally geting used to it now !! Driving can be a little quirky at times but its not bad. I cannot comment on the multiplayer because I have not tried it yet ....... BUT I have not even finished the game and I already bought the DLC, that should tell you how much I like this game.I am so glad I got an email from Amazon when they had this as the deal of the day. The delivery was fast and it arrived earlier than expected.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2013"}

The story was interesting and the open world gameplay was strangely addictive.  My biggest complaint was the narrative often went off the deep end.

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"Excellent VALUE","reviewText":"When this was released awhile back, Rockstar (or Take2 - whomever owned them at the time) gave xbox fans something most companies don't, a deal. 2 very large worlds, 2 very long games, at 1 price.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Review Pending Ending Not Known But Now Its Known And Not Four Stars Anymore, Now With A Long Title Too","reviewText":"I have followed Mass Effect from the beginning and remember playing the first like it was yesterday.  Putting that game in for the first time and having my first red ring of death before it got to the start menu.  The characters, the actions I could take, the emotional draw, and of course the people I could sleep with all made for one fantastic series.  I am happy and sad it has come to its end or well Shepards storyline at least from what I have heard.  The series for me has always been love lots of parts and hate a little of others.Anyways I must say I haven't finished the game yet but am at the mission right before and decided to do some side missions.  I have seen the reviews regarding the ending and I am gonna see if that's whats gonna kill this game for me.  From what I have read it almost sounds like an old Twilight Zone episode or some old horror movie from the fifties or sixties but not really sure yet .  I am sure I am gonna beat it real soon but wanted to get my review out of the way before.  The ending from what I have read really doesn't bother me but it does feel like it doesn't sound as epic as the character you have developed.  This game is hard to rate for me and probably one of the hardest one I had to really ponder.The games starting set piece is awesome and I said from the start this is gonna be five stars all the way.  I intentionally read no reviews or anything since the game came out.  This games scope is big but the gameplay feels absolutely small.  I was hoping being it was the last in the series everything would feel like that first set piece but unfortunately it never happened in so far as I have gotten.  The ending could be the big come back but that has yet to be seen.  The game itself felt way to simplified even modding the guns and powers.  Nothing felt like much except the story which is good enough for me to wanna get through it.  There was alot of things I just ran through and others I pondered.  The only thing I did find that was great was the emotional draw since everything was coming to a close things needed to end and people needed to get dead.  That's right get dead.  Be it that kid from the beginning or that guy or girl doing that thing (no spoilers).The thing I loathed this time was there were so many fire fights that seemed set up like any other third person shooter.  If you see cover than odds are you're about to fight.  I saw cover, saw ammo, saw health and that was the set piece quite a bit.  Almost like a Gears of War and less like a Mass Effect.  The rpg elements felt weak and out of all these games I would say the first is my favorite though it was kind of a disaster to organize equipment and all that.  The second streamlined it and the third feels completely useless.  You merely build up your characters traits and nothing more.  I think if I hadn't of built my character I still could of completely beat the game irregardless.Its of course is difficult for a developer to one up the previous games but this one just felt rushed at parts.  My next problem is how you run into people from previous games which is a small problem but kind of a dumb setup.  At first I was like awesome Garrus is back but by the time it happened the third or fourth time I was thinking it was ridiculous.  Surely they could of just had a distress call from an old friend or something like that but instead these people just show up.  Its like a galaxy and a world of people and you run into these people.  Its almost like they didn't want to have individual moments so they just put in quick run in moments with these people.  Some come back for the journey and others don't.  One thing that irritated me also was how no matter my decision in some moments I couldn't save certain characters.Decision making is still there but still in my mind didn't seem like it made that much of a difference at times.  The first two games you could feel the weight of certain decisions more so than this one.  The last games side missions were a lot better than this one as well like one that sticks out is when you land on a planet and everyone is under the influence of this man.  Nothing like that in this one.  Maybe it was more for a sense of urgency for part three, I don't know.  My memory is kind of mixed up about these games since for some reason I thought Shepard had a jet pack and some guy had a sword that was a gun too which I am pretty sure is Farscape.  I can't tell you the exact mission but remember enjoying them a lot more.  I am glad the planet scanning from the last game is gone but this one way over simplifies it and its kind of boring.Don't get me wrong though some decisions are heavy such as a Geth or Quarian dilemma.  That part was one I had to reload my save because I couldn't bear what happens if you choose the wrong one.  The characters of course are the draw and those of us who have followed the game from the start have become attached to them.  Those decisions were the ones that felt heavy which means those that have the fate of squad mates at hand.  This game just felt like I could rush the dialogue with some people and not really miss anything.  Those moments with Thane, Garrus, Miranda, Tali or any of the squad were the ones that really mattered.  Seems like the decision making and the characters were really all that matter in the series or maybe the most important part.The music pieces are phenomenal especially in the moments with that freaking piano music.  It really adds to the impact of whats going on and will almost make me teary eyed.  I have never cried in a game but there were those moments that you could get the emotional impact deeply.I haven't played multiplayer and don's really plan on it but I might give it a try sometime.  I don't like the ability to play online affecting the ending or whatever it does.  I think it just helps out you totals but I am not really sure. I like multiplayer don't get me wrong but I never wanted it in a Mass Effect but I guess it doesn't really change anything its just a nice addition.I have a hard time with completing certain games and usually procrastinate since I have spent so much time in them.  I find myself a little bit depressed when I am done.  I think I will feel that way at the end of this one when all is said and done after spending so much time with these characters and finally seeing it over is gonna be tough.  I am not an overly sensitive person by any means but this is how my brain works for some reason.  Be it a good or bad ending I will be sad to see the trilogy over.I must say three stars still since the gameplay is o.k. but the story is great and its worth playing and seeing it through.  I might buy the trilogy later since I don't own any of them but have always rented.  For all the bad I might of pointed out the game is overall still very good and I am gonna miss it when its over.  This game has been a joy as far as I care and it has its up and downs like most games but its been a good overall experience.I will update this after the ending and see if it changes my rating or not.UPDATE AFTER MY COMPLETE PLAYTHROUGH.....SPOILERS  Still not terrible but loses one star for emotional distress.Oh my goodness, I will say I was fine with Shepard dying and giving his life for the galaxy.  The final set piece of fighting on Earth was somewhat boring and not well implemented.  Fighting just the same enemies that made it feel more like horde mode than anything.  Out of every gun fight in the game the last Earth well London fight was my least favorite until Shepard takes on the Reaper and everyone gets vaporized.  I have no clue if my squad died or not since it doesn't show anything just Shepard waking up bloodied with bodies around him.  My guess they all just stood at the top of the hill and watched me run like a maniac.  I think they could of made it more explosive and exciting and quite a bit more fulfilling.  In comparison the endings to the first two were better in my eyes. In fact there were more enjoyable levels in any of the games.  The earth level was just a let down.  I did enjoy the fact of saying goodbyes and the such to your old pals.  I thought my relationship with Garrus in this game was almost brotherly and my love interest Tali made me wish my character survives it all.Oh yeah I never played any multiplayer since I merely rented this game didn't want to buy the game pass.  Most of the time it will give you a trial but nope not this time.  I couldn't max out my assets or anything but still almost got a whole green bar.So when you reach the Citadel thats basically it for the action besides the interaction with the Illusive man that kind of dragged on until the ending.  It was kind of helpful in the advancing of the story but than the Illusive man goes into a \"no one tells me what to do\" childlike sentence.  I chose my choosing and wrapped up the Illusive mans story for him and made my way to my final destination after my talk with the Crucible.  I liked that piano piece of music in this game and the emotion drained out of me.  I didn't cry but I could feel the impact.  You kind of have a flashback of old friends and I wish they had drawn that out more.  I think Shepard dying is fine with me but what happens after the Mass Relays explode gets on my nerves and rubs me the wrong way like single ply toilet paper.The issue I take the most is the fact that as far as my other squad mates there is no full closure.  Once Shepard dies in whichever way you choose you have a brief few minutes of a ending and a crash landing which based upon your stats decides if anyone survives.  That was my rub first since how the heck were they all on that ship since I just saw Tali and Garrus in London but they were on board that ship with Joker.  Either way you go the relays are gone so everyone is basically stranded and you got yourself a dead Shepard.  Unless you get that perfect ending or whatever that rumor is floating around.  The one where Shepard lives.  Your crew of whoever I think you were choosing the most during gameplay walks out of the ship.Worst of all when your friends are coming out of the plane (for me anyways) out comes Joker than Tali and than Garrus.  I was like even if I survived my love interest is now far away anyways.  When I saw Joker look over at Tali with a smile on his face I wanted to destroy him (I got EDI killed as far as I know).  I know what he's up to.  I thought I want Shepard dead anyways since he won't be with his best friend and gal.  Now that I know Tali isn't a freakish alien faced woman I cared more for her.  I can only hope she is pregnant with the now dead Shepards kid and hates everyone because of my fate.I thought it would be fun if Joker comes out and you see like dinosaurs walking around them as if they landed on a prehistoric planet.  Then Garrus comes out and say's \"here we go again\".  They then all start laughing and its freezes like a eighties show.  Least that way I could of felt better about the ending.  Play on my nostalgic childhood to win me over.Alright seriously I understand what all the fuss on the endings is about now and it really didn't feel like justice to a game that's consumed so many people.  Engrossed in a world and then its over relatively fast and the sense of closure disappears.  Seems to me the ending would be the most delicate part of the series that would of taken a good amount of time to get through.  I was looking forward to this after Shepards fate type moment but never got it.  It almost feels like you made choices in every game but in the end they really don't matter.

{"product_name":"B0050SX9VO","description":"","reviewerName":"Mindful Consumer","summary":"an ambitious sequel","reviewText":"first off, i will write this review with one: no spoilers, and two: an assumption that anyone who reads this has either played or is familiar with the first installment of the game.borderlands 2 is beyond an amped up version of the first game. it is bizarrely colorful. it is more difficult to survive. it is more fun to try. the guns are more unique. the gameplay feels better. the interfaces are better. the customizations are better. the skill trees offer more options to do bigger and better things. overall, it's pretty slick.the basis of the game is that pandora has been taken over by handsome jack (clearly hiding something behind his strange mask) who is looking for someone to help him open the vault so he can harness some massive power locked inside.if you spent any amount of time with the first, you will have the feeling that this is very familiar, yet completely revised, beautified, and streamlined.my impressions were as follows:grenades! in the first, grenades were more or less useless. here, even the early types you see can be AWESOME! some can combine crazy damage with transfusion, singularity, homing abilities, and various elemental damages. some turn into their own little flaming turret-like creations.customizations: each character can change as various skins and heads are unlocked. i felt the first game lacked in this area. it isn't vital, but it certainly is fun.item sharing: either between characters you play with in co-op, or between your own characters, the interface/s to share weapons and such is a welcome addition.badass rank: the tokens earned from this can be spent on leveling up various attributes (i.e.: maximum health, elemental effect chance, gun damage) which go into effect across all the characters built from your profile. it felt nice to be putting in better stats across the board on my characters.the guns! how could they get better? they did! the legendaries (orange) and some e-tech weapons can be remarkable, however entirely elusive. the drop rate for these items (especially legendaries) is absymal.slag is a new element this time around. slag can coat your enemies and make any further damage really knock them out.i will insert my peeve here: any time you look at a weapon, either in a gun cache or as a dropped item, it doesn't show the proper ammo type, it just shows a generic magazine next to the magazine size listing. i feel as though the rest of the weapon system is so thorough, why not just show the accurate ammo type (i.e.: sniper, launcher, shotgun), as this leaves it up to the image, and potentially the proper name of the gun to tell you what type of weapon it is. most of the time this is obvious, however there have been a few times so far that i haven't been able to tell right away. you can tell once you have the weapon in your backpack, but when looking, you have to just 'know' based on the gun image itself.in conclusion, here is a general roundup:concept: take borderlands. add steroids. and sugar. and red bull. and helium. shake it all up and let it loose. oh, and add an intriguing story (yes, we get one this time. and the villian is a truly sadistic b-hole.)graphics: as much as i loved the first one, i would have liked to see more color. there are beautiful colors everywhere in this installment, be it from the environs to the enemies and everything in between. there were a couple of technical glitches here and there, but nothing that huge.sound: the music is more cinematic than the first and the voice acting is quite good. i'm so happy claptrap is back! also, the voice chat feature for the ps3 is DRASTICALLY improved (thank goodness!). it was awful in the first one.playability: everything feels smoother. yes, if you are playing co-op, there is still lag if one player is accessing a menu screen, but i'm not sure if that could ever truly be fixed. or if it can, it hasn't been yet.entertainment: i bought the ultimate loot chest edition from amazon, AND bought the game on midnight release from gamestop so i could get their pre-order bonuses as well as have the opportunity to play it sooner. i played the hell out of the first one and continued to play it right up until the release of the second. i am certain i will play the hell out of this one as well.replay value: i have completed the game six times (on three different characters). the additional dlc available certainly adds to the overall scope of available gameplay, however none of the dlc packs so far have been all that great, and certainly not as large as randy pitchford said they would be. hopefully the fourth pack will make up for some of that.this is an engaging game, and hopefully it is well-supported by gearbox now and in the future.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

Since then the games have had their ups and their downs. In my opinion, as well as nearly everyone I play with, consider Halo 4 to be the best most well-rounded game thus far. The graphics are amazing, the story is amazing, the new weapons and enemies bring a whole new strategy to the game, and spartan ops is a great way to keep players hooked with the FREE side campaign. Episodes release weekly for that. The only drawback I really see is that there is no simple firefight where the objective is to survive as long as possible. It would be nice to get that back!

It was an open world-styled rpg much like the other Elder Scrolls games. But over the course of my playing it, it felt that everything became pointless. Many of the quest rewards were terrible, except for those in the expansion packs ofcourse. When the final update was released, it was a sign that Bethesda had truly given up on the game, leaving the game to be as unstable as unusual. If you want a game that requires you to tweak the hell out of the game BEFORE playing it and gameplay that is about as casual as Candy Crush Saga, then Skyrim is for you.It was the ONE game where Fast Travel was actually required. The tragic part was that I actually liked to explore and remembered about Oblivion that I wish it were bigger... so much bigger infact. I'd always encounter the invisible boundry that were set into the game, which ofcourse annoyed the ever loving crap out of me. But a game that requires you to fast travel, rather then explore... no thanks! Skyrim is casual due to the new perks system that was implimented, allowing you to put points into every skill in the game. Where is the challenge in that? Forcing the player to set fake challenges is something that I've never liked and this game is bad about that. The game was so terrible that I literally broke my disc into two pieces so I couldn't play it again. Yes, it is addicting as hell... but that really isn't a sign of it being a great game.The color in Skyrim was drab, it was dull as heck! Atleast in Oblivion color was plentiful and was found everywhere in the game. I'd rather play through that then snow, snow and more snow. If there was one thing that was more annoying then the color, it was the voice acting. They must have only hired a small number of people to do the voice acting for every freaking character, because many of them sounded too much alike. Going back to everything being pointless, this includes the guild quests. Atleast in Oblivion and Morrowind, you actually HAD to be a thief to get anywhere in the thief's guild. In skyrim, it is merely an adventurer's guild that specializes in stealing and forging, so what? I want to be a thief, not raid a bunch of lost tombs because my guild cannot resolve their own issues.Morrowind had the three houses and Skyrim has the civil war, which sucks. If you want a good ending in the main questline, you are (once again) forced into participating and finishing the civil war. What is worse, the rewards are terrible and there aren't enough changes made in the game world. If you join the rebels and drive away the imperial forces, you don't get to rebuild in favor of your faction, or anything like that. There are no viable quest rewards for the effort it takes to finish the civil war, besides controlling the outcome of the main story... big deal.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2014"}

The story is set just like a movie, with great character development, action, and stroyline.  Its set in 1911 in the west, as government expansion is creeping in.  You play as John Marston, a former outlaw who is trying to live a reformed life with his wife and son.  Federal agents take your wife and son and force you to hunt down the men you used to ride with and kill them.  The story takes place from the southern American border to Mexico and back up to America in an epic action adventure.Pros: Several outfits to choose from and perform in game tasks to unlock more, play poker, blackjack, break wild horses, bring in criminals dead or alive, decide wheter or not to help strangers with certain tasks such as; return stolen money to a shopkeeper, return a stolen horse, duel against strangers, help local law enforcement find missing people and hunt down criminals with large posses, and several great choices for weapons, you can buy and sell at general stores, doctors offices, and gunsmiths, etc.  (Once you thought you beat this game, it keeps going).  Sometimes its fun just to ride on your horse and see what you find out there.  (And thats just single player mode)Cons: Really the only thing that was annoying sometimes was controlling the horse.

If you liked Oblivion I'm pretty sure you'll like this game; although the story isn't as deep.  In fact it is a bit thin.  This isn't your hack and slash, linear RPG.  It is open and very difficult.  You have to take your time with this one and be very careful of what you do.  You have to know your enemy and your surroundings or you will get squashed.  Dying is inevitable and frequent; especially if you are wreckless.  This is a free warning to those who think they may get frustrated at this fact.  This is one of the reasons I've given this game 4 stars out of 5.  You will die so much that at some point you'll ask yourself why you bought this game; at least I did.  However, you will realize why you did when you see how massive the game is and the limitless things you can do.  The graphics, although not groundbreaking, are still breathtaking.  The enemies are crazy especially the bosses.  Hell, when you finish the tutorial you will get a nice hint to just how massive they can be and at the brief moment you will ask yourself (before you die), \"how the hell am I going to beat this thing?\"  Overall, I think this will be a great experience.  There aren't very many outstanding RPGs on the PS3.  This is one of them; and I will go on to say that this will be a big sleeper hit.  A must buy for RPG fans especially you Elder Scroll fans.  If you are into Final Fantasy, don't even bother.  Die hard gamers who been playing for years will enjoy this more than anything.  It's reminiscent to Dragon Warrior, Ultima in terms of difficulty.  A must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2009"}

I played House of the Dead Overkill with this gun and it REALLY enhances the immersion in the game. From the pump action reloading to the satisfying trigger pulls, you have no idea how fun PlayStation Move games can be until you pair them with one of these.Literally the same day I received this accessory and played with it, I ordered another one so I could do 2 player games with both of us using one of these.I previously bought some of the pistol-type accessories, and they're cool too, but once you try one of these it's hard to go back to a boring pistol.I also like the spot for the Move Navigation controller. I thought those were pointless since you can just use a normal Sixaxis/DualShock 3 controller to navigate, but I ended up buying one anyway just to &#34;complete&#34; this accessory. It makes it much easier to navigate menus and adds some good weight to the bottom of it. Some Move games (such as Killzone 3) you really need it to play at all since it's not really workable to use a DualShock analog stick with the Sharp Shooter for anything but menu navigation.You will need to check compatibility before buying any games though. Some games utilize this better than others. My favorite so far is House of the Dead Overkill. Other pretty good ones are Killzone 3 (non-on-rails games like this need the navigation controller for movement), Socom 4, Resistance 3, Time Crisis, and The Shoot. Mag used to be, but it was online only and the servers have since been killed. Some games like Sports Champions 1 & 2, and Toy Story Mania are really great Move games, but don't have any kind of good integration with this peripheral. For example, Toy Story is basically a shooting game, but the buttons are arranged kind of dumb, and even if the Move controller is in the gun, you'll still use your thumb on top of the controller to shoot instead of being able to use the peripheral's trigger.But for games that fully or mostly support it, this thing is AWESOME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2014"}

You will be able to play emulators with an NES layout controller! 3rd Party, Not original.","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"Some limitations but overall a great choice","reviewText":"I got this controller for use on the Raspberry Pi mini-computer, and I'm pretty impressed. Not only does it work with no fuss in even the Pi's limited Linux distros, it recreates the feel of classic NES play flawlessly. This feels EXACTLY like a NES controller, right down to the concave buttons. Even the fastening points on the case are right. The weight, as others have said, feels right on as well. Overall build feels very good- none of the controls are mushy in the least, the select and start buttons are soft rubber, and unlike some competing models, the black and grey faceplate is appealingly textured and glued on completely tight.There are some issues. The soft rubber middle buttons are EXACTLY the same dimensions as the apertures they pass through and so get stuck sometimes (I expect this to break in after a few weeks of use). The B button is also a little finicky- it demands a light touch, but this also seems to be breaking in (or maybe I'm just subconsciously learning to use it right?). The sensitive B button may also be a product of voltage limitations on my USB hub; time will tell. These are both minor inconveniences but they by no means take away from the fun and precision of playing oldschool games with a truly excellent oldschool controller. I definitely plan to buy another- even with hiccups, they are an AMAZING value for 7 dollars, especially with inferior versions retailing for three times the price in stores.PROS-Outstanding, tough-feeling build quality-Fantastic value (about half what a real replacement NES controller cost back in the 80s in fact)-Weight and feel that are virtually indistinguishable from the original-The priceless value of a time machine you can hold in your hands :)-\"driverless\" joypad design all but guarantees operation in any environment that supports USB (I can verify the Raspberry Pi, see other reviews for how to use it on other Linux boxes and in supposedly unsupported flavors of Windows)CONS-Cord is actually 1.8 meters, with the advancement of TV-to-room ratios this may no longer be enough to reach your couch ;)-Sensitive buttons (may be a votage or break-in issue, or just a glitch in mine)-Sticky start key (this also happened with the real thing though)-Lacks the ergonomic refinements and inputs of its successors (but that's not really the point)FINAL THOUGHTS-Off the top of my head, this controller matches the button layouts of the NES, Master System, Game Gear, Game Boy/Game Boy Color, and Turbografx (if you can live without the turbo settings)-The controller seems to have EXACTLY the front dimensions of a real NES controller, so if you have any ancient controller decals sitting around, you can probably apply them.-Obviously this controller ISN'T capable of meaningful performance in modern games with analog inputs, a dozen buttons, and tilt sensitivity. And a classic Ferrari 250 GT has less horsepower than a Kia Optima, but it's still a better car.UPDATEAs I predicted, the wonky button behavior with this controller has calmed down with a bit of use. It's irritating having to break your controller in, but I guess I'd rather that than have a controller that's loose and cheaply built from the get-go.UPDATE 2Bought that second controller and it behaved right out of the box and configured just as well.

I have reduced my score and impression of the game to 1 star from 2 because of something I recently discovered about the game in a interview with Motomu Toriyama the games director. I found out when reading this that square/enix had decided to leave the game as a cliffhanger and extend the ending through DLC. Yes thats right, if you want to see the games ending youll have to buy DLC. Aside from that evidently character stories like for Lighting and some other characters. So basically if you buy this game and you want some of the characters stories and the ENDING TO THE GAME you will have to pay extra money. Ive always strongly opposed DLC because while in essence its a neat idea but in reality it will eventually become a something to exploit more money from customers, a way to make their 60 dollar game turn into a 90 dollar game to get the whole experince you should have gotten in the first place. When you buy a game for 60 dollars and then buy DLC for it for 10 or 20 dollars you are telling developers \"Yes I am willing to spend 70 or 80 dollars on one game\" and eventually they will start charging that. But thats a story for another day. In the end if you want to beat this game and see the end be prepared to pay even more, you can find the stories easily on google by just looking for \"final fantasy xiii-2 dlc ending\".I'm bored with this game. I last about 25 hours into it and its just a generic, clich&eacute; and mediocre rpg like square has been making for over a decade now. Sadly the reason I don't care for square games is they care more about graphics and cutscenes than they do crafting a interesting story, well designed characters and a well written and overall fun game. This is no exception to the rule because it's obvious the graphics are what they cared about first and foremost in this.A big problem with this game is that it seems like a really great game and that its very well done, but that's because you're comparing it to the first one that was panned more or less universally. See the first one was such a big deal to everyone being a major final fantasy title on current systems on 360 and ps3 that everyone got so hyped up and when they found current gen tech still doesn't make square games any better they were severely bummed out. So by the time this one comes around its still not a very good game but it is at least what the first one should have been. So then they play this and expectations are so low that even though the game stinks its better than most think it is. Kind of spending 20 years of your only eating stale rice cakes for all your meals and then one day someone gives you a ritz cracker. Sure the ritz cracker is just a plain old boring cracker but in comparison to 20 years of rice cakes you would swear that ritz is a new york strip steak and the best tasting cracker ever created.I just very much get the sense of \"I have been here before......A LOT of times before and I seem to recall this being more fun\". I just found myself going through the usual paces, not really paying attention to what passes for a story because its either so uninteresting I can't be bothered to pay attention or its things Ive seen before in a hundred other games or its simply so poorly thought out that it doesn't make much sense. All the characters are just generic and sterile cookie cutter Japanese style characters. The battles are easy and not much fun, the fighting becomes very grindish feeling pretty quick. Even the most action packed cut scenes still can't raise an eyebrow or heart rate because they stink of the same style and flair square has been using for a long time now.Was also quite disappointed at the fact I hadn't even gotten my copy in the mail and I reading news of the DLC they are going to release. It makes me even less interested when a dev starts pimping dlc before the game is even cold on the shelf.Bottom line is I should have waited till this was 20 bucks. Its generic, sterile, bland, boring, uninspired, just like a dozen other games square has done and feels more like square pulling the lever on the register than actually trying to make a game.Essentially I equate square games and this game in particular to a big budget blockbuster hollywood movie that's directed by Michael bay. Yes it has a big name behind it, yes it had millions of dollars spent on making it, yes its special effects are impressive, yes it's been hyped up a lot, yes a lot of people are talking about it, yes its another one in a long line of sequels to a franchise. But its also really boring because its designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It's made to be like a shotgun blast trying to hit as many paying customers as quickly as possible. So essentially it has dumbed itself down in order to try and be as generic as possible so the largest amount of gamers will buy it. It has no personality, no unique feeling, no heart, no soul and it's no fun because it's purely a product created with the one and only sole intention of selling as many possible copies as it can. It wasn't created by talented people, it wasn't created with any love, it wasn't created by inspiration, no care went into it, it just simply a game created to make sales based off the fact it has the final fantasy brand name in its title and that is all. This game is to gaming what essentially michael bays transformers movies (especially the 3rd one) to film making.With so many other really great quality games out there from talented developers I can't even begin to suggest anyone play this or purchase it. Between little downloadable games to other full price retail titles there is no real reason to spend 60 bucks or even 25 on this game. Want a newer Japanese rpg? Then go and buy atelier totori the adventurer of arland, disgaea 4, or runes factory tides of destiny instead and have a much more unique experience playing a rpg that's actually fun and tries to do its own thing.If this game did not have the words \"final fantasy\" in it then I guarantee you the reviews would be a lower across the board. That's the problem with final fantasy is it's like rodney dangerfield in his old age; yeah he is faded, does a lot of dumb stuff and no one really likes him anymore but people will despite all of it still give him way too much room and credit because of his name. And that's what final fantasy is, its just a name that makes fanboys squee with glee and something gamers will buy even if they don't care for it just so they can be part of the crowd that plays ever FF game because it's a knee jerk reaction.Trust me, save your money because you can buy multiple other games with what this costs and have a much better time in the end. Wait 3 months and get it for 20 bucks off ebay. Final fantasy is the proverbial old dog that can't learn new tricks and no matter how many times it will fetch the ball at some point it stops being amusing to the person throwing it and they end up doing so just because that's what they have always done.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.......","reviewText":"Capcom has a long history for having crossovers such as this. You can imagine my surprise when I found out about Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. It was something that came out of left field and hit me, something I wasn't expecting at all.I won't lie, I really wasn't expecting the game to be any good at all. Although deep down inside I was hoping I'd be wrong. I think my biggest worry was that the story that brought the two together would make no sense whatsoever. Thankfully, Jimmy Palmiotti, Justin Gray, and the Mortal Kombat developers were able to pull it off.  Not only that but, add to the mix, great character models and graphics-detailed environments-all-new fighting mechanics-signature attacks and finishing moves. All that adds up to some serious fun. Despite a little bit of a learning curve, it's an incredibly deep fighting game. One that will have MK fans or even DCU fans playing over and over and over. The kombatants in this game are as follows:Scorpion, The Joker, Sub-Zero, Catwoman, Sonya Blade, The Flash, Shang Tsung, Superman, Kitana, Batman, Jax, Wonder Woman, Liu Kang, Deathstroke the Terminator, Raiden, Lex Luthor, Kano, Captain Marvel, Baraka, Green Lantern, Shao Kahn & Darkseid. Shao Kahn & Darkseid merge to become Dark Khan(the MK vs. DCU BOSS).One thing I love about MK vs. DCU is the story mode and its' animated in-game cutscenes. I hope that the developers of the game(which is now Netherrealm Studios) continue this way of storytelling. It kept me engrossed til the end.The game isn't without a few flaws, however. Apparently, Midway decided to take a more bare-bones approach to this game. There isn't much in the way of unlockables & extras, other than bios, endings & credits. I was hoping for something like the Krypt(from the MK games)where you could work towards obtaining different outfits for your kombatants or seeing development sketches of the characters or unlock music from the game or more. Sadly, that ain't the case. Second, while I was able to adjust, I found the learning curve to do the combos and whatnot a little too time consuming to learn. Third and lastly, Online isn't much to talk about. Instead of boring you by telling you how, just try it for yourself-if you get the game. You'll see what I mean. I will say, for the record, that even though online isn't much to talk about--it is fun to play. Be forewarned, though, players online live and breath this game so get you some practice before you play. I totally pwn as The Flash when I play online,lol.Other than that, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe is a competent fighter that's worth your hard-earned dough. Just don't expect much more than that. It's different than your regular MK titles, even though this game is an MK title through and through(if you get what I mean). Although we'll probably never see a sequel to this game, I'd love to see one. It's a real blast to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Dragon's Dogma Dichotomy","reviewText":"Working on my backlog of video games I started playing Dragon's Dogma a few months ago and recently completed the game. In that span of time I've run the spectrum of emotions concerning DD - from loving the game then later to hating it. Ultimately reflecting back on the title I've concluded that this is a very mixed game with many redeeming features and an equal number of frustrating shortcomings.--------------------Basic Plot (spoiler free):Dragon's Dogma is set in a fictional universe and takes place on the continent of Gransys. The game begins with an epic introduction that will have you squaring off against a massive Chimera (part lion, part goat, with a serpent for a tail). After a brief encounter a little later with `the dragon' that serves as the title's antagonist you're forwarded to the sleepy sea-side village of Cassardis. Before you start your adventure you're given the choice to build a fully customizable character or use one of the preset models. If you're the sort of player that enjoys spending a lot of time making your character look \"just so\" then you'll be pleased with DD's character customization offering.Back at Cassardis, your newly created character is soon thrown into the midst of a chaotic scene as the dragon makes its appearance dropping through a portal in the skies high above the coastal village. The dragon swoops into the village destroying much of it and killing villagers. Your character finds a sword and confronts the dragon. Only instead of crushing your character underfoot the dragon steals your character's heart and disappears. Soon the villagers start calling you \"Arisen\" a seemingly fabled and lauded cadre of heartless heroes that have battled the dragon throughout Gransys' history. That marks the beginning of your quest; to rid the world of the Dragon.--------------------Gameplay:The gameplay in Dragon's Dogma is best described as action-RPG with a 3rd person, overhead camera. You directly control your characters on-screen movements to include dodging, blocking, swordplay, casting, and everything in-between. Fans of action-oriented/hack-and-slash RPGs will be right at home here.In addition to your main character you will also get to customize and design a main \"pawn\". Pawns are interesting albeit somewhat strange entities in the Dragon's Dogma universe. Not quite human but resembling humans pawns are sort of like expendable humanoids that augment your characters party (main character plus 3 pawns with one \"main pawn\"). Pawns lack emotion or free will of their own and really apparently only exist to help the Arisen. Pawns are recruited to your party either by directly interacting with them as they wander the towns and countryside of Gransys or by entering \"the Rift\" a purgatory like in-between state where Pawns come to a fro. Your main pawn cannot be swapped out and is yours to customize as you see fit (character class, equipment, looks, etc.).Interestingly, the Pawn system is like a social network of its own. Your Pawn can and will appear in other players games (as long as you're connected to the PSN) and will receive Rift Credits (like a currency) that you can use to recruit more powerful Pawns yourself. Other gamers can even gift you items and provide feedback on everything from the looks of your Pawn to how they perform in battle.The Pawn system is somewhat limited, however, in the sense that you cannot really control any but your main Pawn and even then it's a frustrating mess at times. Pawns will act within a certain parameter and within the abilities assigned to them, however, cannot always be relied to do so. Further, even with your main Pawn you can't control abilities, select attacks or spells in combat. Additional Pawns in your party have even less control in that you cannot even equip them without gifting the items to the Pawns true master. Confusing? Slightly, yes.--------------------Graphics:Dragon's Dogma is by no means an ugly game. In fact several of the locales are quite nice looking. The lighting engine is particularly impressive especially when traversing a dark cave or castle ruin with your lantern equipped and seeing light and shadow play out nicely in tight corridors. The game features a fully day-night cycle and also has some impressive lighting moments when the sun is setting. Beyond that however, the world of Gransys can be strangely devoid of detail and life. There are lots of empty open areas between locales and calling the world sparse would be an accurate description.Characters are nicely rendered as is equipment but there again seems to be a lack of convincing detail. Your main characters lack of convincing detail is highlighted at many points and particularly when he/she is interacting in what are supposed to be highly tense or emotional moments.The world of Gransys seems large but that is due to another shortfall that I'll get to in a minute. The map once fully explored is surprisingly small. Beyond Cassadris, Gran Soren (capital and focal city of the game) there are really no other towns, villages or cities to explore. When you do stumble on what initially appears to be a neat castle or town it's always disappointingly deserted.--------------------The Parts Capcom Got Right:(+) This really is a Role Playing Game. In an era where games like Borderlands is being called a RPG it's nice to see a game worthy of the description.(+) Deep character customization. You can spend hours getting your character just right.(+) A lot of equipment, items, materials and a full combination system that allows you to combine things to make new powerful equipment.(+) A deep sense of exploration and discovery as you stumble around Gransys and take in the environment. Sadly so many RPGs have lost this key element.(+) The enemies. From the fantastic to the mundane. Many liken some of the enemies in DD to the Colossus in Shadow of the Colossus. While I don't think the scale is anywhere as impressive in DD there are some fantastic enemies to fight. Everything from Chimera, to Golemns, massive Ogres and yes, Dragons.(+) Challenge. This is by no means Demon's Souls but this game can offer quite a bit of challenge. The difficultly can be adjusted.(+) Class system. There are enough classes and diversity between skill sets to have truly unique gameplay experiences with different characters. The classes vary from up-close melee style, to mages to rogues and ranged classes.(+) The last \"boss\" battle in the game is done very well and truly deserving of the description of \"epic\".--------------------The Parts Capcom Got Wrong:(-) No fast travel. Or at least not in the same sense as you've likely gotten used to in games like Oblivion/Fallout/Skyrim. For the vast majority of the game you're going to be trudging around on foot constantly revisiting the same areas and fighting the same enemies over and over again. Once you do get the ability to fast travel it's extremely limited. You literally have to visit the location you wish to fast travel to in person, place a specific item then use another item to fast travel back to the Gran Soren. If you wish to fast travel to another area then you have to physically move the item to your intended destination. Fast traveling also uses up an item called a Ferrystone. It's very rare to just find and also very expensive to purchase further limiting the system.(-) Pawns. The system is an interesting experiment but one with more failure than success. Just the simple lack of control is what ultimately cripples the Pawn system. I can't count how many times my Pawns simply stopped doing... well, much of anything. I set up my main Pawn as a Mage/support character but have no way to command her to use a desperately needed healing spell in the midst of battle. Instead she might be off wandering around or casting something else that isn't helpful in the situation. Or just exploring a ruin somewhere and getting a message that my main pawn is incapacitated because she jumped off a cliff and then needed to travel by foot the nearest Rift Stone to summon her back. Perhaps worst of all is the running commentary that all three Pawns have going at all times and concerning everything you do. I wish Capcom had added the ability to completely turn off Pawn commentary.(-) The silent protagonist. Some games are able to pull off this type of hero. Dragon's Dogma is not such a game. Your character looks more like a plastic, emotionless action figure than believable hero. Because the main character never engages in anything beyond simply looking stupid it takes away from the events unfolding on screen.(-) The story. Or the almost completely lack thereof. You'll piece together enough of the story through the rare cut-scene or through NPCs but there are so many parts of this game that don't fit or make any sense. For example there is a certain character that falls in love with the Arisen. Randomly and after almost no interaction. Said character plays a part later on that again makes no sense given the lack of interaction, emotion or any believable context. You're just supposed to suddenly be concerned with the wellbeing of this character because Capcom says so without any work in the story or progression to make it believable or fit in the context of the game. There are countless elements that are like this. Characters come and go. Subplots are opened, explored a bit and then disappear back into the Rift.(-) A resounding lack of anything interesting in the world. Capcom spent all this time developing a large(ish) world and then populated it with almost nothing. Where are the towns, villages, people and interesting things to do?(-) Nonsensical elements. I know I'm playing a game developed by a Japanese gaming company when in one moment a Dragon is laying waste to the people, land and buildings in an area and then in the next moment (post battle) everything appears good as new. Or the tacked on love interest that makes no sense. Or the Dragon stealing your heart. Or the Duke randomly strangling his love interest after finding you in her room (inappropriately) then just acting like nothing ever happened. There is so much random in this game I wonder if the original Japanese script features all these awkward moments or if it's just a localization issue.--------------------Closing:This is perhaps the most mixed game I've ever played and reviewed. Is the game worth playing? Yes, though only if you're prepared to and accept that there are quite a few flaws present.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007FMSDUK","description":"","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"A worthy successor to 999 (spoiler-free review)","reviewText":"A few years ago, a little known game from Japan called9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doorsmade its way to the United States.  The game was a visual novel interspersed with escape room puzzles.  If you're unfamiliar with the visual novel genre, it is a reasonably popular type of game in Japan which typically contains a branching story, lots of text (occasionally with voice acting), static visuals, and music.  Visual novels are not popular in the United States, which explained why 999 came in under the radar.  Nevertheless, it quickly received strong praise from Western reviewers.  What distinguished 999 from its other visual novel brethren?  Besides the fact that it got translated to English, 999 had fantastic writing, an incredible story, and interesting characters.  At the time of its release, the creators of 999 were unsure whether they would make a sequel, and the main writer (Kotaro Uchikoshi) publicly made it known that whether a sequel would be made would depend in large part on the reception 999 received both in Japan and in the US.Well, 999 did sell well enough to justify making a sequel, and this game is it.  Like its predecessor, it is still a visual novel interspersed with escape room puzzles, so if you've played 999 you have a good idea what to expect here.  If you haven't played 999, I *very strongly* recommend playing 999 before playing this game.  While the story of Virtue's Last Reward stands by itself reasonably well, you will gain a better appreciation of the themes and characters in VLR if you have first played 999.  (There's also the fact that this game spoils a large part of 999.)What's different between VLR and 999?  The major changes include a shift from 2d to 3d models, voice acting for everyone except the main character, and an explicit flowchart which keeps track of your progression in the story.  Initially, I was skeptical of some of the changes, especially the addition of voice acting, but after playing the game I think all of these changes are for the better.  The visuals look sharp, the voice acting is really good, and the flowchart makes it so that you never have to solve the same puzzles twice even if you want to explore all the branches of the story.  (In other words, the flowchart not only provides a visual representation of the branching nature of the story, it also allows you to jump to any part of the story you have seen and change your decisions or replay the puzzle or novel sections of the game.)If you've played 999, you know that it has one of the most mind-bending, insane stories in all of games (or for that matter, all of popular media).  I don't want to give anything away about the story in VLR, but I think it's safe to say that the story does a good job of keeping you hooked and provides its fair share of \"omgwtf\" moments.  Like its predecessor, the story could only be told in an interactive medium like video games (in other words, you couldn't make a book or TV adaptation without heavily distorting the structure of the plot).  The characters are probably even better developed in VLR than 999, which partially is a function of the fact that VLR is substantially longer than 999.  Zero III is one of my favorite game characters of all time (up there with GLaDOS from Portal), and his/her voice actor is simply brilliant in this game.The puzzles are more or less of the same flavor as in 999.  You find yourself stuck in a room (or complex of rooms) with a few other characters, and need to figure out a way to open a safe which contains the key to exit the room.  This typically involves exploring the environment - unlike many escape room puzzles, all objects you need to obtain are in plain view and easy to interact with - and then solving some sort of logic puzzle.  These puzzles range from easy to fairly hard, but if you're not an expert at puzzles, don't worry: the game provides an easy mode where the other characters will give you hints on how to proceed.  In contrast, on \"hard mode\" (which is the default mode), they will give you very few hints, and the ones they give you are often either cryptic or obvious.I only have a few negative comments about the game.  I purchased the Vita version, and I found the touchscreen controls to be slightly less accurate than the stylus controls for 999 on the Nintendo DS.  This is especially noticeable when you try to write (you can keep notes in the game) using your finger, but you can probably get around this by using a capacitive stylus.  Also, the heavily branching nature of the game lends itself to a fair amount of repetition, since at any given branch point there's still a considerable amount of overlap in the events that follow regardless of the choice you make.  Fortunately, you can fast-forward through text you've already seen.  The branching can also make it hard to remember the preceding events in whatever path you are currently on, because of the extensive amount of jumping between paths necessary to complete the game.  (On the other hand, this feeling of disorientation was probably intentional...)  Still, these are minor quibbles, and others might not find these issues to be a problem.In summary, VLR is a great sequel to 999.  It's one of the best games available for the current generation of handhelds.  If you're a fan of 999, get this game.  If you haven't played 999 before, but enjoy great stories and puzzles, get 999 first, finish it (make sure to get all the endings), and then get this game.  It's a shame that games like this aren't more common in the United States, because 999 and VLR are some of the best games made in the past few years.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"What the Resi series of games does, it does well - OTT Hollywood-style scares and genetically-mutated things that go Bump In The Night. RE 3 is no different, providing more of the same for fans who love it. It also boasts one or two gameplay improvements, but somehow can't quite get back to the glory days of the first 2 games in the series.The plot follows the heroine from the first game, Jill, 24 hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the T-Virus in RE 2. A novel concept, and one which Capcom surely intended to exploit fully. The inclusion of the Nemesis character, a Frankenstein-like monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish, is also a nice twist, adding much-neede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance. The menus and controls are also tweaked, most notably the inclusion of the 'Turn' and 'Dodge' features, which, if learned properly, add hugely to the gameplay.Graphically RE 3 is as good as RE 2. It's as detailed, and lush as before. The intro is strangely disappointing, being lo-res and choppily animated - the PlayStation 1's power is being overused. The sound is good, though, and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control system.The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game's production. It's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so, and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot. The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially. You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths. Also, Nemesis, though an excellent inclusion, is again too intense for the early stages of the game, and more often than not you'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he's dispatched you. Again.As the game continues, you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you, and you will end up running past the majority of them. The satisfaction of knowing a Zombie is cornered just isn't there anymore. You also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase you're too busy avoiding some ridiculously over-populated area.A vast, sprawling game that does yield some rewards for die-hard fans, RE 3 is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty. The storyline may also confuse newcomers. If you're a fan who doesn't mind being confused and frustrated, then check it out. If not, wait for something better, like Code: Veronica, or anything in the Silent Hill series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2003"}

Yes it does have it's mature elements, but it fits the world where the game takes place.The story is very emotional, and easy to get absorbed in. Of course you have lots of side missions with quirky, and usually very entertaining characters to encounter and help out. One of my favorites so far is you encounter a man with a makeshift stand who wants to legalize pot.  Your character chooses to smoke some with his encouragement of nothing bad happening, until after he takes a hit. Then the man mentions, except for the monsters.The rest of this mission is under a haze, a gatlin gun, and drug induced aliens attacking you. It's an extremely funny situation.Outside of the enjoyable story that \"will\" keep you playing for many hours, you get a free and open world to explore.  You get to do all sorts of things like play sports, develop skills such as stamina stealth, or flying (a plane i'd assume). You also have the ability to purchase guns, grenades, knives, an assortment of upgrades to your vehicles which you can save for reuse, and so much more.This is one of the best games of this year.  It's no secret it's scored so high with many professional reviews. It's clear the developers invested a lot to make this game a robust experience in video games.If you enjoy any of the above elements, and don't mind the high-end violence (or like murdering countless video game people) you will LOVE GTA V.I haven't touched on the online mode as it's not available until October.

It is hands down, the best portable racing game I have ever played. Okay, so I haven't played a lot of portable racers, but I'll even go so far to say it is in the top five racers I've played on all systems, portable and console!  It's that good!I own Burnout 2 and 3, both on the X Box.  I was instantly interested when I heard that a port of Burnout 3 was coming to the Playstation Portable.  Having become a HUGE fan of the Burnout series on the X Box, I knew (well, at least hoped) that the PSP version would be even half as good as what I had become accustomed to  Well, you know what?  It was!  Maybe even better, in its own PSP sort of way.I was a little hesitant to get my hopes up for any kind of mode even close to the original, but EA did an excellent job of mimicking the console's positive aspects, including the spectacular crashes and sense of speed.  The sense of speed is so great, that I actually have to hold the PSP close to my eyes, because I feel like I'll hit something I don't want to before I can turn.  At first it seems like a negative; but after a while you get used to it.  It adds to the excitement that you are so close to having a spectacularly spectacular crash, THEN BOOOOOOOM!!!!  Big time crash.Various modes, also included in the Burnout 3 version offered on X Box and Playstation 2.  But, there is the Police Car Chase mode, where you get to chase down a \"Gangster,\"  I have already gotten the \"Gangster car\" but still working on getting the other bonus cars.I love taking down Oil tankers in crash mode.  They explode across the screen, with spectacular results!  Watch the screen for clues of bonus points, and \"traffic patterns\" to give you information about how to make a great crash, and earn mega bucks.  One thing I don't see in this game is \"heartbrakers.\"  Hitting them cut your score in half.  No complaints, but I'm wondering if anyone missed them from the console version?  Maybe they only exist in multi-player on the X Box?Okay, no custom soundtracks.  I think that would be a nice feature, if Sony could pull it off with Tracks saved on my memory card, for example.  This was a feature that got a lot of mention, but apparently never came to fruition.  Maybe next time.  I don't really dig on the current mix of songs, but the game gives you the option to lower the playability, or completely turn them off, song by song.  A nice feature.My favorite game so far on the PSP.Fun Factor:  10/10Graphics: 9/10Replayability: 9/10Sound: 7/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2005"}

I've always preferred passive, strategic games and simulators over the newest multiplayer shootemups.  But...I got irresistibly curious after all the hype and publicity surrounding this game.  So I downloaded the 97+MB free demo and I tell you right now, this game has made me radically change my mind about online gaming. \"It's so kool!\"The first thing that got me hooked to this game was the simplicity in getting started right away.  I loaded it and immediately was surrounded (and humiliated) by online assassins.It wasn't exactly the graphics that surprised me, but the playability.  The movements are smooth, easy to control, the environment is crisp and clear.  Be careful though, performance depends on factors such as system specs and connection speeds. The current MINIMUM requirements are Pentium III 500mhz.  I assume that you need to have a faster system a good video accelerator and probably (read again, probably) a high-speed Internet connection (cable, DSL) to take full advantage of this game. That's the good thing about the demo.  Although it's a huge download, it's free and you can determine how it works on your system.Initially the interface was a little complicated for me since I'm not  used to the newest 1st person games, but the designers really made a good effort to make the interface intuitive enough to make it simple and avoid frustrations.You can play deathmatches, team play, flag capture and other variations.  I prefer death matches, it makes a very entertaining and quick virtual gotcha;  you actually feel the adrenaline rush as you crouch, strafe, jump and shoot for your \"life\".The program has a customizable weapon priority feature where you can determine wether to arm any weapon you pick up during the game based on its priority.  If you are carrying a high-priority weapon, you will keep it armed if you pick a low priority one.  This is a nice strategic option that everyone should take a look to improve their survival rate.  You can also manually select your weapon, of course.What can I tell you about playing online, there are thousands of people playing around the clock, so it doesn't matter if you want to play at 12pm or 3am, there's always someone available to be challenged.  Or you can setup your own LAN at home and have a blast.I think my review hasn't even covered 10% of the game (I'm playing a demo) but if this just 10% or even 50%, it is definitely worth a future purchase.A definite winner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2002"}

Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Gareth Mc Bride","summary":"A solid Entry into the series.","reviewText":"Capcom has hit the ball out of the park with the very enjoyable latest chapter in the classic Resident Evil series, Resident Evil 5. This time out, Capcom has wisely eschewed the on rails gameplay of the recent Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles and allowed gamers a full range of movements to explore the detailed landscapes of the game.Playing as Chris Redfield (from the original game and Resident Evil: Code Veronica), the game is set roughly 10 years after the original game and sees Chris travel to Africa in order to investigate a reported viral outbreak at the hands of the Umbrella corporation.  Shortly after his arrival, Chris meets his new partner, Sheva Alomar and sets out to investigate the strange happenings in the local town.Before Chris can even get settled in, hordes of infected locales are laying siege to he and Sheva forcing them to fight a defensive battle.  As the duo move about the decimated town, they discover that a team of soldiers has been decimated by an unknown force. When Chris and Sheva locate a disc of information, they soon find themselves in a race not only to deliver the date and solve the mystery behind the infection, but for their very survival.The game uses the same over the shoulder perspective of Resident Evil 4, and in a new twist players must work with their partner to complete the game. This to be honest, was a mixed bag for me, as while I was grateful for the help, healing, and company Sheva provided me, there were times where she was in the way, or responded in a manner contrary to what I was trying to accomplish. Thankfully you can opt to use a flesh and blood player to back you up and for certain segments of the game, I found it easier to play with a human rather than the A.I. character.It did take me a little practice to get used to the controls and inventory system as well as the ability to upgrade weapons and attire. Once that was down, and I was able to focus on my game, I found that I really enjoyed the game.While it has been a source of some controversy amongst fans, I found the mostly daylight setting of the game to be a novel approach and found myself immersed in the story. While it did not provide me any real scares such as did Dead Space, it is a entertaining and enjoyable game, and I took great delight in shooting an oncoming enemy, and being able to finish them off with a well placed stomp.Playing on my Playstation 3 system, I really enjoyed the vibration function offered by the Dualshock 3 control as it was a perfect compliment to the solid audio and amazing visual quality of the game.While the controls and the a.i. were at times an issue for me, I was able to work around this and found myself really getting into the game. While it is a departure from past games in the series, I applaud the designers for stretching out instead of just recycling the same formula again and again.As I mentioned earlier, the sound and visual quality of the game is amazing and the dynamic and natural lighting effects added a sense of immersion to the game that really helped sell the story. While not perfect, Resident Evil 5 is a solid and enjoyable game that should delight fans of the series and provide a great gaming experience to new fans.4 stars out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2009"}

First and foremost if you already have TR:Legend and Anniversary for the Xbox 360and are wondering if there is a difference in video quality the answer is yes,while the previous mentioned console versions video quality was good Square Enix has indeed done a very good job and remastering much of the previous two games so that you get very sharp and detailed clear video graphics with this trilogy.As for the last game Underworld I really didn't see to much of a difference in video quality though that is somewhat understandable as that game was the newest one released so far.There's really not much more to tell about the trilogy especially if you've already gotten other HD collection sets like Jak&Daxter;/Ratchet&Clank;/Sly Cooper,so for fans of the series or those who like adventure games in general here's a great purchase not only for the affordable price but now you no longer have to switch disc to play one of the three games....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Jack M.

Everything about it feels like a budget game.I enjoy some of the Cabela's games on the big-boy consoles, so I was looking forward to trying Deer Drive Legends (an aside, what's up with that name?  By title alone I expected to be driving John Deere vehicles...).  When I actually received the game, I flipped it over and saw a giant picture of a T-Rex!  Alright!  Who doesn't want to hunt rabbits, deer and DINOSAURS?!When the main title comes up, its pulsing in and out over and over, saying 'Check me out!  I'm in 3D!'.  The menus are very basic, no frills, just get in there and start killing wildlife.  There is no tutorial... at all.  You're just thrown right in there, a couple circles on the lower touchscreen and a scenic mountain valley on the top screen.  Time to dust off the instruction booklet like it's 1994. I felt that the controls worked surprisingly well.  You aim with the stylus, look with the circle pad, shoot with the left trigger and reload/zoom/change weapons with the D-pad.  There is also a non-stylus configuration, but I liked aiming with the stylus.  Also, the hit detection seems to be spot on.  Hit a deer in the lungs *BAM* lung shot bonus.  Hit him in the heart *BAM* vitals bonus.The game begins and challenges you to shoot 5 deer in 2 minutes.  This is much harder than you'd expect as tons and tons of moose keep running into frame, and the game alerts you with a flashing arrow whenever a moose shows up to come attack you (I had no idea moose were so hostile to humans).  Meanwhile, the deer that you're supposed to be targeting, have no indicators at all, and look a lot like doe, which the game penalizes you for shooting (as do most hunting games).  There's also rabbits hopping around, and eventually birds and wolves and whatnot.  It took me, a 30 year old adult, five tries to pass the stage.  The next stage challenges you to NOT shoot five doe.  I thought that was the point of all of the stages?  Also, you're given a high powered rifle that chambers one bullet, and a pistol that chambers five bullets.  The difference between weapons is very, very slight, so I almost exclusively used a handgun... to hunt deer.The music is bland, but inoffensive.  There are also online multiplayer modes, but no one was playing when I tried to join.Pros:- Decent control scheme- Good use of 3D- Pretty scenery- Excellent hit detection- Killer moose- At some point you presumably get to fight a T-Rex, if you make it past the list of...Cons:- Too challenging for the target audience- Bare bones options- Five gametypes, little variety- Boring menus- Unexciting weapons and power-ups (IN A SHOOTING GAME)- No tutorials- Killer moose?  Really?Overall, I would recommend this as a kids game for families who hunt, but the game itself is rated T for Teen citing 'blood, violence, sang'.  That's not a typo.  I'm not sure what 'sang' is or why it's offensive.  (EDIT I think 'sang' is French for blood...)  Also, 3D is only recommended for ages 7+, and that sounds about right.  When it hits the bargain bins and you're looking for a shooting gallery type game, you could do worse, but there's also several better options to spend your time and money on.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2012"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife.

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Robert Jenkins \"video geek #1\"","summary":"Worth the N64 purchase price by itself...","reviewText":"In this, one of two installments in the Zelda series for the Nintendo 64, you once again take on the persona of young Link (or whatever you choose to name him), as he embarks on a quest to save the land of Hyrule from the dark forces of Ganon.  One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser.  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man.  Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game.  They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part.  There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with.  Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots.  The controls are wonderfully intuitive.  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it.  You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential.  In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task.  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game.  They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier.  One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows!  Later in the game, you will be glad you did.  Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars.  They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game.  Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword.  Don't say I didn't warn you...Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one.  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule.  These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.All in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect.  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan.  But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!  You'll be glad you did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2002"}

Titanfall is a lot of fun to play and in the end, that's all that really matters. The game looks great, with detailed backgrounds and graphics. A big fuss was made over the fact that the game is output at a resolution of 792p instead of 1080p. These arguments are silly. If you're looking for the best graphics you've ever seen in your life, then look elsewhere. Titanfall is all about the gameplay. It's a breath of fresh air in the first person shooter genre, a game that is guaranteed to get you involved as you wade into battles with your friends.The controls are absolutely wonderful, polished to perfection and completely intuitive. Before you know it, you'll be wall running and jumping in and out of your mech like if it were second nature. The sound is good also, with weapons packing a nice aural punch and surround sound used to great degrees.A campaign has been shoehorned in and I'd be lying if I told you that I paid any attention to what was going on in it. The campaign is basically multiplayer matches with a bit of a story going on. Now, I don't know about you but trying to pay attention to the dialogue while avoiding death is just something of an impossibility. It's nice that it was included but it wasn't really necessary in the end.I want to stress that the game is really meant to be played online with no single player component whatsoever. If you're looking for single player, this isn't the game for you and I cannot recommend it under those restrictions.Titanfall is THE Xbox One game to own right now and very well the game on next gen consoles to own in general, period.

You try it !","reviewText":"When I first saw the low price of this game on Amazon I said... this game must be crap. Considering this is a Namco-Bandai game (one of the best companies in designing great games such as Tekken and  Soul Calibur), I thought I was worth buying to give it a try.Now I can tell, if you love beautifully designed graphics, simple gameplay and a solid story, then you must play this game. It's only 14 chapters long, and each chapter is really short, but it's always full of nasty enemies and depending on the difficulty you set on, you'll get some time dealing with messy creatures.I am now kind of disappointed about the achievements system, because the game has 58 unlockable achievements but many of them come from the side story \"Pigsy's Perfect 10\". The problem is, if you want to play the side story, then you must spend 800 additional  Microsoft Points. Not a bad deal considering this game is really cheap on retail, but then the side story should have their own achievements attached. So in other words, if you want to complete all achievements in this game, then you have to purchase the DLC.I don't want to spoil anyone here... but I'll just said this... the ending... I was not expecting what's been seen in the epilogue. It's just kind of weird to combine video game graphics with... you know. Although it might seem innovative, that felt kind of weird for me to see. And not only the epilogue has these humanized material but also all masks flashbacks. I don't say it's bad, it's actually kind of cool, but yet, weird.The environments and cut scenes are awesome in this game. It's just nice to relax and watch the progress of the story once you have dealt with all dangers in a chapter.The cloud parts are just awesome. I've never played anything similar before. I would just like to have access to the cloud in all stages, that would make exploration a lot more interesting. And yeah, it's kind of lame that at certain points of the game you just can't get so far away from Trip or else you die. But well, that's also a part of the plot.Anyways... I definitely recommend this game. It's pretty funny and addicting. To a certain point, you just don't want it to end. So yeah, I agree with everyone when they say this is a little short. But I guess the story is now open to wait for a sequel. Gosh, I'm really looking forward to it.Graphics: AwesomeSound: AwesomeStory: AwesomeDifficulty: AverageTotal Gameplay: Around 14 hours","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

With Nintendo, they absolutely have delivered with the success of the Wii and the DS. But, last year, they've made a shocking decision to finally end their run with longtim success of the Game Boy franchise after nearly 20 years of success. Still, Nintendo has found a new system that delivers just as well. back in 2004, Nintendo launched the DS, which won a whole new audience of gamers who love the way we use the stylus and innovation of gameplay. Since then, it absolutely has changed the way we play video games on the go. Now, it has once again gone blue, 4 years after the original Nintendo DS release.The Nintendo DS Lite in Colbalt and Black, is a new way we see the essence of blue, with this blue-colored look of the system, that appeals to boys and the seductive color of girls' eyes too. The system is sleek and easy to play all your favorite Nintendo DS games and also your Game Boy Advance titles like Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Brothers 3 on the go. The system also includes a much longer battery life than the original DS system, and is easy to charge up. The look of the games is even better than the original DS on all your favorite titles like New Super Mario Brothers, Nintendogs and Brain Age 2. You can also compete against other gamers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection for special titles through a wireless connection with ease. The price is also affordable at $129, unlike those other hard to get systems like the Playstation 3 or the Wii, so anyone who wants to buy a video game system whether it is on a budget, or if you trust the Nintendo brand can get this great system.All in all, I love the Nintendo DS Lite in Cobalt and Black is a great video game system for gamers of all ages. I absolutely recommend this great handheld system because it is well worth the purchase, and it will keep you gaming for years to come. If you've bought the orignal Nintendo DS or a longtime Game Boy fan and want to trade up, than this is the game system for you.Price: AConvience: ABattery Life: A-Greaphics: AControl: AFun & Enjoyment: AOverall: A 1/2-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2008"}

I've been into them since the SNES days. And when the 64 came out, WWF War Zone became my favourite, then Attitude, but then THQ started bringing out there WCW titles. I hated the WCW, so I never played them for quite a long time. I never had a go at their first release they brought out, but I somehow ended up with a copy of WCW VS NWO Revenge, at first I was focused to find every flaw I could and put it down and never look at it again, but each day I found myself playing git more and more and more and when THQ lost the rights to WCW they picked up the rights to the WWF and released a game that became my new favourite instantly, \"WWF Wrestlemania\" . But as the N64 was on it's way out, THQ gave one last release and made the best Wrestling game to date. I've played a lot of wrestling games, and a lot have come and gone, and a lot have had lasting value and quality, but none like this game. Next to Wrestlemania Arcade this game is the best.There is a tonne of Wrestlers who each have 4 slots. What I mean by that is when you select your wrestler; you can select 4 different versions of that wrestler, with a different look of clothing, or hairstyle or something. Some even have a different character all together. You just press one of your buttons to toggle through them all. And a great option is that you can change every single character. You can change their cloths, name, music, everything except there moves. That mean you can completely replace a wrestler who is a default in the game if you want. Or you might just like to Change one of the 4 Rikishi's into Yokozuna, or change one of the slots of Kane and clone Undertaker so that he has the Tombstone as his finisher instead of the \"Last Ride\". The best thing about it is that you do not need a memory card; every thing is saved onto the cartridge itself!There are heaps of matches, and you can choose pretty much whatever rules you want. From pin falls, hardcore, iron man, tag, 2 on 1, 3 on 1, cage, rumble, and even a great ladder much that is a lot of fun to play with friends. The best thing is you can now go back stage. You just whip your opponent up the entrance way, and you can fight in the stage area, then you can whip them back stage again and fight down a corridor that has doors that lead to the boiler room, a locker room with a table you can smash your opponent through, a pool room that you can slam your foe through the snooker table, and a car park. Back in the arena you can also send your enemy crashing through the announcers table! And you can pick weapons out of the crowed at any time, and even use the ring steps! There is a lot of Weapons to grab, almost everything from the WCW REVENGE game is back, but not all, but there is also great big beer cans, al snows Head, books, briefcases, fire extinguishers even a big cheese! There heaps to find.You can battle in a kind of season match that has story lines to follow, but once you have completed that it becomes very boring, that has no lasting value there. There is also a survivor mode. Which is basically an iron man 4-way battle royal. You have to eliminate 99 other wrestlers to win! You can throw them over the rope to eliminate them, pin then, make them submit or TKO them. If you make it all the way through you get Andre The Giant as a hidden character and he becomes selectable, but the more opponents you eliminate, the more points you get to use in the shop. The shop is a place where you buy new things, from weapons, to costumes, even moves!The create a wrestler is terrific. The moves look great, and there is so many more new moves added to the game then the last titles. Plus there about 20 slots with 4 each in them to choose from.The controls work very well, and there is not just one special move to every one, all depending on where you are, wether you are grappling, at there feet, on the rope ect... then great moves can be done.Where there is good, you have to accept the bad as well. If THQ where still making games for the 64 then they would not these flaws and use it to improve the next version, but everyone is done with the 64.- No \"in-ring\" intro. Your wrestler comes out to his theme music and titan tron video, but he only poses on the stage area, they don't walk into the ring anymore and do there in ring poses.-- Tag team partners only come out together in season mode. They are separate intros in exhibition modes.-- It's really annoying in royal rumble modes when somebody is eliminated and you have to wait about 10 seconds for the next wrestler to run down to the ring and get in, they should have shown that in the back ground and let the game resume instead of doing it the way they have. It is also annoying when you have your \"spirit\" meter flashing to preform your special moves and it has run out by the time the next wrestler has gotten in the ring.-- They have taken out the test of strength showdown. In the last few games if both opponents tried to grapple at the same time they would lock into a test of strength and whoever was the better of the two would get the advantage to preform a move to break it up.-- The Undertaker's theme music is a song is RAW. Not whatever his theme song was at the time, either American Bad### by Kid Rock or Rollin,Rollin, Rollin by Limp Bizket. Why didn't THQ just give his old dark side theme or something?-- There are great double team moves, but there are a few missing, it would have been nice to have the \"double choke slam\" that Kane and Undertaker used to do. Or the Tennessee Jam that Too Cool did when one would hold there opponent in a back breaker and the other would jump of the top rope and leg drop the guy being held. Or the move the hardy boys do where one kneels down in a doggy position and the other springs off him for the sidekick.-- There is too many Mick Foleys; I think having 12 of him in the game is too many, particularly in Rumbles. But you can just edit over him.Despite those flaws. This is still the best wrestling game there is. You probably would be able to fix some of those flaws in a rom version maybe, but this is the `still played by me' n64 version.So layeth the smack down, if ya smell what the sock is cookin'. And that's the bottom line or you can suck it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2005"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse.

In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover.

That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

To give you an idea of how small it is, it is about 1/3 of the size of the older system, I was quite suprised at how small it was. It is almost as small as a portable CD player.The big advantage with the PS One as opposed to the older model is the fact that it can be easily transported, so if you are off to a friend's house, on a trip, or need something to keep the kids occupied during the long road trip, this is essential. All the old Playstation games work with this console, and it also plays any audio CD. The Dual Shock analog controller makes controlling the games (those that support the analog controls) easy and stress-free. The memory cards go into the usual slots. The only thing that the PS One system lacks is a reset button, so you have to turn the power on and off to restart a game.If you are lucky enough the have the LCD screen, you have a portable system. You can take it anywhere, and enjoy all your favorite games while on the road, or at least enjoy the quiet while the kids are busy with it. Like older systems, the PS One is carrying on the tradition of being re-designed with space saving in mind. Remeber the old NES and SNES? Just before they were discontinued, they would re-designed in sleeker, smaller systems. The PS One is now very inexpensive, so there is almost no excuse for not having one.With a vast, solid library of games, the PS One is a sound investment. Believe it or not, it wasn't until September 2001 that I ditched my old SNES (under duress, I might add) and bought a Playstation. A lot of the games are classic, and can suit amost any taste.

You can host, join, and make your own type of game to play online with many people. Even though this game is very old, people still play online, lots of people. Yes the lag is pretty bad but there are amazing places to go and fight for you team. The main thing that i did not like on this game was how hard it was. If i can remember, i died on the first level. Pretty sad right? But it takes forever to beat beacuse it is so hard and the controls get a time getting used to. The underground sewers are a confusing and very hard place to fight. So take your time getting used to it and play all the way through, you are up for a challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2010"}

Frantz 2.0","summary":"The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct","reviewText":"As a fan of everything Walking Dead I had to get a hold of this game. I didn't know what I was getting into due to the lack of pre-release information and reviews, but I went ahead and went for it. The game isn't too bad for what it is, though it has its flaws.The graphics in this game are not your usual current gen graphics. They are more of a updated PS2 style of graphics. Not bad, but being 2013 you expect pretty scenery even if it is the end of the world and Zombies are taking over. The voice acting is subpar. You would think that being an AMC Films game that this wouldn't have been an issue.The game play is a little stiff and the combat is not very balanced. The \"Walkers\" in this game appear to be tougher than the ones on the show to which this game is a \"prequel\" to. You start with a knife, which a Walker will take 4 normal hits to the head before it goes down. This does not bode well if you have a mob of them coming after you. Later in the game you have access you guns and crossbows, but even then the reload times and shoddy aiming put you in a tough spot when you have a mob after you.Walkers seem to appear out of nowhere. If you think you have cleared an area so that you can move forward without incident, think again. Before you know it there will be one right behind you just waiting to sink their teeth into you. Being a First Person View type of game makes it difficult in this area since you can't get a good feel for your surroundings. You have to rely on stealth which is not good since you can't see everything that is going on around you due to the materializing Walkers and the first person view.There are collectables to be had, team members to be found and side quests. These are not too hard to find as the game is pretty linear. There is also no Co-Op/Multiplayer which doesn't bother me as I prefer to play alone.This is not a bad game. It is challenging. I have a feeling that production was rushed for whatever reason but the game is still playable. Fans of the series should enjoy it, though it could have been a much better game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

The card system tends to be the downfall. What really gets under my skin is that you have to search for a certain card to unlock a door or you can't progress any further in the game. If you can't find an \"8\" card, for example, you can't get through the door to the next part of the story. Finding the \"8\" card can sometimes take more than an hour to find. You have to keep killing monsters in hope that they will drop the \"8\" card to open to door. Over time, you get tired of looking. So the cards are a neat idea, and would work, if some of the cards weren't so hard to find. It kills the fun of the game. The ony reason the game has length is because of how long it takes to find cards, if not for that, the game could be beaten in half the time.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Great Multiplayer Fun","reviewText":"This is one of the few games that I have bought and since I had 1 game to pick for Christmas I decided to go with this one.  My 1st thought is if I was not on XBOX live I probably would not have wanted this one just for single player.  Even though I found I liked the single player its more getting from point a to b (like multiplayer) with no story and no side anything so its escaping from locations.  Even though the single player is fun I just don't think I would have spent 60 bucks for just single player unless I can get a lot of hours out of it.  I don't get to play on Live except usually weekends and a couple week nights but I think its great being on teams and everyone taking care of each other, usually anyways.  I love co op so this game really appeals to me and split screen makes it even better.The graphics are fantastic and crisp and gameplay is absolutely fun with zombies running at you it reminded me of Counter Strike with crazy zombies which I guess makes sense given the company that made it.  The sound is great and I like the way the characters tell you when they are healing or reloading to let you know who to watch after.  Just the sounds the creatures make are great and a good job has been done with this game.  The single player A.I. bots are kind of annoying simply because I found they didn't act too much like a real player which is a minor unless you play single all the time.This game is more a love or hate since I have not heard too many in betweens.  Renting is actually what I recommend to do 1st for any game unless you know for a fact no matter what anyone else says you will like it.This is probably one of the best multiplayer co op games I have ever played.  Its just plain fun and usually unless you are in an annoying group, people play all the way through the campaigns and stick together.  This is from what I have seen even though I am sure people do skip out when they die or something but this is what I have seen when I am on Live.  I found it lots of fun to set up in a location like a house or building fighting off the horde and sometimes it can get hilarious with your companions.  The infected fall into overuse in campaign mode and it can get tiresome fighting the same enemies over and over but the so called director usually keeps it fresh.  The only bad thing is just same enemies all the time and the horde of zombies are overly simple to kill.  I laugh a lot when someone disturbs the witch and she chases them down but thats just me.  Another great mode is versus, though it can be annoying to where the infected can spawn to attack the people pretty much anywhere nearby its still great fun.  I like to play serious when I play but I also have fun so the game modes thrilled me to play.  I hope there will be downloadable levels and stuff later b/c I don't know how long this game will keep me in the current modes.  Its fun but I don't know how long the same enemies and same levels and choice of weapons (which there aren't many) over and over will last.I don't really use the mic so much on XBOX live but I enjoy listening to people talk and since I tend to have more a quiet nature.  I do talk during this game since I found it is kind of essential to do so and it tends to be more fun that way.  I also like to find people who play as a team so when I played with this one person who kept running ahead of the rest and dying I got pretty annoyed.Me personally I will say don't miss this one but the hard thing about games is what I love you may hate.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Nick Musolino","summary":"The Epitomy of Video Gaming","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was one of the most anticipated sequels ever, coming out only a year after it's predessor on the PS2, Grand Theft Auto III was released.  Of course, like any other video gamer, I ran out and bought Vice City on it's release date, brought it home, and played it like mad.  However, something happened with Vice City that didn't happen with GTA3.  For some strange reason, I became bored with the game, put it down, and left it...for a year.  Being the avid video game player that I am, I occupied my time with other games, and didn't give Vice City a second thought until my supply was running low again.  So almost out of pity I picked the game up again and began playing it.  It's a good thing I did.  What we have here is quite possibly the largest and most well made video game of all time, right up there with GTA3, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Devil May Cry.  The game follows the same format as GTA3, but there is so much more to do in Vice City, it's not even funny.  Side missions, toy car races, dirt bike races, selling drugs, buying landscape; Vice City has it all.  The game has more unique characters that it's predecessor, and develops one of the best, but predictable plots of gaming history.  Sure, your know what's gonna happen, but that doesn't mean the game isn't written well.  Tommy Vercetti offers a more unique and wider character than The Guy, as he was known in GTA3.  He's tough, he's mean, and he is fricken insane.  And now still, after all this, I'm not sure which GTA I like better for the PS2.  The scenery and city is better in GTA3.  I prefer the dark dreary landscape, as opposed to the light, colorful Miami scenery.  The story is better here, as are the characters, but the missions and gameplay are about the same.  Here's a compromise I think we can all agree on: the Grand Theft Auto series is the best available on any gaming system right now, and I look forward to the next install.  Way to go Rockstar, you prove your worth yet again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

The graphics in the alpha were amazing, the light detail were the best I've ever seen in a game.  I would have to say the graphics in this game rival those of any game announced, even half life 2.  The textures were a bit blurry but I'm sure that will change in teh final release.  I'm running a 9700 pro and a 3.06ghz with 1 gig ram and I got slowdown, but I have confidence that that will be fixed for the final release.  Let me tell you this, every screenshot they showed up to the alpha was in fact real.  I had the privledge of takinga few screenshots myself and I was very very impressed at the level of detail put into each character.  The gameplay even at such an early stage is shaping up nicely, this isn't a quake 3 type game, everything is set at more of a slow pace, so dont think this is a trigger happy game. While I'm sure its gonna be full of action at the end, the appearance of the alpha is they are going for a scary game and accuarcy combat instead of the dodge combat similar to quake 3 and other \"fragfests\"So how impressed was I?

A couple that come to mind are: you can't train your characters skills up and magic is assigned randomly. This game is also a bit more kid friendly since it's on the DS I guess.  There are some weighty issues in here that deal mainly with free will and what lengths some people will go to get what they want.  A lot of this is skirted around by the fact that only your crew can remember much of what happens during the game.It's not like the other games where, it can get real deep with why the bad guys, and sometimes the good guys, do what they do.  Actually there is a pretty good twist at the end of the game as to what caused all of the problems.  Getting to that twist can be a bit of a slog sometimes.  This game suffers from the problem of the last couple of console versions which is that your guys back at base don't level while your out fighting.  This may make sense to some but it is really annoying when you come to a battle that requires you to deploy a good portion of your force.With a total of around 80 (give or take, I did not find everyone) characters that can be used, it is a bit of a chore to to take 3 of them out at a time to level them up. This means that you can get caught flat footed if you happen to come to a big battle that you were not prepared for.  During one battle I had my main four characters in one group, because the story made me,that were level 40; but I had three other groups that had level 20 - 30 characters fighting level 45 monsters.  Granted this problem is fixed if you win, but it is very annoying if you lose.  Also the monster encounter rate can be a bit high in some portions of the game, which is a pain if you just want to get to the end of a dungeon.What saved this game for me was the core of the story.  It does deal with the issues of free will, betrayal, good intentions, courage and friendship.  Even though it feels like some of the edges have been dulled to make it a bit more kid friendly, it still kept me going to the end of the game to see what the conclusion was.Unfortunatley I cannot comment of the wi-fi side of this game as I was not able to use it.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes suikoden and likes rpg'sthat go a little deeper with the story of how the unlikely hero saves the world. m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak.

This is very unique, because then it is your job to keep them from getting back onto the safety of the stage, and their job to try and use a combination of their midair jumps and special moves to try and get back onto the safety of the stage. The more damage you do, the harder and further they fly making it harder and harder for them to get back to safety. There are even \"critical hits\" that send your opponent careening helplessly into the sky and vanishing into a single point with a satisfying \"ting\".Super Smash Bros. Melee also offers a ton of fun items from baseball bats, to pokeballs that you can fling at your enemies or use to further deter them from the stage.I do not want to mention the characters because I don't remember which characters are \"secret\" on this version (having already unlocked them all), but there are characters from pretty much every Nintendo universe from The Legend of Zelda, to Pokemon, to Kirby, F-Zero, Metroid Prime, Mario and StarFox.There are lots of unlockable trophies, stages, items, and characters that you can earn by using a certain character a number of times, or playing the various modes in this game. A lot of time was put into ensuring a high-replay value of this game, and Nintendo really captured the essence of each franchise, and jam-packed them all into a high quality game.There are a ton of different modes including an \"adventure mode\" where you run through a side scrolling level with all of your fighting abilities, to 1v100 matches where a never ending stream of foes rain down from the sky and you must survive to be the last one standing, or a baseball themed level where your aim is to do as much damage as quickly as possible without getting carried away and launching your opponent until the very end.One could go on forever, but Super Smash Bros. Melee is an amazing game that will keep you busy for months just trying to unlock everything, and the gameplay never gets old or boring so you will continue to play long into the future.If you didn't have a chance to play this gem on the N64 when it first came out, do yourself a favor and pick up this awesome game as soon as possible or look for it to possible come out on the Virtual Console for Wii.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"\"gamefreak0\"","summary":"Super Smash bros Melee is a Super Smash Hit!","reviewText":"This game is almost too good to be true.

If you liked Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, just go ahead and buy this game, because you'll love it.  They were both developed by BioWare, and they are just amazing at creating action RPGs.  You'll definitely seem a resemblance to KOTOR right away, and that's a good thing.  I held off a long time on getting this game because I wasn't sure if I would like it, as I am primarily into RPGs, noir games, and open sandbox gameplay.  Some of my favorite games are KOTOR, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy games, Elder Scrolls series, Grand Theft Auto, Sleeping Dogs, Dragon Age, Fallout, etc.  I'm not typically super into shooter games that are really linear (although I do like Max Payne), and it was difficult to get a straight answer out of anyone: WILL I LIKE THIS GAME AS AN RPGER???!!Yes....you totally will.  If you haven't played KOTOR, then let me explain a little more.  Yes, the game has a lot of focus on weapons and you do a lot of shooting, but it has an amazing storyline (really, it's THAT good), and great characters that you can switch around on your team RPG-style, and interact with them, get to know them, etc.  You can also make decisions that impact the future.  It's not a full-blown RPG by any means like Skyrim, but it has kind of old school RPG elements mixed in with shooting and action.  It's a really stellar combination that just gives amazing gameplay.OH - if you've played Dragon Age: Origins and loved that, you will probably like this too.  Once again, it's not as much as an RPG as DA:O, but it's also made by BioWare and has the same feel to it.  You even get blood armor at the beginning that has the dragon logo on it.  If you really like BioWare games, this is really a no-brainer.The reviews for this game really speak for itself and there are LOTS of them, so I'm not going to go into detail about a lot more - I'm just giving you a viewpoint from an old-school RPG player who was hesitant to play this game at first.

This is not Tomb Raider, this is a $30 game at the most. I do understand Uncharted has taken alot of Tomb Raider' s gameplay and plot.Graphics-Good graphic's, but so what, it's on a playstation 3/ xbox 360, therefore it should have great graphics.gameplay-You only get about four to five weapons in this game which is not an issue. You can choose from a pistol, bow and arrow, shotgun, assualt rifle and pickaxe. I primarily enjoy using the bow and arrow, the aiming system is similar to skyrim and i use the bow and arrow faithfully. You can also modify your weapons. Most of lara Croft's movements are automated, you cannot manually crouch, she run at one speed also. Since when do you know Tomb Raider to shoot with one pistol? I have never known of this, however, in this game until the last scene, you finally get dual wield and you shoot the villian. Once you beat the game you notice you no longer have dual wield. The melee is decent but great if you remain undetected. If you are a TRUE gamer who has seen and played numerous of Tomb Raider Titles, you will see this game as simple and lame. I beat the game in three days, with taking breaks. There are no difficult puzzles to solve,  this game is very simple. Uncharted is more challenging.The aiming syatem is also not like the old Tomb Raider.Story- Absolute B.S. All I kept hearing Lara Croft say was \"no i'm not leaving you behind\", i'm not leaving this island\". C'mon, really it gets annoying. The story is not engaging, In a nutshell this is what  the game is about, lara and her researching crew arrive on an island and their ship is destroyed by an unknown force. Once the researchers arrive on the island they notice something is strange, every time they attempt to leave the island a catastrophe occurs, like a plane would hit by a storm or a survivor is killed. Then there is a young lady within the crew that a ancient queen wants to resurrect her soul. Evil forces kidnap her. Now Tomb Raider has to save her friend Sam. Absolute foolishness!Pros-Usage of weaponry modification based of off survival gear retrievalbow and arrow usagegraphicsupgraded melee combat/ stealth meleecons-poor storyterrible cast of surrounding characters ( meaning could this game have been made without them, or would the game have been better without them? i say yes)simplicity- ( meaning a 7 year old could pick this game up and beat it, one does not have to put any thought in the game to figure anything out, this is a very simple game)last but not least, this game should have been title Lara Croft, not Tomb RaiderI understand alot of game developers lke to go n different directions with successful titles like mgs, and tr.

I have an original ps3 and once this game gets going it sounds like an airplane is taking off in your living room.  I am not going to review the game mechanics as most people have already done so.  What I am going to review is the aspects of the game that might irritate you.  First of all on an older PS3 expect your fan to go on and stay on.  If the noise bothers you dont bother with the game.  I put the disc in and about 5 minutes after I started playing the fan went on and stayed on the whole night.  I have had my system serviced recently so it isnt me.The second thing that irritates me is the load times.  It isnt as bad as it is on the Xbox but it is at least a minute long in some cases.  You might as well be watching a commercial.  The load times occur when you fail a trial or die.The last thing that irritates me about the game is some of the controls.  You have to get used to the button placement for secondary skills.  For example if you accidentally draw your gun, everyone and their brother notices and begins to call the police.  The game tells you to press a trigger button - Left - To put your gun back in.  What they dont tell you is you have to click it twice.  Once opens the weapon wheel and wastes time.  Time is something you dont have when the cops are following you.That being said, this is a fun game.  Load times and all.  I have played about 10 hours of the game so far.  I like looking everywhere and it is solid.  The graphics are good, the controls - other then irritating me on occasion - are solid and the whole place has a wonderful large sandboxy feel to it.  Lots of places to visit, lots of cars to use and lots of people to annoy.I have been lucky to be able to compare this version and the xbox version.  While gameplay is similar, and I hardly ever say this as I like my xbox, this version is definitely a better port.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2014"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros.

Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"A. Jefferson","summary":"Games like this are the reason I own a Wii!!","reviewText":"I have been playing video games since the Atari 2600, and was a kid during the Nintendo Entertainment System era.  Some of my fondest memories involve one iconic set of characters: Mario, Luigi, Toadstool, and Princess Peach.  Over the years, games have changed (some changes for the good, and others...not so much), but I love that the Mario series have stayed true to their roots. Every Mario game that I can think of has stood the test of time, and has served as a model to countless other games.  However, despite being one of the best game franchises around, one component was always missing: multiplayer.  Sure, previous SMB games had a \"2 player\" option, but all you were able to do was pass around the same joystick, or take turns using 2 joysticks.  The idea of 2 characters on screen at the same time seemed strangely impossible for these games... and why Nintendo wasn't able to make this happen sooner than 2009 boggles the mind.  But, having spent 7 or 8 hours playing New Super Mario Bros yesterday, I don't care why or how they were able to finally do it...because this game is an absolute blast to play!As soon as the game starts, you start to get an idea of just how great this game is going to be...  especially if you have played Super Mario games before (and cmon...who hasn't?!?).  Everything looks very familiar, but in a good way.  The game really feels like they took some of the best ideas, bosses, levels, and music from each of the Mario games and retooled them for NSMB Wii (New Super Mario Bros Wii).  In fact, it feels mostly like Super Mario World and Super Mario Bros 3 rolled into one, with a little bit of Super Mario Galaxy thrown in as well... and that, my friends, is an AWESOME combination!  Like I mentioned earlier...I have played hundreds...maybe thousands of video games in my time.  And this game ranks right up there with the best of them.  It is, in my humble opinion, on par with Super Mario Bros 3, which has been rated by numerous gaming sites as the best game of all time.  Playing the game for the first time, there were lots of \"oohs and ahhs\", plenty of mischievous giggles, lots of punching and name calling (see multiplayer), and even several times where one of us paused the game just to point out how great this game is.  I hate to gush over this game, but it really is a work of art.  It's easily one of the best games I have ever played, and certainly one of the best available on Wii.  Here are some of my observations about it:Old Skool SMB:  Mario games are good, and they work. Period.  This is one series of games that doesn't need to be retooled, revamped, updated, or changed dramatically in order for it to compete with the likes of Modern Warfare 2.  In fact, there really is no competition for Mario games.  Historically, they sell, are highly rated, and have a long shelf-life.  This game is no different.  It is classic Mario at his best.  There are some updates that make the game fresh and interesting, but it is mostly classic Mario 2-D action, and that is a good thing.Music:  Mario games have always had great music.  Who hasn't  found themselves whistling or humming one of the iconic  Mario tunes?  This game has some really cool new music, as well as some remixes/revamps of classic Mario music.  When I found myself in the first of the Koopa Kid castles and I heard the original music from Super Mario Bros 3(??), I was ecstatic.Multiplayer:  For the life of me, I couldn't tell you why Nintendo was never able to incorporate some genuine multiplayer in a Mario game previously.  But, add it they did, and it is great.  The multiplayer component of Super Mario Bros Wii is really well done.  There are some competitive modes where you and your friends (or opponents) are running through a level and competing to get the most coins, and it is really fun.  But where multiplayer really shines is when you are actually playing through the games with a couple of your friends.  All of you are on screen at the same time.  When you hit one of the \"?\" boxes, 3 or 4 mushrooms may come out... or maybe 2 mushrooms and 1 Penguin suit...and you have a choice:  Will we all go scrambling for the penguin suit?  Or will the most skilled player just take a mushroom suit and leave the penguin suit to the others?  Or, will I scramble and get all of the mushrooms and the penguin suit, leaving my teammates out in the cold?  I tried all of these scenarios, and it was pure joy to see the look on my friends faces either way!  You see, the multiplayer can be either competitive or cooperative.  There will be times where getting a big coin or a 1-up will require that you cooperate...maybe I will need to pick up one player and hold him over my head, and then another player will bounce off his head to get the 1-up.  Or, maybe there will be a player that I want to give some grief... so I can pick him up and throw him down a pit or in the lava... or I can throw a green shell at him.  There will also be times where you are all trying to accomplish something (like jumping across a lava pit), and because we are all scrambling and trying to save our own skin, one player will bounce off the other's head, giving themselves a boost up and over the lava, but sending their friend to their death.  As you can imagine, the cooperative multiplayer would FREQUENTLY and unexpectedly become competitive, and there was no shortage of amazed/shocked looks back and forth (i.e \"Dude... I cant believe you just did that!!\"), punches in the shoulder, name calling, calling \"dibs\" on power ups only to be disappointed, and laughing ranging from a mischievous giggle to rolling on the floor in stitches.  When we were playing, one guy even got really upset and went home!  LOL.  It was one heck of a fun afternoon!  Once the sore loser left, we started cooperating more and competing less, and it was equally fun. Almost equally anyway...Difficulty:  I hate easy games, and I hate short games.  I especially hate short and easy games. This game is neither.  From what I have experienced so far, this is one of the most challenging Mario games I have ever played.  It isn't necessarily HARD...anyone can pick up New Super Mario Bros Wii and begin playing.  That is the case with every Mario game.  But it is challenging.  You will die...a lot.  Especially when playing multiplayer, since frequently one of your teammates will do something that sends you to your end on accident.  Plus, the difficulty really starts to ramp up in some of the later worlds/levels.  Also, there are 3 hidden achievement coins in each level, as well as these special \"star\" coins that you can go out of your way to find...and getting to some of these can be a real challenge.  I estimate that it will easily take 20+ hours to complete this game... and even once it is done, it will be a blast to start over and play again.  And the truth is, Mario games are always long and fairly difficult... I never did beat Super Mario 2!  I think this game is going to have a long shelf life at my house!I will spare you any more gushing details about this game. Clearly, I enjoyed it immensely.  If you own a Nintendo Wii, you should own this game.  If there was ONE Wii game I would recommend you buy, it would be this one.  If you are considering buying a Nintendo Wii because you like this game...I guarantee it will be worth it.  This game is destined to be a classic, and it would be a shame to miss out!

I don't think it is possible to fully realize how nice it is to have a wireless controller until you use one. You don't have to look at ugly cords hanging from the system when you leave your controller on the floor. If you have kids, it's a necessity because they love to pull/sit on/trip over cords that are hanging around while you're playing. I would love to see Sony make their own cordless controller, but until they do, this is the best one available, and I have tried several.One of the biggest selling points for me is the D-pad. Every other third party controller I have ever used has an inferior D-pad...they generally tend to insist on making one big D-pad instead of dividing it into four separate buttons like the Sony controller. This results in errors - when you push up, you move right or left half the time. This isn't a huge issue with many games since the D-pad is not used much. But there are some games (Tony Hawk, fighting games) where the D-pad is essential. This one does the job just fine. Which is great, because I got sick of having to switch controllers every time I wanted to play Tony Hawk.One thing to note - there is an earlier version of this controller that you might find someone trying to sell. Do not buy the older version. Everything I said about the D-pad is not true about the older version. In fact, it has one of the worst D-pads I have ever seen. It uses more batteries, the analog sticks do not have good grip on them, it is HUGE so it may be difficult to use if you have small hands, and the receiver is just a pain (...)because it has a cord attached to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2005"}

Dark cloud 1 lacked story, good characters, fun dungeons, it was horrible. This game pisses me off in some ways but is good in alot. There are so many sub-quests to do.

You will probably spend hours trying to find out combinations and get so frustrated that nothing works, but its alright when you do get one. Also, you can fish, which is pretty cool because you can do things with the fish. Or even build up your weapons, but still, that is not too fun. But there is still one major area the game lacks in, thats dungeons. The dungeons are all the same. Every level of the dungeons is an exact replica of the last one, with one new monster and different paths.Overall, its a renter.

I actually liked Madden 13 quite a bit. Say what you will about the franchise and player clipping issues the AI was about the best I can remember. This game reminds me of playing Blitz , the defense serves no purpose. I have played 6 full games and all of them I have around 200 yards rushing and about 300 passing. There have been several times where I have misread defense and threw strait to the other teams corner right on the numbers and the ball just hits them and drops. I am still yet to throw an Interception in this game. When playing Zone defense it is like 90% of the time the position player doesn't even recognize there is a receiver to cover or the ball is being thrown. I was playing as Patrick Willis over the middle and switched to man coverage. The other teams half back then ran right strait to me and then caught still caught the ball and then ran strait into me and I just stood there as the player bounced right off . No attempt to A. Break up the pass B. Tackle the player C. Make any attempt to do anything but stand close to the guy. My safety made the play 10 yards later on a pass that should have either been picked off or broken up. Atleast I can say that the Defense AI is braindead for the player and computer alike.As for the presentation, the commentary and the cuts literally look like they were cut and pasted from last years game. The replays are really short ,like soo short they don't even show the whole play most of the time. On touchdowns there is a weird moment of Silence after you run in. I don't remember that in the past. It is pretty jarring and takes you out of the moment. The stats are few and far between and usually pop up for like 2 seconds, not even long enough to read them.I thought Madden 13 was promising enough that I was excited for this game , I really thought they were on the right track and if they just smoothed out a few rough edges and went back to the basics with Franchise mode this game could not miss.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

He must solve this mystery before being incarcerated for life. Over 50 stuntmen and actors were used for the game, to create the most realistic, high-caliber, Hollywood-style action sequences","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Terrific melding of games and movies","reviewText":"There have been games throughout the years that have truly done something original, different and completely engaging.  It always seems to be that these games fall by the wayside in terms of popularity which is a shame.  Indigo Prophecy falls into this category as an original game with a fantastic premise and incredibly exciting gameplay.Never before have I played a game that was so interactive in its story-telling.  When trying to describe this game, I would point to God of War, a PS2 game in which there were scenes where you have timed button presses that would move forward a cutscene.  It helped bring you into the story, the cutscenes so that it was you that were doing all of the cool acrobatic manuevers killing the hydra.  Another game that used this to a lesser effect was Resident Evil 4, for example with the knife fight that you had to push buttons to keep Leon safe.  Indigo Prophecy takes this idea and pushes it to the extreme.IP is basically and incredibly interactive movie.  It mixes the adventure genre, which is seldom seen on console, and movies and melds them into a cohesive and incredibly engaging story.  It starts off with a bang as you immediately find yourself killing someone you don't know in a diner.  You feel like you're not in control of your actions and as a result you have a body in a restroom and a policeman drinking coffee in the restaurant.  What do you do?  You're free to act from here on out.  Do you leave the body and rush out?  Do you hide the body?  What about the blood?  What about the blood on you?  What about the knife?  When you leave do you pay your bill?  You can take care of all or none of the options above.  And the story will be different, sometimes marginally sometimes drastically.  Oh, and by the way, that cop sitting outside needs to use the restroom and soon the screen will split and you better be out of there before he makes it to the restroom.This opening sequence exemplifies everything this game is about.  Choices, story and gameplay all merged into one.  But innovation doesn't end there.  As soon as Lucas (the murdering protagonist) is free of the diner, you take control of two police detectives who investigate the scene.  You can switch between the two on the fly and you have to find clues, make theories and basically do everything in your power to catch Lucas.  Its this give and take gameplay, where you have to play one side against the other, that truly gives the game a sense of urgency and excitement.Going back to the God of War example, when you have cutscenes in this game, you better not put your controller down.  Gameplay pushes forward the story-centered bits as well.  Whether its doing a simon says type control scheme to manuever your character past cars that are hurtling toward him, alternating between the L and R trigger as fast as you can to save someone who's drowning or using the R stick to make dialogue choices on the fly (you're timed) to hear all you can, the game makes sure to bring you into the story.  Its very effective and really ratchets up the tension.If there is one sore spot in the game its the graphics.  While not bad, exactly, they don't necessarily push the Xbox in the way that this last year of Xbox life should.  It looks like a first or possibly second generation Xbox game.  Artistically the game is good.  The characters in the cutscenes move really well and realistically.  And there is never a moment of lag or skipping seen in a lot of games today.  The character's faces have some nice emotion to them and the graphics aren't stellar, like I said, but they do a decent job.  There's a ton of aliasing, however, which is sad.Another sore spot is the controls.  When you are in direct control of your character (i.e. actually moving them as opposed to having control of the cutscenes via button pressing) the game is pretty loose.  It reminds me of playing the old Resident Evil games.  You have the cinematic camera which causes some confusion as to which direction you should push your character.  As a result, you will do a lot of figure 8s in the game which can cause a lot of problems when you have to hide the evidence because a cop is at your door and the timer is going down.  Character animation while moving is also very stiff and a big difference from the cut scene animation.The audio is terrific, however.  While the box says the game does not run in 5.1 in game, I think it lies.  My receiver lights up whenever 5.1 is being used and its always lit with this game.  And it sounds like 5.1 is being used.  The voice acting is absolutely wonderful and professional.  Each voice matches the character and it helps enhance this feeling of playing a murder mystery movie.  With voice acting becoming so important in games today, this is most welcome and really helps sell the game.  Musically, the game also excels by using the very talented Angelo Badalamenti to score it.  That name might not mean much on the outset but he has created scores to many Hollywood movies including most by David Lynch (Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr., Twin Peaks) but also Dark Water, Arlington Road, etc.  The score is absolutely beautiful and moving; it really fits in with what is happening on screen.What this game does best is meld the story-telling of a movie with the gameplay of video games.  It exposes the limitations of both and yet uses the best of both to create an engaging, moving and very interactive story.  For me, this game is a perfect building block for video games.  I can overlook most of its flaws because it is so different, so exciting and so damn cool.  It warrants a 5 star review simply because of what it did.  I would most heartedly recommend this game to those who love a good story, like action adventure games and want to be impressed with what video games and movies can accomplish together.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2005"}

The dungeons however are unimaginative and lazily designed.  Each dungeon is unique but you'll be seeing slight variations of the same hallways and rooms over and over again within those dungeons.  This was probably done by design to allow for their world to be seamless and eliminate the need for load times, I personally would have like to had more interesting dungeons and load times than bland and repetitive dungeons without load times.Load times - There are none, but considering how repetitive the environments are on each planet, this isn't a great accomplishment...you can explore whatever you want without load times like it said but don't expect to find much.Combat - The combat was definitely the highlight of the game for me.  It fast paced, very dynamic (for a jrpg anyway) and takes place on the map, there is no special battle screen you have to load.  They even throw in random \"Challenge Battles\" that reward a special prize for completing, these challenges will usually be things like \"Kill all enemies in XX amount of time\" or \"Kill all enemies using *character name* only in XX time\".  There is no penalty for not completing these, its just something that keeps combat more interesting as you progress.Unfortunately although you will find yourself having to grind, grind and grind some more for hours on end if you are trying to complete the lesser hunter quarries which amount to 4 or 5 different \"Kill 30 of XX enemy\".  Some of these enemies you will be lucky to see 1 or 2 of for every 10 battles you fight.  I would suggest just passing these mini-quests up but they are sadly convenient because...If you want to create new weapons (which is done by combining two similar weapons) you will have to first \"MAX\" the skill on both weapons first which translates to running in circles for an hour while your skill with that weapon slowly reaches MAX.  By the time this happens you'll find you have killed 21/30 of a certain enemy and if you're like me you won't want to leave that undone since its almost complete...once you complete that you'll find you've killed 23/30 of another type...40 minutes later you can move on if you just give up on it or if you're lucky.Story - As interesting as playing as space pirates, collecting bounties across the galaxy may sound the story is weak and follows your typical RPG story outline.  Boy leaves home to explore the world...check, boy meets hot girl...check  Boy meets more characters along the way who inexplicably decide to follow him in his travels...check  Boy and co discover evil plot, then thwart evil plot...check, game end.The characters for the most part aren't bad, just recycled archtypes you've seen in every other RPG, none of them stand out.  The ones who do stand out stand out for all the wrong reasons...bad over the top accents, annoying personality, etc.ConclusionThe combat system, the weapon creation system, the \"insectron\" mini-game are all definitely fun and have quite a bit of depth but they really aren't enough to make me recommend this game to anyone except to people who love RPG's and have a tremendous amount of time to waste.  If you're looking for a really in depth RPG, with good story and characters I recommend Disgaea 1 and 2 if you haven't already played them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2007"}

You get to choose 1 of 4 houses to move in when you start.2. You get 4 characters all having own house (4 mortgages too)3. Many of the same animals from ACWW but they say different things.4.

{"product_name":"B003EH0BQ4","description":"","reviewerName":"jomojomo","summary":"My Take","reviewText":"1) Game quality.  Nintendo makes some great Wii software, but no other company that I know of does.  Super Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 are two of the best video games ever made (not just my opinion look at the all time top ten lists yourself); Donkey Kong Country Returns is a great platformer;  Wii Fit is used by my wife every day; and we like the sports games.Unfortunately, the other companies that produce software see the Wii as a system that is for kids, and kids do not have money and they do not make purchasing decisions.  So the games they release for the Wii are designed to have a low sticker price and rock bottom development costs.  So be very careful what games you buy.2)The wii is 99%  game console.  You can stream Netflix with it though, and they have a decent weather/news channel, but mostly it is just for games.  The PS3 streams, plays cds, dvds, and it is a bluray player.  The xbox has no bluray, but can stream from your computer.  If you need something to play blurays and stream media from your PC, and see gaming as bonus feature, the PS3 is the most economical way to go.  The wii used to be able to play dvds, but pirates discovered a way to play pirated games on burnt dvds, so Nintendo had to remove that feature.4) Graphics.  Everybody knows that the Wii is SD and the other two are HD.  But really, its not that big a deal. The other two do not present their games in full 1080; rather because of hardware limitations, most games for those systems are 780.  You can have just a good of a time playing in SD as HD, of course ymmv.5) Motion controls.  They are just gimmicks, imo.  For 'real' games, they are a nuisance and often times negatively affect game play.  For example, in the galaxy games you have to waggle the controller to make Mario spin.  Every once in a while he will spin for no reason if you slightly adjust your hand position, and other times when you want him to spin, the controller wont register.  It doesn't happen often, but it does happen enough to make me wish I could turn motion control off.  I can't say much about the move, but I know the kinect also has drawbacks: lack of precision, lag, and the fact you need 12 feet of free space if you are going to play with two peopleThe one exception the above is the Just Dance games.  My wife and I have a lot of fun dancing together.The biggest drawback though, is that they can lead to physical problems.  No joke.  There are a bunch of potential injuries from the Wii; most of them are related to the upper extremities: shoulder, elbow and wrist.  So if you are over 25, you may hurt yourself if you aren't aware.You're doing an activity in a way that you could not do in real life.  For example, when you play the tennis game, you can hit hundreds/thousands of virtual tennis balls.  But when you play real tennis outside, you have to run and chase balls and you can only do that for so long before you get tired. So with game 'sports', you are able to do a lot more of a repetitive activity quicker and for a longer time. Which can add up to an overuse type of injury.I discovered this playing Tiger Woods PGA 11. With real golf, 18 holes takes all day.  With Tiger, you can do it in 45 minutes.  My shoulder became sore from swinging the remote as you really have to swing hard to get distance.  Before long I was selling the game.  As a side note, I paid 59 and got 14 for it, so I'm guessing I'm not the only one.5) Price.  It is the cheapest system, which is nice. But be warned: things do add up. Here is approx what we spent when we bought it:  $209 (game system) + $55 (2nd controller and you will want 2 controllers) + $25 (2nd nun chuck)= $280.But the other systems are even pricier, for example to get an xbox system up and running: $399 (125 gig version), $150 Kinect, $40 second controler, $80 for Xbox live subscription = $670 and that is with no extra games.Other notes: Microsoft and Sony have both lost money on the current generation of consoles.  Sony because they wanted to push bluray while hddvds were still a threat, and microsoft because they wanted to buy their way into the game console business and they have a big wallet.  Nintendo couldn't do that because they make their living off of consoles and games, where as for MS and Sony it's just a small part of their organizations.So Nintendo built and designed a system with a very focused goal.  They did a good job at picking hardware and designing a gaming system that squeezes every gram of power out of the components.  The company president said when they were making it they wanted a small, quiet video game machine that most people could afford, and that's what they made.Conclusion:  My wife uses the wii fit daily and enjoys the exercise programs such as ea sports (i think thats what it is called).  For me, I buy the occasional game such as Donkey Kong Country Returns, but it's not something I use everyday.Don't get me wrong, imo the wii is worth getting just to play the 2 galaxy games, and yes they are that good.So for us the system has been worth the price paid and we look forward to see what Nintendo comes up with next.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and if you've played something like Drake's Fortune, the controls are sufficiently similar that it becomes a zero-learning-curve game. (Note - Drake's Fortune uses third-person camera - yuk. COD4 is first-person - ie. you look through your own eyes).GraphicsThe graphics in COD4 are good. Very good. Not brilliant, but a massive step up from the previous titles. The environments are detailed but the maps are relatively small. There is good texture mapping and use of colour and the global shadowing system is adequate. There are some problems though. There is a lot of aliasing on thin lines - power lines, cables - stuff like that. Aliasing is the stair-step effect (jaggies) that you get when a graphics system is unable to smooth out the differences in extreme contrast. For a console as power as a PS3, this shouldn't be a problem but it is. COD4 also suffers a lot of popup - where items pop in to view very late or change level of detail very late. This is particularly noticable on the Ambush map in multiplayer mode. The bricks and debris on the ground pops in in front of you almost in a wave as you run. Sandbags pop to their highest right in front of you and the burned out tanks in the middle of the map pop into high detail as you approach them. To start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. Again - a PS3 shouldn't have this problem but COD4 is a multi-platform game so maybe they just coded to the lowest common denominator and didn't bother to tweak it for the PS3.Smoke and particle effects are nice, but very processor-intensive. If someone pops a smoke grenade and you run through the smoke cloud, be prepared for very low framerates - it really bogs down. You'll see the same three or four textures used on smoke billowing through the smoke effects too so if you're waiting it out for the smoke to clear, you'll think \"hey - deja vu - I just saw that exact same smoke.\"There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.Occasionally you'll find faults in the graphics engine that make you wonder if the game didn't QA properly. On the Pipeline map for example, you can hop on to one of the oil tank rail cars and see through the oil tank. Sometimes when you die you'll fall out of the map or be able to see the inside of your character's head. The game runs at 60Hz for the most part, and in 720p it looks pretty good (but it's not full HD). There are places where it'll bring the PS3 to its knees though with the number of characters and effects all being drawn at once. Multiplayer mode on the Shipment and WetWork maps are good examples. You'll be lucky to ever see 60 frames per second on those maps.Motion capture is good but not brilliant. All the requisite moves are there for all the characters but there are some noticable pops and bangs in between their set pieces. If you're in the thick of the action, you don't notice it so much but if you're spectating a multiplayer game, or observing enemies through a scope in the single player game, you'll often see a glitch in the motion capture between crouching and standing up. There's a definite pop as the characters go from slow, hunched-down crawl to normal walking when standing up. There are other issues here and there but the crouch-to-stand-up problem is the one that immediately springs to mind.SoundThe audio on COD4 is also pretty good. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. It's so seamless in COD4 that I've come to rely on it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. There's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without silencers, but I suppose only a gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right. There's a couple of mis-steps here too though - the Mini Uzi sounds like a child's toy for example. The voice talent is varied but too many of the English characters sound like Dick Van Dyke doing cockney. Come on - this is the 21st century - couldn't they get English people to do the English accents?Single playerSingle player mode is a good intro to COD4. The maps are varied and the missions are split between US and UK troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works.Enemy AI is so-so in COD4. There are some neat new tricks compared to other run-and-gun games but ultimately you'll be able to out-think the AI pretty quickly. You need to; there are no health packs in this game. You have overall health and that's it. If you get badly shot up, you can hide and recover, but in a full on smackdown with enemy troops, there's no time to hide so it becomes a question of speed, skill and luck to stay alive.As I said above, the maps are quite small and confined This is good because it means at no point during gameplay do you ever come across a loading screen unless you change maps or missions. It's bad because you can run from one side of the map to the other in about 30 seconds on the largest map which means there's not a lot of free-roaming capability. The game itself is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes.The weapons choice is wide and varied and there's an option to throw grenades back if one lands close to you and you have quick reactions. Invariably when I try this though, it goes off in my face and that's the end of that. Each weapon has iron sights or laser / scope / dot sights. Some of the aiming positions are counterintuitive though. The MP44 and M14 assualt rifles have the distinct look of shooting diagonally instead of straight. I've never quite got used to this and if I end up with one of these things, the enemy automatically has an advantage over me.Without a doubt, the best single player mission is where you find yourself at the weapons controls of a C130 gunship. This entire level is played through an infrared sensor channel. You're orbiting a village and your task is to keep your troops on the ground safe from enemy attack. Your troops are marked with infrared beacons, so they all pulse or flash in the sensor view. You have three different guns at your disposal from rapid-fire machine gun to what-the-hell-was-that cannon. I think if you play COD4 through to the end, you'll eventually only ever re-play this level in single player mode.OnlineOnline gameplay is where COD4 really shines in terms of fun factor. Unlike days of old where inexperienced players would drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who could snipe them through glitches in the map, COD4 has a load balancing system. As a newbie, you have zero experience points so you get put in games with other people way down the scale. This means you get a chance to learn the maps and figure out how best to play without the frustration of instantly dying because you re-spawned near someone who has a zillion hours of game time under their belt.The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one. As your experience increases, you get put in maps with other players with similar levels of experience. In this way it leads you into the all-guns-blazing experts-only matches quite gently.There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. COD4 does support headsets chat, but until the first patch came out, there was no way to mute other players, which meant you were treated to levels of swearing that you probably had no idea existed in civilised society. Fortunately, now you can mute the players with Tourette's which makes it a lot more enjoyable. The problem is that a lot of people assume that because they've got an open mic and a captive audience, it gives them the right to behave like a total goon.There are issues with the online play though. You'll often come across a situation where you are clearly shooting someone else but your hits aren't having any effect. When you die, the replay cam will show you the same gunfight from your opponents point of view and there will appear to be an obvious disconnect between when you thought you were shooting, and when the game considered you to be shooting from the other player's perspective. I call it bullet lag. More often than not it clears itself, but occasionally the online match will just become impossible to play because of it and you have no choice but to exit and join another game.The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a \"host ended session\" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. A lot of games use distributed online mode, meaning all the machines track the progress of the host in case it goes down. If it does, another player's machine becomes the host, seamlessly, and gameplay continues. GTA4 and Racedriver Grid both use this technique to great effect. For it to be missing from COD4 is criminal.One thing that I'm still not quite used to in COD4 is bullet penetration. Get a sufficiently powerful weapon and a suitably thin wall and you can shoot other players through the wall. A lot of the time it's guesswork, but there are enough graphical glitches that you'll often be able to see another player's knees, elbows or backside poking through the back of a building when they think they're hiding. This is good if you're the attacker, but bad if you're the victim - you can often think you're suitably out-of-sight only to have someone fill your back with lead from the other side of the wall.Three stars or four?Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. The PS3 is still a relatively new platform and the developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of it. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely.COD4 is a three-star or four-star game but it's hard to choose which. In the end I went with four stars because of the fun factor. It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the graphical and server glitches, has a high X-factor. It's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like (are you listening Konami?), but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD4 has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.5 stars for fun. 4 overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2008"}

This is the only one you need.","reviewText":"I'm simply blown away after playing through Black Ops. This is a review for the gamer who just wants to have a good time. After playing through this game, I had a blast. It's rare for me to be so absorbed into a game and dedicated to beating it on the spot nowadays. Games just seem to have lost their charm. But Treyarch sure outdid themselves with this one.This is coming from a person who HATED World at War. It just wasn't for me. Taking notes from Infinity Ward's COD game last year, Modern Warfare 2, Treyarch took what that team did right and perfected it. This game had me in awe on every level as I played through it. It's so full of action, the budget I'm sure is in the millions.This game really makes you feel a part of it as you play through the levels. It's not just simple run in a room and kill everyone, then move on to the next. It has constant changes to the environment that you must adapt to, such as a bridge you are running on gets a huge hole blown in it, and as you almost fall to your death your teammate helps you up. The A.I. characters aren't just cardboard cut outs like in some games, they actually have a personality to them, and they help you out on your missions. I actually felt for them when they were killed.One thing I like about Black Ops is you are never lost. Thanks to handy indicators, it's always easy to know where to go, or what your next target is. The control is spot on. Aiming is precise, and the weapons handle like the real thing. You are going to blow through hundreds of enemies, yet everybody in the game seems to have their own way of living, the ways that they hide behind cover, shoot at you, scream to their squad you are coming, and the ways they die. It's not the same animations over and over, everything seems new as you come to it.The game always knows when to switch up the flow of the action. There are so many different vehicles and such that you find yourself in, it's always something new. You might be in a boat, shooting missles at everything in sight. You'll find yourself in a tank, raining absolute carnage on anyone and everyone around. This game feels like the most epic action movie of all time, yet it could never be a movie because the budget would be in the billions.It's just so fun to play this. I haven't had as much fun with a game in years, to be honest. I'm not some typical COD fratboy who lives and breathes for this series, I'm just a normal gamer and I came into this game expecting a great time. This game exceeded my expectations, it blew me away. The campaign has a great, detailed story and was also quite long for an FPS title. You travel all over the world, and it's just great to see these environments.The graphics are beautiful, absolutely stunning. I'm sure that this game pushed the 360 to it's hardware potential. It's certainly the best FPS on the console, and probably the best FPS of the last decade.For some reason I was reminded of Goldeneye on N64 as I played through this game. Missile silos, facilities, jungles.. it's all there. Yet as much as I loved that game back in 1997, I don't think I had as much fun with it as I did this game. Black Ops really brought it's story to life, and really drew me into the game. I felt for the characters, I would jump and scream as I stormed through absolute chaos, blasting everything in sight. It was just a great experience, and I haven't had this much fun in a long time.I even see myself replaying this campaign, which again is something I rarely do. I strongly suggest this game to everyone. Whether you like games, wars, or just straight up action, you have got to get this. It's simply awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

NFS Hot Pursuit does not disappoint.  Lots of drifting which was the reason why i didn't care fr the demo but the game is just so addictive.  I just get caught up in the \"Just one more race,\" loop.  On-line play is good and seem very challenging which can lead to other problems with the over eager gamer.  Cars are rendered beautifully and each seem a little different in their handling aspects.  You get to play a variety of cars for the cops and racers alike right out of the box, and then unlock more vehicles as your rep level increases for racers or cops.  Simple straight forward races, and pursuits with a little strategy thrown in for good measure.  Not a big fan of the \"Short Cut\" that EA keeps adding to Need for Speed title after Need For Speed title.  It is nice to see EA going back to the roots of the franchise without becoming bogged down in badly acted story modes full of groan inducing \"hip lingo.\"  Please no more.  Just drop it in and drive!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}
