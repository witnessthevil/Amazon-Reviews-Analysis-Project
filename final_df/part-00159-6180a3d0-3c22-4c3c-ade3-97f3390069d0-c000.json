But this I have to agree with some of ya'll this game has too many glitches and just don't seem to measure up. It was a good idea changing the engine but the animations got really fouled up in the process and it just looks bad. I mean players falling over each other,running into another player and falling down, tackles being made looks like the arms legs and neck are broke. Overall this come out bad. EA put out a well known product and made you wait till they decide to make fixes in patches for the game to start playing like somewhat like normal. Most of the time I spend alot of time playing a new Madden or college football game after its released,this year I been so aggrevated the way they turned out I hardly play either one. If you want a good solid EA title play NHL 13 or FIFA 13. Why can't they just make these football titles better like they do in NHL 13 and stop putting something new in it and taking 3 good things away every year. Leave the good alone and make the lacking better. If you want  a good Madden title buy last years version.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPC","description":"The year is 2027. The machines of Skynet have risen, reaping a bloody harvest of human flesh across the globe. You are a soldier of Tech Com, a ragged team of human resistance fighters intent upon stopping the overwhelming onslaught of cybernetic assassins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Your ultimate goal is to reach a time travel device in time to send Kyle Reese back to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor, mother of resistance leader John Connor.This game is set before the events of the firstTerminatorfilm. There are three playable characters, each with specialized skills and abilities, including Kyle Reese, hero of the film. The 11 massive missions take the player through diverse, richly detailed, highly interactive environments. The dynamic camera system allows the player to target cyborgs with speed and accuracy, using never-before-seen weapons of wanton destruction.Terminator: Dawn of Fateincludes both missile and melee combat in third- and first-person play modes.","reviewerName":"EMAN NEP","summary":"WORTHY -- OF BEING CRUSHED IN A HYDRAULIC PRESS","reviewText":"I love the Terminator movies, but I gotta be honest with you,not this game .... Here's why:1)Obnoxious camera, in conjunction with the terrible movement controls. I OFTEN found myself getting lost/disorientated/stuck.2)Not enough outdoor levels. Instead, you run around bases, hotels, parking lots, asylums, etc. You end up feeling very claustrophobic by the 3rd level or so.3)Speaking of which, there are only 10 levels.4)There are three characters to play as, but it's not like you get to pick one of the three characters before entering the next level. One mission you may be Kyle Reese, the next you might be some gun-toting female.(5) If there is one enemy that you will learn to hate REAL fast, it's those annoying flying saucers that knock you on your back when they attack. And then you get up, and unless you destroy it \"muy pronto\" you're going to get knocked down AGAIN.(6)I've only seen/fought one T-800 in the game. But you have your Pulsed Plasma Rifle in the 40 Watt range, right? Remember how easily the Resistance killed T-800's in the future scene in Terminator 2? No such thing here. You pump umpteen thousand rounds into this T-800 and he finally softens up. Then you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him only to saw him in half. But that upper half is still alive, so, Plasma Rifle in hand, you pump another umpteen thousand rounds into him. Goodness, you'd think you were shooting a wimpy .22 or something. It was after that battle that I said, \"Forget it, this game isn't worth my time.\"(7) You don't get to ride around in vehicles. (But Keep in mind that I stopped at level 7 of 10, so I'm not sure about 8,9, or 10, but I doubt it.)(8) Easy mode is too hard.(9) No BIG battles, like the one at the start of T2. Instead, you're reduced to \"going-it-alone\" missions with occasional run-ins with stupid allies.(10) And worst of all, this game just simply isn't fun. It's frustrating. Believe me, I tried to like it, but it never happened. You can spend your money on something better than this (like the Terminator films on DVD special editions if you don't have them already).Here are a couple Terminator game alternatives you might want to consider: Skynet, Terminator 2029,(these latter two were made by Bethesda for the PC, if I remember correctly),various Terminator games for the Gameboy, NES, SNES, and Arcade.The only good parts about this game are the FMV's, but I'd rather watch the movies than this piece of garbage any day.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Bill Stockstill \"&#34;Bill&#34;\"","summary":"A FPS Based On Reality","reviewText":"When Electronic Arts decided to reboot the Medal of Honor series, they felt an update was in order. Instead of a WWII setting, they went with the invasion of Afghanistan in 2002, America's response to the 9/11 attacks, to destroy the Taliban. Bold move. They adopted an informal approach of getting input from the most skilled soldiers in the world of which there are only a couple hundred and are known as Tier 1. If you saw the movieBlack Hawk Down [Blu-ray] there were Rangers and Delta force soldiers depicted. Although this game is set 9 years later, the same type soldiers are in this game. You play both in the single and multi player modes. If you saw Black Hawk Down you remember the scene where the soldier with the bike is picked up by the Black Hawk. That is a Tier 1 soldier. Also in that movie, 2 Delta Force snipers volunteer to defend the downed helicopter pilot and end up losing their lives. MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart were awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously for their actions.What EA has depicted in this game you won't find in any other. They worked with Tier 1 soldiers to depict what the early fighting in Afghanistan was like. The unothodox looking soldier on the cover actually looks like a real Tier 1, Spec Ops soldier from a news photograph called \"Cowboy\".  The game depicts these small teams of elite soldiers infiltrating enemy areas looking for Taliban and specialized fighting units like Army Rangers being used when a larger show of force was needed. The single player mode has many missions that remind me of the SOCOM series of games where stealth is needed by a small group. SOCOM used the Navy as an advisor on their game to get a sense of realism, the same thing EA did informally with MoH. Some parts of the single player are similar to Call of Duty:Modern Warfare in that you control an attack helicopter or direct fire from air support. And there are a couple of missions where you play as a Ranger.GAMEPLAY:  Environments are very realistic, as you would expect. DICE decided they were going the realistic route in terms of what weapons really do so while the game uses the destructible Frostbite engine, its toned down and similar to how its used for Battlefield 1943. The example one of the producers said in an interview was that a grenade really won't take out an entire wall like inBattlefield Bad Company 2but instead leaves a hole. Gameplay can be described as intense firefights in smaller areas vs a large battle. A few of the Combat Mission maps do have a Bradley armored vehicle, but most are limited weapon wise to small arms with all player classes being able to call in defensive items like flack vests and offensive strikes from support units outside those playing (mortar strikes, rocket strikes, etc) once they rack up enough points via kill streaks. The most lethal offensive strike you can bring in with a kill streak is a cruise missile but I have yet to see one of those in 15 hours of online play.There are issues that we have all come to expect from newly released games. Game makers go on schedules and now release games based on those vs. if they game is totally ready because they can release patches afterward. That is not going to change and it comes from the cut throat competition of video games. So yes, the game has some minor issues but expect EA to fix those as they have done on previously released titles such as Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Madden 11. For a game that sold a million and a half copies in 5 days, I have yet to be unable to play online although, as expected, there is lag. The lag I have experienced is a total stoppage for a few seconds vs continuous lagged performance throughout the game so to me its minimal. This total stoppage may happen 2 or 3 times in a 10 minute game.PROS;-The only game realistically depicting the early war in Afghanistan (pre Iraq invasion) vs the Taliban-Several multiplayer game modes including a capture the flag type, deathmatch, a version of rush called Combat Mission and Hardcore Mode (that rotates through several modes with team kill on) and another where you either protect or attack 2 objectives for a period of time, a no respawn mode is coming soon-Customizable weapons-Upcoming free DLC that will include a new non-respawn mode and 2 new maps-The Limited Edition includes access to the upcoming Battlefield 3 Beta-Intuitive controls, better then the Beta-Good hit detection, better then the Beta-PS3 versions include the 2002 Medal of Honor: Frontline game.Cons-Some frame rate issues in some of the movies in the single player-Lag issues, but what new game doesn't have lag issues?-Normal mode on the single player is pretty easy-Some minor issues need to be addressed in multiplayer,no way to ID who is talking, can't talk in the squad screen, can't mute indiviual players, on Sector Control there is nothing to differentiate which objective is alpha or beta-Play groups with your friends limited to 4-Can't talk to the entire team-Can't choose your spawn point, the game assigns you to a group of 4 that you can communicate with and you spawn on, but you can't change your group or choose not to be in one like BFBC2, although, it doesn't seem as bad as it sounds.Neutral-No prone in the multiplayer, although the single player does have it. To me, it cuts down on camping so its not all bad.-Can't customize player skin.As with most games, people either love it or hate it. Some don't like the limited destruction. Others don't like the lack of vehicles in the multi-player. Others like its realism and that you don't have to spend half the time in multiplayer mode hiding from a helicopter or wonder if during the last minute of the game you are winning will someone on the other team deploy a nuke. The single player mostly, to me, reminded me of SOCOM. The upcoming no respawn mode seems like its aimed at SOCOM players, especially those dismayed by the changes Sony is incorporating into the upcomingSOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs. I can say one thing. This game is much better then the Beta so if you are basing your opinion of it on the controls and hit detection of the Beta, don't.You can't discuss this game without a word about the response from several governments around the world. The defense minister of Canada was abhorred that a video game allowed players to be Taliban fighters. The U.S. military does not allow the game to be sold at on base stores, but does allow it to be played on base. The response from from EA was two fold. First they pointed out that most of us from the age of 7 have played this type of game. In cowboys and Indians, someone has to be the Indian. Secondly,  they deleted the word Taliban and instead use Opposing Force. These responses probably explain why EA had to seek informal input instead of official military advisors. No matter what you think of the game, you have to give a nod to EA's effort to bring another Medal of Honor title that strives for historical accuracy like its predecessors.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2010"}

MANY TIMES... yet for something like every 5 stabbings, only one of them would actually count as a hit, and the rest of them apparently \"missed\".  not only that, but this guy must have been Zeus in disguise, because he actually killed me.. with his fists.. and me in full steel armor.i know i know.. it's not Doom or Quake.. but that kind of thing seriously detracts from the realism element that this game otherwise has down pat.so, that's why 4 stars instead of 5.otherwise, and in almost every way, this game is incredible..at least, so far.  i'm only level 4 right now, but i expect it to only get better and more complex.

I didn't have a choice in getting this particular collection because I own all the other DualShock bundled games that are currently released.  What I don't understand is all the hype and \"raving reviews\" for the entire inFamous franchise.  It's CRAP.I got 14% through inFamous, and I just stopped playing.  The whole game is nothing but a Grand Theft Auto rip-off, just without the cars.  Sorry, I now officially HATE sandbox/open-world type of games.  Totally not my thing!  The downward spiral of hate for sandbox games came when I was playing a helicopter mission in GTA4.  I should have known that my desire for this particular video game genre ended back then, not now.The graphics in inFamous are really awful, and what's with the sluggish jumping and climbing controls?  When you want the character to jump onto a portion of a building, he goes in the other direction.  Either that happens or he grabs onto something that you THOUGHT was there, but it wasn't and he falls down.  It's absolutely ludicrous.The side missions are extremely repetitive as well.  The lack of variety certainly hurts this game's replayability factor.  I don't care if you can play the game twice, once as a good guy and another time as a bad guy.  It's just so boringly repetitive that you won't even bother to finish the game.

I actually enjoy the campaign modes in these games. Which is why I am giving it a 2 star. I am sure people will blast me because the MULTIPLAYER IS WHERE ITS AT MAN!!! OMGWTROXXORZ.!11. I agree that the multiplayer can be fun, but this is a review of the game as it stands.Campaign Mode: ***** 5 starFirst off the campaign mode. The graphics and scenes are so absolutely beautiful I would give this a 5 star hands down, it is what brought this title up from a 1 star. From the basic places like the airport in the mountains. The snow, the weather, it all seems to be so very real and inviting. When you have to take back the White House it is breathtaking from the color of the sky to the helicopters crashing all around you. Wonderful, epic and left me wanting more. Which, leads us to the reason I want to give this a 1 star.Campaign Story: 0000* 1 starThe campaign mode is ridiculously short. I wanted to take my time taking it all in and several missions push you the whole time to GO GO GO!!! which is expected due to the insane pace of the enemies. It really sucks you in and makes you feel part of it, however, it falls horribly short due to the anemic plot and, well...shortness... The major issue with the campaign is the incredibly weak story. They never explain why anything has happened, the dialogue between the characters is full of hyperbole and patriotic fluff. I realize the world thinks Americans are a bunch of yahoo cowboys, but come on with the brainless pointless dialogue.Sub campaign:The Spec Ops are so-so fun, but its just a rehash of the campaign you just finished.Now lets discuss the 10,000 pound gorilla in the room.Multiplayer 0000* 1 starI understand its my lack of skillzorz that makes the multiplayer frustrating. That does not mean that I have to give a game I do not enjoy anything more than I have. The new titles and other 1337 embellishments they have thrown into the multiplayer has done nothing but polish what I perceive as a pile of excrement. Playing with a friend can make multiplayer a bit more fun. Going into a game where only 2 out of 18 have a mic, where most are young kids, and some have voice modifiers so we dont know they are kids,(yea right Darth), is nothing short of pure hell. Its not fun, nor is it the reason I got this game.After playing such epics asUncharted: Drake's Fortune&Uncharted 2: Among Thievesthis game pales in comparison for the depth of characters, re-playability, and overall scope. I am not a glutton for punishment so games likeDemon's Soulshave little appeal to me. I have a family, job and other things taking up my time, (like Amazon reviews), so a 2-3 hour frag fest where I am repeatedly killed over and over holds no appeal to me either.For the -Not Helpful- voters:I am sure this review will garner a fair share of negative votes. Just remember you too are entitled to your opinion and you too can write a review on any product and YOUR experience with that product. My experience with this product, while amazing, was brief and ultimately very frustrating. If this was a review of a new electric toothbrush and that toothbrush shocked you every time you used it, you too could come here and write about it was a pain to use. Reviews are not meant as an -I am a fan or I hate it-, instead it is meant as a way to let customers hear a varied and alternative view of a product. I think overall Activision did a pretty good job with this game. The soundtrack was spot on and sounded great. But making the game as a single player and a multiplayer means its not excellent at either one. Sure your Honda Civic can go off-road but eh, do you think it will hold up well?Pros:>> Beautiful animations>> Epic scenes>> Motion capture is fantastic>> Fantastic soundtrackCons:&lt;&lt; Story is disjointed and weak&lt;&lt; Campaign is very short&lt;&lt; Relying on this game to be 100% multiplayer experience means that it never works well as a single player game.Summary:This game was made as a multiplayer game with a campaign thrown in as a disjointed storyline that never fully grabs hold and engages, partly because it is too short. If the campaign were only 20-30 more hours long, this would be an epic worth keeping. So for now, try it before you buy it.Thank you for reading my review.

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Stuff of Nightmares","reviewText":"There are many excellent survival horror games on the market, but there are very few games as disturbing as Silent Hill. Whilst playing, there are moments when you will be completely freaked out by the bizarre and nightmarish things that are happening to your character Harry Mason, as the game charts his search for his missing daughter, lost after a car accident in the deserted town of Silent Hill. Don't expect an easy time in this game, the town is filled with horrific beasts and apparitions, which will chase and attack you. As in most games of this nature, you're aim is to explore the eerie town and delve deeper into its secrets by solving puzzles (usually morbid or goulish in nature!) and collect ammunition and weapons to help you survive the onslaught. But even during the quiet moments, the sense of dread is so realistic that you will be completely drawn in to the game. The story is bizarre to say the least, and often very distressing. Even the &quot;best ending&quot; to the game (there are several) is downbeat and elegiac. It might sound like I am exaggerating about things here, but I can clearly remember several sections of the game when there was nothing to do but panic, a feeling that no other game has since produced. Some events in the game are completely surreal, with strange noises and phantom figures appearing with no explanation, the result being that playing Silent Hill is like living inside someone's nightmare.

This game  has the worst looking graphics known to date the lighting looks bland and the textures are very dull aswell as the humans they did'nt even look realistic even the animation was really bad now the voice acting was good so as the Alien enviroments to the aliens themselve's but the animation was just disgusting. Six years Gearbox spent on this game and this is what ever happen to the sick demo that they showed at E3 were everything look straight up creepy enviroments to the most awesome fighting scenes with face to face with the xenomorphs and aswell very entertaining cinematics which they also fail to accomplished if you compared the demo to the actual game you will be mad as hell  I DEMAND A REMAKE OF THIS GAME oOR A IMPROVE ADD ON TO THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!. If I were you keep your money and spend it on games that are worth the $60 like Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3, Tomb Raider, and Grand Theft Auto","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0025KZV7A","description":"Electronic Arts Inc. Left 4 Dead Game of the Year Edition 9876 PC Games","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"What Left 4 Dead Is, and What It Isn't","reviewText":"I love the \"zombie apocalypse\" genre, enough so that when I saw Left 4 Dead on the shelf at Wallyworld for a measly $20 I had to buy it. I truly didn't know anything about it other than it involved zombies and a group of survivors trying to survive the zombie onslaught, but that was it. From the time I put the CD into my X-Box 360 a week ago until now I've had mixed feelings on this game and have struggled to quantify it and distill it down to its most basic elements.There's really not much of a plot here, but then again what plot do you really need for any kind of zombie infestation? Chances are there was a government experiement that got out of the laboratory and infected the masses, or perhaps some microbial organisms latched on to a satellite reentering the atmosphere and spread havoc upon an unsuspecting populace. It doesn't really matter since it always plays out the same way. Humans are transformed (either from the dead as in Night of the Living dead, or live ones are infected by a biological mutagen, as in 28 Days Later) and begin stalking those who haven't been infected or are still alive. Really, when you're talking about zombie outbreaks, that's all you really have to know. The game follows 4 \"immune\" survivors; Bill (retired Vietnam veteran), Francis (a biker/hoodlum), Francis (a former IT computer tech), and Zoey, a college student and horror movie fan. These are some of your archetypal figures you'll find in zombie movies. The four travel together in search of a way to get to safe havens of human habitation but have to pass through some pretty grisly zombie-infested locations to get from point A to B.Before we go any further it is absolutely necessary to say that Left 4 Dead is *not* a plot-driven FPS like Half Life so much as it is a team-oriented, multi-player zombie \"experience\", set in a sort of quasi-cinematic fashion. There are 4 \"episodes\" in Left 4 Dead and each takes the group through standard zombie infested settings one has probably seen in a zombie movie. I do not know if these episodes are meant to be linked together into one continguous narrative or if each is meant only to be played as a single experience, but the settings are quite nice and really make you feel like you're in a zombie afflicted locale. It's all there; the abandoned city, the farm house battle, the journey to make it to a boat that gets the players off of the mainland. Your goal is always to travel from point A to B and get to your means of escape, be it a helicopter, Air Force transport plane, or a lumbering APC coming to your rescue. Along the way players will hit checkpoints of a sort called Safe Houses. These safe havens are places to heal, restock ammo and first aid kits, and upgrade or change weapons too. There are four safe houses per episode and on the harder settings you'll feel like curling up there and just riding out the zombie apocalypse as long as you can. In some of these, scrawled on the walls, are messages from previous inhabitants which make a sort of low tech bulletin board system, some providing info on where to go, others leaving messages for loved ones they had to leave behind, and others (quite comically) flaming each other for having the wrong details on zombies in general. Each episode has a title card like a movie, with titles such as \"Blood Harvest\" and \"No Mercy\", and each episode ends with closing credits like a movie, with character stats in lieu of Director, Best Boy, and Actor credits, as well as a \"X number of Zombies were killed in this film\" statement. Nice touch!The game uses the Source engine, which powered such awesomeness as Portal and Half-Life 2, and it is beautiful here. But the fact is that as solid as the Source engine is it's not the Unreal engine, the behemoth that powered the beautiful Bioshock 1 & 2. That said this seems to be an advanced version of the Source engine and is fine tuned to be as pretty as I've ever seen from Valve's programming office. The flames in particular are surprsingly well rendered, although much of the surface details are plauged by pixelation and some strange clipping issues. If they included the Havok physics engine as they did with Half Life 2 I'm not seeing it here. The only time zombies seem to fly backwards is when I hit one with the shotgun...I'd have liked it better if they flopped around a bit more, but I can forgive this...at least a little bit. I also came across a few graphics from Half Life 2 in the Blood Harvest campaign, which sort of surprised me when I saw them. I half expected to see Gordon Freeman's Lambda symbol spraypainted somewhere.So far this sounds pretty good, right? Then why the 3 star rating? Well, for starters the game is simply not designed to be a single player game. But where Team Fortress 2 (from the same publisher even) makes for a quirky multi-player game this tends to be more of a run'n'gun experience, designed only to simulate a \"zombie experience\" by a group of players. Each of the characters in the game are identical in stats and each is limited to only a few weapons and supplies; a primary weapon (shotgun, M-16, hunting rifle, or Uzi), a secondary weapon with limitless ammo (a semi-automatic pistol which can be upgraded to two during the course of the game), a single grenade (Molotov cocktails or pipe bombs), a single first aid kit, and a bottle of pills, which temporarily gives the player health benefits without actually giving them health. Actually I found the pills to be next to worthless except when one is in a major pinch, but when times are hard and they're all you've got...well, you take them.The game is extremely repetitive, to the point where you can see the patterns in zombie spawning before they actually spawn. And spawn they will, from impossible locations usually, like the small closet which has only one door that you *just* cleared, but will vomit out 20+ zombies in a 10 seconds. And these zombies are more \"I Am Legend\" variety, moving fast and rigormortis-free, rather than straight Romero, shuffle and moan type. These zombies are fairly typical throughout the game and are pretty easily dispatched...however you will come across a few mutated varieties as well, such as the Hunter, which can leap amazing distances and land on a party member almost without warning. The Smoker typically stands around in hard to reach areas and uses its tongue in a freaky fashion, able to lash it like a whip and drag survivors away from the battle so it can begin to feed on them in privacy. The Boomer is a bloated fatbody that tends to spew some sort of zombie-attracting substance on you, usually at inopportune moments, and explodes like a bomb when you kill it. And the Tank is, as its name implies, a super-powerful gorilla like zombie that takes concentrated firepower to take down and can dish out a lot of melee damage. The last is the Witch. Now the Witch I find a bit puzzling...you can usually hear her from a good distance away, whining and moaning about being a zombified Witch I suppose, and can prepare accordingly. Shining your flashlight on her will get her riled up and make her attack (and she's a vicious one, my friends). The game seems to insinuate that you can bypass the Witch if need be but in only one case was I able to bypass her. In this regard I think the game is full of it...just shoot her, it'll save hearing that whiny, creepy sobbing she makes.The place where the ball was seriously dropped though is one of the things that Left 4 Dead purportedly has going for it...lack of a single player storyline mode. This lack of player driven story really soured the experience for me. I don't have an X-Box Gold account, so there's no way I can play this online, and after reading several other reviews I'm not sure I want to. A hyper 14 year old is going to bushwhack this not-so-agile 37 year old without much effort and I've read that you can experience that *only* if you're lucky enough to be allowed to stay in an online game in the first place. From what I've read there's supposed to be a split-screen capability, but my wife won't touch this game with a 12 foot pole and my younger brother, who might enjoy a game like this, comes over to visit only sporadically, which leaves me and 3 CPU controlled players. The computer players will shoot accurately enough but they never use grenades, which drives me up the wall at times, and come across as being there only to keep you alive when a Boomer unexpected rumbles out from behind an 18-wheeler. The computer players are there...they shoot at zombies and can be relied on to keep your back clear, and that's about it. From a single-player standpoint this game is mostly a failure for that very reason. I can see where a group of 4 friends would probably have a blast here, but without a single player story mode this game remains a mediocre game experience to me. And the tragedy here is that Left 4 Dead would be ideal for that type of play. The zombies themselves come out in single file, so someone with an M-16, for instance, can just take a bead on the lead zombie and with a few rounds take out the zombies right behind them. In several episodes you're given access to a military rotary cannon, but the cannon always has a poor field of fire, usually pointed at a location where few zombies will come at you, leaving you with an uber zombie killing machine that is essentially worthless. After a while Left 4 Dead just becomes a \"shoot anything that moves\" experience, rather than the visceral, scare-your-pants-off game it might have been. That's how Wolfenstein 3D worked...I never thought I'd see that mechanic in an FPS again, but here it is, \"reanimated\" for a whole new generation. One has limited use of tactics, such as holding an open window against an oncoming zombie horde, or blazing away at doorways that are about to be pounded down from zombies. Again, I can see where this game would probably be a real hoot for a group of players, but I don't have that capability, unfortunately, and have to rate it as I see it and experience it.Pros- Pretty, although slightly dated graphics- Decent weapons selection, with limited ammo capacity means you'll have to learn how to conserve ammo- Having scant supplies makes you yearn for those safe houses like you otherwise wouldn't- Nice flame effects- Thoroughly appropriate settings...custom made for the zombie apocalypse experience- Zombies are nicely rendered and often specific to their setting. At the airport you'll see pilot and flightline worker zombies. In the hospital, dead patients and doctor zombies, etc.- Fast, frenetic pace- Hey, it's a zombie game!Cons- The game is predictable- It's also extremely repetitive- Zombies conveniently line up for you to shoot them- The game focuses on multi-player to the detriment of the single-player experience- It could have had more storyline, although it's not required (as stated at the beginning)- After a few days the game gets kind of uninteresting- The rotary cannon is next to useless in most gamesLeft 4 Dead is a fairly mediocre game in my opinion, one that could have been much better had a little bit more elbow grease been put into it. It successfully captures the zombie theme but fails to fully implement it for player enjoyment, and is instead relegated to a fairly typical \"Run n' Gun\" shooter rather than a horror game. It could have been so much more...that's what makes me sad to give it only 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A fun sandbox experience with extra grittiness!","reviewText":"Most people will immediately think of the Grand Theft Auto games when first playing The Saboteur, especially when it comes to the gameplay mechanics and the map system which the GTA games obviously inspired. While it doesn't offer anything innovative in terms of gameplay, The Saboteur is a stylish and engaging third person sandbox action game with the sense of free roaming and discovery that gamers have come to love.The story of the Saboteur is standard for these types of games; a lone rogue, bent on revenge over the death of his friend, takes on the Nazi army with the help of several renegade factions in Nazi-occupied Paris. The purpose of the game is two fold; defeat the Nazis and inspire Parisians to rebel, thus adding numbers to your cause. The protagonist is former race car driver Sean Devlin, a big drinking, tough talking bruiser who is charged with the task of liberating Paris from the Nazi stranglehold. Assisting him in his mission are various revolutionaries and criminals who join together to raise hell in Paris and push the Nazi's away. As a plot device, the setting allows for some remarkable environments, but the style really shines with the color scheme. Occupied sections are shown in black and white, with hints of color here and there, while sections you have liberated get their full color back. The black and white graphics give the game a great film noir feel, while the rest of the scenery is equally impressive.Missions are varied but essentially fall into three categories; sneak into a Nazi area and destroy something, kill a certain number of Nazis, or liaise with various rogues about the town. The occasional race is thrown in, but the game otherwise has a GTA feel to the missions. Gameplay consists of running around, driving cars that you steal (you can even carjack drivers, a-la GTA), or climbing around the rooftops in a similar fashion as Assassin's Creed. The control is easy to master for most gamers, and while some have complained about stiffness, the driving controls are also intuitive and easy to navigate. The only bit of clunkiness some is with the hand-to-hand and melee combat, which does feel stiff and is not always responsive when you are surrounded by a gang of gun-toting Nazis. The open-world and free roaming mechanics are also great fun and will definitely provide some replay value as missions can be approached in a variety of ways. The game is also not overly difficult, with Sean being able to take a lot of bullets and health being quick to regenerate, so you will not find yourself dying a lot.At it's core, The Saboteur works best as a sandbox run-and-gun game. The stealth elements are fun enough, but I found it much more satisfying to go into situations with guns blazing and pick off as many Nazis as I can. The story may be cliched, the gameplay formula somewhat tired, and the voice acting somewhat questionable (especially the obviously phony accents), however the game holds excitement and provides enough style to keep the gamer interested and involved.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2009"}

Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Your Health Is Low","reviewText":"I didn't have a problem with the game freezing up my XBOX, and I'm sorry to hear it happened to (seemingly so many) others. The story isn't the best, and the inventory system is clunkier than the original. But a lot of improvement has been made. And you have to play it for a while to notice the better differences.The goodThere is no Mana bar anymore. If you are a primary Will user, this will be a godsend. No more having to worry about how much juice you have left. If you have the spell, you can use it as much and often as you want. I loved that. To extend on this, Magic is better balanced against melee weapons, so you don't feel like I did in the first one, that the spells were a nice addition, but not typically too practical in a difficult fight.The game has a fairly complex economy system. Much more complex than I've seen in any other game. You can buy nearly every building in every city. There are exceptions...but not many. And when I say that, I mean it. You could probably count the buildings/structures you cannot buy on one hand. Which leads to the next thing I liked: When you rent out houses or buy vendor stalls and shops, you accumulate wealth without having to work for it. And, as is normal, you can regulate how much you charge. More than the town average will corrupt you, less with make you more pure.After the main quest, there are still jobs and quests available that take a while to complete. I've probably put a good 30 hours into the game, and I still have a lot that can be done.You four-legged friend. I think it's the coolest addition to the game. He will help you somewhat in fights, he will sniff out treasure for you to dig up, and he will growl when you approach an enemy, before you see them. As well, he/she has a number of expressions to compliment your own...which are adorable.The graphics are really great. They are similar to the first game in terms of coloration and...well, Fableness. It's colorful and there are lots of ambient noises out in the open.The leveling system is improved by default. Since in this world 500 years after the first, the Heroes Guild is utterly destroyed. The Chamber of Fate is the most intact piece that us left. But this means that there are no experience portals for Skill, Will, and Strength. So as soon as you build up enough experience, you can immediately go to the Abilities section in your options and upgrade you skills.The music is pretty, and similar to the first. It's a perfect compliment to the environment. No long explanation needed. It's just well used.The OkayTo be honest, I was disappointed in the guns. The rifles/pistols/crossbows. I didn't find them as evenly balanced against all of the others. They are nice from long range, but I didn't find them as useful as I found the bows in the original game. Not bad by any means, but I think if they caused more damage in relation to the other types of skills you possess, I would have used them more.The \"free roaming.\" On the back of the box it's said that \"Roads are for suckers\" accompanied by a picture of someone hopping a fence. Well yes, this is possible. However, what is not possible is multiple paths to the same destination. There is more substance -around- the roads, and there are more caves, but you cannot, for instance, leave the road and go up and over the mountain to get somewhere faster.The new mapping system. I remember about a year ago, Peter Molyneux told us all that the original Fable was too easy. You could play the game by looking only at the displayed Mini Map. And he was right. But their solution? Now instead of a Mini Map, you have a glowing golden trail to follow. You -can- turn it off, but to be honest, I didn't really see this as a solution. It's just a different version of the same thing.The badThe story, I have to say. It's not that great, and it's not actually that long. But, I suppose I couldn't expect something on the scale of Oblivion or Lost Odyssey after the first one was so short as well. There were really no twists. The beginning really had me intrigued, with the box and such. But then it kind of went exactly how I expected it to go. There was no...substance, to any of the characters. Except between you and your dog. At the end of the game one of the characters calls your characters the best friend she ever had...and it's meaningless. You don't spend that much time together, and are absent for a long time. You don't know that much about them.The Inventory system. Like the last game it is nicely divided into subsections. Weapons, Clothing, Food, Potions, Trophies, Books/Documents, etc. However, when you choose, for instance, to consume a potion that will give you more Strength Experience, it closes the menu and you go back to the game. So if I want to lose weight by eating celery, I have to press Stars>Items>Food>Celery. And then repeat it. It just gets to be a hassle. I wish you could do what you need to do, and then unpause the game yourself.Weight. If it's your first playthrough, you will probably, like me, end up overweight. I didn't even realize it was happening, because when you first play through you probably don't have that much money, so you buy whatever will heal you. This seems necessary because, 1. If you get knocked out (killed), you get a new scar, and 2. Potions and Food are a lot less plentiful than in the last game. So when you get badly injured, you eat whatever comes up on the D-Pad. There are lots and lots of things that can make you fat. Cheese, meat, pie, some beers. The only normal item that makes you lose weight is celery. The ONLY. It took me about 5 hours of interactive game play to finally get back to even with my weight. Sleeping for weeks at a time to give the produce vendors time to restock on celery, buying and eating it, sleeping again. It got tiring, very fast. So my recommendation to you if you haven't bought the game yet and are reading this...stick with potions, apples, and carrots.(Too long didn't read? The game is worth your $60.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

I really like the first game, even in spite of it's naive short comings, which are mostly fixed by now (such as more animations and videos, and the quality of the puzzle solving interface). I attempt to play these in order, so I don't judge each one harshly, assuming they get better. And in this case, this Layton could have easily gotten skipped.It's art is great, and is improving, as well as, as I've mentioned before, having a pretty good balance of video content. My biggest complaint, and it's the bulk of my rating score, is that the puzzles are mostly repeats (with different art, or different values (like a re-hashed math problem). Some puzzles are simply math problems, where basic algebra will resolve the problem, and others are simply \"did you read the question correctly?\" Ultimately, I found the game not challenging in the least, the story was a bit over-the-top, and hard to believe, I get bored with this so quickly, I end up putting it down for weeks at a time, when I come back, I have to go everywhere again, and click on everything to find those, ultimately non-rewarding, puzzles.I do like this style of game, I do like the character and the series, as well as the art and interfaces.

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"A. C.

It is really a strange looking device that when connected to the Wiimote makes it a Nunchuck with less devasting consequences.  Basically this controller takes the games to the 3-D level.  Allowing you to control your character moving the analog stick.  Although it is used in different ways for various games.  What I really enjoy about the Nunchuck is that it adds more challenge.  With many games I have noticed it creates more learning of the movements.  As we slowly began to move out of our two dimensional game worlds into a trully three dimensional environment.  Think of the Nunchuck as a connection of your body.  In the game Rayman their are several parts where you are moving it up and down creating physical movement.  It is hard to explain in writing.  That is where actually physically doing it you begin to realize how much these games actually make sense now with your actual arm actions.  In closing I would have to say the Nunchuck is not so much a necessity but a requirment for many games.

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"The Game \"B\"","summary":"BEST HORROR GAME EVER MADE!","reviewText":"Doom 3 is probobly the best horror game ever created for any gaming console.

I mostly play multiplayer modes. I like how you get shields so that you don't die from only a couple shots, and accordingly it takes multiple shots to kill other players. I like the good graphics too.The main reason why this game is one of the best and is always fun to play is that there are many options. There are many different kinds of weapons and equipment. There are different levels, you can even make your own, but it's hard to get others to play with you on them. There are also many multiplayer game modes. There is a survival mode, many objective modes, and regular death-match modes too. The objective modes include capture the flag, stockpile (where you collect as many neutral flags around the map and bring them to your base) oddball (where you get points for holding an object), territory modes, and much more. So if you're tired of one mode you can play another. Some objective modes are mixed together, but you get to vote on what you want. Unlike the new Gears of War 3 game, there is a big team mode. In fact, GOW3 isn't anything special compared to this game.Other reviews probably already mention the following features that make Halo: Reach different than Halo 3, but I'll list them quick anyways. This game features special equipment like jet-packs, you can't hold a gun in your left hand and another in your right, there is no quick zoom or focus like before or in other games (you zoom in differently using the DMR or Sniper guns). This is probably my main complaint, not being able to quick zoom.Compared to empty games like GOW3 or unpolished games like COD games, Halo: Reach is amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}

I got onto Amazon to read reviews and see the reasons why others might have shared in my dissatisfaction, but found only that the negative reviews included a lot of whining about how the game is \"boring\" and \"stupid.\"  So here is what, I hope, is a better explanation as to why I think this game appeals to some people, and not to others.I've come to the realization that one of the biggest turn-offs for me, personally, is that this game has absolutely no plot, no linearity, and no semblance of structure.  Which is not to say that it's a fault of the game, since it has no desire to use any of the three.  The game wants to be as open-ended and non-linear as it can possibly imagine, and in that regard, it's quite successful.I'm of the vein that prefers the Metroid/Zelda types that, even when non-linear, at the end of the day, there's a task that needs to be done in progression of the plot.  When there is no plot, there's an endless, very open amount of tasks, that probably varies rather uniquely from game to game.  The only confines come in the gradual purchasing of items; so, for example, you can't actually fish until a fishing rod comes to the store for you to purchase.  Beyond that, you can literally do pretty much anything you want; you can fish, you can dig up fossils, you can collect seashells, you can send letters to your neighbors, you can plant flowers and collect pears to sell at the store or use them to plant even more trees, you can also hook up your GBA and play old NES games.  It's very open-ended.  If you like a lot of walking around, interacting with your neighbors, and deriving activites from them, I would very much recommend this game.For my type, on the other hand, I would more fairly define it as simply slow-paced--too slow, for my attention.  My problem lay in the slight meniality of it all.  There was something just a little too repetitive, and, dare I say it, open-ended for me.  I prefer structure, and this game offers and desires none.  So people of the Sims/Harvest Moon fan base would probably greatly enjoy this game.  I think it's a given that anyone of the FPS/Adventure/Shoot-'em-up preference would find this game boring.  Strategy enthusiasts would become dulled by the lack of complexity (which is not meant to be an insult; this game, at it's heart, is one for younger kids).  RPG fans should approach with a degree of reticence--it could easily be to your taste, or not, depending (since I would classify this game as something of an RPG cross-breed).One actual minor complaint I find would lie in the graphics, which, I felt, left much to be desired.  Though I realize this was initially for N64, I still think the Gamecube has much more to offer than what this game takes advantage of.So I can't give this game 5 stars, since I didn't love it; but I give it more than one, since I think my dislike from it is a result not from it being a bad game, but just one that is not to my particular taste.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00007UHPJ","description":"Primalfollows the story of Jen Tate, a modern woman who must face the demons of an immortal universe to discover her own supernatural origin. As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds. Additional technological achievements include seamless character morphing between Jen&#146;s human and demon forms, extravagant particle effects, and environmental effects such as fog and mist.","reviewerName":"4MaskCurse \"Kyonshi Jiang Shi\"","summary":"Just not enough action...","reviewText":"I was glad that I rented this game first before going out and buying it.With a name like \"Primal\",you'd think there would be alot of action,fighting and gorey moves(like BloodRayne). Alas, this is first and foremost a puzzle solving game.While there is fighting later on in the game(after solving three or four puzzels)it is not very fun.Using the shoulder buttons I thought was a bad idea,and the battles get very tedious.The story however is very good and a diffrent take on the wholegood vs. evil plot;Order and Chaos needing eachother for everything to exist.Both Jen and Scree were very cool characters that made for a funny team.On the flip side though,I never really cared what would happen to her rocker boyfriend \"Lewis\" (stupid name;maybe they did it on purpose?).I guess I'm sexist,but I've never really liked games were the girl has to find/rescue the guy.The graphics are top notch beautiful,and look very life-like.Bonus points went out to this game for voice acting with both Jen and Scree.I was shocked to learn that Hudson Leick did the voice of Jen,(actress who played Callisto on Xena) which was a nice suprise.And while I don't know the name of the actor who voiced Scree,I'm pretty sure it was the same person who did the voice of Vorador in Blood Omen 2.The game's soundtrack however failed miserably;mainly because there was hardly any music at all.The only music that is played is during the battles;and after the battle ends,so does the music...returning to complete silence.That might not be a bad alternative however since the battle music is Lewis's rockin' pop metal garbage.(I just don't like him)To end,this is a game you should definatly rent first.While it has some great suprises for a puzzle game fan,it is FAR from the best action game you could play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2003"}

Sure, the game was fun, graphics were great and all, but it didn't matter much to MG fans thanks to Raiden and the acid trip that followed him. Thankfully this time around, you don't play as Raiden, but \"Snake.\" I put quotation marks there for a reason. Why? You'll have to find out for yourself. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'll go on with my review.Now to say the very least, the graphics are BETTER than SOL. I don't even know how they could've improved in that area, but they did. Even though the environments still fill a little bit like levels(the woods aren't seemless and have very little loading time), some of them are quite large and detailed to the tiniest blade of grass. The character models are very well done and are the best looking on the PS2 to date.Weapons and items also share the same quality of detail as in SOL. Let me say this for the sound and music. If you don't have one, get a home theater system. This is one game that half the experience is gone unless you listen to it in Dobly Digital Pro Logic. The music(once again by the great Harry Gregson-Williams, who did the score for the previous Metal Gear and various movies) is fantastic and really gets your blood pumping when you're spotted. Even though the regular game has no music, the cinematics and finale has music. Gameplay hasn't changed much, but has been given a few new moves. Everyone knows about the survival angle in that you hunt for food to keep up your stamina gauge and that certain animals or food can give you food poisoning. You are now able to perform surgery on yourself if needed. The best new content is, of course, the camoflauge and CQC(Close Quarters Combat). The camoflauge works like you think it would. Use the right kind and you'll blend in. Use the wrong kind and pay the price. The CQC is really my favorite part of the game as it lets you take down an enemy more effectively than before. Grab them, interrogate them, slit their throats and use 'em as a human shield to say the very least. Not to mention various aspects of the game will make your jaw hit the floor(especially some of the boss fights, like the End, The Boss and well...I'm not saying anymore.) Gamelength is longer than before. Yes, there is still a little more watching than playing, but not as much as SOL. Rest assured, you'll get your money's worth. Even after beating it the first time, you'll feeled compelled to go back and redo it again and again. It's very addictive because you can solve situations in your own way. Not to mention a mini-game called Snake vs. Monkey, which is not only fun, but FUN-ny. And going back and trying to take down the bosses with tranq. darts. Now for the story. It's a much better effort than with the philosophical ranting of SOL. Snake Eater is more like a Bond film(look at the music video after beating the first part), but with more character development. Unlike SOL, Snake Eater has characters that won't make you punch your screen. Naked Snake and EVA's relationship is a lot more believable and generally more interesting than Raiden and Rose's. The Boss is a character that is one of the best characters on here besides Naked Snake, Ocelot and Eva. You really root for the good guys on here. The villians have also improved, but are a little corny. Their names for example are a little campy, except for The Sorrow. Volgin, the main villian, is cool in his own right, but still oozes that same Bond feel. Like revealing his evil plan before trying to kill you. Who does he think he is, Hugo Drax? All that aside, the story is easily the best of the three and even better than my personal favorite, Metal Gear Solid(PS1). It's more dramatic and even near, I say nearly, brought a tear to my eyes. Let's see other games do that. Overall, Snake Eater is a much better effort than SOL. No main character switch, no ranting on and on about the Patriots, and you can even get a little revenge on Raiden. I won't say where. My only complaints is that the length, while longer than the previous ones, is still a little short, but makes up for it in replay value. Waiting times for the radio is a little long and having to go to the menu to do most of everything is a tad annoying, but you'll overlook these problems because it's so darn great. I give this my highest recommendation. This is not only the best in the series, it's one of the best PS2 games of the year. A 5 out of 5. This is Sean David, signing off. I come back in a few weeks with another review as soon as I find my way out of the jungle.Until next time,Semper Fi, Carry on.Sean David","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2005"}

It throws you into a flurry of shurikens and blades the instant you begin to play, and the difficulty level does not waver throughout the game at all.  For someone like me who crunches through games like a fiend, I was hoping that Ninja Gaiden Sigma would put up a fight.This game was fun, but tough.  You will definitely get the snot kicked out of you many times but that makes the victory that much more rewarding.  This game is not for causal gamers or people who get frustrated easily.  You will repeat a lot of fights either because of respawns or deaths.My number one qualm about this game is the camera.  It is one of the worst cameras I have ever had the displeasure of maneuvering in a game.  Camera failures will disable your ability to focus on the proper targets, see around corners, and be sneaky...like a ninja is supposed to be.  Camera adjustments are possible, but the controls are unresponsive as the  game tries to focus on things for you and fails miserably.Your opponents are supposed to cause your death, not a camera.  This is the type of game where every last drop of health counts, and when your camera doesn't enable you to target any of the four enemies that are pumping you full of lead, your death will come quickly.I expected more out of Tecmo for this port.  The crappy camera is what made the fun factor 4/5 rather than a perfect 5.  The game's challenge actually adds to the fun.  It takes effort to win.  But again, this fundamental flaw puts a damper on what the game could and should have been.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2008"}

There is no question - FFXIII has the best graphics of any console game, ever created. The transition from FMV to gameplay is seamless and you can hardly make the difference. Yes, this is a game that addresses to the inner geek and justifies buying that big screen TV (note that not all wives will agree with this statement).Yet, the beauty of the game is all on surface. Gameplay is a mix of old themes from many other JRPGs, but without catching the magic of great games like Lost Odyssey, Eternal Sonata, Tales of Vesperia or previous FF games. You have the usual 1 dimensional heroes (ya' know when they are deep, because they don't say anything and look down)and the story starts in the middle, with no explanations on terminology ('lCie??) or character motivations. You are expected to care about them though and this is tough, when some events play on too early (call me cold-hearted, still don't care about Sera).Fighting is real time, no random encounters, but since 10 out of 13 chapters you walk in a straight line, battles are hard to avoid. You have a class system similar to Blue Dragon, only that this time around you have to switch between the classes, in battle. See - you cannot damage an enemy until you fill a damage bar and stagger them. Most of the time, the only way to fill the bar is by attacking with all 3 characters, as Ravagers or Commandos (Mages and Fighters). Enemies hit for a lot of damage, so then you need to change roles to Medic, for a Paradigm Shift - a switch in classes. Fighting is a bit more complex than this, but this is what is burns down to.There are no levels, but you receive Crystalium points and use these to increase your health, strength and learn new spells. I enjoyed this system, because it allows you to advance almost after every fight.If there is one place where this game fails miserably, it's the - surprise - Linearity of the levels. True, it can be argued that other than some American RPGs (Oblivion comes to mind), most games are linear in nature. FFXIII has no shame though and most chapters have you walking on a 10 feet wide path, that tends to go in one direction. This detracts from the story and kills any replayability.So - why so many stars then??? Here is the sad thing: once you start playing, it's hard to stop. Like with Avatar, story becomes less important and the world carries itself. It's a shallow experience, but we live in a shallow world, so can't blame the game.Paris - are you still here?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

I have never been a big donkey kong fan, but i do like adventure games. The overhead world looks nice, and the graphics are pretty decent, But what good is a game that starts off way too difficult on the first level? The time trial is way too difficult, but like most games the requirement for getting the gold medal for a time trial or other challenge is not too demanding. Another complaint i have is the controls. The wii remote is good for alot of things, but not for this game. To execute this  DK rolling move, you shake the remote. Now why do we not have the option to use a gamecube controller like we did in mario kart wii and SSBB, it is not like the wii was incapable of using the gamecube controller port for wii games.  That DK roll comes in handy with the time trials, but it is almost impossible to get the gold medal in the 1st level because it is a distraction to have to shake the remote while using the D-pad to move and a button to jump. An ideal way to play was to have the option to use a gamecube controller and have the DK roll assigned to the X button, but for some reason you cant use a gamecube controller. I know this is the wii and people want to utilize the wii's motion controls, but in this situation, it would have been best to use a gamecube controller. Games like mario party 8 and zelda twilight princess actually fully utilize the wiimote's motion controls.In conclusion, this game does have nice graphics and presentation, but what kills it is the punishing difficulty and bad controls.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2011"}

In the older Animal Crossing, if you got sick of paying off your overpriced mortgage and speaking to your neighbors, you could also play any old nintendo games you managed to collect.  This game just isn't the same case.2.  The Able Sisters shop.  Mabel no longer allows you to save more than the eight patterns on your person.  This really disappointed me, because I love to design patterns.  So, regardless of being able to draw with the stylus, you can't do it often unless your willing to sacrifice everyone else's good designs or some of your old ones.  In the older Animal Crossing, you could save many more designs.3.  While we are on the idea of designing, Wendall, the starving walrus artist, no longer gives you rare wallpapers when you feed him.  Now he gives you even MORE pattern designs.  I consider this a bad thing because of lack of a decent pattern saving feature.  The end result being you can get more patterns than you know what to do with.4.  The mortgages are too high.  This too, can rob playability from the game.  So, you are stuck once again fishing and catching bugs endlessly.  You can get tired of it, and it's more difficult to make decent money with them this time around.  Also, because it takes so long paying off the morgage, your house can get crowded very easily after a while.5.  Four players can live in one game, but there is a catch.  Everybody has to live in the same house.  Personally, I don't like this feature at all.  Although everybody does share the same mortgage, they also share the same stuff and rooms.  So, if you are hoping for a game to share with your siblings, or something of the like, make ABSOLUTELY sure they can be trusted with any valuable things you get in this game.  I believe more harm than good can come out of this feature; I preferred it when everyone had their own house in the older Animal Crossing.  Then you couldn't tamper with anyone else's items, and they couldn't tamper with yours.6.  Don't buy this game if it's just to see Porter, the train monkey, again.  He isn't in this game, nor are there anymore trains.  I, myself, don't consider this a bad thing; but it goes in the bad section anyway for anyone who is a Porter fan.7.  This game is not, whatsoever, able to link with the older Animal Crossing.  I don't believe there is such a thing as a device that connects Nintendo DS games to Gamecube games.  This is just a warning, even if you are a billionare with a full catalog in the original Animal Crossing, there isn't a way it will be helpful to this game.8.  Your neighbors.  Unrealistically, one of them tries to move every two days (once you hit the maximum number of neighbors).  Usually, you can beg anyone out of moving; but this can be a pain to deal with.9.  I hope you are not expecting to test your luck in Tom Nook's monthly lottery again.  The lottery is no more; in its place is... a slightly more complex system.  I will explain this a tad more in the good.  I'm not to upset by the loss of the lottery, but I put this here because I know there are those who will be.10.  I don't think you can get Tom Nook's highest store upgrade without a foreign player (one from a different game card).  This is bad if you don't know anybody else with this game, as well as having no Wi-Fi connection.  I am this case.  However, I am not certain the biggest store upgrade is impossible to achieve without someone else's help.  Still, I don't have it as of yet.11.  The beach.  While you can still collect seashells and the new bottle mail, there's not much else you can do there anymore.  There are no more islands, which also means no more Kapp'n singing in a boat.  Gulliver doesn't wash up there anymore either.  Said characters do make appearances in this game, but not at the beach.  Personally, I think no island, with no island mate, is a big minus in Animal Crossing: Wild World.12.  How to meet Gulliver now.  Don't ask, just note that I haven't even met him yet.  His arrival in this game does seem to suit him, however, as he always was \"A basket short of a picnic, if you know what I mean\"...13.  No more saving gyroid.  For those who like every gyroid in general, this can be bad.  Instead, you have to save in your bed; or use the start feature (one I really don't trust for some reason).  To me it's not so bad, but Tom Nook has the nerve to call it another 'story'.  To me, it's not a story, unless you can stash your stuff in it; which you can't!14.  Redd's store is the only place you can get paintings now, and I do not like it...  Redd, as old gamers will know, is a fox who just LOVES to cheat people who shop at his store...15.  No more calendars.  Not that I can find, anyway.  If you want to receive an early warning a holiday IS coming, you will have to check the town's message board.  Even then, you will only get about a two to one day's notice.The Neutral:1.  Flowers now.  Remember in the old Animal Crossing, where you could just plant a flower and forget it?  The flowers would be beautiful, even for years, until you took the shovel and dug holes where they were; or run over them too many times.  Now it's very different.  If you want flowers, you have to buy a watering can and water them every single day.  Even then, some of them still wilt the next day.  Don't panic if a flower you love looks dead, though; just water it, and it will come back the next day.  On top of that, if you store the flowers in your closet, they will never die no matter how many days without water they go.  I put this in the neutral section, because whether it's good or not depends on how much you like to care for plants.  I don't really like taking care of them everyday, but it's normally worth the possible pay off (See the good section).  Oh, and please note, that you can pick up flowers like items this time.  You can sell flowers, but most of them are not worth very much.  If you pull out a wilted flower (gray or black), however, it will be disposed of like a weed.  Dandelion Puffs are also an exception to this rule, as they never have to be watered.2.  Resetti, the Mole, is back.  Just like in the old Animal Crossing, he only shows up when you reset (turn off without saving).  I have yet to see if Resetti is as harmless here as he was in the old Animal Crossing.  I have only resetted the game twice; and so far, he seems harmless.3.  There are no more Police Stations, but Copper and Booker still maintain slight importance in this game.  They act as guards to your city's gates.  Booker still runs the lost and found, but additionally, he can also sometimes tell you who the special guest in town is.  Copper, on the other hand, is only important if you want to go to a friend's game card.  He's also responsible for giving you your friend code if you wish to go Wi-Fi.  I consider this neutral, because the police station was a cute idea; but now they are guard dogs, which is also cute.  Whether this is good or bad, really depends on which one is the cuter idea.4.  No more glitches.  Now, selling turnips will still never get you over a hundred bells (currency for newbies) if you time travel; but I don't think this is a glitch, as much as it is a mechanism to prevent cheaters.  I consider this neutral, because while the annoying bugs (such as the range of the tapedeck's, or whatever you have that plays music, music) are gone, many good glitches died as well.  If you don't like glitches period, than this is good for you.  Congratulations, you find enjoyment in doing things the hard way; this is the perfect game for you.  If you are open to good glitches, however, this is a bad thing.  Reason being, it means no more dopplegangler; as well as no more 'save and quitting' to get catalog orders instantly (which must have also been a glitch).  I think the catalog thing stinks, as you have to wait until the next time Pete delivers mail to get stuff that you order; which is very inconvenient.  If you are not a morning person (one who gets up at six in the morning), your only hope is to decide what you need from your catalog before five P.M., or wait until the next day.  I don't like this at all (I think DS games are too perfect...).5.  Too many holidays.  Some of them are really poorly named too (La-Di-Da day anyone?).  I put this in the neutral section, because I'm sure many people like to party all of the time.  Tortimer doesn't seem to give gifts in very many of them either.  If you need earlier warnings about events, try to chat with your neighbors.  I received at least a five day, maybe even a week's, notice of Bluebear's birthday this way.6.  Getting jobs and making deliveries is different.  Getting jobs just require speaking to your neighbors in general.  You can no longer ask for work specifically; but no worries, they usually give you jobs to do anyway.  This can be a pain if you just want to talk, rather than work or even compete.  How deliveries are now done can be bad.  They give you a wrapped package and a letter, both screaming to be opened, to give to somebody.  This is only really a problem if you can't control your curiosity, but this can be an annoying problem.  All I can say is packages are not worth the look, as you will learn what they are when the recipient gives them.  Letters... only occasionally.  It's more likely your neighbors will pay you with bells for these jobs, but you can get better pay catching a flock of mosquitoes...  Not really worth the pay, but for 'friendship' purposes (see the good).The Good:1.  How many ways can you say 'realistic'?  That's what this game is.  This game took greater advantage of its three dimensional capabilities better than its precedent; and it really makes you feel like part of the world.  Flower care is realistic; and rather than rain or be sunny all day, the weather is unpredictable.  It could be sunny one hour, and rain the next!  You are not the only one who has birthdays either, your neighbors will also occasionally have birthdays; with small parties you can go to.2.  Three is no longer a crowd!  Sick of talking to Robin?  Oh look, Alice and Limberg are having a chat.  I'm going to eavesdrop on their conversation, because now I CAN!  It's true.  If you see two of your neighbors chatting from across the lawn, there is a small window of opportunity to hear what they are saying.  Just play like you are talking to one of them, and you will hear their conversation; sometimes, you even get to join in!  I think this is pretty cool.3.  Really cute items.  My absolute favorite item you can get is a picture of a neighbor you get close too.  I love collecting these photos, and putting them in my house.  They come with a small note behind them that represents their personality too.  It's Really cute, and each picture unique.4.  You get to know a couple of the older characters more personally.  Eventually you will hear the origins of Tom Nook's and Blathers' pasts.  Even Sable will share a few more memories and secrets.  This makes these characters seem more like people, rather than basic CPU.5.  New characters!  There is a considerable amount new special guests, as well as normal joes and business people.  A couple are a coffee shop pigeon named Brewster, who will warm up to you later, and Blathers' sister, Celeste.6.  Every old character makes a comeback save for Porter.  They are also better than ever, and have greater influences.  They have been changed a tad, a sample being Gracie doesn't make you wash her car, but their still here.7.  Accessorize!  Sick of the old princess hat?  Change it!  Unlike the old Animal Crossing, where you could only change your clothes and hat simultaneously with the same outfit, you can change clothes, hats, glasses, and even your hairstyle (hairstyle comes with Tom Nook's biggest store upgrade).  Wear a sunhat with a blue tie die shirt and sunglasses for the beach!  Or even wear a feather you can get from the Boondox!8.  The game still teaches kids responsibility.  How to live a life on their own, how to make mortgage payments and manage money, even how to do community service.  There is this poor community called the Boondox you can donate bells to.  The more bells you donate, the better off the community is.  Like its precedent, this game has decent life lessons.  It even teaches you should have good insurance!9.  I hear multiplayer is fun.  I haven't tried this, but talking to people live is good in my opinion.10.  New tools!  Shoot balloon floating presents out of the sky with a slingshot, or keep track of a few minutes with a timer.11.  More variety in fish, insects, and seashells.  While it's harder to make money, it's not as boring to fish in the sea.  You can even catch sharks and tarantulas!12.  No more dump.  Now you have a recycling bin in the post office.  It teaches kids to recycle, while wasting less space and being more attractive.13.  The game teaches you not to litter.  To demonstrate this example, like its precedent, you fish countless pieced of garbage out of the ocean.  Annoying yes, but teaches a good lesson.14.  There is new furniture, wallpaper, carpeting, and maybe even more.  Now you can really personalize your house!15.  The HRA isn't as bad as before.  At least not to me, your neighbors seem to have trouble with them though...  Overall, they aren't as mean and unintelligent as they were before.So, that's it in a big nutshell.  Truth be told, I could go on with this game for hours, but many details of this game are better experienced than told.  If you are interested in this game, and you own the first Animal Crossing, I recommend comparing their features; this way, you will be sure if you are getting what you want.  It is important you know the differences between the two, so that you understand you are getting a rather different type of gaming experience.  Both games to me are about just as good.  This game lost some serious features, but the new features can make up for it.  It's a great game, but if I haven't stressed it enough, whether I recommend it for you or not, greatly depends on what reason you are interested.  If you are looking for classics from the old nintendo games, want to perform the good glitches, and are not interested in some store raccoon's history, then don't buy this game.  Buy the original Gamecube Animal Crossing.  If you are just looking for some great new and improved fun, are a hard core fan of any Animal Crossing thing in general, and want a fresh in game life experience, then you have a winner here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2007"}

Diablo 2 is the first exposure I've had to massive multiplayer gaming. I have to say that even though it's got it's flaws, it's not a bad place to start.The plot is simple. You choose 1 from a menu of 5 (7 in expansion) warriors to stop the world from being overrun by minions of a Devil-like demon. Each warrior type has unique spells/combat moves/abilities to help them. But YOU choose what abilities they specialize in as you cannot master every one of their abilities. This allows each class to have several different ways to build them up. Collect special weapons/gear to enhance your abilities or even give you new ones. Half the fun is finding new awesome gear to make you stronger. There is no limit to what kind randomly generated items can be found but specific rare and unique collectible gear are the true prizes if you can find them.Reasons to play:Unlimited Online Play is freeConnecting is as easy as say, logging into emailYou don't need a 3-d accelerator to have this gameIt performs well on my 6 year old computerIt's funNo shortage of fan-made guides and strategiesFlaws:The Blizzard servers lag fairly oftenOnly 8 players per gameIt doesn't have cutting edge graphics (but they still look fine)Finally You can't store all the items you want to on one game, if you need to trade items between different characters you've made, you need a trustworthy friend to hold them for you while you log in and out with different characters to drop/pick-up items.Ways to get the most out of this game:Choose a character and read an online guide on that character to figure out a good way to build stronger. Start with a simple yet strong character like a \"Hammerdin\" or a \"Summoner Necromancer\" and then branch out with new characters as you become more comfortable. Start playing games online solo or witha friend. You'll enjoy the game most if you're actually building characters that can compete on higher levels. Since the game is cheap, you might interest a friend in purchasing the game with you. Playing together online is more fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000NPTOTK","description":"Final Fantasy PSP In Final Fantasy, the tale begins when four young warriors, each possessing a Crystal, are summoned to bring the world back to a harmonious elemental balance.

I resisted all my base impulses for years. Then I just bought it anyway. This remake of the classic that started it all, has been re-brushed and repackaged half a dozen times, but I can call this one the best of its evolutionary states. It has the best graphic touch up and the most extra content thus far. I plowed right through it the way a wino might attack a bottle of MD 20/20, and in similar fashion I am now left feeling cold and guilty and a bit ashamed once again. Final Fantasy why can't I quit you!!!Excuse me I don't know what came over me there. I will try to start the review off on a better foot. Let's see. As remakes go this one is great. It really succeeds in capturing the essence of its aged counterpart, while eliminating all of the unmanageable game system quirks from the first. I will go into that more in a minute. Lets just say that I got my money's worth considering the cheap price of this item on Amazon.Graphics and SoundThe sound is good. You will find all the same tunes from the original, with just a light touch up and a little less of that tinny analog sound that we grew up with. Right from the get go the all too familiar Final Fantasy Theme will let you know that you will soon be getting your fix of crystals swords and sorcery. The music in this Final Fantasy is memorable, if not a little subdued and strange. No complaints there. Things are a little sharper in this version and its a good change. Its especially nice to be rid of the silly sound effect that cued whenever you talked to someone in the game as the text box lazily crawled onto screen. fweeeEEEH... FWEEEeeeh...The graphics have come a long way from the original Nintendo title, and this is certainly a welcome change. The sprites now show a great deal more detail, and the designs are better on the whole. I really enjoy these remakes, and appreciate that they have kept most of them in 2D. I think a nice looking 2D sprite will beat any amount of sub par 3D rendering you care to put on offer. If only they would now put out FF3 for the PSP with 2D sprites, instead of that awful geometry-land mess you had on the DS.Characters and PlotWell your characters have no personalities. This predates the more story and character driven days of the series. You start the game with all of your party members, and you choose their job classes and their names, and you even get to make up all their dialogue yourself! That's right, your characters must have been with each other for a long time because they feel they have little to say to each other, and given the less than riveting conversational style of the towns people you can hardly blame them for being silent there! In fact the well in the starting town offers up better conversation that anyone else in the game.Joking aside, the game has no character development, or even dynamic, and the dialogue is terse and strange in most cases.The plot itself is very basic. The four crystals which hold the world in equilibrium, have been taken by four elemental fiends. Its up to you and your three mute comrades to dutifully kick their butts, retrieve the crystals, and restore order to the world. You spend most of the game wandering around fairly aimlessly for all that. without any character interaction and scant dialogue with NPCs, or \"non player characters\" to move things along, you are really without any sort of perceivable motivation. You more or less stumble on the first crystal after defeating the Earth Fiend known simply as Lich, and then after that its sort of like; \"Well I guess we already have one...Can't do much with an incomplete set of crystals I suppose...\"Its important to remember that this game was a pioneer of the genre. One of the earliest examples of a full on RPG video game. With that in mind you cannot judge some of the silly aspects too harshly. The game is almost fully a nostalgia experience, or maybe research if you are some sort of budding RPG-ologist, but it has a hard time holding up on its own merits by today's gaming standards. There just isn't much here besides a nearly endless procession of monsters to chop up, and a smattering of treasure chests to plunder. It hearkens back to a day when your imagination had to work in tandem with the electronics you might say.Game PlayThis remake has held on to all of the improvements made in the various incarnations of this game over the years, and this serves to make the experience much more enjoyable. Some of the important changes are worth mentioning. At least you will appreciate what they did for you this way. Some may complain, but this isn't a direct port and its clear that they only changed elements that made the game frustrating, or fixed things that were simply limitations in programming knowledge at the time.For one all of the items in the game cost significantly less than they did in the original. You would have to spend hours upon hours decreasing populations of the same monsters just to buy a single weapon or spell previously. Because there was not as much of a world divide in the game, you would run into the pathetic weak enemies that hardly gave you a lead gil, right along with the strong rich ones, which meant you could not count on consistently gaining money. Oh and god forbid you should be poisoned or have a character die because that will mean a long hard trek back to town to buy some ludicrously expensive antidote, or get shaken down by the local church. Our heroes had it way wrong. They should have become merchants...Next up you can now save your game anywhere at any time. This is a great boon in a game where you can potentially encounter nine enemies that can each cast a party targeting instant death spell... Before, you could only save your game at inns. Oh and did I mention that you actually had to pay to stay at the inn? That's right you had to pay your had earned gil just for the privilege of saving your game. This essentially leashed you to the towns for most of the game, and going from a town to a dungeon, could likely turn disastrous if you were to take a wrong turn and end up in the middle of nowhere. It might be better if anyone in town had a clue where the places you had to go were, but then I guess if the people you play are legendary warriors of light, and even they get the crap kicked out of them walking through a field...They also mercifully changed the attacking mechanic in battle. Previously, you had to have all your characters select their targets in combat and then they and the monsters would attack in a seemingly random order. The problem being that you would often have to sit through 6 wolves gnawing your leg off, before you even got a chance to retaliate. In addition to this, if an enemy died from the last person attacking it, the next person would still try to swing at the dead monster instead of selecting a new target. This made battles 10 times harder and more frustrating, because it was always a guessing game as to whether you were going to kill three enemies, and reduce your incoming damage, or lightly scratch three different enemies, and have them turn around and beat you half to death. Thanks for doing away with this miserable mechanic guys!Finally I will mention that the entire magic system has been changed to be like the later MP or \"magic point\" based system. The magic system was set up more like Dungeons and Dragons, where the characters have 8 different levels of spells, and could cast a specific number of each level before resting. I'm a bit conflicted on this one, as I actually liked the old system a little better for the game. In the new system you have boatloads of MP and never really need to conserve your magic. In the old version there was a strategy based around saving all your most powerful magic for big encounters. The result was that you ended up getting use out of most of your magic, instead of just using whatever spell is most powerful all the time. Still I think it does make the game a bit more accessible to most players, and its not bad exactly, just different.There are also some extra dungeons to explore, which helps to lengthen the game a bit, and give access to some new items, weapons, and armor, but all of these feel a little tacked on, and I found myself so irritated by them that I didn't bother going through them after the first couple. I found them boring and hardly necessary, as the game becomes something of a cake walk by the time you even gain access to the final extra dungeons. I suppose it could be fun if you care enough about completion to want to do everything. I suspect that most of us will be ready to move on to bigger and better things however, and will just want to get it over with. You see side quests with extra powerful weapons usually work best when you do them so that you can fight some super powered secret boss. Unfortunately in this game you have to fight all the secret bosses to get the new items so after you have them, you are left with almost nothing to use them on...This game is a remake plain and simple, and its a game that will most likely appeal to people with nostalgia for the first Final Fantasy or those who want to lightly explore the series' roots, without being forced to go mad from punishingly rigid old school game play. As remakes go, I can recommend this one, and I was very pleased with the reverent but firm treatment of the title. The team that does remakes for old Final Fantasy games is terrific. I only wish they would release them all for PSP with similar touch ups. 3,4,5,6 would be welcome in particular!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"Computerdude1032","summary":"Not a perfect game, but tons of fun and better than the original!","reviewText":"Normally I don't write reviews for video games, but after seeing all the negative reviews for this game, I almost didn't buy this game.  Now that I bought it, I'm so happy I did and I want to encourage you to buy it as well.  In short: Starcraft 2 is probably the best RTS game ever made, and the customization options for multiplayer will keep you playing for years to come.  In long...The bulk of the negative reviews seem to focus on two main things:1. The game has DRM (digital rights management) to prevent people who download the game illegally from playing it.  This requires you to enter your CD key upon install, and to be connected to the internet while playing the game.  When you think about it, this is not a big deal.  Many games (*cough* EA *cough*) require you to keep your game CD in the drive in order to play the game.  For me, this is terribly annoying, and I'd much rather have the system Blizzard implemented with Starcraft 2.  With Starcraft, after you install the game you could basically just throw your CD out because the game is permanently registered to you and you can re-download it off their website as many times as you want in the future.  For me, there's no reason to complain about this game's DRM.2. The campaign has almost the same number of missions as the original, and it's quite long.  Yes, most the missions are Terran based and there WILL be expansions later, but it's not like Blizzard removed content from the game, rather they just focused development on Terran so they could focus on more development later. This is NOT a bad thing! The more Starcraft the better!!!Now, I'm not saying the game is perfect, but I see no reason why anyone should criticize it for those two issues.  Additionally, the multiplayer aspect of the game is amazing! Unlike the first game where it was a mad dash to see who could enter a game first before it filled, in this game you enter by map name, so if you click on \"red circle tower defense\" it will just bring you into some red circle tower defense game, not a specific one.  Also, for your standard 2v2,3v3,4v4, and FFA matches, there is a ranked matchmaking system so (after your first 5 matches), you should start to get matched with people of similar skill level.  I'm not a huge fan of the Blizzard created maps, so I'm not sure how much use I will get out of Matchmaking, but based on the endless options for custom games, Multiplayer will NEVER get old (just like the original NEVER got old!).  Anyways, where the game really kicks the original's butt is in terms of the map editor.  Rather than having to mess around with moving your map files to the correct folder, you just click \"publish\" and they will be loaded to Battle.net for you waiting for you and the world to play.  Also, within the map editor, you can download other maps (assuming the publisher published them as \"unlocked\") and edit them as you wish, and then re-publish (with a different name).  When you publish you have the option of making them public or private so you don't have to worry about your unfinished maps getting played if you don't want them played.A note of warning though, the map editor is not for the faint of heart.  You can do literally anything with the tool, but for someone who isn't so great with the computer, the map editor WILL be unusably complex for you.  If you're one of those people, that's OK! Just let us make the sweet maps and you sit back and play them with us!  If your a computer science person (like me), or just good with computers, the map editor will be a powerful tool in your for you!Well, long story short: BUY THIS GAME NOW! It's so much fun, don't let the naysayers (about DRM and campaign length) tell you anything different!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

I'm a moderate gamer, the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review if for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.Persona 4 is a great girlfriend game.  We jokingly refer to it as \"time to watch the anime\". It's a single player game, so my involvement is limited to \"don't say that...say this\" or \"I don't think that's the right answer....\" The characters are interesting and the game is very story driven. With the exception of battle days, which don't happen all that often, the game is actually almost entirely story. I won't get into the plot, but if you're a fan of anime, you will enjoy this game. The game play is intuitive and you will rarely find yourself at a loss wondering what you should do next. The Persona fusing is the most complicated thing about the game, and I usually check the laundry or load the dishwasher when it comes to that point in the game. There are many games that I have sat through in defeated resignation, this is not the case with Persona 4. I'd find myself telling him that it's been 3 days, when are \"we\" going to play the game again! I hate to admit it, but I think I had a little crush on Rise!

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Technohead","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"This game is great.

With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows Dr. Jones escapades through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favorite cinematic moments, from Indy&rsquo;s entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run.Of course, pop culture&rsquo;s most iconic archaeologist will whip through all the classic moments with the help of a host of supporting characters including Marion Ravenwood and Short Round. Players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes just as they could in the best-selling LEGO Star Wars games.Key FeaturesEveryone&rsquo;s favorite fedora wearing hero returns to theaters this May in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and families can celebrate the humor and excitement of the original films with LEGO Indiana Jones.Tongue-in-cheek humor presents The Original Adventures in a manner only LEGO can whip up, with comical reinterpretations of classic Indiana Jones scenes and elements.Use Indy&rsquo;s signature whip as a multi-purpose tool to attack, disarm, swing across gaps, activate levers and interact with a world of LEGO objects and puzzles.For the first time, LEGO Indy characters are fully immersed in their environment; swim, climb, shimmy across rock ledges and pick up and carry objects.Use a variety of weapons from the environment to fight enemies (e.g., chairs, guns, swords, bottles).Unlock more than 60 playable characters, including villains and supporting characters (Marion Ravenwood, Short Round, Rene Belloq, Willie Scott, Marcus Brody, Jones Senior and Mola Ram).Character specific abilities include excavation by Satipo, an umbrella slide by Marcus Brody, and monkey access by Marion Ravenwood.Create unique playable characters like Sallah Scott or Mola Round by mixing and matching the LEGO body parts of all playable characters.Explore the globe and solve puzzles that encourage creative thinking through the use of teamwork and unique building situations only possible in a LEGO world.Cooperative gameplay encourages parents to share the legacy of Indiana Jones with their children in a fun and humorous way.Experience the Adventure as Indiana JonesView ImageSignature moments from the filmsView image","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Adventure Defined","reviewText":"Pros:+Great Nostalgia for the Indiana Jones Fan+Great sense of humor through the cutscenes+Simple gameplay, anyone can pick up and play+A varied number of puzzles through the game+Lots of secrets to uncover+Music score taken directly from the filmsCons:-Short campaign-Big emphasis on hand to hand combat isn't great when you're fighting someone with a projectile-Minor camera issuesIn 2005 the gaming public was introduced to LEGO Star Wars.  That game went on to become a phenomenon.  It was fun, simple and humorous.  LEGO Indiana Jones plays very similar to the LEGO Star Wars games in many different ways.  There are slight differences, however, and while LEGO Indiana Jones is certainly a treat, it isn't quite as good as LEGO Star Wars.If you've played LEGO Star Wars, then Indiana Jones is instantly familiar.  You'll go through all three of the original films.  Throughout the levels you'll be two or more different characters and able to switch on the fly.  Much like the Star Wars games, characters have abilities they can use to get you further into the game.  Some characters can find secret passages, some can double jump.  Indy, of course, uses his whip.  There's a much bigger emphasis on puzzles in LEGO Indiana Jones, but there's nothing here that's too challenging or taxing.  Anyone should be able to pick up and play LEGO Indiana Jones.  There's also co-op play and a friend can jump in whenever they feel like it and drop out whenever they feel like it.There are also studs that you can collect.  Studs are the currency you can use in the hub to do things like purchase hidden characters or other bonuses.  You can get studs by destroying certain objects or simply by taking down enemies.The biggest difference between LEGO Star Wars and LEGO Indiana Jones is the way combat works.  In LEGO Star Wars most characters either had a blaster or a lightsaber.  Indiana Jones relies much more heavily on hand-to-hand combat.  You can find weapons and use them, but they have limited ammunition.  The only bad thing about the gameplay in Indiana Jones is that there's so much of an emphasis on hand-to-hand combat that it leads to unnecessary deaths sometimes.  When the bad guy has a gun and you don't, half the battle is dying to get to him and take him down.  Luckily, there's no penalty for dying in LEGO Indiana Jones other than losing studs.  There's no such thing as a game over.Just like LEGO Star Wars, there's the story mode where you use the characters the story gives you, and then you can go back in Free Play Mode to uncover more secrets you otherwise couldn't before.  You'll want to go back in Free Play Mode in order to get all the secrets.  There are treasure chests to find in every level as well as a red package.  You can't get all the hidden treasure chests in a level without going back in Free Play Mode.  The main campaign probably won't take you that long.  Half the fun of LEGO Indiana Jones is going back into levels and uncovering secrets.In terms of production values, LEGO Indiana Jones is a winner.  The LEGO world is incredible to behold.  While there's no voice acting to speak of in the cutscenes, there's a great amount of humor, and there are a lot of classic scenes that are reenacted very well.  LEGO Indiana Jones is easily a looker, but it also sounds great.  There are a couple of camera hang ups, but nothing too big, and it runs pretty smoothly too.  The music is pulled directly from the films.  John Williams score still sounds good almost thirty years later.LEGO Indiana Jones shouldn't be missed.  If you enjoy Indiana Jones or if you enjoyed LEGO Star Wars, then LEGO Indiana Jones is a must.  It emulates the film very well and is so simple to play that anyone can pick it up and go with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2008"}

It is crucial to help Amaterasu make the world a place where all living creatures can dwell once again.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Amazing","reviewText":"With the PS2's life cycle coming to an end, there are hardly any new games that are anything remotely spectacular.  Capcom's Okami however, is just that, and it's not just one of the best games to ever grace the PS2, it's one of the most original games you'll ever play.  The first thing you'll notice about Okami is the game's incredibly unique art style and graphics, which are some of the best to ever grace the PS2.  Seriously, this game looks incredible, you won't believe your eyes.  Okami's storyline is based on Japanese legend dealing with the sun god Amaterasu, who you play as in the form of a white wolf, and the epic quest that awaits him.  Now, what truly sets Okami apart from the rest of the pack is the caligraphy-esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game.  Need a bridge?  Draw it.  Need to dispatch a pesky enemy?  Draw him in half.  This brush adds a new dynamic to the gameplay which is fresh and unique, and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type.  There's loads of side quests and mini-games as well, adding to the length of Okami which truly make it an epic game, and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the PS2.  If there's anything bad to say about Okami, it's that the combat can get too easy at spots, but that is only an extremely minor gripe.  All in all, Okami is just the thing that PS2 owners have been waiting and yearning for.  An original, epic adventure that doesn't get stale and provides some of the most unique and mouth watering graphics you'll ever see.  If you own a PS2, Okami is an absolute must own, and it's one of the best games you'll ever play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2006"}

I've had the motionplus come off repeatedly while supposedly locked to the remote. I can't imagine it lasting very long in the hands of active children.Aside from that, what everyone is saying about it losing its accuracy when used aggressively is true. I loved sword fighting until I got to the higher levels where the opponents took longer to defeat. I had to quit playing because the remote would constantly lose calibration in the middle of a match.It also doesn't work very well on Wii Resort Kayaking. The same paddle motion that allows you to go left one minute suddenly propels you to the right the next. This is because the remote is not correctly registering which way it is leaning. Like someone else, I bought two of these and both show the same problems. I even tried Kayak racing with two remotes and we both had the same issue. Also watch your battery levels. I found mine ran out MUCH sooner with MotionPlus.

Given the bundle is the same price as a stand alone console, there&#8217;s nothing to not like about it including a game and 4GB memory card.  I&#8217;d want AC III Liberation anyways, so bonus on bundle.I actually prefer the black Vita to the white one.  My preference of limited colors is more silver, green, blue violet and metallic shimmers, like expensive sports car automotive paint.  Even though I love limited colors, they also make me less eager to take the handheld out into the world, which is the point of having one in the first place, so there&#8217;s something to be said for the basic black.  I&#8217;d probably be neutral about the white, but thanks to the stupid blue light, which shines more across the white, than it does on the black vita, choice made.PS Vita bundle cost less than my limited PSP bundle(shiny green Metal Gear PeaceWalker), thanks to Black Friday goodness (3 months of Playstation Plus & Playstation All Stars Battle Royale, too boot).  The proper memory card cost me more than I saved T_T.ACIII: L is in a plastic sleeve with the memory card, but the cartridge lives in my PS Vita, so no big deal there.  I play AC III: Liberation, more than I play AC III on PS3, so far.  I do have some issues with the game, sexism, and play maybe trying too hard to be console and not find its own; jack of all trades, master of none.  I think the fact it is set in New Orleans and I don&#8217;t have to deal with annoying Desmond or present day series story arc issues is why I&#8217;m currently finding it more endearing and engrossing.  I love the Big Easy and its history.The Vita in general:A deal, Playstation Plus free loaner games, and a few specific Vita titles is what it took to push me to look past the Vita&#8217;s shortcomings to even make the purchase in the first place.I did and do not need a Vita.  Thanks to missing desired features and included undesirable features; I&#8217;d decided to wait on the Vita.  I knew only a deal, a console revision, some more releases or completion of DS and PSP library was going to move me.Although lack of new releases is probably one of the least satisfactory reasons to fork out money for new hardware, so I&#8217;m glad it did not come to that.  The Vita is my Merry Christmas to me gift.The new specs, controls has and hopefully will continue to grow what is possible outside of home console gaming.  I get to enjoy Gravity Rush, AC III : L, Wipeout 2048, Playstation all stars battle royale, Uncharted, Hot Shots Golf World Invitational, etc.  now and eventually any other titles, I&#8217;m interested in.I&#8217;m majorly disappointed in the OLED screen.  Sure, in direct sunlight it is best and I don&#8217;t mind the mura blotches (mine are minimal).  I do mind the hideous vertical lines on monocolor and dark screen or dark viewing conditions vertical lines.  I really didn&#8217;t want to go through a gazillion returns and end up with something worse, so I guess I&#8217;m keeping mine, in spite of the nuisance.  Since I don&#8217;t own a tablet or whatever, the Vita was going to be my go to device for video playback.  It really hasn&#8217;t supplanted my 4.3&#8221; LED HTC Thunderbolt.  The lines make images look full of noise and grain.  Also, I have to worry about negative effects of static images.  It hasn&#8217;t been an issue during most gaming (unless we&#8217;re talking Resident Evil 1, 2 & 3).  I thought the point was a crisp, clear, bright quarter high def image with more details and the Vita just failed, thanks to this default in the technology or quality control.  I put Season 3 episodes 1 & 2 of Lost Girl on my Vita to watch them and ok, I didn&#8217;t see the lines most of the time, but I didn&#8217;t see a lot of other things, either.  It looked like a bunch of silhouettes at time on the bus and even on full brightness I ended up seeing my reflection, not the show!  Same file on my phone, ok my phone has less viewing angles, but the image is sharper and there&#8217;s no annoying lines making everything look grainy.  They both suck in the wrong sunlight, though I get less of my reflection in the phone.  Also, I can play more video formats and load them on my phone faster and easier.  OLED is not all it is cracked up to be (especially combined with touch screen, if that&#8217;s why the damn lines).No swipe on on screen keyboards.  Seriously, tapping instead of sliding or swiping or whatever you want to call it on touch screens is very inefficient.Vita needs TV Out.  Whether we&#8217;re talking about blowing up something at a friends, or on the road, or just continuing to play the game at home.  There&#8217;s not enough cross play and transferring saves back and forth is far from seamless, although retro city rampage saves are pretty seamless.  The fact of the matter is the immersion of some of the games makes me not want to play out and about, and I&#8217;d like hdmi out.I wish they&#8217;d release vocaloid to US or let us buy digital copy of Japanese vita title from US account.  Aside from Persona 4 Golden, this is my other most wanted PS Vita game that I don&#8217;t have.More power and more controls and refined analog and a few of the new games, made Vita an interesting entry.  I have not really got excited over 3DS titles, even though there are some of those I want to play.  Also, PS3 and XBOX 360 rpg gaming was disappointing and limited in titles compared to DS Lite and PSP.  PS Vita looks poised to continue where the PSP leaves off.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

Their takes on racing, from the more traditional PGR series to the shooter-that-is-actually-a-Yes, Blur is, overall, a kart racer. Yes, it uses actual carrs, but the gameplay itself is pure kart racer. You have your power ups and a bit of rubber banding AI to keep the races close. You have opponents who will hold their weapons until the last lap and then unleash hell upon you.Bizarre has managed to craft a truly phenomenal racing title here. Single player is difficult, largely due to generous rubber banding, but there is so much to do that you will never get bored. There are daily challenges that are updated, naturally, daily. You get rewards for using weapons, perks for beating bosses, and other rewards for pulling off certain feats.While single player can be quite frustrating, online is where the game REALLY shines. They lifted generously from Modern Warfare and made a Perks system of their own. You do cool things and you get cool cars. Its a simple, yet addictive, mechanic. And without rubber banding in multiplayer, skill plays more of a role than luck. The race will still be chaotic, but not to the same degree.I like the track layout. Shortcuts abound and while some driving talent is needed, but you are given a wide enough berth to really cause some havoc. You race in fantastic versions of real locations. Weapon layout isn't random, so its not just blind luck as to what you pick up. I like the look of the game, though the visual effects when your ride is about to blow up make driving quite difficult.I admit I didn't have high expectations here, but I will be damned if this game didn't shock me with its high quality. Its a really good take on a kart racer that needs consideration.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001CRQYBO","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"I went on an Easter Egg Hunt and a War Broke Out!","reviewText":"Although the shootouts in Wolfenstein are fun, so much emphasis is placed on searching through every nook and cranny for hidden items, you forget about the war.Wolfenstein is a Mission Based First Person Shooter that pits an American Super Spy vs Nazi Super Soldiers.  There are 8 Missions in the game that advance the plot and a few Side Missions for no apparent reason.  The game also features Multiplayer Modes with a variety of different game types.Concept: 6/10You are Agent BJ Blaskowicz, American Super Special Agent sent to thwart the Third Reich's Super Soldier Program during WWII!  Not only do you have a silly name, you have an ancient relic that gives you supernatural powers.  With this relic, you can see in the dark, slow time, shield yourself from bullets, and increase the power of your guns.  Actually, as far as super power bestowing ancient relics go, this one is pretty weak.  But, if you need an excuse to kill Nazis, this game does the job.Gameplay: 5/10The gunfights are solid.  BJ is armed with machine guns, a sniper rifle, grenades, a flame thrower, a few energy weapons, and the aforementioned ancient relic of bestowing mediocre powers.  The Nazis are good at finding cover and shooting at you.  Nazi Sub Bosses with special powers buff their allies, forcing you to make decisions about how to survive the encounters.  However, some of the sub bosses are really cheap.  If you don't fight them exactly how the game wants you to, they insta kill you.  The Bosses also suffer from a 'Stand Here and Do X Now' design.  It's a good thing that checkpoints are generous.  At the end of each level, you are graded on time, enemies killed, and how many hidden items you found.  Hidden Gold allows you to buy upgrades for your weapons.  Hidden Files give you deeper insight to the game's story.  Because weapon upgrades are tied to searching every nook and cranny in a level, and not tied to killing enemies, the game feels more like an Easter Egg Hunt than an adventure.Graphics:  7/10The game uses ID's Doom 3 Engine, so Wolfenstein doesn't look nearly as good as Gears of War 2, Halo 3, or Call of Duty.  The cutscenes are fairly well rendered, but there is nothing jaw dropping. The character models look average.  Some levels look better than others, but overall, Wolfenstein looks sub par compared to the other first person shooters out there.Story:  5/10The game fiction seems broken in Wolfenstein.  The title screen is a crashed bomber on a field in flames... for no reason.  When you select an option like \"Continue Game\" or \"Options\" they show different Nazi Soldiers... for no reason.  The story is told through cutscenes and feels disjointed at times.  The NPC's don't even really look at you when they speak.  You click on them and they just sorta state the obvious.  A huge problem with the game's fiction is that it clashes with the gameplay.  If you're in a level, NPC's may be shouting, \"HURRY, WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!\"  But in order to upgrade your guns, you have to search levels thoroughly to find Gold.  So, you ignore the characters pleading for your help in order to rummage through garbage cans in alleys.  Think about that for a second.  You have 6 Allies urgently begging for your help in a firefight, but the game decided that it's more important for you to look through garbage.Sound:  9/10The gunfire and explosions do a decent job at keeping the action exciting, but the real hero here is the music composer.  The music of this game is reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark and really captures the spirit of adventure.Replay Value: 6/10The Single Player Campaign is only 6-8 hours long.  There are 4 Difficulty levels in the game and you can replay Missions over again if you want to try and find more hidden items.  If looking in dumpsters in Nazi Germany is your thing, then go for it!  There are Multiplayer Games with different objectives, but they aren't as fun as Halo, Gears, Red Faction, or Call of Duty.This game is rated M for warlike violence.  Characters get shot, dismembered by sniper bullets, vaporized, and immolated.  There's no nudity and I don't recall any foul language.  So, most Americans would think that this is ok for kids!Overall:  6/10The game really feels sub par.  With a short single player campaign, emphasis on collecting hidden items over story, and cheap insta-kill bad guys, Wolfenstein falls short of the competition.Rent it if you want to have some fun killing Nazis over a weekend.Buy it if you're a collector of first person shooters or you really want to get into multiplayer.Avoid it if you're already playing Gears, Halo, Red Faction, Call of Duty... and you don't want to take a step backwards.If you like this game, I can recommend Doom 3, Bioshock, Red Faction, Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty, or Left 4 Dead.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2009"}

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"If you liked MUA...","reviewText":"Basic: If you liked Marvel Ultimate Alliance, you'll like this sequel even more.Graphically: Similar to first, but improved. The environments look a lot better and the character interactions aren't too bad. It's a RPG so you're stuck with a certain viewpoint at times, but you do control how close/far you are from your four characters for the most part.Bugs: They're working on some problems. One was joining an online game and the hangups. There are some glitches on some of the missions, but I've found if you exit and reload the game save, it'll fix itself. One in particular was a boss battle and you have to eliminate the surrounding enemies before you can damage the boss (rinse, repeat), but one of my characters knocked one of the guards off the edge, preventing me from causing any harm to him.Gameplay: The added fusions are lots of fun and the character abilities are close to what I would expect them to be able to do. The different fusions in the game are definitely where it is at, tons of different interactions between the list of characters. There are some similarities when using like characters, but for the most part there are three basic fusions (guided, targeted, clearing) and depending upon which heroes you have and who you're trying to initiate the Fusion with, you might be limited to what fusions you can do.The missions aren't too bad, and I think the best part of the game is choosing sides and having different bosses through a section of the game. I'd recommend playing through twice, once on regular/hard difficulty through either Pro or Anti-Reg, and another time through the other on Legendary difficulty.Sounds/Voices: for the most part the voice-acting was really well done. Most of the characters sound like they should. And a lot of the familiar marvel sounds are there.Online/MP: as mentioned, the online can be problematic, but it is more fun to play through the scenarios with a co-op buddy (on or offline). Especially since the AI doesn't do the best of jobs of managing your non-human controlled allies.Recommend?: Yes and No. Great for Marvel fans and RPGers. If you liked MUA, XMen Legends, etc., you'll like MUA2. The DLC is kind of pricey however (it's cool that they added Carnage, Psylocke, Magneto, and Cable tho!). The Juggernaut is fun to use, but is only available separately. If you have a friend that has the game and the character, just join their game to try out the Juggernaut (there are free patches to allow for Co-op members to share DLC while online, but once you quit, you'll be back to your standard team list). The game takes some time to get through considering it has a bunch of simulator challenges, hidden conversations, hidden collectibles, and 2 different playthroughs, but after that you're done.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

When I started playing it, I thought this would be one of the few games with true replay value, since the characters are so different and intriguing in their own way.Unfortunately, the game is so buggy that it is hardly playable, and that is with the latest patches applied! I have several quests I am not able to complete due to bugs. Some of them, the game will simply not recognize as completed, and others crash the game at the end of the quest. Argh!I understand that it is a lot of work to make role playing games, and I also understand that the logical web can be quite complex. But at the end of the day, this comes down to a good development and QA process. No rocket science here. It's simply a matter of getting the logic straight. A task developers of business applications master in much more complex scenarios every day.Unfortunately, Troika has gone out of business since they made this game. Too bad too, because overall, they were a good company. However, this game I do not quite understand. Apparently they had to wait before they could release this game since it was based on Valve's Source engine and therefore, this game could not be released before Half Life 2. Well, if that is true, then why didn't they have time to iron out all the bugs? Or use the source engine a bit better? Graphics are good but not great, and as you move around in the world, you get a lot of flicker and the camera often keeps jumping back and forth like crazy. To a point that it's nauseating. If this was Troika's last attempt to keep the company going, then I have to say I am sorry, but this was not even close! No wonder they didn't have more people buy this disappointment.Don't get me wrong. I had fun with this game. When it works, it is pretty cool.

I like other genres and I have a love for Need For Speed games since the beginning. I played the demo and watched the trailer to this new title and I was drawn in. I went out on release day and picked up my copy. I then began watching and reading some reviews and they were less than steller. I still debated on keeping the game and then Black Friday rolled around. I received a $30 price adjustment on the game plus a store coupon, so I basically got this game for free.With that being said...I finally opened up this game and said, what do I have to lose...nothing!!! Well I didn't lose much but I'm average at best when it comes to racing games. I found this game to be exciting one moment...heart pounding and then freaking boring in fighting/cutscene mode...press Y, then X, then B and then A and again and again to escape being locked up from the Vegas Metro PD...boooo!!! That was a total waste of my time but it was a must to advance to the next mission. I then found myself playing catch up missions and 3 and 4 part racer missions that you must \"beat the clock\" on to get the the next segment. I hate those missions. Next I found myself playing certain missions like 6 or 7 times because there is no such thing as second best...U MUST BEAT ALL OF THE OPPONENTS to advance. I found in some of the missions that some of the other cars (AI) were ridiculously hard to beat. I was just about to win a really difficuly mission racer wise...when I was a few feet from the finishline when the freaking bastard whipped past me and won and I had to start all over again, my heart literally just dropped and I was freaking pissed off.I am really trying hard to hang in with this title because I really want to love it  but there seems to be no chemistry between me and the game. I think is an awesome looking game...graphically...second to none, thanks to that Frostbite 2 Engine and used in (Battlefield 3). If I must suggest this game to a wide range of people I would say if you are hardcore into NFS or just a hardcore racer...this game might just disappoint, but if you are new to video games or the genre you may love or hate it.

Were all 8 hours enjoyable? Hardly.Sure the game has its moments of spooky survival and dark things that go bump in the night, but i wasnt too impressed with the final product.The 'room' gets very annoying quick. You have to go back to your room a bajillion times throughout the game to save, heal, swap items (because of the super annoying inventory system), exorcise hauntings, and read clues under your door. Having to go back to the same old dull looking apartment room gets old too fast.Plus some of the areas are downright confusing. The circular prison and subway system will have you running in circles figuring out what and where to go next. And i was hardly impressed with the level design. The hospital was a large hallway with 10 rooms like a grid. And the apartment complex and sports store level were nothing but similar stairways and rooms. The levels lacked originality in my book and the only one i really enjoyed was the forest and orphanage. Spooky stuff there.And quite possibly the worst thing about Silent Hill 4 is the combat. Every enemy, from the dogs to the two headed monsters to the nurses followed the same attack pattern. And knocking each one down then 'stomping' them gets tedious too. And sometimes you will keep attacking a downed enemy while another standing enemy is right beside you! Annoying? Yes.And dont even let me get started on the horrible, ugly, dumb,  partner you pick up halfway through the game. Having to constantly protect and walk slow for a useless 2nd character was terrible.All in all Silent Hill 4 is not a bad game. Though its not a particularly good one either.

This is the experience that core gamers have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Short and Sweet","reviewText":"Much like the game itself, this review will be short and to the point: For those of us who have been playing MGS for a long time now, this prologue-type game is indeed worth the price of purchase. I took pleasure in seeing the MGS universe rendered on a next-gen system (these are the BEST graphics I have ever seen - the FOX Engine is absolutely incredible), and the new mechanics work beautifully. Having benefited from playing the other games in the series, the complicated plot was not lost upon me, and I can get many hours of playtime from experimentation and varying my style of play (just like the MGS2 demo, all those years ago, but with the addition of challening side missions).However, I honestly can't recommend this game to newcomers... they will be utterly bewildered by the story, and they will most likely be upset when they finish the game so quickly. I also feel like you're less likely to go back and spend time exploring, if you're not already invested in the MGS universe.But for MGS diehards, like me, there is much to be enjoyed in this little teaser from Kojima... and I'm sure we'll be unveiling hidden Easter Eggs for months to come!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end?

Say if you only play SP most games are not worth the price anymore, why don't things like Steam allow you to buy SP only for say $20 for 2 playthroughs? Steam actually cuts down choice since it is such a pain to resell a Steam game, and SP only people are really looking for the secondhand market as thier only option to a more reasonable and indicative price to what they are getting. Oh, they'll nickel and dime people with selling virtual stuff a la carte, ONCE you've already bought the whole game at full price but won't give you the larger choice of SP only or MP only purchase. SP was an afterthought in COD42, but was the main attraction in this game so this game is worth more money to SP people than COD42 but it's actually the opposite to those lovely greedies like IW, Rockstar and the like.I'm a Single player only as I don't want to get more hooked on VG's than I am and it seems that MP is the route to that ultimate of time wasting. I have to say the labeling by the professional reviewers is wrong, this is not an \"action RPG\" in my book, it's a straight FPS with some RPG elements. RPG elements being getting various weapons, shields and other things and doing side missions to upgrade them as well as at the very start being able to choose the character you will play the game through with. Each of the 4 characters you are given a choice to play have different skills and specialties but you will be able to use all weapons, just not use all upgrades. Other than that you are not really given any choice in what you do throughout the game with no alternate routes as far as I can tell.Simply, this game is very fun and funny if you like 15+ single player levels and many different items to upgrade and collect that actually help you in the game instead of just lame \"bonus\" objects like that meaningless extra stuff they put on DVD/BD's in order to charge you more. It's not a complicated game, just a shoot weapons and drive a \"fummer\"(Future Hummer) around to your various objectives and bosses. I love the art style, it's hybrid of normal and cell shaded/comic book and the various characters and thier comments are hilarious at times. The levels are all fairly awesome to look at, particularly the Salt Flats with the huge Thor machine. All of the various creatures are well done and move around well.Of course it can get repetitive in terms of the small claptrap robots always giving you messages of available off story missions available as well as the weapons/shields/artifacts upgrades just really being a more powerful version of the previous one. If you like FPS's you'll like this one though, it's not very often we get a NON-sequel and well done FPS nowadays. I'm glad I went with this rather than COD42, as how can anyone who plays SP only want to pay sixty bucks for an overwhelmingly MP game?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

Usually Sonic is a rolling fiend, zipping along tracks. In this case, you can choose from one of four teams, each of different difficulty levels. For example, the 'Chaotix' team is made up of a bee, an alligator and a mysterious purple horned Sonic-like guy. The three run along levels together, gathering golden rings, beating up on monsters.Each character has his or her own special powers. If the 'flying' one of the group leads, the trio can now fly to higher levels. There's usually a fast member and a strong member in each group as well, for breaking objects and zooming along tracks.You have to figure out in each situation who to lead with, to get past the current obstacle. This might be easy on early levels, but it does get to be a tough challenge in later missions!The graphics are reasonably good, with nice details on surfaces, although it's sort of clear that textures were just mapped on rather bsic shapes. The maps are very large and you have full mobility through an entire map without loading times, so that's great.Each team is a different level of difficulty with its own characters, voices and plot - so it's great to start with the easy levels, learn how the characters and gameplay work, and then move up through the more difficulty levels. Yes, the easy levels are easy. They're meant to be! But there definitely is more challenge as you get to the harder levels, so play through to find your challenge level.In the beginning it's obvious which character to use in a situation, but as you work through the choices become harder and harder. The maps are so large that you can approach a given puzzle from many different directions, with any of the characters under your control.The music is actually pretty good for a game, but some of the voices are REALLY annoying.All in all, a great idea for a platformer. With so many platformers using pairs of characters now (Ratchet &amp; Clank, Jax &amp; Daxter etc) going to 3 was a natural progression. A good mindless game to wile away the hours with!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2004"}

I usually finish games within a few weeks, so this game just sat in my gamecube wasting away.  This game is long, sometimes frustrating, but very, very rewarding.  Completing the game takes about 60 hours, and that is with some help from a gamefaq's walkthrough.The first thing that strikes you is the atmosphere and graphics.  Even for a last generation game, it is impressive.  This and Resident Evil 4 really showed that the Gamecube was quit the superb little graphical powerhouse.  The lighting, the water, all show new breakthroughs previously unseen in other games at that time.  Each realm in the Zelda countryside all have an atmosphere that is both real and fitting.The game has an open feel encompassing all of the countryside.  You get snow, castles, villages, canyons, underwater residences, lakes, etc.  The variation and the look is amazing.  The amount of things to explore, like all Zelda games, is massive.  There are plenty of things to do and plenty of places to explore.This brings the most important thing - gameplay.  Each dungeon is unique in its presentation and gameplay.  Many of them are quite ingenious.  For example, to pass a certain level, you need to hit a switch with an arrow, which would then turn on an electric current that turns a metallic cave's roof into a giant magnet, which you can climb when you put on magnetic boots.  These are the types of \"puzzles\" that need to be solved.  This game rewards thought, not just reflexes.There are some problems though.  I hate bosses in all games, because if you die in the middle, you have to restart it.  Also, bosses tend to have one gimmick which you must find out about, and you will just die and die until you figure out the gimmick.  Zelda's bosses fit this description.  Fortunately, they are not difficult.  Also, many levels require you to look at a certain place, or hook into some place that you would have never thought of.  For example, in the last level, you have to shoot a painting, which looks like it's just part of the background.  If there weren't any walkthroughs on the Internet, I would still be stuck there.Finally, this is game is long.  Way too long.  For some people, that is a good thing.  For me, not so much.  I stopped caring about the story after a while.  Not because it's wasn't compelling, but just I wanted to get this game over with.All in all, a great adventure game that lives up to the Zelda name.Pros:Great graphics for a last gen gameBeautiful atmosphereNice looking cutscenesVery balancedUnique, inventive, and well thought out dungeonsCons:Needs a walkthrough at a few pointsCould have been shorterTime for Zelda to have voice actingDifficulty: MediumTime to Complete: 60 hoursFrustration level: Medium","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2007"}

It's really hard to put down.I love the snappy interface and as someone unfamiliar with the whole genre, this game does an excellent job of introducing combat systems without overwhelming.The characters are well realized, and though I haven't tried the traditional perma-death system yet I'm sure it will add a lot of intensity on a second playthrough, particularly as you lose not only the character but the bonds they've formed with other characters to benefit and the teamwork benefits of keeping them together.My favorite part about the game is the art. The cutscenes are a joy to watch and progress the story meaningfully without being longwinded or overbearing.If you're already into SRPG and JRPG games I'm sure you'll enjoy this one- all the other reviews can tell you how awesome it is.

Some of the new features this game adds are: easier city management, and the option for a global landscape for your game where the action takes place on a planet that is pretty well graphically rendered. Also, the overall look of the game is sort of a hybrid between two and three dimensions, so it looks good graphically, but is still easy to maneuver.It does have a few bad points. First, as you increase the difficulty, it becomes rediculously hard pretty fast and no longer enjoyable because you get wiped out really early on in the game. Second, this version doesn't really add a lot compared to the last version as far as gameplay goes. Finally, I found myself often having to restart the game because the \"random\" position the computer starts you off in often is in a corner of the landscape with few resources.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2006"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"It's the new best Sonic game!","reviewText":"It seems like that due toSonic Colors, Sega's finally taken 3D Sonic games to the right direction. It's further proven with the release of Sonic Generations, a game that takes nearly all of Sonic's history and compacts it into one game, with new levels in those familiar environments! Naturally, we Sonic fans were all hyped. And what's even better is that the final product was no letdown.Sonic Generations starts you off in the classic Green Hill Zone, re-imagined with entirely new level design, semi-remixed versions of the catchy level music, and brilliant graphical details! Once you start playing, it feels just like theGenesisSonic games all over again, with the addition of X letting you automatically Spin-Dash (Although the original \"Down+A\" combination is still there), and...B to crouch (\"Down\" still present too).In case you didn't get enough of the game's from-the-start brilliance, there's also theDreamcast-eraModern Sonic, who, like in Sonic Colors, is complete with Boosting, Homing Attack, etc. He gets his own versions of the background music as well. Since Sega's finally doing it right for 3D Sonic games, playing as Modern Sonic is just fun as it is playing as his old pot-bellied counterpart.Remember when there were scenes like that giant truck chasing Sonic down a road in Sonic Adventure 2?Sonic racing Metal Sonic? Shadow? How about that time when he ventured through the Sky Sanctuary, and nearly drowned in the pink water from Chemical Plant Zone? You get to relive all of that in this game, and these events fit perfectly with the game's new level layouts (The giant truck can destroy some construction sites, changing those bits of level design for Classic Sonic!).Of all that Sonic had gone through, though, there are only 9 Zones in Generations, representing games like Sonics 1, 2, 3, Adventure, Adventure 2, Next-Gen (The 2006 game, but thankfully, its Zone, Crisis City is actually a lot of fun here), Unleashed, and, of course, the recent Sonic Colors. You would probably think that the game is as short/long as the Genesis games, and while you could say that, there are lots and lots of challenges and achievements you can do and get, making the replay value grow largely.Even if you did beat the game by completing its minimal requirements, you can't hide the fact that you have enjoyed the thrill ride throughout, from beginning to end. Happy Birthday, Sonic....UPDATE (7/4/2012): As I was looking at this recently on Amazon, I realized the prices have dipped for both new and used copies of the game! Now that you can find it for under $20, there's absolutely NO excuse to skip this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

I can remember my father telling me that Mercedes designs cars to look good tomorrow, not today.  He was right.  With every model, like clockwork, after a year or so they'd start looking good, then great.  My bet is Battlefield will be much like that.  As truly fun as it is to play today, it'll be much better in a year or so.Few quick reasons to love this game:1.  When you run it on a great machine the graphics/game physics are mindblowing.2.  The game encourages teamplay.  I know, it's hard to imagine quake trained gamers playing medics, but over the past months since its release, the game is conditioning its players to team up.  It's working, and it's really really fun to work with a good squad.3.  The game/network is very intelligent.  Scarily intelligent.  Everything you do on a ranked server is tracked forever.  Everything.  Gaining rank gets you new weapons and status you can leverage into a Commander position.4.  This game not only supports VOIP, but encourages it.  Commanders can talk to squad leaders, squad leaders talk to their members, very good order.5.  Online play will frequently (i'm talking multiple times an hour) give you \"one of those gaming moments\".  You know, when your pulse quickens, and you feel like you're really in the game.  My girlfriend can hear me screaming from my downstairs (things that would make a pornstar blush).  I'm not even cognizant of it.6.  Helicopters with TV guided rockets. Nuf said.7.  Command and control.  If a side plays without a commander, odds are they'll lose.  If one plays with few (if any) experienced squad leaders, they'll lose.  Very cool and unique feature.Reasons you might not want this game:1.  This is the most insane system-hog of a game I've ever encountered...very frustrating for even relatively good systems.I've had high hopes for games of all genres over the past 2-3 years, I've reviewed many of them, some favorably, but I think BF2 is the best action First Person Shooter on the market (and probably will be for a few years).  One reason for that belief is the extraordinary hardware requirements it demands to truly perform.  I started playing it on a 3.3MHZ w/ best Geforce card, and 1Meg of RAM.  It lumbered, and the graphics were subpar compared to other FPS's.  I now have a freakin super-computer (dual cards, 4Megs RAM) and it runs like a different game.  When hardware catches up, the underlying value of this game will get more appreciation vs. present-day frustration.I've logged at least 70 hours on this game, and I learn something new every night.  So many layers to uncover, then combine.  I think this game still has allot to show people.  And, like each redesigned model of Mercedes, will prove its true beauty over time.Enjoy,Christian HunterSanta Barbara, California","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2005"}

Many gamer reviews have had ill to say as well.  I read what all these nay-saying reviewers wrote before I played the game and then I went back and re-read their reviews after I finished the game yesterday morning.  In reflection:  They were all WAY OFF.  Thief Deadly Shadows is an amazing addition to the Thief franchise and a great stealth/action stand-out.  I noticed that all of the reviewers who gave the game poor marks did so because it had a few bugs in it.  And because the game is only playable on XP and 2000.  - Those were their two major gripes.  --  About the bugs I shall say this:  The game is indeed buggy and crashed on me more than once.  It was nothing serious though.  It didn't make me NOT want to boot it back up and find a way around the bug.  Deadly Shadows is extremely fun and it will have you coming back for more.  I think that's a point that a lot of these die-hard gamer geeks are forgetting: DEADLY SHADOWS IS A FUN GAME.  Some gamers can be technical and stringent to the point where they don't allow themselves to have fun while playing a game.  The reviews those people post are the worst reviews for you to read when deciding whether or not you want to buy a particular release. Deadly Shadows, despite a few minor bugs that will be fixed in an upcoming patch, is a very fun game to play.  It is addictive and carries with it a story that is well-written, suspenseful, and fun to take part in.  That being said I must mention the two greatest features of Deadly Shadows.//  First and foremost:  The dynamic shadows.  The shadow-play in this game is extremely well done.  The way that shadows and light exist together in the different environments looks absolutely great.  Walking around a dimly lit room from candlelight to moonlight is awesome to behold in DS.  Very realistic looking; it draws you deeper into the Thief world.  *Great shadows and lighting.*  I cannot stress that point enough.  The second thing I must mention:  Shalebridge Cradle...  It is a level you're going to play when you're about halfway through the game.  It is AWESOME.  Genius, genius, genius.  Without a doubt one of the most memorable levels in any game to date.  The environment itself, the concept behind it, and the way it is played out - all genius.  High marks for Ion Storm on that one.  Go and see Shalebridge Cradle.As for the technical stuff? -  I played the game on a Pentium 4.  2.8 ghz with 512mb of ram.  I used a Geforce fx card with 128mb onboard.  The game ran fine for the most part on 1024 resolution but there were a few lighting-intense rooms that were just too much and it killed my frame rate.  Other than those few occurrences of intense multi-lighting the game ran great.  The graphics and artwork are decent. - Always made better by the gorgeous aforementioned lighting/shadow aspect.  In summary:  Buy this game.  Play this game.If you're a fan of the series: Enjoy an excellent return to the Thief saga.  If you're a newcomer:  Welcome, and be prepared to have a lot of fun with Deadly Shadows.  All around, this is a great action/stealth game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Never been done better","reviewText":"Rogue Leader was originally a launch title for the Nintendo Gamecube, and continued the franchise started by Rogue Squadron on the N64. The basic gameplay is something of an elevated arcade shooter. It's nowhere as in-depth as a flight sim, but it includes some situations where you'll need to do some genuine tactical thinking to get out alive (protecting convoys, destroying targets, etc). You'll have an infrared heads-up display and basic command over your wingmen, as well as an extra payload of bombs or torpedoes to get the job done. Missions range from new levels and environments to recreations of key scenes from the movies (Battle of Hoth, attack on the Death Stars).What really turned Rogue Leader into a system seller was its stunning graphics. This is still one of the prettiest titles on the Gamecube, and comes the closest of any game to looking like Star Wars (with the possible exception of the sequel, Rebel Strike). The amount of detail is breathtaking, and the effects are solid. Nintendo lost a solid developer with the departure of Factor 5.The only nitpick about this game is that it basically plays the same as the N64 original, and also the other Star Wars space shooters (Battle for Naboo, Starfighter). Graphics, framerate and audio have take a huge leap in quality, but the basic gameplay (and some of its limitations, like z-axis movement in space) is untouched. In that sense at times it feels like a tech demo souped up with fancy bells and whistles. But if that's it, then it's one of the most satisfying tech demos you'll ever play.This is a must-have for all Gamecube owners, Star Wars fans or not.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2005"}

Now, I know the entire public most likely believes that all COD games were made with regenerating health, but that's why this first game will always be the best.  It requires real strategy, tactics, and skill just to stay alive.  You have to stay in cover at all times, always observe the environment, and only cross open ground after you're sure you've killed everyone.  You also have to conserve all health packs in the environment, only picking them up when you're finally about to die.  For the ultimate mashochist, the hardest difficulty, &#34;Veteran,&#34; completely removes all health packs and won't even register any checkpoints if you happen to drop below 50% health, not to mention the fact that all enemies are super-accurate and deal massive amounts of damage in no time flat.  I honestly thought that &#34;Ghosts&#34; would go back to this mechanic, given the title name's implied emphasis on stealth, but it didn't.  COD has become so blinded by its own success that it keeps spitting out basically the same old format year after year and refuses to try anything different.  That's why this first game will always be the best ever.COD was developed by Infinity Ward, which at the time was a brand new development company that was started by the same team who was responsible for the mega-hit &#34;Medal Of Honor: Allied Assault.&#34;  Published by Activision, COD feels like a more polished, more diverse, and deadlier version of MOHAA.  Where MOHAA focused on only one perspective, the Americans vs. the Germans, COD adds Great Britain and Russia into the mix.  Of course, this means that you can also use each side's weapons to your advantage, some of which are even better than what the Germans have.  You can only carry two guns at a time, so it helps to have a short-range and a long-range weapon to maximize your effectiveness.  A sniper rifle is invaluable when it comes to wide-open areas with little cover, and a sub-machine gun is excellent for clearing out tight, enclosed areas with multiple enemies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2014"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Brutal, near-perfect, frustrating to no end :)","reviewText":"This is my very first 'serious' racing game, played with Logitech's Drivingforce GT wheel.Since this is a much talked about topic, let me state that I do not find it to be 'small' or 'an extended demo'. If anyone can show me a $30 PS3 racing demo with dozens of cars, half a dozen race tracks and online capabilities then... I would consider calling this 'a demo'. On the other hand, I never played the previous GT's so, when the 'real' game becomes available I just MIGHT be able to understand why some aren't happy with this game's size.Overall evaluation:- graphics are super-excellent- sound is great- control (with a racing wheel) is as close to reality as you can get- online is challenging but a race with 12 cars in it can get quite chaotic- car customization is okay, but all options other than 'color' become available only in the super-advanced level- the race tracks difficulties ranges from 'very easy' (Daytona) to Super Hard (Suzuka) to fun (London)- the AI gets better and more aggressive as you advance to the higher classes- the simulation is quite good for a $30 game- the 'challenges' range from 'very easy' to 'next to impossible'- collisions and crashes never result in 'damage' but, at the higher classes, the cars involved in collisions may temporarily turn into 'ghosts' - meaning that the other cars can pass through them- the penalty system consists in having your engine cut for a number of seconds, whenever the God inside the PS3 decides that you were guilty of getting off the track or bumping into your adversaries. I don't always agree with the way this is administered - YOU usually a 'ramming penalty' when someone hits you from behind... oh wellWhat's not to like? What I like the least about this game is that I conquered the 30 challenges of Classes C, B, A each and I am only 2 wins away in the S-Class from actually earning the right to using my $2 million (which I have) to buy that great Ferrari. I just can't seem to be able to win those 2 - Suzuka and Fuji, I believe. What makes this more frustrating is that the makers of this game made these races MORE DIFFICULT, following an 'update', back in early August.If anyone has good POST UPDATE configurations for the 2 'impossible' races, please post them here as 'comments'. I ran that Fuji race a thousand times already but, somehow, no matter what car I use and how I customize it, it's still underpowered when compared to the computer-controlled competition.

I know the game is called Saints Row IV but I will call it Saints Row 3.5 since it does not feel like a whole new game.A quick little bit of info here... Saints Row IV started off as DLC before THQ shut down, it was originally meant to be the final big DLC add-on (us older gamers would call it an \"Expansion\" pack) to Saints Row 3. THQ went bankrupt and Volition was bought up by Deep Silver. They took the final DLC, the core game, and stretched it out into a full game. Thus the reason for a 4 out of 5 review.So to be clear, this game is still Saints Row 3. Same city, same vehicles (less of them though), same graphics, same game engine. Just certain things added or taken away.This game is absurdly fun and funny. So let me break it down as spoiler free as possible:Game engine: The exact same as Saints Row 3.Graphics and Models: Deep Silver took some vehicles and assets from the previous games and reworked them to the wonderful level of detail seen in the First Saints Row game, mainly the vehicles. They have a much higher level of fit and finish than even Saints Row 2 had. BUT, there are fewer vehicles in this game than in any of the other games. Boats are completely gone, so waterways are absolutely empty. Only 2-3 Airplanes remain and there is no civilian air traffic. The animation and characters are much nicer looking and seem to have had a once over by Quality Control. So all round the models are much nicer. Ran smoothly at max ultra settings on an old EVGA 460 GTX at 1920x1080, 8gigs of ram and a 3.0 GHz quad core processor from 5 years ago.Sound and Music: The sound effects are pretty much the same from SR3. The music on the other hand is absolutely great, they have just about everything, and lots of big name songs. The voice acting is wonderful, even Nolan North (of Drake, Deadpool and seemingly every male video game character ever made, fame) lends his voice to the player character list, along with quite a few name brand voice and film actors as other characters... The roster is rather impressive and makes the game all the more fun.Story: The story in this game is much more fun and involving than SR3 was. You will need to play all the previous Saints Row games to understand the back stories, banter, and in-jokes of many of the characters in this game. Plenty of \"OMG!\" moments, and lots of laughs. There is some great character development and banter that was sorely missing from SR3. Though at times it feels the game/writers spent too much time watching cyberpunk and action movies from the 90s and early 2000s instead of creating something entirely new. It was great fun, and worth seeing all the parodies of other games and movies, but at times the parodies feel more like blatant rip-offs. There are optional side missions that are basically just activity completions and rewards. There are no activities left over after doing the character \"side quests\" so at that point the end game just becomes run around and collect random stuff/points you missed. You can replay activities for money or better medals. There is still no main mission or special character mission replay option... We had it in SR2 why can't it be in SR3.5?Player Customization: The level of visual player customization is the same as SR3 and nowhere near as amazing as the player character customization from SR2. Though carried over from SR3 is the player upgrades/leveling system.Vehicle Customization: The same as SR3 but with quite a few more parts and accessories for some vehicles, though you still cannot customize \"special\" vehicles, planes, helicopters, and VOTLs. Though for a game with cars and car customization it severely lacks in vehicle based missions compared to previous games as most of the time you are running, jumping, and fighting, instead of driving or riding shotgun like previous games.Weapon Customization: Weapons have non-visual upgrades now instead of the visual upgrades like from SR3 (when you upgrade a weapon, it does not change its base appearance with things likes scopes or suppressors and such that SR3 had). Though you can change the \"skin\" of the weapon to look like other types of weapons and most have 1-3 selectable paint jobs, but you cannot add or remove parts of a weapon.Other Customizations: Cribs/player bases are completely gone so absolutely none there. Gang customization is the same as SR3.Game World: Still in Steelport, or a simulation of so to speak, exact same map size and most every location remains the same as SR3 just add some cyber bits here and there. Also, during the game it is perpetually Night/dawn/dusk/dark and there is no day cycle until you completely beat the game. The city doesn't really feel as \"alive\" as SR2 did, but when you figure out the plot it makes a bit more sense to be that way.Super Powers: While they are fun, and have lots of upgrades, it ends up feeling too much like the game \"Prototype\" and not enough like Saints Row. Most of the game vehicles become pretty much pointless when you can leap, climb, fly, and run better than nearly any vehicle in the game rather early on.Controls: This is a console port and is horrible with Mouse and Keyboard, they are \"ok\" if you don't have a controller, but use a controller since that is what the game was made to work with. Though mouse and keyboard feel improved over SR3. It controls nicely and has the exact same layout as SR3, though with the super powers, some buttons now have secondary functions when you hold them or tap them.Game play: You will go everywhere from space, to text adventures, to 2D fighters, to top down pixel battles, to platforming, robot fights, and more. The variation keeps things interesting, at least on a first play through. There is even a massive list of cheat codes built into the game as well to make the game even more fun, crazy, hard, or easy. So it works if you are a casual gamer or one of the hardcore challenging types of players.Re-play Value: As with most the Saints Row games, it is pretty high in the re-play department. With the amount of character and vehicle customization, as well as upgrades, it is worth revisiting to see what can be changed or done differently on another play-through.Overall Opinion: This game is much more fun than SR3 was, but still not as much fun and time consuming as SR2 is for me. It has more polish than SR3 did, and I hope the future of Saints Row gets much bigger than Steelport or Stilwater combined as the map just feels small compared to many other games out there, especially when you have super powers. My biggest gripe is that it needs more side activities and player customization. In SR2 most side activities had 6-12 levels to them, whereas SR 3.5 has about 2-4 levels or so to each activity. They still have not added back in the service vehicle activities (taxi cab, tow truck, ambulance, fire truck, police car, police helicopter, and so on from SR2). Still no \"Fuzz\", \"Septic Avenger\", \"Demo Derby\" and so on. There is a distinct lack of vehicle races as well. If you are going to give us all these customizable vehicles; give us something to do with them.---------------------------------BOTTOM LINE:---------------------------------It is a stupidly fun game while it lasts, but many times felt too much like the game \"Prototype\" and not enough like Saints Row. The absurdity has been turned up to 11.5 and had the knob broken off, so don't buy this game thinking it will have an award winning plot or basis in reality in any way what-so-ever. (And that can be a good thing as games are meant to be fun to play. That is why they are called games and not movies.) The vehicles and player models seem much more polished over SR3 with the wonderful detail that was put into the first Saints Row game. The voice acting makes it worth replaying, as the different player character voices have different things to say throughout each play through.

There is just not much to do that's all that fun other than the missions which get repetitive and due to the horrible handling vehicles can be a tedious lesson in frustration. I can count at least a couple times I've tried all the missions available and found all of them this way, this one doesn't keep you playing like SA did. The motorcycles are almost un-ride-able and you are forced to use them in at least 5 missions.So handling sucks the fun out of it a lot. Also the character is so slow in almost everything he does, running,changing weapons, stealing cars, etc. The cell phone is more annoyance than anything, you are constantly inundated with calls for non-story things, if I wanted the Sims I'd play that! Ditto for Gran Turismo/Forza!This is like a product with a very sexy package only to be just a generic inside, not worth close to $65 this just turns me off of Rockstar in the future, it seems like no one remembered what made GTA so fun to begin with. After a few years of waiting it's a real let down, yes RockStar got it's $500M on this one from everyone, but the next one I'll pass on buying new.

Denick","summary":"I feel like I'm in the middle of a cartoon!","reviewText":"Whereas games from the \"Ratchet and Clank\" universe make me feel as though I'm in the middle of a Pixar movie, \"Thieves in Time\" achieves an equally impressive feat: It makes me feel like I'm taking part in one of the hand-drawn afternoon cartoons of the 80s and 90s (which I would regularly watch after school, while nibbling on snacks). I love everything about the presentation in this game: the characters are adorable, the story is hilarious and absurd, and the cel-shaded approach has never looked finer. The time traveling plot and assortment of anthropomorhpic animals takes me back to the days of shows like \"DuckTales\".There is, however, a complaint that I have with this game: I wish I had control of Sly Cooper for greater lengths of time (ALL the time would be even better). While Murray and Bentley are cool characters, and they make for an awesome family/team, I found that I began sighing every time one of their segments began loading. When Sly is in control, this platformer can attain a certain level of \"zen\" as you engage in your chains of stealthy feats- leap, perch, climb, balance, strike, repeat (and the controls are identical to the PS2 games, as far as I remember- they've aged wonderfully). However, when the other characters are in control, this becomes something of a clumsy, forced platformer that left me longing for Sly's stealthy, agile ways. That's just my humble opinion- others may enjoy the segments of Sly's friends and the attempts to instill gameplay diversity, but I was always anxious to return to the thieving raccoon. And in the defense of the developer, controlling Sly's friends has always been a part of the experience, even with the original \"Thievius Raccoonus\".The inclusion of Vita functionality (Cross Buy) with this title makes it pretty enticing for any Sony gamer (especially at $40). I'm a fan of the PS2 Sly Coopers (\"Thievius Racoonus\" still being my favorite), and I have not been disappointed with \"Thieves in Time\" (and there are still TONS of collectibles in these worlds calling out to me), so I can wholeheartedly recommend it to those who are in the same boat. I'm not sure how gamers who are new to the series will receive it, but I would definitely suggest considering it, particularly if you enjoy cartoons and non-violent games, or if you're looking for something suitable for younger gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"yup a 2, wow this is awful","reviewText":"Super Mario Sunshine is now considered the weak point of all the big name Mario titles, and for good reason- it's really lousy in several key areas.  Almost all of them in fact.  For those of you that grew up with the 2D Mario games, this game will feel lifeless and dramatically different in comparison.  For those of you who approached Mario with the Galaxy series... you'll have the same reaction.  The lowest point of the Mario series is Super Mario Sunshine, unquestionably.Let's name all the problems-The entire theme of the game, with the exception of a few platform-dominated missions underground along with a ghost house maze area, is based around the beach.  The ONE environment that feels totally out of place for a Mario game (the beach) and Nintendo actually thought it would be a good idea to roll with it.  REALLY disappointing.  I'm totally used to the Mushroom Kingdom by this point and expected as such.  I'm pretty sure most Mario fans feel the same way.  Incredibly disappointing that Nintendo abandoned the Mushroom Kingdom for something so generic.  Nintendo should have executed a beach theme only occasionally like how it's properly done in Yoshi's Island and Super Mario Galaxy, and then added more diverse locations for the other 90% of the game because the way it stands now, the beach is seriously overkill.  Not to mention all the yucky beach music that makes me sick after a while.  Variety is a key component of the Mario series.It's pretty sad that the underground platform jumping missions are the high point of the game because jumping on platforms is normally a chore in 3D Mario, having to line up and carefully execute well-timed jumps.  It's awful.  Platform jumping was awful in Super Mario 64 but at least the environments in that game are a tad nicer/more diverse than the overdone beach theme here.  Eventually you arrive to platforms that either disappear or square shaped cube-like rotating platforms that are unique the first time you deal with these, but ultimately adds more to the frustration factor instead of actually being fun or adding anything to the replayability.  The only time these platform missions become somewhat entertaining is when you have to collect 8 red coins with a timer requiring the player to move swiftly.  These are challenging and fun.Mario has a spray nozzle and a rocket nozzle.  The spray nozzle is a horrible idea because the object is to fill up with water at every available opportunity and spray most of the bosses until they die, which is clearly NOT what makes many of the other games in the Mario series so incredibly fun to play.  Absolutely no way.  Basically you spray bosses until they die while dodging attacks.  Sometimes this is hard when the surrounding danger gets intense, but most of the time it's painfully easy.  The rocket nozzle is slightly improved however, because this allows you to launch into the sky really high and reach the platforms that would otherwise be impossible to reach.My least favorite part of the game is a 5-way tie.1- the lifeless, empty and boring levels with hardly any enemies or exciting powerups anywhere.  Trees, beaches, water, tightropes, platforms, rinse and repeat.  For 10-20 hours.  God...2- the \"collect 100 coins to get a shine\" missions (the shines are the same thing as the stars found in SM64 and the Galaxy series by the way).  Several of these missions, namely that one God awful watermelon-pushing stage, takes FOREVER to obtain 100 stars.  If thoroughly exploring lifeless environments is supposed to qualify as fun and the reason many Mario fans make such a big deal about open world exploration, count me out.  Collecting these stars means Nintendo is FORCING me to explore these generic and boring environments.  Nooo way.3- having to go back to the *same exact stages over and over again* to search for/obtain MORE shines.  Where's the darn level variety?!?!?  Maintaining a beach theme is bad enough, but at least make each stage *different* for crying out loud.  Come on Nintendo, Super Mario Sunshine isn't progress- it's a kick in the rear-end.4- collecting over 200 boring blue coins, many of which can be found by spraying water on these X's located on walls that you will often stumble upon.  The reward for collecting so many of these bland blue coins isn't exciting for the player in the end so expect the highest level of disappointment imaginable.  Collecting blue coins ends up being a needless chore not only because the reward is underwhelming, but because the concept itself is unexceptional.  No real desire or motivation to obtain them.5- the overworld I guess you can say, where you spend a good chunk of your time throughout the \"adventure\", is nothing but generic buildings disguised as MORE generic platform jumping with ugly characters everywhere.  How horrendous.Oh and the storyline?  Mario goes to jail?  Give me a break.  Never *ever* attempt to implement storyline bits in a Mario platformer.  The \"princess is kidnapped/kill Bowser\" storyline is pretty weak admittedly, but honestly that's *all* we need.  Don't even think about making a story anymore elaborate than that or it will fail, which is why Super Mario Sunshine's story fails so miserably.I highly recommend skipping this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

Once you survive past those inexplicably long &quot;cinematics&quot;, you're up for a side-scrolling shooter that puts its focus on the more important things.  The graphics are nothing to write home about, but the mechanics are extremely responsive, the controls intuitive, and the gameplay engaging.  I was surprised at the number of different moves, manoeuvres and weapons they were able to cram into this game, and it quickly draws you in.There is also a &quot;puzzle&quot; element to this game as you navigate through a grid-based system of rooms looking for a way to get across.  Some of these are a little obscure for my taste -- I prefer nonstop action when playing a side-scroller -- but it doesn't overuse the frustration factor.The one major complaint I have is that this game is a long linear storyline with absolutely no alternate ways of playing.  This also means if you get stuck, that's it -- no more game left to play.  It would be so much better to be able to choose to replay levels you've already passed after you've completed them, to boost the replayability factor.  And the very long opening sequence can't be skipped, so I'm also discouraged from future replays.  Why this colossal blunder in a very simple part of games nearly impossible to get wrong?Metroid Fusion is a very good game that charms by virtue of its old-fashioned side-scrolling simplicity.

This game defies almost every attempt to shoehorn it neatly into any one genre. The gameplay is unlike anything I've ever seen in a game before, as is its art design, storytelling, and overall approach to using the Wii-U's features well as an exclusive, and it's all fantastic too. Hideki Kamiya made this game. I love Kamiya-san. He has made some of my all-time favorite video games over the years, from the aforementionedViewtiful Joeto one of the most brilliant gaming masterpieces ever made,kami, the guy makes nothing but unique, exhilarating video game gold, and now you can add The Wonderful 101 to that list. Seeing as how this is such a densely designed, wholly unique game, this may end up being a long review, I warn you right now. If you don't like long, detailed reviews, give this one a pass.The story behind The Wonderful 101 is as crazy and hectic as its gameplay. Basically, you play as, not one protagonist, but many simultaneously, as a worldwide superhero initiative entitled The Wonderful One-Double-Oh. Wonder-Red, the blond masked hero that looks eerily similar to Viewtiful Joe, acts as their stalwart leader, but there are many Wonderful-Ones that get the spotlight in this game, such as Wonder-Blue, a talented LA detective who is a headstrong, brash rebel with an impulsive need to always look cool, Wonder-Green, a very chubby Frenchman with a love of all things culinary, or my personal favorite, Wonder-Yellow, an incredibly tough-yet-timid Russian strongman. These heroes find themselves combating an invasion from the evil alien GEATHJERK menace that threatens the peace of the world, and that's as far as I'll go in describing the plot. Suffice it to say, the story's premise is clearly based on classic Japanese shows such as Power Rangers and other anime of yore, and I absolutely adore it. It's quirky, no doubt about it, but the writing is stellar and the voice acting is suitably overly dramatic and downright charming. I love the story and the way its told in this game. It reminds me of my childhood.The art and sound design in this game really works well with the whole Japanese Superhero themes. All graphics have a distinct Viewtiful Joe quality to them for sure, but they were also designed to looks somewhat like children's toys come to life, and it looks awesome. Characters and scenery all have a plastic-like sheen to them that looks gorgeous and unique. This game is incredibly imaginative, full of vibrant colors and impressive effects that are a joy to take in. The special attack animations and models are particularly impressive. I love everything about the visuals in this game. The sound and music design also delivers well on the Saturday morning cartoon theme. Music is full of bravado and heroism, and the sound effects sound ripped from classic cartoons. It's all very cool. This game is full of sensory overload, in a good way, and that is really complemented by the visual and audio design. Great job here.Really, it's the gameplay that sets W101 apart from any other game I've played. While \"Viewtiful Pikmin\" may sound like a nice little label when you first see the game, it's inaccurate. This is not a strategy game with a Viewtiful makeover. This is an action game through and through, much in the same vein of Kamiya's past works, withDevil May CryorBayonettabeing the most obvious comparisons, with tons of challenge and elements of strategy thrown in. Don't think this is just a Bayonetta clone with a Power Rangers makeover however. The real twist in the game is the fact that you control many heroes simultaneously, as one huddled mass, all working together as an almost amoebae-like clump to fight the baddies. Using the gamepad's touchscreen (or the right analog stick), you can form \"Unite Morphs\" to create massive weapons to use in combat. Draw a line, and Wonder-Blue will hold onto a massive sword filled with the other characters in your group. The longer you draw the line, the more Wonder-Heroes will fill the sword and the bigger it will become. Draw an L-shape like, and now your weapon is Wonder-Green's pistol (or a freaking bazooka if you draw the shape big enough!), shooting other heroes in your group as bullets! If that sounds weird, it is, trust me, but it is an awesome combat system I have never seen or even hinted at in any other game. It's fantastically unique, and because this is a Kamiya game, there's an arcade scoring and ranking system that adds even more addictive qualities to the experience. The core of this game is all about utilizing your wits and reflexes in battle using these mechanics and while it may be tough, it is really worth getting the hang of.I also must give the Boss Fights special attention. They're absolutely insane, and practically levels unto themselves. Some last up to twenty minutes, and I'm not talking twenty-minutes of just slogging through it in hideously boring fashion. No, I'm talking full-on twenty minutes of exciting, new, always changing elements and visual spectacle to boot. Awesome. I love old-school boss fights in video games, and W101 definitely delivers that.The game utilizes the gamepad in incredibly unique and exciting ways too. At some points, you may find yourself going into buildings, where you can't see your characters on the TV. The view of them will now be on the gamepad, and puzzles utilizing this function are really clever and well-thought out. My only complaint about them is that its harder to see everything on the gamepad screen. Some complain about how hard it is to draw particular shapes on the gamepad to get the Unite Morph you want, but for me, it has worked stupendously so far. This game, along withPikmin 3andRayman Legends, really shows the awesome potential of the Wii-U and its special controller. I hope other developers start realizing its potential too.The game has an incredible density of content too. Well-hidden secrets and collectibles keep things interesting. While the core cast of color-themed heroes rounds out to about a half a dozen, there are roughly 100 (duh) heroes to find in the game that will become a permanent part of your Wonderful army. These guys are hilarious, such as Wonder-Beer, a fat german man with a costume that looks like an oversized beer mug, Wonder-Toilet, who has a toilet for a helmet (lol!), or Wonder-KungFu, an elderly, dumpy looking janitor who is a master of Druken Kung Fu (very stereotypical of Japanese anime, lol). Each one has his/her own profile with background info that is sure to make you giggle. The game also features a very deep upgrade system that allows for purchasing new moves as well as improving old ones, not to mention a cooking section in which you can create one-use healing and offensive/defensive items utilizing all the space themed food items you collect in the game. When you add everything together, you've got a super unique action game with tons of replayabiity and layered depth to discover. Did I mention this game has an insane density of content? Does that sound like a good value to you? It should. :DOne last thing, this game is HARD! The first thing you'll notice when starting up the Wonderful 101 is that your brain will almost fry from sensory overload. Keeping track of the myriad of things happening on screen while trying to concentrate on the immediate gameplay at hand is difficult at first. Explosions litter the scene, droves of enemies attack you all at once, collectibles rain down, and you have so many heroes to keep track of, it can be overwhelming. I'll tell you right now, this game is super challenging, nuanced, and the fighting system is incredibly deep. The mechanic of drawing shapes quickly on the gamepad in an action game is new, and it'll take a little time to get used to it. If you find yourself frustrated early on, don't give up on this game. Pause the screen and learn the game's mechanics from the in-game encyclopedia, watch some videos of good players on the internet to get an idea of how to play, and press on. Once you get over the game's initial system shock and its difficult learning curve, you will love this game. I highly recommend learning to use the Wonder-Pudding (shield) and Wonder-Slinky (dodge) moves well. You'll need them in this game. We live in an age where games coddle gamers and inundate them with constant eye-rollingly obvious tutorials. W101 doesn't do this, at all. Some may complain, but I think it's awesome to play a game with classic sensibilities this way. So don't give up, you'll be glad you stuck with it. I'm an experienced gamer, and I found \"easy\" to be the perfect setting for me for my first playthrough.I know this review is long, but seriously guys, I've barely scratched the surface of this game. Kamiya really jam packed it with content plus the kitchen sink. Its initial difficulty and absolute refusal to coddle gamers the way many games do these days may be an unpleasant shock to some peoples' systems, but trust me, once you can the hang of this game, it will deliver thrills and spectacle by the shovelful. I've been playing video games for twenty-years, and I have never played a game quite like The Wonderful 101, and I guarantee you haven't either. So give it a chance, and enjoy what it has to offer. It's even more special because its a Wii-U exclusive that takes full advantage of the hardware, and we all know that is all-too-rare these days (although that's about to change). So buy this game, persevere through its challenging learning curve, and be treated to a wholly unique video game you are sure not to forget.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}

That's the word that keeps coming to mind as I've been playing this latest installment in the beloved Rayman series.Not to mention captivating, delightful, imaginative, inventive, funny -- and just plain fun.Long before Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Daxter or Sly Cooper there was Rayman.  A dear little guy with floating hands and feet who walked, ran, jumped and hovered sideways through a side-scrolling platform adventure collecting widgets, freeing captive friends, and bopping bad guys.Fans of the series will be pleased to hear that this new collection is probably the best Rayman ever. Everything you liked about the previous games is back, and Rayman has some new moves, plus a little friend who assists him in clever ways at the press of the circle button.The game also features a local co-op mode, which I haven't tried, in which you can enlist your friends to help Rayman on his way.  You can also play as other characters besides Rayman.The controls are spot-on, and the checkpoints are well set so when you fail (and you will fail!), you won't have to go back too far or restart a level to make further progress.Did I mention that this is a perfect game for kids?  There's no violence or profanity, and even the bad guys are engaging and funny.  But does that mean adults won't love this game as well?  To the contrary, there's more than enough challenge here for gamers of all ages -- and your kids will probably have the speed and dexterity to put us oldsters to shame!It doesn't hurt either that Rayman's adventures have the most lovely orchestral musical accompaniment -- one reviewer compared it to the Looney Tunes scores, and that's probably not far from the mark.So if you'd like to introduce your kids to some old-school gaming of the highest order -- or you want to indulge yourself -- welcome back Rayman.

This is an immersive, action-packed world of dark hallways and darker intentions.","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"A Blast, If Not Original","reviewText":"Leave it to November to bring about the mainstay of the years hottest titles, and this November is no different, with hot titles like Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth, Splinter Cell, and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City making their way onto the shelves just in time for the holiday shopping mayhem. Now, finally, after nearly six months of waiting, my most eagerly anticipated title has finally arrived, Digital Extreme's Unreal Championship. After crooning over it for so long, does it live up to the hype, did it blow me away like I knew it would? No, it didn't. As much as I hate to say it, Unreal Championship was disappointing.The games developers had been advertising it for so long saying its being built ground-up for the Xbox, and even though the vehicles had been stashed a few months before its release, it still looked to surpass the PC's Unreal Tournament 2003, for it was something different, unfortunately Unreal Championship IS Unreal Tournament 2003, in fact asides from one new mode, there's really nothing different between the versions, and that's where my disappointment lies. However, that's not to say Unreal Championship isn't a good game because it is, and it's not just good too, it's a great game. The applause of this goes to an already excellent designed system for the PC version which carries over flawlessly onto the Xbox.For console gamers who loved Unreal Tournament for the Dreamcast and Playstation 2, there's a lot to like with the latest installment of Unreal. It embodies everything you want in a sequel, its bigger, badder and better, period. Returning modes are the typical deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, and domination. Domination has been altered from the original Unreal in where teams fight constantly over controlling three Control Points scattered throughout levels. Domination 2.0 is now trying to control two points simultaneously for 10 seconds without interruption in which your team then scores a point. It's nothing incredibly different, but does make the gameplay much more frantic and fast paced as you end up [speeding]all over the map to stop an enemy who is just seconds away from scoring a point.New to the series is Bombing Run, which plays like a distorted capture the flag you'd find in the old days of P.E. back in junior high school. Teams fight over a ball that lies in the middle of both teams' bases, one you have possession of the ball you lose your weapons but holding the ball slowly restores your health for as long as you hold it. While holding it you can pass the ball to other teammates by shooting it towards them if you're being overrun by foes. To score player must bring the ball to the enemy's goal, running through the goal scores seven points, where as shooting the ball into the goal scores three.Asides from the new game modes, Championship is now played entirely on teams. Starting a tournament you will be required to select a team from a large roster, there are classes of gladiators available now with each race having their own advantages and disadvantages. The alien race has increased speed but has a lower maximum health, the freak-show group is relatively weak but every time they are killed they grow stronger and stronger with each death. Once your team has been selected you will have to fight your way through the ladders and onto the final battle, where you will payback your teammates efforts by eliminating them yourself until you are the champion of the Unreal Tournament. This final match is the only Championship, exclusive that basically operates the same way a survival match would in fighting games.In all, even with my disappointments, Unreal Championship is easily the best first person shooter I have played this year. After playing the original Unreal Tournament for the consoles, you couldn't help but be disappointed in their overall lack of multiplayer options and huge drop in frame-rate for split-screen play. Unreal Championship fixes all the gripes I had from the first and it stands now as the quintessential deathmatch game for console owners and is a must-have for Xbox owners, if you haven't played Unreal Tournament 2003 or don't have a powerful enough computer for it, Championship is your ticket.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2003"}

The new controller is the best thing since the Wiimote and we FINALLY have HD! Metroid Blast is wonderful, but it's still way too bad that we won't ever see a real Metroid game for the Wii U. One of my few complaints is that the Wii emulator is kinda lame. It doesn't even have the photo channel! The Youtube app is great. (Would that they would make it for the 3DS too!) Watching Into the Green World on it with my HDTV is a real hoot. The Mii Maker is very good. The ability to use the gamepad as a TV remote is WICKED. Another complaint is that we have to wait forever for SSB and Mario Kart 8 to come out. Also, they probably won't have any great games on the VC like Zero Mission or anything. It may eventually have GCN games, but probably not Prime 1. If they ever did it had better be the original NTSC GCN version, without the Rape of the Chozo Lore in the Wii version, plus 480p Progressive Scan mode otherwise it won't be worth getting.

And it's also one of the most boring.Everything that can be said about it has already been said by hundreds of reviewers, and spectacularly by that guy I keep mentioning in my reviews, Yahtzee, of The Escapist magazine.On the good side, the game indeed LOOKS very real, and has some amazing rag-doll physics and the like.The bad side is extreme in comparison.  Your character is a generic Eastern European refugee whose life consists of being an unemployed bum who goes about carrying out illegal jobs in a lackadaisical \"oh vell I guess eet eez time to keel sambaddy\" demeanor, while he and his cousin get exploited and ripped off by everyone, and his cousin calls him all the damn time to go out on dates bowling or drinking or whatever.The controls are odd and the city's colors are all manner of shades of gray, brown, and graybrown.  It is so dismally bleak and gritty that not even a real life New York City would resemble this sort of city every day of the year.  Everything is in such bleak colors bordering on monochrome that it makes it a bore to look at despite the fantastic graphics.The driving takes the cake (Chocolate.  With lemon filling.  And vanilla/caramel frosting) as being the absolute biggest and worst fault in this game.  Having driven cars in GTA3-GTA San Andreas, as well as in other games involving driving, and Saints Row 2, as well as even driving in real life, it is safe and believable for me to say:THE DRIVING IN GTAIV DOES NOT COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO REALITY.  IT IS A GIGANTIC CASATROF*** MESS.  IT IS DOODOO.The driving system in this game seems to be that every car you get into immediately has buttery tires and gains a thousand pounds, as just going 10-20 miles an hour makes clean, tight turns a physical impossibility.  Unless you come to a complete stop and slowly edge your way into a sharp or not-so-sharp turn, you'll end up either going far too wide out of your lane, or completely losing control and spinning or swerving or crashing.Nothing in real life can possibly mirror the driving in this game save for perhaps driving piss-drunk wasted with two or three flat tires and several heavy objects weighing down the trunk.Multiplayer is a great new addition, as it lets you create your own character (although with a limited number of choices) so I got to create my own fantasy creation complete with long red hair, a beret, glasses, and a rainbow-colored jacket.  By the way, if anyone knows of any rainbow-colored jackets in real life, let me know so I may buy one.Despite the fun of multiplayer, or rather BECAUSE of it, it distracts heavily from the main campaign.  The main storyline is so utterly boring and pathetic, and Niko Bellic is such a drag to play as, I haven't managed to get more than three or four missions into the story before giving up entirely and playing multiplayer, where I've had my most memorable experiences with the game.However, despite all the work gone into crafting this, it fails out in comparison to its predecessor, because it fails to balance gritty realism with escapist cartoonish-ness, simultaneously encouraging and punishing us for going all-out sandbox murder and mayhemming, while also giving us in-game TV to watch, as if to mock us for our pathetic lives that we buy a video game about murder and mayhem and spend the first moments of the game buying news clothes, going out on a date, and watching TV ALL WHILE IN GAME.I said it in my review for Saints Row 2, but I'll say here that Saints Row 2, by a different company, and a complete and utter GTA clone, is in fact far superior to GTAIV.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

The same pertains to Jak and Daxter, as a simple story drives this game along. The main plot of the game rests on Daxter, Jak's brother, who was transformed into a small, orange muskrat by a substance called \"dark eco.\" Feeling very guilty over Daxter's transformation, he puts him on his shoulder and goes out into the world to find a cure. I must commend Naughty Dog for character choice though. How often do you get to control a spiky-haired elf and a small, orange rodent. Though there are very few twists and major plot turns in the game, Jak and Daxter continues the primary focus that platformers are shallow story games. Just like the Mario games, everyone knows that a platform game's strongest category is gameplay.The main style of gameplay in this game revolves around collecting items, and a % completed meter will remain in check as you collect these items. Just like Super Mario 64's Stars and Banjo-Kazooie's Jiggies, Jak and Daxter must collect power cells. Power cells will be awarded by completing certain tasks in the game, or finding them in hidden locations. Another very collected item in the game is the Precursor Orb. These orbs are all over the place in each level and serve as the money oriented object in this game. Collecting enough of them will allow you to trade them in to other characters for Power Cells. Power Cells and Precursor Orbs are just a few of the items you will need to collect in order to raise your % completed percentage.While the game does have its entertaining gameplay moments, there are some that are rather boring. Most of the time you will be running around scrounging for Orbs to turn in for Power cells. Sometimes on more interesting parts, you will be asked by other characters to do errands for them, and will reward you on your outcome. Other events include collecting a certain number of scout flies, climbing tall structures, shooting a certain number of foes with fire balls, and oddly catching a fixed amount of fish in a short time. Levels are very large and creatively designed. Usually when getting on a large perch you can even see other levels in the distance. Also, what makes the game even more inviting is that there are no major load times, whatsoever.I felt that the graphical nature of the game shined very brightly. Naughty Dog has really taken advantage of the Playstation 2's graphical processing, and it really shows throughout the game. As noted before, the horizon stretches out seemingly forever and there are no annoying pop-ups. The frame rate is a bit wild at time in certain areas, but it is nothing that really takes away from the gameplay. From the lava filled volcano, to the blizzard covered mountains, to just the average jungle town, every aspect of the game is colorful and true to the platform style gameplay. Character designs won't disappoint either. The fluent movements of Jak and Daxter are all portrayed excellently despite their few moves. The enemies look fine as well, and play their role in different levels throughout the game. Now while the Playstation 2 is usually criticized for its lack of texture processing, this game really proves them wrong. The high resolution presents colors and obstacles with practically no pixelation whatsoever. The cinema scenes correlate with the moving story of the game, and the facial animations go well with the comic oriented dialog. I believe that this game will set the primary standard for future PS2 platforms.The sound/musical aspect of the game is one of the more disappointing features of the game. The character acting basically revolves around the comic relief of Daxter. While at times he is funny, most of his jokes are pretty lame. They are still light hearted though and make him an enjoyable aspect to the game. Jak the hero is mute throughout the whole game, and most of the other characters rarely have anything interesting to say. The music of the game isn't anything special either. Most of the time you will generally not even notice it. All in all, though while it isn't anything unique, most of the tunes go well with the atmosphere.All in all, Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is definitely the best platform game on the PS2 right now, next to Jak II ,the sequel. This game, while not very original, brings a unique and interesting platform experience. It is a shame that the replay value of the game has nothing to offer once you complete it. However, the single player experience is the reason that you even play platform games, and while the game isn't incredibly challenging, it does have its moments. If you want to know what happened before Jak II, or enjoy platforms in general, then look no further.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2003"}

This is absolutely infuriating for the first few hours of play.But eventually you get used to is and learn to watch even closer to what is going in in BOTH screens.I have only played the 1 player campaign, but I am at the last boss on medium difficulty so I feel like im qualified for a review.The Good:-As tough as you want it to be! 3 difficulties levels where the actual speed of the enemy bullets and run speed changes...along with having less lives. Hard mode is VERY hard and reminds me of good times on the old NES.-Great control. Contra wrote the book on how to make a game where you battle the level/enemies not the controller.-Weapons!

If you are in the same boat that I was, you own a 360, it broke, and you are considering switching to the PS3 (especially with the price drop), this review is for you.Side by side, the PS3 and the 360 have many similarities.  Graphically, they are close, although I think that the Sony edges out the 360 by a little.  Clarity and rendering seems smoother and more flawless.  Sound is improved, but the truth is, my 360 only had component outputs (no HDMI) and the PS3 is running straight HDMI signal.  So, perhaps its unfair, but I didnt have the choice with the Xbox (it was a first gen 360, I realize its an option now).Game catalogs both have their high points.  No one can deny Gears of War, but I am seeing a trend that the really good games are almost always multiplatform now, and the Sony has some that I can't deny are some of the best I've seen.  Upcoming PS3-only games like Uncharted 2 and God of War 3 I feel will seal the deal for me.  All my other favorites are available on both systems (GTA, Saints Row 2, Mercs 2, Assassins Creed, Bioshock), so there's really no loser there.Hardware-wise, the PS3 is the strong, silent type.  I mean, its like a Lexus to a Fast-and-Furious exhaust modified Civic as far as noise.  My 360 was unbelievably loud, and frankly distracted gameplay because of it.  Subtle, ambient surround-sound noises are heard easily with the Sony.  Also, it puts off little to no heat.  I'm not kidding in any way, my 360 used to raise the temp of my \"game room\" about 5 degrees or more, it was crazy.I wont get into longevity and long-term failure rates on both systems.  The data is out there, and the PS3 has a much higher success rate in this category.  Money doesnt grow on trees, and I really feel that I should only have to buy one console per generation of a system.  If I could do it all over again, I would've gone with the PS3 from the start.Now, I dont online-game, so if thats your thing, then you may take my advice with a grain of salt.  If you are like me and pretty much solo or co-op play on-site, then you won't miss \"Live\".I'm loving the specs, I'm loving the quietness, and I'm loving the Blu-ray player.

They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"M.

Roman","summary":"A review from a non-GoW fanboy.","reviewText":"This review's coming from someone who doesn't flip out over everything God of War-related, or says that you should get something just because it has to do with God of War. Face it- for the price this 'ultimate' edition's going for, you probably want to be getting your money's worth, right? I hadn't played God of War 3 until I got this set just last week, and I didn't spend more than retail for it, but even then, I can't see how this is an 'ultimate' edition of God of War 3.First up, the main selling point of this edition- Pandora's Box. It's a cheaply made plastic box that looks just like the one in the game. The plastic they used to make this is very soft, and you can probably snap the horns off of the sides with even a tiny bit of effort. There isn't a lot of fine detail on this, and it looks a lot like some kind of Halloween decoration you'd find at a party store in October. The bottom of the box has no detail at all either. This could make a decent box to hold candy in style, but given how it looks in-person, there's not a lot of style to it.When you open Pandora's Box, the art book is waiting for you. This is probably the best thing about this set, aside from the game, and it's a lot better than the one that got released in the UK, which was rushed and had the same quality as your typical instruction manual. The US art book is a hardcover book, about 100 pages, and features tons of great art. Enemies, scenery, sketches, there's a lot of impressive work and if you're one of those fans that wants a GoW tattoo, this would be a good book to scout. The book isn't that big since it had to fit in Pandora's Box, but I don't have any complaints about it because you can see everything clearly.Under the book, you'll see a black ribbon on the side of the 'bottom' of the box. Pull it up and it turns out that it was guarding a secret compartment (well, I use that term loosely) where the game is. Nope, there are no cds for the soundtracks that the box advertises, but instead, they're included as DLC, along with the Dominus skin, Exile Arena and documentary. There's a code for each bonus inside of the game case. The game features the same art as the retail version, and is identical except it doesn't have a bar code, and just says 'not for resale' in its place.When it comes down to it, this sucker going for over a Benjamin is a rip-off. The game alone is worth around half of that, the DLC is cheap on its own (hint hint), the art book is nice but you can always find the same images online, and Pandora's Box is a joke. I know you can't expect much of a replica for the price, but they sure as heck coulda tried harder. Maybe if they included the God of War Collection like the UK version did, I'd be more forgiving since it'd be more for your buck. And if this is supposed to be the be-all edition of God of War 3, why include just one of the many skins available? Why not include all of them? But as it is, you're better off just getting the game on its own, and then getting the DLC separately.I think Kratos would've went off about REVENGE(!) and tracked down those responsible for making it if he had seen this set.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2010"}

However, if you just like playing the games, I honestly must say for you to pass this up.  For reasons that are pretty obvious.For one, everything GOOD about the Gameboy Micro, can easily be seen in the GBA SP.  This screen is backlit and easily fits in your pocket, and plays GBA games.  Alright, that's fair enough.  But come on?  The GBA SP was just like that.  With the GBA SP there was a backlight with a rechargable battery, and if you folded it down then it went into your pocket with no problems at all.  I do like all the different custom face plates though.  They're easy to use and don't leave any of that sticky residue.The GBA Micro is, of course, for those who do not already have a GBA of any kind.  If you don't have a GBA, go with the SP.  And let me explain why:1. You cannot protect the screen of your GBA micro: If you stick it in your pocket, you'll pull it out only to see several scratches on the screen.  Needless to say this is a big problem.  With the SP's fold down LCD Screen, you could easily protect it.2. The Screen is Actually Smaller: This is true too.  The screen is smaller and the games are not properly brought down to scale.  It's very annoying!3. You can't play older Gameboy games and Gameboy color games: The same thing plagued the DS, but the DS I could live with.  This I cannot.  Part of the reason I still have my GBA SP is so I can play older Gameboy games.  You can't do that with the Micro.4. The list price is too high: I don't know about you, but I certainly don't want to spend one hundred bucks on this when the SP has more to offer in terms of quality.  The SP is cheaper and easier to work with.  With the hand-held console war advanced off to the PSP and DS, paying one-hundred dollars for this is almost shady.Overall: If you are someone looking for a decent Gameboy system, get the SP.  You get all the qualities of the Micro and more.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2005"}

I know some people like to micromanage a squad/team/group: their armor, weapons, special abilities, etc etc. That's not really my cup of tea. One thing I can get behind, regardless of game type, is story. Mass Effect is easily the most engrossing story I've ever played in a game. I've played through this title three times now.To get the most out of this game, you really have to play the first Mass Effect - which was almost as good. The gameplay is more refined in ME2 - playing a little more like a third-person shooter, and a little less like a roll-the-dice game (e.g. Fallout).  But the choices you make in the first game effect the story in the second title as well. If you just start a game on ME2, there's no way to \"choose\" the events that happened in ME1 - you're stuck with the default story line from the first game, (although there's still lots of choices to make in ME2 and real gameplay/story consequences to those choices).I also have to highly recommend the shadow broker downloadable content. I'm usually opposed to buying additional content after buying the game; but I'll make an exception in this case because it's a decent amount of extra gameplay AND story for a reasonable price (especially now that ME2 is $20!).If you haven't played this game yet, you owe it to yourself to buy this game (and the first if you haven't already) and block off a weekend for some of the most engaging and engrossing video games you've ever played!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2011"}

However, the story is really lacking and they watered down a lot of the rpg elements.First, the story just isn't as good as the first one.  Both in micro and macro terms.  There's not even a real bad guy that you can have a battle with at the end.  It's just a headless group.  You learn a lot about cerberus this time, but nothing new about the Reapers.All the equipment was downgraded.  You don't find individual pieces of armor and weapons like in the first one.  Instead you kind of \"unlock\" a new weapon for anybody to use.  Also, the skills are downgraded.  You used to have at least 8 upgradable skills per character, now you only have 4.  Each skill had 10 or 12 levels to put points into, now there's only 4.It feels like you have less customization options in exchange for fast gameplay.  They probably did this to make the game appealing to a broader audience, which is a shame.  Also, the story is extremely well executed and acted out, but there's not as much substance as the first.  I feel like if they're going to wrap up the series in part 3, there's going to be way too much stuff that has to happen in one game.  They should have accomplished more story-wise in this edition.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

This game is aimed at a much much much younger audience(Ages 4-10 at the least). Not saying that Mario is an adult game, it has always been a children game, but its difficulty level made it a challenge for everyone. Super Mario Galaxy holds your hand to the very end of the game. The game almost feels like no challenge at all. There is no striving to get that 1up, that special star, or anything really. It's all almost given to you. When I saw I was running around with 9 lives + I knew something was wrong. If you ahve 9 lives+ in a Super Mario game your either the game master or a true gaming beast! In this I was absolutely neither...matter of fact I barely did anything to get there. This game was hardly a challenge at all. Most Mario Games are known for their level of difficulty as Super Mario has never been a breeze to walk through(unless you spent 100hours on it like the Mario pro's). I was dissapointed to see that Nintendo had eased up on the game for the WII release. Of the later Mario games I would say Super Mario 64 was probably the best. It was difficult, challenging, and you had to really play it to beat it. Super Mario Galaxy is a great childrens game for young children, but this by all means is not the Mario that a Nintendo gamer is looking for.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"M.

But this time around it doesn't live up to the hype.  The graphics are not what you would expect for a next generation game, no where near COD4.  Also, any game that doesn't offer a full Co-op story mode gets a negative notch from me.

It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Billy's Revenge","reviewText":"Ever since I sawJurassic Park, I had a newfound respect for Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Forget dragons: a T-Rex is a terrifying killing machine, and Jurassic Park made it clear that you didn't just see one of these monsters coming, you actually felt its presence.  Of course, my love for dinosaurs started well before that, back when I was in elementary school.  What's sad is that I wanted dinosaur curtains, dinosaur bedspreads, dinosaur anything -- and back then there WERE no dinosaur-themed stuff for kids.  Now my one-year-old wears a new dinosaur-themed outfit practically every day.It's probably no surprise that I'm fond ofJurassic Fight Club, which matches two (or more) dinosaurs in tail-to-head combat.  The speculation and history lessons are fun, but the actual computer graphic battles in all their bloody glory left me itching for something more.  And that more is Turok.Turok is a first-person shooter, but the thrill is in the use of the bow and the knife to silently take out your enemies.  Dinosaur combat is less about shooting them and more about pressing the right combination of buttons to fend it off; the combination changes with each dinosaur attack, which keeps Turok fresh with sudden mini-games that are thrust suddenly upon you.The other neat element is that dinosaurs are animals at heart. They run from explosions, sniff out prey, and can be lured into traps. My personal favorite: shooting a flare over a grenade, a dinosaur wanders over to sniff it and...BOOM! Instant meat shower! The dinosaurs are more forces of nature than enemies; there are plenty of opportunities to have shoot-outs with better-armed and armored opponents.This is the first game to really do the T-Rex justice.  Showdowns with this monster (which, I'm pleased to report, happen frequently) always end in horrible carnage.  The great voice acting and slick script only add to the paranoid atmosphere. There's even a shout-out to Aliens, complete with flamethrowers and giant bugs.Remember that scene inPredator, where the Native American, Billy, stays behind to take on the alien with jut a knife?  His off-screen death was really lame. Turok's much better answer: Hell yeah, an Indian can take on a dinosaur...give him a knife, and he can stab a T-Rex to death with it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"Ninja Gaiden drops on by the DS and livens up the party","reviewText":"I've held off from buying the Nintendo DS for a couple years now. I used the excuse that there really wasn't any games for it that appealed to me. While the DS line-up of games have gone beyond the Nintendogs, Brain Age and Pokemon lines it was still limited in heavy action-oriented games. It took the announcement and subsequent release of Team Ninja's latest title in their great Ninja Gaiden series to finally make me pick up a Nintendo DS. I am more than happy and glad I broke my embargo of Nintendo's newest handheld. Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword was all I had hoped it would be and actually made the DS fun to play with.Anyone who games a lot knows that Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden series for the Xbox (soon for the 360 as well) was seen as a game for the hardcore of the hardcore group of gamers. This series was unforgiving in its difficulty and didn't baby the players. While such a thing may alienate the more casual player it does pose as a great challenge for gamers who have seen and played all types of games and where a challenge to their gaming skill comes only rarely. I was concerned that transferring that difficulty level from the console to the handheld would prove to be a problem, but Team Ninja seem to have found a balance in Dragon Sword's overall execution. While Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is not sadistically difficult it's also not a pushover. There's enough of a challenge in the gameplay that it shows the spirit of what the Ninja Gaiden series has always been: a challenging and fun action series.Dragon Sword also made great use of the DS touch screen and stylus system by pretty much using it as the end-all and be-all of moving and fighting throughout the game. The rest of the buttons, shoulder bumpers and D-pad have been relegated to act as a way to block incoming attacks. This makes the game quite intuitive as making slashing motions over an enemy on the touch screen would cause Ryu Hayabusa to lock on that opponent and make his attacks. Combo attacks and chains could be achieved by making the correct patterns with the stylus over an opponent. For hack and slash players the combat system will be easy to use even fancy attacks are not made, but for those willing to learn the special techniques the stylus-touchscreen mechanic could be quite rewarding.The graphics on this game is some of the best I've seen on an DS game released so far. While not on the same level as the Xbox's Ninja Gaiden Black or the upcoming 360-exclusive Ninja Gaiden 2 this DS title pushes the limits of what the handheld's innerworkings can accomplish. Dragon Sword using 3D animation for the player and the enemies on the screen while using pre-rendered 2D animation for the background. Similar to past Resident Evil titles this marriage of 3D characters with 2D environments makes for quite a beautiful looking game. The comic book style animation for the cutscenes also makes the game play out like a manga. This illusion is further enhanced by the fact that the game is played with the DS opened like a book.Overall, Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword was quite the successful foray for the traditionally hardcore Ninja Gaiden series which always came out on the newest and powerful console system. Team Ninja was able to bring the action-oriented gameplay of the original console titles, but also bring an innovative and intuitive gameplay through near-exclusive use of the DS stylus and touchscreen. Here's to hoping Team Ninja will continue to make more Ninja Gaiden and original IP titles for the DS to complement the titles they've been releasing on the 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2008"}

Silent Hill 2 is an experience before a game--a happening in stead of a distraction.  It's an event to be felt rather than played.  That's what Silent Hill 2 is for me.  And it's amazing.  In general, I'm not a fan of horror games.  But the Silent Hill series is more than cheap scares and gore (though such will be found).  It's a great story tied with exploration and discovery.  It's the unraveling of secrets.  What happened?  What's going on?  What's it all mean?  These are the questions you'll be asking yourself when you play through SH2.  Or SH3 for that matter.  I assume the same goes for 1, 4, Origins, and the new 5, but since I haven't played them I cannot say absolutely.James Sunderland's wife passed away three years ago, but he could swear the letter he's holding is written in her handwriting.  She's waiting for you, James, in your \"special place\".  But when James finds the old resort town, he finds only monsters and those few humans dragged to the town, driven by their own inner pain, trying to discover things for themselves.James searches, fighting where he must, being stalked by the malevolent figured with the helmet shaped like a rust-covered pyramid that carries a knife too big for a normal man to even lift.  He searches through streets and apartments, a park, a hospital, a prison, but will James find the answers, or will he go mad, or is he already?  This is Silent Hill 2.The gameplay is what you'd expect if you'd played the games before.  You run around, solve puzzles, beat up monsters with a steel pipe or shoot them or what have you.  You uncover secrets and watch the events unfold.  And how you play the game determines how it ends.  Explaining a game like Silent Hill is boring when you mention the mechanics.  Because the mechanics--the controls--are just there for you to have a way to be in the story.  The controls work, that's all that needs to be said about them.  Camera angles can be irritating at times, but they are how they are to increase the cinematic quality.Overall, though, Silent Hill 2 is amazing.  I wasn't even a fan until very recently.  I picked up 3 wondering if I liked horror games.  I still don't know if I do, but I love Silent Hill.Graphics - Decent, most of the times.  Great during some cut scenes.  But we're spoiled to amazing next-gen graphics these days.  Still, I love the facial expressions on characters during the well-rendered scenes.  That really brought life to the characters.Sound - Fantastic.  Akira Yamaoka has been doing SH's music for so long and for good reason, it's always fitting with the mood.  Catchy, haunting, whatever.  I'll be buying the soundtrack.In closing, I've played more fun games than SH2, but I don't think any will stick in my mind as well or as long.  It will make you think, it will make you wonder, and you'll enjoy it the whole way.  And really, isn't that what games are supposed to do?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}

It doesn't matter your skill level because the learning level is streamlined to how you play. With the last Rocksmith the main issue I had was the syrupy slow interface. Well, that has been fixed by Ubisoft. Selecting a song has never been easier. The only real complaint I have, and it's a minor one, is I wish there was more of a diversity of songs. By that I mean I wish there was some recent songs(say last 5 years) instead of mostly all old classic songs. However, what songs they do have on their are a very nice selection of hits to make you bang your head.If you already own the original Rocksmith, then you don't need to buy another USB cable because it will work with this 2014 edition. Maybe the best thing about this new edition is it asks you what your skill/experience level is before playing. That is really great!

It's a collection of mini games where you basically step on, avoid, or generally smack around rabbids/rabbits. In one game you must contort your body to mimic on screen shapes to scare the rabbids. You can also play this game with two people, sort of a collective scary shadow puppets game.  It is pretty funny to watch the kids work together to try and fit their bodies into a shape to achieve success.  In another game you must dodge floating bubbles containing a rabbid to score points. The kinect requires a lot of space if you play this game with more than one person, but the single player experience is still enjoyable if you lack the necessary room.  There is a decent collection of mini games and this game would be a decent gift for any kids with a kinect controller, but I would not reommend this game for a child over 10 or 11 years old. My kids have played this every day with glee since we got it.  This is definitely a more physical game than our other kinect games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Media Man","summary":"A worthy but different Guild Wars sequel","reviewText":"Developed by ArenaNet and published in August of 2012 by NCsoft, Guild Wars 2 is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMO) set in the fantasy world of Tyria. The story which takes place approximately 250 years after the original Guild Wars - Eye of the North, follows the story of the emergence of the long slumbering Elder Dragons and the threat they pose to the current inhabitants of Tyria. The tale is catered to the character you create and play from a choice of 5 races (Human, Charr, Sylvari, Norn and Asura) and 8 professions (Guardian, Warrior, Engineer, Ranger, Thief, Elementalist, Mesmer and Necromancer) with a plethora of skills to customize your character's play style. After you create your character you begin your choice based storyline and join other players in the struggle against the Elder Dragons. Here are my thoughts on Guild Wars 2;Pros+ Beautiful and moving original soundtrack by Jeremy Soule.+ Level scaled grouping.+ Plenty of solo and group play.+ Massively scaled world and cities.+ Beautifully designed zones with plenty of places to explore and puzzles to solve.+ Gorgeous graphics.+ Personalized storyline.+ Brilliant voice acting.+ Revamped combat system combining both twitch and skill based abilities.+ New playable races and characters.+ Fluid combat and action animations.+ Free to play. No monthly fees. Just buy the game and you're done.+ Dye your characters whenever you'd like for free. No more collecting or having to buy/trade for dye.+ Voluntary PvP.+ Area quests.Cons- Finding a group option or lack thereof was really a pain.- Storyline is a bit too predictable and can become dull and unoriginal at times.- Massive environments often feel empty of enemies.- Some really unattractive looking armor and gear.- Not a fan of the technology/gun aspects of the Asura/Charr/Engineer. It really drew me out of the original fantasy setting of Guild Wars.- A few events, classes and dungeons are still broken, unbalanced and buggy.- Micro-transaction cash shop. I dislike it in any game I play that has it.- Many quests fall victim to the stereotypical go here, kill X number of things, harvest X number of things etc. I really dislike this in MMO's.- Didn't feel much like the original Guild Wars to me other than the lore.- Can be graphically heavy on the system.- Grinding for gear.The original Guild Wars (and all following expansions) is one of my favorite fantasy role-playing games of all times. I spent an immeasurable amount of hours questing and exploring the huge amounts of content so when Guild Wars 2 was announced I set my hopes pretty high. As screenshots, gameplay and developer videos began to emerge I became even more excited about the upcoming title. At the same time I also began to feel a hint of apprehension as Guild Wars 2 seemed to be taking a sizable departure from the original. My feelings ended up being true on both accounts. Although the game is remarkable overall, it didn't feel much like the original Guild Wars did to me. The game itself is gorgeous and there's an enormous amount of places to explore, quests to complete and things to do. As far as a no monthly fee/buy to play MMO it's easily the best on the market at the moment. Guild Wars 2 may not be perfect, but it's still a great game. If you're expecting the original Guild Wars you may be disappointed. But if you're expecting a new and changed Tyria filled with foes to battle and challenges to overcome, then Guild Wars 2 fits the bill quite nicely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands.

Please...!","reviewText":"When I was reading some of the press material for the Nokia N-Gage I found it interesting that Nokia representatives had been stating that they wanted to build a device that people would not be embarrassed to play in public. I laughed because I'm 23 and am more embarrassed by a cell phone than a hand held console. Not too much later Nintendo released the GBA SP, I don't know if it was because they wanted a sleeker design to pre-counter the inevitable whip lash of Nokia's &quot;Gameboys' for little kids&quot; tactics, but it wasn't a bad idea. Not that anyone was actually embarrassed by their GameBoy, but if they were there's no need to be now as Nintendo has finally designed the perfect handheld. Granted you can't make staticy and barely audible phone calls with it, but who cares? GBA still has the same great games it always has had, capable of playing all the old GameBoy and GameBoy color games in both wide screen and 4X3 mode, like the original GBA, and best of all, the screen is finally lit and can be played regardless of your lighting conditions, and there is an internal rechargeable battery that is fully charged in a matter of a couple hours. The battery will also last more than ten hours. Nintendo has eliminated many of the problems that I had with hand helds, the constant need for replacing batteries, and difficult to see LCD screens. Add to that a sleek new flip top design and a size that fits into your pocket better than ever I think that you have the perfect example of what an affordable and effective handheld should be, a game machine designed for on the go that you won't have to throw into a lake in frustration when your phone conversation cuts out on you. Not saying that the Nokia N-Gage won't sell, or won't have its own benefits, but rather that the GBA SP is a gamer's handheld, designed for gamers, by gamers and its not something I as a 23 year old gamer would ever be embarrassed to have in public, in fact I'm at work right now playing it and writing my review because its a pretty darn cool system.

Emerge from the tiniest of villages into a sweeping tale of danger and war, chronicling your rise from a peasant to a full-fledged hero of the Realms. The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"A game that has improved with time","reviewText":"When Neverwinter Nights 2 was first released, it was riddled with many bugs that left it almost unplayable in certain areas. Fortunately, Obsidian Entertainment did their part and worked dutifully to fix the worst of the glitches and improve play experience. As a result, now is the time to try out Neverwinter Nights 2 if you were wary before. With most of the technical issues out of the way and a bustling community producing excellent user-created content, Neverwinter Nights 2 is finally reaching its potential.Neverwinter Nights 2 offers several improvements over the original Neverwinter Nights. The most obvious of these improvements are the vastly enhanced graphics and the improved rules - Neverwinter Nights 2 uses the streamlined and revised \"3.5\" edition of the Dungeons & Dragons rules and also allows a wide array of options that its predecessor did not, including new PC races and a wide array of prestige classes.The biggest improvement of Neverwinter Nights 2 is the single player campaign. While the original Neverwinter Nights offered some interesting ideas, it fell flat in terms of story. The sequel goes back a little further than its predecessor, digging into the style of storytelling that made the Baldur's Gate series so popular. While not as long and in-depth as that series, this game does present the best campaign we've seen in a D&D; computer game since Baldur's Gate 2. You now control a group of four to five characters, each with their own personalities. The world is large, with plenty of room for exploration. Most importantly, the dialogue and story are top-notch, with your character deciding the fate of the Sword Coast. The variety of quests is spectacular, ranging from traditional find an item/kill a monster quests to more elaborate adventures, such as defending yourself at a trial or improving and maintaining a full keep.There are still a few minor technical glitches with Neverwinter Nights 2, but the show-stopping bugs of before are gone. Building custom content is perhaps a little more difficult than in the original Neverwinter Nights, since the toolset can now do so much more, but the community has still put together some spectacular products. Most significantly, the single player campaign alone makes this game worth the purchase price. With an interesting story and near limitless potential, Neverwinter Nights 2 offers an excellent computer role-playing experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2009"}

This new chapter uses next-generation technologies to create a fully immersive gaming adventure.","reviewerName":"mkllby","summary":"It's OKAY","reviewText":"First let me say that there are really great aspects to this game. Visually this game blows me away. At times I have found myself doing nothing but walking around the world taking in all the sights. That is where my true fascination with this game ends though, and had it not been for the stunningly beautiful world I would've rated this game lower.I am trying to figure out why people have been so captivated by this game. The story line (or perhaps the pace of it) is literally mind-numbingly boring. I bought this game when it first came out. I played it for probably 40 hours hoping that it would eventually get interesting. It didn't, so I stopped playing it. Sometime after that I was desperate for a good RPG, and started doing some reading/research online for a good game. I ran into a review of this game and in the article they cautioned that the game was so huge it was easy to completely lose track of the main story. Keeping this in mind I started playing the game again, this time focusing on the main story. After another 30 to 35 hours of playing with the focus on the main story, I am still so bored that I don't think I will ever be able to finish this game.The lack of a great story is the true downfall of this game. I have read where people herald things such as the realism of it turning night and day. Perhaps I am in the minority here, but this doesn't add one ounce of enjoyment to my gaming experience. Personally I found this to be quite annoying. Many times after heading into town to do some trading (because I needed money and was \"over encumbered\") the shops would be closed. Then you need to find something to do (without venturing out too far because the shops might be closed again by the time you get back) to kill time all night until they open again. Soooooo boring!!!!I love being able to roam freely, but I have played (and replayed) linear games with an awesome story that I couldn't put down. It is always easy to critize, but I think if the developer had focused more on the depth of the story instead of the depth in \"realism\" of the world this could have been a truly great game. As it stands now though, it is barely OK. However I would probably still spend the $ just to see the level of depth they put into the world as it is pretty amazing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2007"}

Look at the customer photos to see how people such as me have created a work around for the mounting issues. FYI if you mount it to a standard height coffee table and sit on a sofa, chair, etc... the wheel would be too low for comfort - usable but far from ideal. The designated driving chairs are great, but they are expensive and they take up a lot of room (they don't fold away).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2009"}

How do four players Pokemon at the same time, you ask? Easy: two-on-two battles. With four players (and monsters) involved, the battles get that much more hectic. For that matter, just two players can choose to engage in \"Double Battle\". That means even with just two trainers present, you can send out two Pokemon at once to battle in a four monster free-for-all.Beyond that, the Pokedex has been entirely disposed of. It's been replaced with the Pokemon Navigator (of course, it's known as \"Pokenavi\" for short.) Inside the Pokenavi's copious confines you'll find more than a simple list of Pokemon. You'll be able to see a map of the game's world, and check out what's in different towns you've visited so you can refresh your memory without trekking back there to discover it all again. In a section of the Navi dubbed \"Trainer Eye\", you'll be able to review your win and loss record, and the inclinations your Pokemon display during battle. You'll be able to check strategies and schedule rematches with other characters.It seems like Team Rocket finally hung up their hats, because this time you'll be battling two syndicates of Pokemon mischief: Team Magma and Team Aqua. Team Magma will trouble players of Ruby, while Sapphire fans will have to contend with Aqua. The stories of the two games are more or less the same, otherwise, though.With the addition of new modes, new monsters, and all-new game interface options, it sounds like more than a little care is being put into Ruby and Sapphire to assure fans of an extremely enhanced Pokemon experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0009VXAM0","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"A trully multi dimensional experience...","reviewText":"In the last week I have become an owner of a PS3.  My next generation collection is complete.  I have spent dozens of hours on the XBox 360 and Nintendo Wii.  Now I am beginning to enjoy the PS3 experience and all it offers.  I want to make this review as multi faceted as possible covering everything this console offers.  The PS3 is not a mere gaming platform.  It is much more.  Like all next generation consoles this one offers more than gaming.  Much more than gaming.  Although it does appear that both Microsoft and Sony are trying very hard to become the living room feature of choice.First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with.  I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is.  The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty.  I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome.  Connecting the PS3 was the easy part.  Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console.  Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect.  From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs.  The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing.  You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound.  New to any video game console is HDMI output.  This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio.  HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture.  It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound.  So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers.  On the front end you get three memory card slots which are hidden behing a plastic door...so as to not diminish the appearance of the PS3.  Also they included four USB outlets.  This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer.  The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times.  Which is similar to the other consoles.  I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review.I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3.  This allows for each person to go online with their information.  Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.Next is the system settings.  This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system.  You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v.  You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections.  The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use.The PS3 also has a photo viewer.  You can download photos by two different means.  One is by using your camera and connecting it via USB.  I haven't checked to see how viable this option is.  Next you can download the pictures with a memory card.  This operation is rather simple and downloads are quick.  Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature.  It allows you to view your pictures on a blank canvas as they fall onto the blank canvas.  I think the picture viewer would be best if it allowed you to set music to your pictures.  I hope they do make this a feature in the future.Next is the music player.  You can dowload songs by two different means.  One being memory card and the other cd.  Songs download much quicker via memory card than cd.  Although Sony has talked about having downloads via the internet which I think would go over very well.  You can listen to music while viewing a feature that uses colors and textures.  It is your standard music viewer...nothing special there.I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3.  The Bluray player.  Most of you now know what a Bluray player is and does.  I have viewed two movies on it.  I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's.  One a 1080p and a 1080i.  I really did not notice much of a picture difference.  After viewing a few movies on the XBox 360 hddvd player and the PS3 Bluray player I really did not notice much of a difference.  One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition.  Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition.  The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier.Now would be the gameplay part of the interface.  This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded.  This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate.  For any PS2 owner it also carries your virtual memory card with all your game data.  As far as the games go I have played three actual games plus several demos.  The games that are non exclusive like Madden Football or Need For Speed to not have improved visuals over their XBox 360 counterparts.  The game speed is smooth and polished.  The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Genji is quite impressive.  The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces.  Game demos like Motorstorm and Gran Turismo HD show what the PS3 is capable of.  Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games in the next year.  I have also enjoyed the few full games that are downloadable.  The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99.  What I have enjoyed is online gaming.  With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees.  The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing.  I also believe you can use your PS2 headset via USB.  The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360.Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3.  On the interface online is a big part.  From the browser to having friends and checking your mail.  Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store.  Which is obviously not very unique.  The 360 has a market which could be considered the pedigree for consoles.  The Wii is limited to just classic video games.  The Playstation store is small right now with very few items to download.  You have games, demos, and movie trailers.  The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP).  After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP.  Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play.  When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP.  All you need is a wifi connection.  I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable.  I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP.  The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby.  It did not work for me then.  Only when the PS3 was on and set for remote play.  The only negative I have found with the Playstation Store is when downloading.  Unlike the 360, when you download something you are not allowed to do anything else.  This limits you to just downloading.  The downloading does seem to move a little slower than on the 360.  That could just be because I am stuck staring at a download screen.In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience.  I feel the $600 is well worth it for the features you get.  Wifi, Bluray, memory card readers, HDMI, and of course the game playing.I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this.  Others may just be waiting for more games.  If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}

Had I never played Blitz before (available and quite popular as a free application on Facebook or as a paid app for iPods/iPhones through the Apple App Store) then I'm sure I would have just loved this.  Instead, I found myself missing the more frantic pace of the 1 minute timer, and the zone one has to get into in order to rack up really large combinations, bonuses and points.  Because of the interface here, the whole game slows down.  You're not just grabbing a single jewel and flipping it one direction or another, you're selecting with the pen and then rotating with buttons, and it just takes a bit longer to get done what you need to.  Of course, that will be appealing to those that appreciate more methodical (perhaps even more thoughtful) play.  So what I find less attractive about this version may be exactly what appeals most about it to you.So consider your style of play, perhaps even play one of the many free versions online, and absolutely feel good about this version as a buy if a slower rhythm to the game is desirable.  It's highly polished, has a great interface, works well within the confines and features of the DS, and at its core is a classic and celebrated game.  What's left is that subjective and personal question (regarding pacing) that differentiates this from the other variations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

This is without a doubt one of the most insanely fun fighting games you will find around these days, featuring a bevy of characters from both sides to choose from and duke it out (including Dead Rising star Frank!).  Stylistically, the game resembles Street Fighter IV in terms of using 3-D modeled characters on a 2-D fighting plane, but the game's fighting engine is more akin to the Marvel VS Capcom series, with crazy combos and attacks that range from simple to complicated to pull off.  The game looks great, plays fantastically, and features a variety of options in terms of control schemes (whether it's the Wii-mote, classic controller, or Gamecube controller) that almost anyone can jump in and pick up and play.  The only real flaws that the game has is that the unfamiliarity with the Tatsunoko license that a number of gamers may have, but by all means, please throw that aside.  All in all, Wii owners should rejoice the fact that Tatsunoko VS Capcom has arrived on our shores, because this is one of the best fighting games to grace the Wii yet, and one of the most fun that you're likely to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0074LJ3CE","description":"","reviewerName":"Cristoper Najar Herrera","summary":"Great port... or is this more than a port?","reviewText":"The game on the PS Vita is just terrific. I initially had my doubts regarding this product because I already own the 360 version and the graphics and audio are flawless. So I really thought a very little console couldn't manage such quality.Since I don't have the PS3 version of the game, I didn't enjoy a gameplay with Kratos from the God Of War series. But the PS Vita version is a full version that contains all the possible things that you could get on Mortal Kombat 9. This is good, and a little disappointing at the same time. Good, because once you start the game, you have everything available to have a cool fighting experience without the need of extra charges per DLCs. A big roster full of cool characters including Kratos, Skarlet, Rain, Kenshi, Freddy Krueger and Rain. Disappointing, because you have pretty much everything at hand; you don't have to go through the story mode or beat certain things to unlock characters on the selection screen, because all characters are already there, unlocked. So if you are the kind of gamer that likes to struggle and beat challenges in order to unlock stuff, then there's nothing to do here as far as character selection is concerned.Surprisingly, some alternate clothes are available also without the need of doing anything on the game; for example, all female and male ninjas already have their alternate costumes available, like the classic Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Ermac outfits. Again, no need for extra downloads.The game is like an exact copy of the 360/PS3 versions with an addition of 150 new tower challenges which are a separate game mode. So you have the traditional tower of challenges and on top of that, 150 new challenges, that are mostly intended to take advantage of the Vita's capabilities. Such challenges include bouncing the Vita to move the characters, doing special moves with the aid of the touch screen and rear panel of the Vita, etc. It's a little tricky at first, but once you get the feeling, it's pretty amazing. So this game is not a mere port, it has very cool additions.The graphics are very good, but you see some little low quality on the story mode. The cinematics look awesome. But when it's time to start a fight on this story mode and the camera does a close up on the character, the graphics look ugly. But only on that very little time that can take 2 seconds at much. Everything else from the cinematics and the kombat looks amazing.Another cool feature is the online mode. You can play single or tag matches and once you find an opponent (which can be your friend or anyone on the network) you can talk to people without using a headset! This is soooo nice because at least for me it's a little uncomfortable to play with something attached to my ears. But here, you don't need that. You can just play, and talk to your opponent at the same time. You can continue talking as long as that session takes.Something that REALLY disappointed me on this game was the lack of a cross-platform feature. This game plays so smoothly and has all the same characteristics that the PS3 version has, so I don't see WHY Street Fighter X Tekken has cross-platforming but Mortal Kombat does not. I would have been terrific to play some cool fights with my friends who own a PS3, and rip some heads off.Overall, this game is a must in your PS Vita collection. Especially if you own the 360 version, there are many pluses on this one. I definitely recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2012"}

They've made it feel more modern than MK 1-3 and it doesn't feel as blocky.Now most people would say that the actual fighting is all that matters but this game really changed my opinion of that.  This game is my favorite fighting game ever, as a whole package.  If you're seeking a single player experience especially (which the Vita version you won't be playing on the couch with your buddies) this is the best fighting game ever made.  It has a very decent and fun story mode, it has 2 challenge towers that aren't just absurd feats (like the Mission Mode in Guilty Gear X2 became) but instead fun and interesting.  There is a ton of stuff to unlock, plenty of great characters (this version gives you the 4 DLC characters for free), and plenty of fun and interesting fatalities to experience and learn.I honestly didn't play the Vita version online at all. The PS3 version ran great online so I'd assume the Vita version does too, but I can't confirm that.I will say compared to the PS3 version the graphics of this version aren't nearly as good but I'd say the extra challenge tower is a fair trade off.My only complaint is that the Platinum trophy is nearly impossible for this game and the PS3 version. It requires you to play each character for 24 hours of game-play, there are more than 30 characters...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

King \"The super mario nerd\"","summary":"Not the best, what was nintendo thinking?","reviewText":"When i bought this game i thought it would be much different. I had the first and third mario games for the nes so i wanted to complete the trilogy and buy the seconed one. I played like a 1 miniute demo of the game but it was not long enough. so when i bought it and it came to me, it came to me that this is not the same mario. The only  part i like about it is there is a choice of 4 cherecters each of their own special moves. Mario is just regular but he looks almost completly different. Luigi looks different too but it is really annoying with his cherecter that he slides everywhere when he walks or runs. Peach is not being rescued on this game she is my favorite charecter because so floats for a short period of time and she controls well. Toad on the otherhand can jump very high and go fast. Each charecter can duck and when it glows u can do a super jump. They also can pick up items in the ground like onions and plants and throw it at the enemy. THAT IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY U CAN DEFEAT THEM TOO. There is no jumping on them anymore. To defeat the bosses u jump on their eggs they spit out at u and u pick them up and throw it at them. IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS IS THE JAPANESE FAMICON VERSION (DOKI DOKI PANIC),NOT MARIO. They just changed the charecters to mario.What did nintindo think when they did this? This game is also hard to beat, i could not even get to world 3. If there is even that many. ITS NOT EVEN 2 PLAYER!!! The only reason i still have it is because its part of the trigoly and it will be worth more when u sell all of them together. I gave it a 3 star because its mario and i love the games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2009"}

I gave this one a shot figuring it had to work if it's made for PS3! Setup was super simple and I was up and running in less than 10 minutes.

I find myself fidgeting with it often after the one hour mark to get it in a better position.

After all, the goal of the game is to find and slay sixteen Colossi, which are (as the name implies) giant lumbering behemoths. The Colossi and the world they inhabit are built to a breathtakingly large scale. The sheer vastness of the scenery pushes the limits of the PS2 from a graphical perspective. Unfortunately the beautiful surroundings feel dramatically empty since they are devoid of any life besides the Colossi themselves.While I give the game points for a very creative premise and unique gameplay, it feels like something is missing. The Colossi battles are intense but to reach them you must spend way too much time wandering the world completely alone. And as remarkable and unique as each the game's antagonists may be from an artistic design perspective, the battles themselves did not benefit from the same treatment. Apart from a few minor variations, each fight consists of gaining the creature's attention with your bow & stabbing the weak spot(s) with your sword, rinse and repeat. By about the fifth or sixth Colossus the process becomes somewhat tedious. A few other weaknesses such as a slightly wonky camera, a few minor control issues, and an almost nonexistent story also detract from the experience.While my criticism may seem harsh, I did enjoy the game. Shadow of the Colossus aims for the moon. While its few flaws made it miss, it still landed among the stars. The rush you get as your tiny character clings tenaciously to a flailing giant is an experience you won't find in any other game. In spite of any shortcomings, I recommend checking this game out- even if only as a rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2008"}

I think Crackdown is a fun game to play.  It is very entertaining and the game will keep you occupied for hours.  In the game, you not only fight street gangs and gang leaders, but you also participate in different street races and try to find different colored orbs to build up your strength and skills.  You become faster at running, you can jump higher, and you can shoot weapons better.Okay, here is the negative part to Crackdown.  First off, it feels like the game developers rush through to try to finish this game.  The game feels like it is half finished.For example, the city you play in is divided up on different islands.  The city is called Pacific City.  So you are surrounded by water.  Well here is the weird part.  There are no boats anywhere out on the water.  You are surrounded by water but there are no boats.  You have beaches on the islands but there are no people sitting on the beaches or swimming out in the water.  There are factories in the game but there are no railroad tracks so there are no trains.  I have never seen a factory area without railroad tracks and trains.  There are no airports so there are no planes or helicopters up in the sky.  Where are the motorcycles in the game?You have a Amusement Park in the game called \"Fun Land\" that located on a beach.  I noticed when I went to Fun Land that are no people at the Amusement Park.  Well how come there are no people at Fun Land?  Every time I go there to Fun Land, I can't find one person there.  It doesn't matter if it is day or night.  And how come there is only one ride there?  You have a big Ferris Wheel and that's it.  The Ferris Wheel doesn't even work.  And how come none of the Snack Bars at Fun Land are ever opened for business?Most buildings in the game you can never go inside.  They are just there for looks and that's it. I don't know why people even bother comparing this game to the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series because it's not.  The Grand Theft Auto series games all had planes, boats, trains, motocycles, etc.  You could go inside most buildings in the Grand Theft Auto Series.I listen to all the songs in the game.  There are 105 songs you can listen to while you are driving around in a vehicle.  I notice right away none of the songs are popular songs.  All the songs are sort of rap songs I've never even heard of.  Why didn't they put in some country music, new age, rock and roll, contemporary, etc. that people recognized?  In Grand Theft Auto Vice City one of the reasons the game was so popular was because of the music in the game.  They played all 1980's hit songs which really added to the game.  This music is pretty much forgettable in Crackdown.I like Crackdown, but it really frustrating when I could see Crackdown being a much better made game to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

An example of this was when I used a 3rd party memory card while playing Phantasy Star Online.  Within a week all my data was corrupted on the card.  I then switched to the 251 from Nintendo, and I haven't had a problem since.  I really like the color of the card too, because it matches my Black Gamecube.

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Poop Thang","summary":"One of the Best Video Games of All Time","reviewText":"First off, this game is very good considering it had very good graphics (for an N64) and sound.

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Fantastic game with just a few flaws","reviewText":"For the first half of this game, I was ready to anoint it the best action game ever made.  Everything just works so well.  The gameplay is perfectly balanced, the mystery in the story builds, and everything seems perfectly tested so that it works just right.  All of the additions that the game makes to the genre are ingenious.  Then, about 2/3 of the way through, the game loses some steam.  The level design takes a step backwards to 1998 in some areas.  Other times, gameplay elements don't work very well.  Finally, the story ends without answering anything, making you wonder whether there is going to be any resolution for what seems like a bunch of senseless plot twists.Half-Life 2 is the most incredible looking game ever made.  It blows away Doom 3, and is still easily better looking than Far Cry.  Everything in the game looks amazing. The characters look, move, and act so life-like.  The water almost makes you thirsty looking at it, and each of the game's enemies are loaded with detail.  The new alien enemies that you meet about halfway through the game are particularly impressive, and the gigantic striders are simply unbelievable.  City 17 is a strange mix of beauty and despair.  I have never played a game that so perfectly captures an atmosphere like this.  Imagine what a rundown Eastern European city would look like in a futuristic totalitarian state ravaged by mayhem, and you have it in this game.  Towards the end of the game, when you are fighting through bombed-out, war-torn and flaming buildings, you have to occasionally stop to marvel at the carnage.  Valve really hit a home run when it comes to atmosphere.Half-Life 2 adds a lot to the original game.  There are a couple of long vehicular sequences, some squad-based combat, a handful of new and interesting enemies, but most of all, physics.  No PC game has integrated physics this well into the gameplay.  The gravity gun is certain to be imitated by lots of other games.  With it, you can pick up all sorts of objects in the environment and use them as shields or weapons.  After playing through the game almost twice now, I can tell you that ripping a radiator off the wall and flattening an enemy with it never gets old.  Neither does launching an exploding barrel at a group of enemies and watching them fly across the screen.  The game also has some physics-based puzzles, which aren't that much of a highlight.With the exception of one significant stuttering bug, the audio for Half-Life 2 is unforgettable.  Everything in the game sounds so - cool.  Every sound will implant itself firmly in your memory.  The radio chatter and AI barks of the combine, the whirling of the manhack blades, the horrible moan of the headcrab zombies, the sounds of the gunship machine guns, the hum of the gravity gun, the resounding crack of the 357 magnum, the screeches of the ant lions, and the \"thump-thump\" that the striders make as they plow through the city.  Half-Life 2 also has some great voice work to go with its wonderful sound effects.Level design, for the first 2/3 of the game, is brilliant.  The game is pretty tightly scripted and doesn't deviate too far from the formulas of lots of other first-person shooters.  Health and shield power-ups are places just enough to make the game forgiving without making it too easy.  The game throws a variety of exciting challenges at you and doesn't get too frustrating or annoying.  In particular, the hover boat level is a nonstop thrill ride, and the Ravenholm chapter is like a survival horror game on crack.But after that, you start to run into some areas that become either annoying or just aggravating.  It starts with the dune buggy level, which features horrendous controls.  You will spend more time upside-down in the buggy than you will spend driving it.  Then there are some annoying physics puzzles.  Three times, the game throws a puzzle at you that requires you to build some sort of bridge over a hazardous terrain using objects in the environment.  These sequences all interrupt the action, they are too long, and they aren't fun.  There are also some \"avoid setting off the turret\" puzzles near the end that are outdated and shouldn't have been in this game.A couple of defensive missions require you to set up automated turrets, which are easily knocked over and seemingly impossible to get standing back up again.  These sequences are indescribably aggravating, as you helplessly try to get your turrets upright while your enemies blast away at you.  The squad-based portions of the game are unsatisfying. The squad is either fodder or just gets in your way in the game's tight corridors.  If you have a squad, a single strider will cut it down in about five seconds, so it's pointless to try to keep them alive.  The game still has encounters that require you use the knowledge that you gain by quick saving to get through them.  If you ask me, games like Far Cry and Halo have made this type of encounter obsolete.Half-Life 2 is somewhat longer than your average action game.  It took me over 15 hours to complete it the first time, and it has so much to see and do that you can go back and replay it immediately.  I loved Half-Life 2, but some of the parts at the end left too much of a lukewarm taste in my mouth to call it Game of the Year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

(Sorry but if you compare the real world performance stats GameCube and XBox are lightyears ahead of Sony.) Even Hideo Kojima complained about the difficulty in developing the game, but he still managed to put out a game that looks and feels like a major Hollywood blockbuster. A deep engrosing story involving Solid Snake and later his replacement Raiden in a quest on a mission to stop terrorists from gaining access to the new and invincible Arsenal Gear. But there's so much more to it. The story features a grand conspiracy involving the real rulers of the United States, the threat of nuclear war, and many other themes. Over all both the game and the story are phenominal. But even though I am giving this game five stars I do have a few minor complaints.Raiden grows on you, but I wanted to be playing as Snake. In the future Konami might want to remember that Snake is the reason we love Metal Gear, and while I hope we haven't seen the last of Raiden, I don't want the game to focus on him as much as this one did, I don't want to loose track of him either. Snake still needs to be the focus.Also there are some contentinuity issues that must be explained, watch the Colonel closely, and Rose. You'll see what I mean. It raises the \"if this is true then how/why did he... at Shadow Moses.. when...\" question for those who are utterly engrossed in the story. And hang around after the credits, they provided quite the twist ending. It'll be interesting to see what the third Metal Gear Solid will be like, but hopefully Konami will opt to put it on a system that will allow them to accomplish the graphical marvel that PS2 didn't allow them to do due to it's bottlenecks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2001"}

A friend of mine gave it to me when he found it too complicated, and I can't pull myself away from it.  I'm running it on a Sony Vaio laptop (Has a somewhat weak Nvidia graphics card, not an integrated card) and it generally runs very well.  Not all the graphic goodies are turned all the way up, or on for that matter (vegetation), but it still looks amazing and runs very smooth unless it's a very large battle.It is a rather complicated game.  I've only played the \"grand campaign\", and have had to do several Google searches for information for explanations to things that weren't covered fully in the manual.  At first I would let the computer decide the outcome of battles as I had no clue what I was doing.  But, slowly I learned and it is truly the battles that make this game stand out from normal turn based games like the Civilization series.The battles are amazing and I sometimes find myself with this odd euphoria after a grand comeback.  The troops are detailed (probably more so if I were on a better computer), and they move very well.  Although the AI can be somewhat lackluster.  When the enemy decide to run for their lives that's when you want to send your Calvary to mow them all down.  But, often the enemy get spread out and your troops just run around in the middle of them doing nothing.  You can have only two enemy troops left to kill, but one got hung up on the castle gate and they are spread apart by say 200 meters.  So, your troops will just ride around in that gap never getting close to either, instead of just picking one and going after it.  Very minor frustration though.One thing that does really frustrate me is on the turn based part of the game, your units have very bad pathing.  You'll tell your units to head to point A, and they'll move as far as they can for that turn.  The next turn something that beyond their vision is now close enough to see, and it's blocking their path.  So, they'll turn around and go back to go around them.  Well, the very next turn they can't see that unit blocking their path anymore, sot they'll go that way again, and again it's blocked.  This can go on for several turns.  It's really bad if you need them to defend a city that is under attack.The paths that your units will choose to take are not marked.  A line showing what path they plan on taking before you committed to the move would be nice.  Sometimes you don't notice another unit is blocking your path, or you see it but think there is plenty of room to go around.  So, you'll tell your unit to move and they will suddenly take a huge long path that would take several moves to complete.  Makes you wish there was an \"undo\" button somewhere on the game.Every game is different.  I find myself having a lot of false starts.  Maybe I'm not making enough money to upgrade cities or purchase troops. And, it seems like I can play the same faction the same way, and one time I'm broke, and another time I have enough to do what I need to do. Maybe I find myself under attack by many strong factions and am always on the defense without a chance to do much else.  Expect some false starts until you get a game worth playing.The voice acting is really good.  I chuckle a lot at the things my units say.  The sound of the French crying for mercy before you execute them as prisoners is one of my favorites.  I don't know how authentic the accent is, but it is amusing.  Your commander will give a little speech before a battle to bolster the men.  They were fun to listen to at first, but now I tend to skip them just because the speeches are pretty much the same.Your units can benefit from battles by gaining experience.  Near as I can tell, all it really does is give them a better attack rating or armor rating.  It doesn't really do anything to their abilities.  Which is rather worthless for archers or artillery which don't normally get into hand to hand combat.  I would have liked to seen archers and artillery have slightly faster reload times and accuracy.  I think that would have added to the feel of the game.The religious aspect of the game can be a hindrance.  You'll find yourself spending a few turns making troops and gathering them together.  You'll send them to attack a town of another Catholic nation, and suddenly the Pope tells you if you attack them you will be excommunicated, and you can't attack them for X amount of turns.  Well, you only have about 250 turns to win the game, so that can be quite a burden when you have to wait 6 turns here, 5 turns there before you can attack them.  Being excommunicated can cause rioting in your cities.  I tried playing as the Moors and Russians as they aren't Catholic nations to avoid this, but they tended to have rather weak troops.  Plus the land around them tended to be spread out so travel time was greatly increased, making hard to win in under 250 turns.It can be a very difficult game.  It is filled with a lot of nuances and can be quite complicated.  But, that is what makes it so great.  Where you can go spend $60 on a console game and beat it in ten hours, you really get your moneys worth out of this.  Even if it was free:)  I've been playing this game pretty solid for about three weeks now, and feel there is still a lot of life in it.  They have a new one coming out that is Civil War themed, think I'll have to try that!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2008"}

The rest of it I totally hated.The reason I bought \"Grid\" was that it had garnered enough reviews on Metacritic to earn the place of the most favorably-reviewed racing game for the Playstation.  After having played it for weeks I wonder how many hours those reviewers actually played it.For me, at least, the thing was unwinnable.  It was so difficult as to be ridiculous, even on \"Basic\" difficulty.  I like to come home from work and want to unwind for an hour or so with a racing game.  This seemed as good as any other, but after a few weeks passed, I noticed that I wasn't making any progress in the game, since I wasn't winning any races.This is because:1.  All the camera angles are so low that you can't really see much of the road ahead of you.  Therefore to avoid crashing you are forced to travel at speeds slower than those necessary to win even the simplest races.  As a result, the only way to really win a race is, essentially, to memorize the track.  But this strikes me as boring and not unlike memorizing maze patterns in Pac-Man.2.  The physics of the game are completely absurd.  Since when do cars invariably and eternally speed out of control because you floor it when you're on grass or gravel?  I have a car and do that from time to time:  my car does not spin in absurd circles when I do.  The physics of the game and the interaction with other cars was all convincing and realistic until you got off the track.  When you did, Bizarro World rules suddenly same into play.If you do buy it, I would at least recommend buying it for PC.

So, you have to email EA support.  They responded to my request for a BDTS serial key within 2 hours.  I understand that the BDTS serial key is generic, so the same key could be used by many people; however, key activation also depends on EA servers.  If you have a key and it doesn't seem to work, keep trying for a few days.I also bought Pinnacle Station DLC from the Origin Store for 5 bucks, and it came with the 1.02 patch for Mass Effect.  Pinnacle Station is like a shooting gallery / hologram deck, where you pit your fighting skills against hologram characters.  It's not a true mission like the other missions.The value edition comes with a second disk. The extra disk is for other European languages; look in the \"data\" folder, and you will find several large .rar files for German, French, and Italian. Unless you select one of those languages during install, you will not be prompted to use the second disk. And the \"eurodocs\" folder contains game manuals for 12 languages, including English.If you are looking for the English manual, go to the second disk; you will find it in the \"eurodocs\" folder in the sub-folder named \"English\".So, what about the game itself?  You can read many other reviews for that!  I will say this: It plays like a movie, which is very cool.  Just the right amount of RPG, just the right amount of action, and very good story/plot and character development.

I have extremely wonderful memories of playing Mario Kart on SNES for hours on end when I was young...but those days are gone.  Mario Kart:Double Dash is an extremely fun and well made game, and I would really put forth that I &quot;really like&quot; Mario Kart...and I would also put forth it is the best of the series thus far.  The graphics are typical Mario; they won't &quot;wow&quot; you but are cute, happy, and all those things Mario needs to be.  The control is Nintendo quality, and the addition of the extra characters certainly is refreshing (although Diddy Kong, and the baby Marios should have been left way back in the planning stages).  Some of the levels are downright brillantly created.  Just take a drive DK Mountain, Wario's Colleseum, or Baby Park and see what I mean.  Simple stuff like the addition of selectable karts also is fun, especially for younger players.  Older players tend to pick characters and kart for the long haul, but little kids will find the selection process a blast.  The newly added Bomb-omb Blast battle mode is fantastic, and the multiplayer mode stays intact as a staple of Mario Kart goodness.  So what's wrong with Mario Kart?  Well, let me tell you something right now...it is without a doubt one of the most insane and ridicious games ever made.  The main pitfall of the game is the extremely random item collection.  Way back when (during those dark SNES days) when a player landed a lighting bolt, that rare elusive item you'd only read about in the instruction manual...it was something.  Double Dash (for some reason or another) hands those suckers out like they are going out of style.  Ditto for the spiked shells.  You can also rest assured that when you near that finish line you've got a red shell, spiked shell, or flying banana peel aimed right at you.  While I enjoy a good challenge, when a game like this become predictably ridiculous, it shows poor game design.  Something that is NOT Nintendo.  In previous Mario Karts, CPU characters have always had the upper hand.  This incarnation is no different.  It's not unreasonable to hit an enemy with a red shell then switch drivers and use three mushrooms and still be lagging behind.  Which leaves most races up to chance and not to actual skill.  In the end Mario Kart:Double Dash is a fun game with some major issues.  It isn't about changing the world of gaming, it's about that good ol'Nintendo fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2003"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"Bioshock, but not Bioshock at the same time.","reviewText":"A review from a REAL gamer and fan of the Bioshock series... ME!I waited to finish the whole game on PC before writing a review as I am quite a fan of the first 2 Bioshock games. I played with a 360 Controller and it worked beautifully, so this review applies to the Xbox version as well. You will definately want to install this to the HDD if your Xbox 360 has the space as loading from disc can sometimes cause hangups on loading in the Xbox version.I know that the rumor mills and PAID game reviews are saying this is the best game of all time and has achieved the mythical 10 out of 10 and that every gamer should own a copy... Well... I have to say that is just not true. The coveted 5 star, 10 points, or 100 point review scores are lying. A 100% score from a gamer is basically saying that a game with that coveted score is a GOD among all other games and that all other games should bow down before it and kiss its feet. Everyone should own a copy even if they only play flash games online. I do not feel that is the case here and is pretty much hype or just new players that have never played the first two Bioshock games.Before people start exploding with anger as to why I only give it a \"meh\" 3 out of 5 and not 4 or higher is that, as a part of a SERIES of games, this one is a step BACKWARDS from the previous games. If this was its own game, in its own universe, and not connected any way to the original 2 Bioshock games; I would give it 4 out of 5.I have to say this is a VERY SHORT GAME, they could have done so much more with this to get it up towards the amount of content that the first two games had, near 15 hours or more, but it looks like the Bioshock series has fallen to the DLC monster and time constraints that so many big game companies are forcing upon games now. I went all through the game and explored every little inch I could in the game, and it came out to under 9 hours of play time.Since this game IS titled as part of a series/established universe, I will rate it as such and compare it to the previous games. I believe that ANY new game in an established series should ALWAYS try to out-do and improve upon the previous games.Here we go:First- Replay Value: The original Bioshock games were all about CHOICE and DIFFERENT paths and MULTIPLE ENDINGS to add what gamers like me call the holy grail of gaming known as \"Replay Value\" or \"Replayability\" and what companies call \"Lots of people buying our games\"... This is what makes a game worth buying over just renting, beating, and never playing again. Bioshock 1&2 had SUBSTANTIAL side quests that sometimes took an hour or more to complete, and were quite in-depth. There were many choices to be made that would change all manner of outcomes in the game and would give different endings. Bioshock Infinite seems to give you the ILLUSION of choice during the first 1/3rd of the game and then everything is set on rails from there. As for side quests, there really are none other than quickly exploring a side building with under 3 rooms in it and a few cypher loot hunts. You get the same ending in Bioshock Infinite no matter what you do in the game.Second- Setting/Atmosphere: While the settings of the first two games are underwater and quite gloomy and atmospheric, even claustrophobic and frightening with sporradic placing of some enemies... Infinite is mostly in the open air and bright sun shine with open spaces, and what I call \"Arenas\" where you KNOW bad guys will be attacking you, so it has a completely different feel from the first two games, and just does not feel very... Bioshocky.Third- The Weapons... In The first two games the weapons were very steam punk like, and you could see the upgrades you bought as they were added to the weapons. Such as spinning gears on the shotgun or the extended capacity add-on sticking out the side of the revolver. I loved the design of the weapons in the first 2 Bioshock games. In Bioshock Infinite you get rather plain weapons, some of them feel like copies of other weapons you already get in the game with maybe some red paint on them or such... They get no visible upgrades either. Instead, the upgrades are in name and text only with no change to the weapons visually.Fourth- Ammo Types: There were DIFFERENT types of ammo in the first two Bioshock games: Armor Piercing, Exploding, Electric, and so on, with varying strategies to go along with nearly every enemy... Bioshock Infinite, none of that, just one type for each weapon and, to me, it felt like the basic enemies took a lot more hits to go down and ammo was much more scarce, especially near the end of the game. Pray and spray.Fifth- Player Engagement: Bioshock 1&2 were very engaging all throughout the game, always making you wonder what might happen next or when some enemy may pop out at you since enemies were not constrained to just appearing in wide open spaces. There was quite a bit of backtracking and revisiting old areas with new things unlocked. Much fun could be had while playing the game in a darkened room. With Bioshock Infinite it felt so.... FPS Typical... Enemies drop out from the sky, shoot em', clear this area, move on, clear next area, move on, with very little backtracking or encouraged exploring or random encounters.Sixth- Enemy AI/Character Design: This is where Bioshock Infinite FAILS MASSIVELY! In Bioshock 1&2 the enemies were downright scary in how creative they were, they would stalk you, or flank you to get you from behind, or would run away and hide at times, popping up in entirely different areas. They would look for you if you ran away or hid. Every fight was different. The enemies/splicers in the first two games all seemed to be different, unique, and quite memorable in their own ways. One thing Infinite gets right is the main story characters facial expressions, especially Elizabeth... If they had spent as much time working on the game as they did her expressions, this would have been a much better game. As for the AI in Bioshock Infinite the enemies just come at you in mindless waves as if this was a Serious Sam game, they don't hide, they don't stalk you or look for you... They all know where you are with their magic radar sense. So just lots of shooting at generic police, rebels, robots, and heavies that all stand out in the open waiting for your bullets and powers to splatter their faces. Or the opposite, friggin' stands right on top of you Zerg rush style. All while they shoot mindlessly at you or at the item you may be hiding behind while you are required to run around like a chicken with your head cut off. I really did not expect Bioshock Infinite to have AI that is this downright TERRIBLE after the amazing experience from the first two games.Seventh- Powers and Abilities: Those that have played Bioshock 1&2 know the massive amount of plasmids and abilities you could get and upgrade, you could play the game how you wanted, even as a stealthy character with some of the upgrades. In Bioshock Infinite it has been broken down into weapon upgrades, and I believe only 8 vigor abilities, with 4 clothing power up options. Infinite just feels \"Dumbed Down\" and over simplified from the previous games with NO STEALTH/invisibility this time. It has had most of the strategy taken out and just turned into a \"run and shoot\".Eighth- Graphics/immersion: The game is quite stunning graphically; in the first 1/3rd of the game it is engrossing and enjoyable... But... As the game moves on it feels like they were in a rush to reach the end so it is just not as immersive as the first two Bioshock games. The graphics from the first two Bioshock games were and are still amazing, especially when it comes to water effects. Infinite just did not feel \"on par\" with the previous games or even when comparing to some of the newer games out there. It does look good but not jaw dropping good. Though, in all honesty, I couldn't care less about graphics as some people are but it seems important to some.Ninth- Controls: I played the game for a short bit with keyboard and mouse and the controls were decently simple, typical FPS. Same for using the controller which I played the rest of the game with... Obviously the game feels better with a controller than the keyboard and mouse, since it was made for a controller.Tenth- The Writing/Story Telling: Bioshock 1&2 were absolute masterpieces in original Videogame writing and storytelling, fully fleshing out the world and characters and making it hard to guess what was coming next, while giving some rather hard choices at times that would change the game play and ending possibilities while in the end giving a good feeling of closure and satisfaction. Bioshock Infinite is more of a... Well... Without spoiling the story, as convoluted as it seems to become, look up the definition of \"String theory\" and the game may make more sense in the end. Otherwise the story of Bioshock Infinite may sail over the heads of certain gamers. Since there is only one ending for infinite, it just doesn't feel complete or like it would have made a difference any way you went.THE BOTTOM LINE TL;DR: Short Game... NO REPLAY VALUE! Horrible AI. Fun, but not very Bioshock feeling compared to previous games... It IS a fun FPS game on its own, but just didn't feel like Bioshock. Biosomething but not Shock in any way.RENT IT for a console system and play through it before you even THINK about buying it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Thought Provoking, Entertaining, and Fun!","reviewText":"Seamless blend of epic storytelling and FPS gameplay!Concept: 10/10Bioshock Infinite adds a whole new dimension to the Bioshock Universe, literally.  Bioshock Infinite introduces dimensional / time travel and explores a utopian US City that seceded from the Union and rose above the clouds.  The people of this city are extremely religious and blindly follow their leader, a self-proclaimed prophet named Comstock.  The gameplay is fairly linear like the other Bioshock games.  You must use special abilities called Vigors and an arsenal of weapons to battle your way through powerful enemies to rescue a mysterious girl named Elizabeth, who has the power to open rifts in space and time.Story: 10/10+The story is well told and very well acted.  It's the kind of alternate history / sci-fi story that makes you think.  The themes are about nationalism, hope, faith, and alternate universes.  You play as a former agent named Pinkerton DeWitt who is sent to a city in the clouds to rescue Elizabeth, a girl with mysterious powers.  She is held captive by the government and is under constant observation, so they can study her powers.  As the story develops, the bond between DeWitt and Elizabeth grows and builds throughout the story.Gameplay:  9/10The levels are a mix of fairly open ended spaces, and very linear room to room combat.  At any time, you can press UP on the D-Pad and an arrow will appear, showing you where you need to go.  There are plenty of places to explore and find extra gear, weapons, ammo, health, and salts, which power your special abilities called Vigors.  There are also vending machines where you can purchase Upgrades, and more Health and Ammo.  The path through Bioshock Infinite is heavily story based, so it's linear and it goes in one direction.Combat: 8/10Booker and Elizabeth team up to fight hordes of enemies.  Booker uses weapons and Vigors.  Elizabeth can pull things through dimensional rifts.  Health Power Ups, Money, Automated Machine Guns, etc.  Elizabeth is the ultimate support character!  You have Health and Shields, and your Shields regenerate.  If you die, you are resurrected in a nearby area and you can continue the fight with half of your health.  The enemies also get some health back too, so you need to earn your way through every battle.  The combat system really rewards aggressive play.  You're usually low on ammo, health, and Vigor, so you need to blast your way through the enemies to get more.  This isn't the type of game where you hide behind some cover, pop out, and shoot.  My only problem with the game is that the enemies can overrun you.  They don't recoil very long when they are hit, and if two of them flank you or attack from the front and the rear at the same time, you're pretty much dead.  They also fire a bit too rapidly, so if a rocket hits you and you stagger, the second rocket will also hit you and finish you off.  If you were a bit faster, or the enemies recoiled just a bit longer from being shot, this would seem more fair.  This is a fairly minor gripe and overall, the combat is fun.All of the Vigors involve dealing damage to enemies, making them fight on your side for a while, or laying traps.  The Vigors are great, but I just wish I could use them more often.  It's like being a powerful wizard, who can only cast 3-5 spells in a battle.Graphics: 10/10The graphics are excellent both from a technical and artistic standpoint.  Columbia, the Utopian City in the Clouds and every prop in it, looks great and contributes to the overall theme of the game.  The characters are stylized and look just a bit cartoonish, instead of hyper-realistic, and they animate very well.  The special effects and enemies also look great!  Elizabeth, your constant companion, is exceptionally well rendered and acted.Sound: 10/10The music, sound effects, and voice acting are all top notch.  The music takes you back to the early 1900's.  The sound effects punctuate the action.  The voice acting really makes you feel for the characters.Replay Value: OnceBecause this is a linear game with no multiplayer, the only thing you can do is play it again on a harder difficulty.  There are 4 total.  It should take about 12-15 hours to finish the campaign, depending on how much you explore.Maturity: TThere is a bit of animated violence, but nothing that the avid anime fan hasn't seen before.  There's no sex or nudity either.Overall:  10/10This is a GREAT GAME, and you don't have to play the other BioShocks to enjoy this one!Buy it if you love great storytelling.Buy it if you own the other BioShocks!Buy it if you like FPS with some strategy behind the fighting.Rent it if you have 12-15 hours to blow through the campaign.Avoid it if you need your FPS games to have multiplayer.Avoid it if you want an open world game.If you liked this game, definitely check out the other BioShocks.  If you like the tactical Combat, check out FarCry 3 or Deus Ex.  If you liked Elizabeth, check out Prince of Persia.  There's a great dynamic between the two characters in that game as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2013"}

Those games was pretty cool, but Left 4 dead was more of a arcade game and Dead rising feels like I was staring in a cartoon. I think Dead island dose a good job of mixing those two together. You can chop off limbs, drive, shoot, stab, craft and upgrade weapons , level up and even play co-play ( co-play is only over xbox live and system link.)I read some reviews of  people on amazon upset about there being no split screen. I Think its always smart to do some research before buying games, or anything you are going to buy. I knew there was no split screen before I brought the game from Doing my homework on the game first.Speaking of co-play yourself and 3 friends can complete the whole story together , with one of the 4 characters in the game. If you every played Borderlands the characters system is the same. You can pick Sam B a Tank use blunt weapons, Logan weapon throwing specialist( he is more of a all around guy), Purna you uses firrearms , and  Xian Mei she uses blades. This game is single player friendy but co=play is just a blast. The more buddies you have playing the game with you the harder the game gets. meaning more zombies will come after you and your team mates.Teammates can heal you and pick you up when your down.There is also some missions in this game build for co-play one mission has you filling up gas tanks why your teammates kill off the horde of infected running towards you. There are many other missions other like in the game.Crafting in the game is fun its just like fallout or dead rising .you find items around the island you go to the work bench to build the item or upgrade it.If you dont like crafting you can also buy the items from venders but they will cost a really steep price.Driving in this game okay you use the Rt to go forward LT to go backwards. I am not really use to the First person driving so still learning that.Killing zombies in this game is just awesome first like to say this game is a melee game first shooter last. grabbing a hammer and busting a zombie in the head feels so rewarding. The sound effects and the limb animation is great. There are over 1000 weapons in this game to find and kill zombies with.you also get guns but they are hard to find and buying them will put a hole in your wallet.each character also has a fury skill which is like their special attack . I been playing with Sam b he can knock down zombies with his bare hands and its just great fun to punch a zombie in the head and watch his brains splatter all over the place.StoryFirst thing everybody ask me is this game anything like the Trailer. Dose it have that omg that lil girl just die feeling. I would say no this game dose not remind you of that slow motion moving backward trailer. This game dose have a story but it reminds you of a B grade movie and that's a good thing. I don't want to give to much of the story away . But its nothing really special but still keeps you entertain . I mean what else could they do with a zombie story. your stuck on a island with the undead and your trying to escape.I will say  the character backgrounds stories take a back seat in the game, they really never talk about their past and it never really comes up. The characters are just more like classes then personality.This game do its fair share of bugs like all games do on release date. The game company has promise they will release a patch this week, Matter fact the steam copy of the game has already received a patch.If you don't want to take my word on how much fun this game is rent it first. This game is one of the few new games coming out without a online pass so try it out for yourself and tell me what you think.But please dont judge this game because of bugs or amazon sent you a bad copy of the game.And dont judge it because it has no split screen NO open world game has split screen why would you think a small developer team like Deep sliver game would?Boarderland had split screen but it wasn't really a open world it was closed in by load screensDead island is not closed in, the game is really huge and really open.Only time you will see load screens is when switching from the Island to the underground places.BTW its just not a island your on there is also a city and a jungle to explore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2011"}

Not much as to be said when it comes to the most populer and best selling game of all time.  The first game sold the Xbox and the second game was a huge seller for Xbox Live service and was still played through today.  Now Halo 3, the last game that follows now ledgedary Spartan Master Cheif.  And its a great game while being a little disapointing at the same time.The STORY.  The story starts off where Halo 2 badly left off.  Cheif returns to Earth in hopes to stop Truth from finding a activating the Arc to kill the Flood along with everything else.  Joining Cheif is the shuned Elite, the Abriter.  But don't worry this is the Cheif's story and the Abirter is left to tag along.Here you'll finish what Halo 2 started and left you off.  The campain mode is easy and if you played the other two games you need to up the level.  The game is action packed and doesn't slow down too often the score helps set the mood for the action on screen and really gets you pumped up.  The game will take roughly 8-15 hours depending on the level you play and/or if you play Co-Op.The GRAPHICS.  I have to point out the graphics of Halo 3.  They are not the best but not the worst.  We've seen better looking games in the past and future games look to trump this tenfold.  The lighting and most enviroments look good but like I said its not the best or what you might be expecting, but Halo wasn't never about graphics but its gameplay.The GAMEPLAY.  The gameplay has always been Halo's bread and butter.  Halo made the FPS cross over from the Keyboard and Mouse set up to the console controller and includes great vehicle control and combat and this game plays the same way.  Why fix it if it isn't broken?  And Bungie didn't change a thing.  They added a few new weapons and a few new vehicles and called it a day.The MULTIPLAYER.  This is where game shines.  Just like in Halo 2 the MP mode will be played 3 years from now.  All 11 maps have a great feel to them and are all diffrent.  The matchmaking system returns to put you in games with players of your skill type.  New modes like The Forge allows you to completly edit (not terrian) the layout of weapons, spawn points, etc. to create anything you want on the battle feild.  Here you can save it and upload it to Bungie.  The only downfall is the lack of options to search for custom and Forge games.  You must Invite friends only.  The same goes for the co-op mode.  The same was said about Halo 2 and Bungie did nothing to help this.Then you have the sweet Theatre mode.  Here the game saves all your progress and you can move the camera around, take pictures, and make small movies to share with your friends.  The only complaint is you can not rewind campian mode nor can you record any of it.  But that's just a small complaint.The END.  In the end Halo 3 is a must have for anyone who enjoys a good Multiplayer game along with anyone who enjoyed the other Halo offerings...I'm sure they already got their copies of the game.  Halo 3 will still be played years down the road and Master Chief will be looked upon now as a legendary video game personality.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2007"}

Or online games, never cared for those either, but this game has changed my mind and made me remember all those times playing similar games when I said I'd NEVER like a game like this.Why do I like Left 4 Dead when I've never liked a single other shooter? I don't know, really. I can't explain it, I just do. The game isn't very fun as a single player game, but hop online with some frineds and you'll have a blast mowing down Infected, trying to avoid Boomer puke, trying to maneuver around the witch without startling her, trying not to get lassoed by the tongue of a Smoker, and hoping your friends come to help you quickly when a Hunter has you pinned down and is ripping your entrails out.Sure, this game has limited maps, I'm hoping there'll be more to download for FREE in the future, but even as it is, with the Director AI placing enemies in different places everytime you play, you'll have fun playing these over and over. I don't think it'd be fun to play all day long every day, but since I got this I've been playing one map all the way through and the next day I'm always looking forward to meeting my buddys on X-Box live so we can play again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY77E","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Oh no, what happened?","reviewText":"I thought Crysis 2 was wonderful - it had all the elements of a fantastic game, not least of which was the amazing graphics. The multifaceted gameplay though, where you could stealth your way through or gun run, was also versatile and loads of fun whichever option you chose. The game offered the freedom to take your time, to explore and to play the game YOUR way.It was surprising then to start Crysis 3 off with an escort mission... and sadly an escort mission is pretty much the entire game. You know the drill, you follow an NPC as he rattles off cliched monologues and slowly opens doors for you. You progress at his pace and cannot continue until whatever the NPC is doing is complete. It doesn't help that Crysis 3's NPC is an obnoxious, profane cockney with no socially redeeming features. I despised this character from the outset and dearly wished for his rapid death. Even when he's merely barking orders at you from an earpiece he's an unwelcome element practically ruining the game.Unfortunately, a lot of the opening missions are set indoors running down corridors. Gone are the freedoms of an open space, at least initially. Sadly, even once you're outdoors there's no clear options. Want some hints from your HUD that clue you into the various paths? Tough - they're outta here. So instead you have football fields of open space and not much to do. Graphically, possibly the game's saving grace, is mostly limited to blue/gray wet areas. Where are the cities, the bright daylights and gorgeous vistas? There's only one or maybe two missions set outside during the day - the rest is a dark, dank disappointment.There's also boss battles which are reminiscent of Mario/Zelda games. Crysis 2 didn't have these. The final boss is a one hit and your dead affair and it doesn't checkpoint. So you're running in circles trapped in a confined area hoping not to get popped and have to start again. The Half Life styled vehicles and Starfox 64 missions are out of place too. Terrible.All in all I haven't been this disappointed in a sequel in a very long time. I'm tempted to give it one star, but it does have some good moments and the variety of weaponry are worth a mention.Do be prepared for a deviation in gameplay with this release and expect Call of Duty SP style linear progression. Crysis 3 is simply not for me and I recommend a rental first.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"Exercise for the mind","reviewText":"There are so many puzzle and mind-exercise games available on the DS now it's difficult to keep track of them all, but Nintendo's Brain Age, despite being one of the DS's first titles, continues to stand out.  The concept is very simple--Brain Age includes many activities designed to stimulate blood flow in the brain and make you think, giving your brain the \"exercise\" it needs to remain healthy.  It also includes Sudoku.Audience:  This game has appeal for a wide range of people.  It is great for elderly folks wanting to keep their mind active and sharp, good for kids who can learn while playing a video game (although Big Brain Academy might be more fun for that demographic), and excellent for anyone in between who has a few minutes each day to challenge themselves mentally and maybe relieve a little tension from the day.  Because most of the activities are short, the game can be picked up for a few minutes at a time, and would be ideal for a commute on public transportation.Graphics:  Not much to say here.  It's a puzzle game, so the graphics don't need to be lifelike or real, but they're good enough to be able to enjoy the game.Gameplay:  The game revolves around a daily test you can take to determine the \"age\" of your brain.  While this doesn't really make sense (for example, younger children who are just learning math and other skills will have a very high age at first), it doesn't really matter to me because I can see by the graph of my \"age\" whether I'm improving.  There is also a practice training mode where you can practice several of the activities.  There are unlockable games as well, and a separate mode to play Sudoku (Sudoku has various difficulty setting available).Control:  This is the game's major drawback for me.  While navigating the game using the stylus is simple and intuitive the gameplay has two drawbacks dealing with the controls (I'm including this under controls even though they're not technically problems with button setup, etc).  Both have to do with the game failing to recognize an answer, either through the voice recognition feature or while writing a number or letter, and resulting in some frustration on the part of the user.  The game, for example, does not recognize some words, especially the word \"blue\" (in the color activity).  I also have trouble with the game not recognizing some letters in words I write or in reading the wrong number in the math games.  This is not a matter of penmanship--everyone I know who has played this game experiences the same thing.  People who find themselves easily frustrated may find this to be a dealbreaker--for me, it's irritating but not something that makes me detracts TOO much from the overall enjoyability of the game.Challenge:  The activities are plenty challenging, and even if you attain the ideal brain age of 20 the game tracks your personal best scores and you can work on improving them.  You can also see how other people who have profiles on the same cartridge have done.Multiplayer: while there is a multiplayer option (using 1 cartridge--always a plus), gameplay is limited to only a couple of the activities in the full game.  Multiplayer options fall short in my opinion.Overall this is a great game, and worth the twenty or so dollars it costs (at the time of this writing).  With all the mindless games available these days its nice to get something to keep your brain vibrant and active, and the fact that you can pick it up for 10 or 15 minutes at a time is a major plus.  I'd include this game in my list of DS titles worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000EGELP0","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Use your brain","reviewText":"I'm not entirely sure whether I can call a game like Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day a video game. Its graphics are hardly groundbreaking, its audios are almost monotonous, and its core gameplay involves reading aloud, counting syllables and solving mathematical problems. Surely, that's not what video gaming is all about, is it? Well, not if you hail from the Nintendo school of gaming, no. As mundane as Brain Age sounds, it's actually strangely addictive, and once you begin your journey of improving your brain age, you'll find yourself deeply immersed in the various activities aimed at giving your brain a daily workout.The primary objective of Brain Age is to \"exercise your brain\". This is done through doing activities that are designed to stimulate your prefrontal cortex, which is the part of your brain that influences how you apply what you've learnt (whatever). It's believed that doing these activities on a regular basis will have a positive effect on your brain. Whether or not this holds any truth, I'm not sure. But with 15 activities to choose from, at least the game can keep you occupied for quite a while, even though some of these activities are less desirable to do than others.Some of these activities include a calculation game, which puts you through a series of simple mathematical problems. 2+6, anyone? Or 8x7, for that matter? Well, you get the picture. The idea is basically to get the brain to start thinking quickly with a succession of simple questions, instead of forcing the player to spend too much time dwelling on one. There're different variations of this calculation module, but the underlying gameplay doesn't divert from the idea of rapidly solving a problem.Reading aloud is another activity in Brain Age. Obviously, this makes use of the DS' mic, and it basically requires you to read through an article as quickly as possible. While you may have problems pronouncing words like \"epoch\", you can actually breeze through this activity by simply bulldozing through without pronouncing the words properly. Just remember to wipe the saliva off your DS screens. Syllables counting is another mini-game on Brain Age. This one requires you to count the number of syllables in a short sentence, and then write the answer down on the touch screen. If you're not exactly sure about what is a \"syllable\", just remember that the word \"syllable\" itself has three syllables, and you should be fine.Of course, there're more to just calculation, reading aloud, or counting syllables in Brain Age, but as you can see, the activities in the game are not exactly the \"saving the world from an evil force\" kind. Yet, the game's appeal comes in the form of its simplicity. At times, when playing this game, I feel like I'm doing one of those online IQ tests, and the eagerness to score well is impetus enough for me to keep going despite the dryness of the questions. This basically sums up the charm of Brain Age.To spice things up a little, Brain Age also included a substantial amount of Sudoku puzzles. Now, if you can believe my wife, Sudoku is the best thing on Earth since sliced bread. The popularity of this grid-based puzzle game is immense, and it's not surprising to see it being included in the game. As with the usual Sudoku books, the Sudoku puzzles in Brain Age are sorted according to difficulty. The easy ones are, well, pretty easy to solve, while the advanced ones require more logical thinking. Anyhow, Brain Age contains more than 100 Sudoku puzzles, which should keep fans of Sudoku occupied for quite some time. Having Sudoku as one of the 15 activities in Brain Age basically provides additional value for an already value-for-money budget game.And, to top it up, Brain Age also has a multiplayer mode, which allows you to host up to an amazing 15 players with one cartridge. Unfortunately, the only playable activity in this mode is the calculation module, which lets you take on others in 30 mathematics questions. This gets old really quickly. It'd be fun if you can challenge your friends to a game of Sudoku (duh!), really.Brain Age also requires a unique way of playing. You play it with the DS being held vertically, much like reading a book, with the touch screen on the right. The concept is to recreate the scenario of solving puzzles in a puzzle book, and to a certain extent, this blends in very nicely with the objective of the game. And, true to the game's out-of-the-box nature, Brain Age is played entirely with the DS' features. That is, via the touch screen and the mic. These make the game more \"book-like\" than the usual DS games. The game also caters to left-handers. If you're a leftie like me, simply tell the game so, and you can turn the DS \"the other way round\" so that the touch screen switches to the left. This is a nice touch, or the game may just lose a lot of potential buyers!The problem with how the game plays, however, lies in the sensitivity of the touch screen and the mic. Somehow, it seems to have problem registering my pronunciation of \"black\", and doesn't really recognize my \"8\" on the touch screen properly. As a result, I've an initial brain age of 76 (!) because of unnecessary errors. It appears that players will need to adapt to how the game receives input to do well in their own results. This is not exactly a big issue, but it could be frustrating when you're trying to beat a certain timing, only to be let down by your poor handwriting or diction.In conclusion, Brain Age is a very different sort of game, even by the DS' selection of quirky titles. It may not boast the usual features that sell a video game, but in their place, we've something that is simple, unassuming, and ultimately very addictive. Moreover, the game is supposed to improve the functionality of your brain, so what's there to lose? Brain Age is highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2006"}

For the most part you can think of it as a MW2 expansion.What's different? Well I believe Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games took all the negative feedback from both MW2, and Black OPS, and tried to \"fix\" them in this game.~Changes- Quickscoping returns (sniper favorite)- Grenade Launchers, and Rocket Launchers are SEVERELY reduced in damage from MW2- No end game killsteaks \"nuke\"- Smaller \"less open\" Maps- No Stopping Power - Lightweight - or Danger Close (no more running around super fast knifing everyone)- More Balanced killsteaks (yet they still messed up read further)- Added in \"Survival Mode\" like Black Ops Zombies but much less enjoyable.- New Killsteaks split into Assault, Support, and Specialist)- Gun level up feature- theater mode (like black ops)~POSITIVES-fast, fluid 60FPS Gameplay-Snipers are perfected (if you liked sniping in any cod, you'll like this game)-Instant matchmaking, and fairly good connections. (not much lag)-Some of the killsteaks are very fun (juggernaunt, osprey gunners, reapers, assault drones)-Survival Mode is fun for a while, and enjoyable with a friend-Cheaters/Boosters are being dealt with, so no more boosting lobbys.~Negatives-Not very much \"new content\" you'll feel like you are playing MW2 all over again-Campaign feels exactly the same as Modern Warfare 2. I've played a few levels, and was bored.-Unbalanced weapons (some weapons and classes are overpowered compared to other weapons, Type 95, PP90M1, Striker)-Feels like MW2 and Black Ops, so it lacks replayability if you've already played previous cods.and what I dislike the most ->-Support Killstreaks was a HORRIBLE idea, your killsteak doesn't reset when you die so even the worst players will be calling in uav's, and stealth bombers every game killing you over, and over, and over...~FUNThis is where it'll vary from player to player. If you are GOOD at COD you will definitely enjoy this game more than someone who isn't very good. If you are not good at first person shooters, you will likely hate this game.Also, keep in mind this game is almost an exact copy of MW2 with parts of Black OPS included, if you liked those games, you'll likely end up enjoying this one as well.~Pro Tip (for anyone seeking an early advantage)Use Hardline PRO (killsteaks require 1 less death, and every 2 assists = kill)Then use assault strike package - UAV, Care Package, Predator MissileYou will be gettting a killsteak every 2 kills, 3 kills, 4 kills, and then it will repeat at 6kills, 7 kills, 8 kills, and so on. Easiest way to keep a UAV up on your team at all times.~Final ReviewMW3 isn't much different from MW2. If you still think MW2 is fun, then this game is for you. If you lost interest, or you are a bit tired of MW2, or Black OPS, or just not good at shooters, then stay away from MW3. it's not anything different, more of an expansion pack than anything.

The one biggest hoorah I also give the game other than the great graphics, levels, power-ups, and music is the ability to have multi-players during levels instead of having to wait your turn for one of the players to die on a level to get your turn to play, also a great new move is different bosses for every level end to defeat instead of having to fireball Bowser over and over again like the previous earlier Mario Brother games to rescue the princess.  The graphics again are incredible for the wii with the added bonus for old time players to use the remote like the stardard 8-bit Nintendo controllers of yesteryear, you can use the nunchuck to move your player around as well but it brings back a bit of nostalgic quality using the remote as mentioned previously. There are two other min-games on the disk one is free for all where you and the other players can play any course with your friends but is not part of the overall story, the next id coin battle where you and the other players compete with each other to collect as many coins before reaching the end of the course and whoever has the most coins wins.  So for longtime fans of the Mario universe here's a great new release for the Wii well worth getting and for any new timers who(I'd Be amazed if they haven't played Mario Brothers) check it out either online or at the Nintendo Wii site you might just be shocked at how fun and entertaining it is...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

And while the difficulty has been slightly intensified, the fun factor has as well; thanks mostly in part to perfected controls and the multiplayer addition. If you find the game too advanced in later levels to be much fun to play by yourself, it's still fun to get a few friends together and laugh about what a mess it is trying to all make it through a single level without losing all of your lives. The ability to drop in and out at will is splendid as well. The game has one of the best ending boss battles to be found in any Mario game. And the large coin collecting challenges which earn you access to bonus stages will keep you playing long after you've beaten the game. This game is a definite throwback to the golden days of early gaming; updated with some clever control schemes, beautiful landscapes and an excellent soundtrack serving as icing on this cake.

{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"NOT a Gears of War","reviewText":"A lot of people have been bashing this game saying it is a Gears of War clone. To set things straight, it was Shinji Mikami, director of Vanquish and Resident Evil 4, established third person shooter genre. While Gears of War are great games, but Vanquish is a different type of game in league of its own. After finishing the story on HARD difficulty and attempting couple of challenge rooms (you unlock by finishing campaign chapters), here is what I thought.****************PROS*****************REVOLUTIONARY ACTION-PACKED GAMEPLAY: While majority of people will confuse this game with Gears clone, this game promotes you to do exactly the opposite of what is required in Gears. Gears of War promotes and rewards you cover and shoot type of gameplay. Now if you try really hard, you can probably get through this game using cover and shoot strategy, but chances are by staying in cover long enough, you will probably gate killed by either melee attacks of agile enemies, by mega lazer that bosses fire or simply by homing missiles. To get an edge over the enemies in this game, you have to be daring. You have to do crazy actions such as use your boosters, kick them on the face while jumping in the air, while in air slow down time and shoot the enemies around you. COOL, RIGHT? Honestly, the gameplay, rocket boosters, crazy melees, freeze time and shoot are BEST PART OF THIS GAME.UPGRADE REWARD SYSTEM: Just like fasted pace gameplay, this is also something new and unique in this game. All of the weapons you get are upgradable. But to upgrade them you have to be strategic. There are two ways you will find upgrades for the weapons. One is simply by destroying enemies (or rather destroying multiple enemies in stylish manner). Other is by not using that weapon and them picking up one more of that weapon from destroyed enemies or from crate supplies which are found like every 7-10 minutes. This prevents you from overusing one weapon and exploring different weapons found in the game. Also, reckless shooting or staying in cover for too long will get you killed. If you get killed enough times (by playing recklessly), your weapons will be downgraded.JOYS OF EXPERIMENTATION: So on one hand you have your abilities and on other hand you have at least 8 different types of weapons (maximally 4 at a time). The gameplay truly encourages you to experiment with them. I.e. use assult rifle and take out legs of big robot while you are in cover, jump out of the cover and slow down time, quickly take out the hands of the robot, boost your thrusters get close to the robot and finally melee its head off. LOVE IT JUST FREAKING LOVE IT.YOUR SUIT, WEAPONS, ENVIRONMENTS AND ART: To me this is the coolest thing in this game. Your suit and weapons are created from \"nucleus\". So you will see each time the character relaxes, the helmet will be half gone and when you change weapons, one weapon will turn into another. Words simply can't describe it. Furthermore, depiction of near robotic future of America and designs of Marines and their commander Burns (with all the armor and heavy guns) is also pretty technical and to the details. I like it a lot.GREAT ENEMY A.I.: I loved the A.I. in this game. YOU CAN'T HIDE. The enemies and bosses will come and get you. Even the weakest enemies have deadliest melee attacks. While I played it on hard mode, even on normal mode, enemies can kill you with ONE HIT KILL. Don't worry though. This is no Demons Soul. There are frequent checkpoints in the game. And the opposite is also true. You can kill many of the enemies with one hit kill assuming you do things the right way. Even the bosses you may find difficult at first have weaknesses. You just have to experiment enough and find out how. Love how this game push you to try new things.CHALLENGING BOSSES: There 6-8 different types of bosses (not including few main bosses) in the game that you may encounter more than one time. Some of these bosses are very unique. While you can shoot them over and over again and kill them, it will take long and chances are some of these bosses will kill you with one hit kill. To beat these bosses you will truly have to master your skills (dodging, thrusting, slowing time etc.) Again love how this game pushes you to experiment and be tactical.DECENT STORY: While it is not one of the best, the story still makes sense and has certain degree of suspense and mystery to it. English voice acting, dialogues and character facial expressions are pretty good. I won't spoil the story, but if you follow politics (more importantly IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN), you will enjoy the depiction of Hilary Clinton look a like depiction of US president.CHALLENGE ROOMS: After finishing each chapter of the game, you will unlock Challenge rooms (equivalent to Horde Mode in other games). As stated above, you have lots of abilities and weapons and campaign is rather fast. So challenge rooms are one place you can experiment as much as you want with your weapons and abilities, create new moves and punish enemies. Now don't get me wrong that is not the only purpose of Challenge rooms. As their name states, it will be a true \"challenge\" to finish these challenge room levels as you will have one after another hordes of enemies attacking you from all the direction. These challenge room truly adds to the replayability of the game.VARIETY IN MELEE: Equipping different weapons will have your character do different melee attacks. All of them are unique and look pretty cool looking. Some of them are quite devastating. However, there is also downside to the melees. See Cons. section.***************CONS.******************RELATIVELY SHORT CAMPAIGN AND NO MULTIPLAYER: I know these days most games are 8-10hrs long, but I wish the campaign was longer. While multiplayer and co-op is not a requirement for this type of games, I truly wish it had it. It feels like one of the games that is designed for co-op. Never the less, it has challenge rooms, so it does add longetivity of the game. Plus, if you get hold of the action, I know you will play it more than once.UNIQUE MELEE: Melee attacks in this game are SUPER AWESOME. Only drawback is they are quite tactical. Using them will deal great damage to enemies, but also leave you vulnerable to enemy attack if you don't kill them off with melee or melee weapon combo. I truly wish you don't have to be so tactical when using melee and could use it as much as you want.*********CONCLUSION******************This is a very unique game and certainly not a clone of Gears of War (which is also a great game). If you like crazy fast-paced action mixed with futuristic weapons this is a game for you. Any body who is a fan of action adventure and shooter games such as Resident Evil 4, Gears of War and even Devil May Cry should definitely this a try. THIS GAME IS UNLIKE ANYTHING OTHER YOU HAVE PLAYED. Trust me on that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

I bought this game on PS3 so I can be used to the controls as I've never really played The Show before. The PS3 version came out a month before this and it looked incredible but the PS4 version is truly next-generation Graphics and it looks amazing.Now if you're new gamer to the series and baseball in general you can basically play with the simple control layout (When you first start the game you can choose simple controls or you can adjust it in the options menu) which is simply pressing the X button to swing and then also pitch. Because I'm a disabled gamer and I play with my face (can't use my hands or fingers) it is what I use and it's quite effective & fun. My first full game I threw a one hitter with Jon Lester it was super fun. Also if your new person in the series the home run Derby is a great experience also. You play against random people on the Internet or your friends in a head-to-head home run Derby. My first home run Derby I only hit four home runs then my next one I hit almost twenty.Now I've never try the advanced control but with my disability I would not be able do it. But if you're somebody good like more aggressive control over the players on the field the options are totally there.I was always impressed by the PS3 graphics for the show but seeing the dense in the Fenway wall and the epic beards on players. It really is amazing and this is just a glimpse of what this next generation of consoles is going to provide us with as to eye candy.And the crowds they look lifelike.  The PS4 version allows; I believe for 10 times the individual fans over the PS3 version and it really adds to the immersion of being a ballpark. If the little subtleties like this that make this game a must buy for any real baseball fan. And again if you're somebody who's new to baseball I think you can jump into this and you won't be too overwhelmed.A few other cool things you may not know. With this version of the show all your saved game data will be accessible by any versions you get later on. Saw your progress will transfer from game to game. Also you can update current rosters and I believe you can even play current games a.k.a. I can play with the Red Sox verse whoever they're really playing this week.To me that is a great feature and really adds to the feeling of the show.Will I hope this helps thank you for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2014"}

You can also hook up a USB flash drive to it and look at pictures or listen to mp3 and some videos. Just think of it as a powerful portable computer.It is also able to connect to a wireless router. Make things more convenient if you have a wireless router (which I don't).Anyway, I bought this PS3 in October 2008 and been using it almost every day. So far, no problems. By the way, you may want to keep the system in a well ventilated area. If you put it inside a TV shelf, make sure you keep the doors open when you are using it. Like all other electronics, they do generate heat.Some fine prints you may want to know about this particular PS3 80gb system: IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PS2 GAMES. I think it is compatible with ps1 games, but it cleary states its not compatible with PS2. I don't own any previous PS games, so it doesn't matter to me.By the way, I've been watching many blu-rays in the past few weeks, and I'm a bit disappointed. With a DVD, the picture takes up the whole screen. With blu-ray, there's a top and bottom black bar, similar to a Widescreen DVD.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"AF \"Whigs\"","summary":"Lots of fun!","reviewText":"I'll try to keep this short.  I've been a gamer for 25+ years.  I like all sorts of games.  The Wii is by far the best console for family games ever made.  My son and I can find plenty of games to agree on - the Lego games are fantastic co-op play for 2 people - and we can find things that my wife and daughter even want to play on occasion.I'll say this - there are plenty of \"hardcore\" gamers, including much of the gaming press, who dismiss the Wii because the graphics are less sophisticated.  Yes, it's underpowered, but graphics do not make a game.  Plus there is a ton of that Nintendo Magic to be found - Mario Galaxy 1 & 2 (any of the Mario games, really), the Zelda games, Mario Kart, Metroid, etc.  Lots and lots of great stuff.  And plenty of 3rd party supports.  Just read reviews or rent before you buy.  There is a ton of shovel-ware - but that's true of all systems.And here's something else I love - games on actual game discs.  The Xbox 360 and PS3 do have game discs, but they also have a lot of downloadable content (including bug fixes - ugh), which means that you're paying $60 for the game plus...how much more?  I like things to be simple - sell me a game and don't try to nickle and dime me.  I'm not interested.  This is of course an oversimplification of things, but it's how videogames are going - soon it will be the nonsense like Diablo III where you can't even play the single player game without logging into the publisher's servers.But I digress.  We've had our Wii for 3-4 years now, and we still have fun with it.  It's one of my favorite systems ever (my favorite being Sega Dreamcast), the motion controls are cool when they're utilized properly by developers (Pro Evolution Soccer on Wii is probably the greatest sports game ever made).  The way I see it, Wii is all about fun and less about trying to impress people with fancy window dressing that ultimately doesn't mean anything.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"Reasonably Good","reviewText":"I can tell you right now, this game will not live up to the hype.  It cannot possibly live to the hype.  The hype suggests that the game should arrive with sexual favors and pudding as a feature, and no game is as good as the reviewers would have you believe Bioshock is.  Surprise, surprise - the game has a number of issues that keep it from being the transcendental achievement the press want it to be, but that doesn't stop it from being a very solid game, worth your $60 investment.Let's start with the basics.  This is ostensibly a first person shooter, in the family of Halo, but owing a little bit more to Oblivion and Deus Ex so far as implementation goes.  Or F.E.A.R., I guess, though that one had multiplayer.  Which, shock of shocks, is one of the major knocks on the game.  This game was never designed or balanced for multiplayer use, and, as such, there's no multiplayer.  No deathmatch, no leaderboards, no team sports, no cooperative.  To preserve the atmosphere of the game and to produce a better single-player title, the multiplayer was never intended to happen.  If you cannot tolerate a game without multiplayer (I personally don't see how anybody could tolerate one, as I agree with Yahtzee!'s assessment of the Xbox Live community in general), then this game is not for you.As far as the actual gameplay goes, a great amount of puffery and chest-beating has been made with respect to the RPG aspect, but I honestly don't see it here.  There isn't really any kind of character development or progression - the plasmids are merely guns that work with your left hand and don't have a trigger, and the tonics function basically like equip-able items in other games - and, overall, you don't get the RPG \"feel\" from this game.  The feel is, more than anything, reminiscent of Doom 3 (to which it has been compared), with a dark, moody setting and some very cleverly disguised monster closeting (i.e. instead of just popping out of the wall, some monsters will walk into a room behind you after you go looking for something and start playing around in the water).I'll admit it - after about half of the game, I was pretty bored.  You run through the stock of enemies (who don't behave in nearly as intelligent a fashion as implied) pretty early on and most of the game is spent shooting the same types of critters with the same set of voices and the same general behaviors.  While the environment is constantly interesting to poke around in, the adversaries are lamentably not.  Hacking also plays a major role in the game, which would be great if the mini-game didn't 1) arbitrarily decide that you just plain lose sometimes; and 2) take thirty seconds to play through on its easiest difficulty.  While you can work your way up to not having to hack a couple of common targets, you'll be playing Pipe Dream right up through the end of the game.  Pretty tedious.So what's so good about the game?  Well, for starters, it's a shooter I finished, which is saying something, because I become terminally bored with just about any of them after about the halfway point, for mostly the same reasons as those I've listed here.  This one kept my attention all the way through to the end.  The game isn't overly long (a problem many games have - sixty hours is not just right; it is far too much for an old man like me with a job and a house and a personal life), which is a plus for me.  The voice acting is the best I've personally ever heard in a video game - so good that you don't notice that it's voice acting in most cases.  The artistic direction is pretty good as well, capturing some of the sixties architecture.With respect to the source material and authenticity, there's some quibbles to be had.  The guns and ammunition you find are distinctly more 1920s than 1950s, the music is mostly big band and crooners, and while the game might be considered reminiscent of Objectivism, the philosophy is way, way too far off to be considered any kind of a critique, or even a reasonable examination.  The Atlas Shrugged vibe is, however, carried off with aplomb, for which the art director in particular deserves some praise.This is a pretty great game.  I played it, finished it, and am wondering whether it would be worth it (news flash - it won't) to go back through on Hard to get the final achievement I'm lacking.  It's worth anybody's $60.  I wouldn't pronounce it the game of the year at this point, with Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed and Rock Band and Halo 3 and any number of other AAA titles due out, but it's a good game, and a good use of the medium to turn a shooter into something other than a twitchy-flinchy-shooty-bangy-kill-a-thon and still be effective and straight-faced about it.  Any game that can stir a moral reaction in its audience through its content and story is pretty solid (and you will have a moral reaction to the Little Sisters and what goes on in Rapture).  I wouldn't call it art, but it's some great entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2007"}

If you like post-apocalyptic games, western rpgs, and/or sandbox style games you need to own this. If your looking for a true sequel to the original Fallouts then yes you will be dissapointed; this game is not turn based. Judge it on its own merits and prepare for months of gaming delight. My only complaint is combat out of VATS is a tad bit clunky, specially coming from shooters but after a few hours you adapt and its not a big deal. Also have to watch out for important wandering NPCs getting their head blown off, but this could also be seen as realism and a variable for multiple playthroughs.And be sure to do a full install, it really helps with load times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2009"}

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"Good Game With Flaws","reviewText":"I was worried when this game came closer to release. I got even more worried once the reviews started rolling in. Still, I went ahead and bought it.The whole Sonic in 3D problem seems to never go away. There have been plenty of chances for Sonic Team to get it right, but for some reason they always make major missteps.I will say, though, this is a very promising step forward.The plus side, this isn't a port of the Sonic games from PS3 and Xbox 360, which was the original plan. I think everyone can be grateful of that.The entire play mechanic has Sonic running down a predetermined course. You tilt the Wiimote to steer, pretty much in the same way as Excite Truck. The 2 button makes you jump, the 1 button makes you stop.One of the most enjoyable control elements is the homing attack, which you perform by jumping into the air, waiting for the enemy lock on to activate, and then shaking the controller. This causes Sonic to blast forward and slam into his opponent. This definitely takes some getting used to, as a mistimed jump will do nothing but send you leaping into the arms of your enemy, causing you to lose rings.This brings up one of the shortcomings of this game. Anything but a quick small jump causes Sonic to stop and charge up. This takes away from the whole \"breakneck speed\" feel of the 2D Sonic games. You should be able to charge your jump while running.Also, the amount of time it takes Sonic to get to full speed is far too long. When you get hit or run into an obstacle, the energy gets completely sucked out of the moment as you have to wait to build up a full head of steam to be on your way again. In missions where you have to finish in a certain time limit, this can be more than aggravating.I don't mind the storyline. As a matter of fact, I think it's a nice change of pace. The other characters make cameo appearances, which I'm very much in favor of. I don't want to have to punch, fly over, or shoot anything in a Sonic game. I want to get going as fast as I can and just let my reflexes take over.You will need to get used to the camera, though, which is very different in terms of platforming games. There is no player control to it, and the developers have set it up to have an almost cinematic feel. There were a couple of times where I thought I was watching a brief cut-scene only to realize I still had control of the action. Once you get used to it, though, it's not too bad.I'm looking at Sonic and the Secret Rings as Sonic Teams first step towards righting the capsized ship. Future games need to utilize what this game has done right and work to correct the flaws. All in all, I'm not upset with my purchase.I will say this, though- I docked a point on the overall rating because, damnit, I'M TIRED OF WII TITLES HAVING STUPID PARTY GAMES! GIVE IT UP, ALREADY! If I want party games, I'll play Warioware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2007"}

Smith \"otherthani\"","summary":"Single Player Campaign Reviewed","reviewText":"Call of Duty: World at WarI have just completed the single player campaign, and aside from some minor flaws, I found the game extremely enjoyable.Call of Duty goes back to the roots of the franchise in a WWII setting. As expected from a COD game, the battles are extremely intense and the AI will continue to challenge you. However, there is really not much new here. If you have played other COD games, youve played this one. This game is COD 4 in a WWII setting.The US battles -vs- the Japanese are epic in scale and tremendously fast paced. There is alot of head on fighting (lead the charge).The Soviet Union battles -vs- the Germans feel different (as they should). They are a little more stealthy and are more about ambushing the enemy. This in itself adds its own kind of intensity as you are always feeling outnumbered and outgunned.This is not a graphically superior game, but nor is it inferrior. The sound is well done (however I did have to turn my sub up for additional bass) and the musical score can make you feel like your in a movie. The weapons are pretty standard, however a flamethrower was added to clear out trenches (very fun) and taking out an entire enemy squad with a heavy machine gun can be quite satisfying.This game is extremely linear and 90% of your path is pretty much set for you. This doesnt necissarily make it a bad single player experience, however its a bit perplexing with the improvements made to the genre where choices are becomming more abundant in the FPS games. It can also be a bit frustrating when you would like the option to flank, but your stopped by a fence or hill that you know you could get to in the \"real world\".Im a little surprised by some of the negative feedback this game has received. Some of it comes from the multiplayer community (which I cannot speak for), but the majority seems to be coming from installation/crashing issues... which generally comes from the necessity to update drivers with new games (which everyone should be doing when any new game comes out anyway). I had no such issues with this game.All in all I had a great time with this game. I absulutely do not regret my purchase. I was a bit disappointed with the linear gameplay, but what this game lacks in decision making, it wholely makes up in intensity and immersion of the player. If you are ok with that you should pick up this game. Keep in mind, I have only played the single player and have not tried the multiplayer modes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

They both said that I should  get a PS3 because its controller is better suited for a woman with small hands. So I went ahead and purchased a PS3 ( and also because they have more exclusive titles).Anyway, my six-year-old nephew (who resides with me) has been wanting to play Minecraft for nearly a year. Since it's exclusive on the Xbox, I went ahead and bought the console, all the while thinking, \"How am I going to play any game using the Xbox controller?\" I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the controller fits beautifully in my hands (and I have small hands). I actually prefer it to the PS3.My six-year-old nephew is a gamer and I have been trying to persuade him into using the right analog stick on the PS3 for an entire year. He just couldn't get the hang of it. So, within a week of purchasing Minecraft on the Xbox, he began using the right analog stick (on his own) and exclaimed to me that it's easier to play this way. The placement of the analog sticks is better than the PS3. I asked my nephew which controller he prefers (and he loves playing on the PS3) and he said the Xbox controller.I have two teeny tiny cons: Firstly, like the Wiimote, the Xbox controller uses AA batteries instead of charging it using a USB cable. That said, I've played over 25 hours on the Xbox controller and I still haven't changed the batteries. Secondly, the D-Pad (while in comparison to the PS3) isn't as good and precise.That said, I love this controller and I recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000JHMJDA","description":"Need for Speed Carbon PS3","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"A fun arcade racer","reviewText":"Need for Speed Carbon is a decent racing game for the PS3.  The graphics is good but nothing to get overly excited about.  The framerate is consistently high, which is great when you are driving at over 120 mph.  (I play it in 1080i mode on my LCD TV.)  The career mode has some sort of storyline, but it's complicated and I just skipped over the poorly delivered dialogs.The game is an arcade racer, which means its car handling physics is not very realistic.  A number of real-world nameplates are represented, and each does have its own \"feel,\" but the designers and developers made no attempt at making them feel real.  (The opposite of this approach is, of course, the venerable Gran Turismo series.)  The best thing about an arcade racer like this is the driving is very forgiving.  You can corner easily at over 90 mph, something you'll never do in Gran Turismo.  You can also turn off car damage and smash into everything and anything -- cop cars, oncoming traffic, etc. -- destroy them yet sustain no damage.  Because the framerate is really good, when you use the bumper or dash view and drive above 120 mph on an HDTV, you can really feel the rush.The career mode has you race to win over territories.  You must place no. 1 in each race to win.  After a while, the races do get repetitive, as do the cat-and-mouse chases with the cops.  The city in the game, which seems to be modeled after L.A., is not very big, so after half an hour or so you'll have travelled on all its streets and highways.  I wish EA had included a more expansive setting.In short, this is a fun game and makes a great rental.  It's too expensive as a purchase, and its limited variety of play makes the purchase a poor value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2007"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"Meet the Next Next-Gen","reviewText":"I've had my PS3 for years now, and I have to say that this console really did run its full life span, providing me a lot of fun.  Initial PS3 games that I'd played weren't particularly stunning, but eventually the titles justified the hardware and I don't regret the high price ticket (for the time!) one bit.If I had to compare the PS3 to the XBox 360, I'd say the beauty of it is that it doesn't brick itself with a Red Ring of Death.  If I had to compare it to the Wii, I'd point out that it's far more of a media entertainment device.  I'd originally written that backwards compatibility hasn't been a problem for me, but you should be aware that most every other models (apparently including this one) are NOT backwards-compatible with older games.  This was a huge disappointment for many PS3 fans because compatibility was promised and then later taken away.Apart from that, the only bad things I've encountered are that the Sixaxis controller's \"tilt\" functionality (slightly similar to the Wii's ability to physically move the controller in the air to play a game) is very shaky:  it's difficult to control.  Also, the fans on the PS3 are extremely loud, and run constantly:  even playing a movie will create the roar of the unit trying to keep itself cool.  I keep my PS3 away from dust and clean it regularly, but it still seems to need to run loud.  Later models address the problem better--the fans are quieter and the heat builds up less often, so they don't have to run as much.For years the PS3 was our workhorse:  not just for gaming, but streaming music and video across my home network, watching video on Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, or just popping in a Blu-Ray or a DVD.  It's gone from tube television to flat-panel, from tinny TV speakers to 5.1 on a home theater receiver, and I still love the way it works today.I look forward to the PS4, but still will be playing my PS3 for years to come--it has been an excellent system in many ways.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Der","summary":"Just below average game","reviewText":"This game just does too much that players don't know what to make of it. As you may already know there are 3 different stories for this game. 4 stories if you do count Ada Wong story. Anyways, every story is different from each other in some ways. For example, when you play Jake's story, you will find yourself doing a whole lot of chase scenes and action commands more over than any other story. For Leon's story is more slower peace and a bit more old school scary feeling to it. For Chris's story, you get an action pack non-stop military story. This game has it all, but way too much of it and beyond that.I found this game has VERY BAD CAMERA. You are trying to play the game and suddenly the game takes the camera and points you to what it wants you to see. You might be wanting to doing something else and don't want to do that just yet, but nope. The game doesn't care about what you think and will force you to see what you want. You can't even move the camera anymore and if you were looking with it at somewhere else you won't even see what the game wanted you to see all together.People that play shooter games all the time, will feel quite use to the controls and won't have a problem with it at all. But, for me, I had to get used to them. I don't play shooters that much and I didn't like to move the camera myself. I liked the controls from RE5 much more than this game!The game play is okay, once you beat the stories, you can go back and play them again and again to get the stuff you miss...but maybe you don't want to do that because it takes quite some time to finish each story. 5 chapters in each story. One chapter may take about 30 mins to 1 and half hours to do, so it's not a quick thing at all. Also, if you want to blaze through the game then you want to do the easy mode for sure as with each higher difficult it gets much harder to kill anyone and you take way more damage too.The only thing I really found fun was the Mercenaries mode. This mode is given to a player right from the start of the game and you don't have to beat the game to get it. You just have to play the prelude, which is forced to play anyways. If you play with a friend from the start, your friend also would have to play the prelude as the first player as he/she can not access Mercenaries mode until they do.Mercenaries has 3 stages to for the disc, but you only start with one stage. You must beat the other 2 stories to get two more stages to come out for the rest of Mercenaries. Also, there are 3 more stages that you can buy as DLC for $1 each stage. If you really enjoy Mercenaries than you should get the DLC, as it fun to play them over and over again.What I find different from RE 5 Mercenaries and RE 6 Mercenaries is that RE 6 Mercenaries is WAYYYYY Easier to beat with a 150 combo. My friend and I already have done that on 3 stages and we only had the game for a week. This is because the time for killing enemies has increase from 10 sec to 15 sec. That's so easy!!! Also, the weapons for RE 6 are soooo powerful against enemies that it's child's play! Come on! Boom, Boom, Boom. lol Also, RE 6 Mercenaries makes it very easy to get used to what skills you like and if you're so good at doing that skill you can totally destroy any stage with an amazing score!!!The game fails in Mercenaries mode for helping a partner recovering when he/she get's knock down and is in dying mode. I found myself running towards my partner, but realized that the camera will always turn your character backwards. If you where pushing your character to move right, after the dying screen comes up you find your character running left instead. Total BS!!!I didn't know at the time when I wrote the above, but I know now why, the camera goes all crazy and white out when a partner is down. You can actually, equip a skill called \"first responder\", which would let you still be in total control after a partner is down. If you're a pro player, you would never put on this skill because a pro player would rather die and start over for a high score than use this skill. Also, pro players would almost never get taken down, so there's really no point in using that skill.Finally, do I recommend this game? This game is only good if you in love with Resident Evil series and you will find that you don't mind it. You would also like this game if you love shooter games. You won't like this game, if you wanted something like Resident Evil 1 to 3. That side of the RE series is dead and won't ever come back....well in this RE series you can do counter move from RE 3, but most likely, if you wanted the scary feeling then that's not in this game. You won't be scared at all! This game has gone action pack and if that's what you wanted then this is it!2 stars for Mercenaries and a good fail for campaign mode.--------------------------------------------Update:There are more mercs stages since I wrote my review. I of course bought them because they are still fairly cheap. They have a totally of 10 stages. Not sure if they will have anymore stages, but it is still possible.There has been couple of free updates as well. The updates helps mainly the campaign mode and is helpful if you plan on playing and doing everything in it.There are 4 more online modes that you can buy for this game now. Since, I don't play online - I didn't get them. They do look quite good if you play online though. Some modes allow you to play with others as a team and some modes allow you to play against others. Check them out, if you like this game and do play online a lot. I'm sure, you will like them.-------------------------------------3/12/2013They have now combined all the DLC 7 Mercenaries stages into one bundle DLC. Buying the bundle would save a player a few dollars. Of course, if you liked the mercenaries mode, you would probably had already brought all the stages already and still be happy with not waiting for a bundle. If not, this is your chance to get even more play value out of this game at a discount.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

A lot of people have already said what I would say. The graphics are amazing, there is so much to do, the humor is hilarious (but are many dark points in the game that will make you cry) and while the story I thought was pretty well told when you consider how Sakurai decided to take this affectionate parody of Greek Mythology.A lot of new characters are introduced and all are fleshed out and interesting (especially Dark Pit) and the game is never ending when you consider the fact that every weapon you get is different.And of course the only problem of the game is the controls. While I found the controls easy to use, there is a steep learning curve and if you play too long, your hands will be dead.Overall, I would give the game at least a 95 out of 100 because the controls aren't going to stop you from playing an amazing fun game, right?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2012"}

It may seem too short but it has multiple endings and a lot of re-playability.Graphics:  I don't like Anime.  Let me repeat.  I'm DO NOT LIKE ANIME.  I don't hate it, i just don't care for it.  But this game looks beautiful.  It actually makes me sorta like Anime more.  But overall, the graphics look beautiful.Music: If you've played Persona 3 then you will know some of the songs here.  The music works very well.  In the nightmare stages the music fits when the stage has a foe chasing you and when it's more a stage to get you used to the new stage elements that have been introduced.Story:  Here is where the game shines the most.  You play Vincent who is having nightmares every night.  At the same time, he is being pressured by his long time girlfriend, Katherine, to take their relationship to the next step.  And on top of this, another girl, Catherine, is seducing him and trying to take him for her own.  Now he is caught in a web of lies, secrets and guilt.  Every time you pass a nightmare sequence you wake up to more drama in his real life.  It's very engaging.Gameplay:  I really hate to call the nightmare sequences \"puzzles\" cause it sorta makes it less than what it is.  These are Vincents nightmares.  He has to climb to the top of these evil towers to escape so as to not die in real life.  So the tower begins to fall down as you start climb, or there some huge monster chasing you.  Everything in the dreams is connected to his real life in some way.  There is more I would like to say to make sense of the sheep you see on the cover, but I don't want to spoil anything.You are given questions to answer here and there throughout the game that determine the direction the story will go for you.  The game has multiple endings and difficulties and medals you can get depending on how fast you climb the towers.  So you can get a lot of game play out of it.Overall, I love this game.  I think it is pure genius.  The issues that it addresses are very relate-able and really suck you into the story.The Special Edition comes with just a pillow case, not an actual pillow by the way.  The Special Edition isn't really all that worth the extra $20 in my opinion but this game is so special i just HAD to have it so I don't regret it.  There hasn't been a game like this in a long time.  I'm VERY impressed with how well they pulled off this whole concept and made a very VERY fun game.If you are hesitant on this game, then try the demo.  But i will warn you, the demo doesn't really do a great job in tying in the nightmare sequences with the story so you may get the wrong idea.  Also the nightmare parts are a lot more complicated once you play the full game, and they get really creative, fun...and HARD.  If you can rent the game, that would be best.  But I would say if you like it, to go ahead and buy it.  It's one of the few games out there that is worth full price in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2011"}

Though there has been some talk that the PS4 version is visually better than this one, that doesn't change that this is the best looking game I've ever played. Tomb Raider nails every important aspect of an adventure game and a video game in general. It has a great balance of exploration and focused level design. It gives plenty of optional areas to find and explore, with lots of tools to locate where you're supposed to go, and very clear indicators of what the game will let the player interact with. It also features thrilling fights, with multiple ways to approach combat.The mechanics of the platforming are amazing. The game is very much on the player's side. In so many games, if you don't do a jump with unrealistic precision in the exact way the game expects, you tumble to your death and have to try again. Tomb Raider, on the other hand, assumes you're not an idiot and tries to do what you wanted to do. If you jump toward a ledge at a slightly wrong angle, the game is going to smoothly turn Lara and latch you onto that ledge regardless of your being slightly off center or whatever. The game is clearly doing its best to interpret the player's controller inputs in a way that makes sense. It never feels like it's too much, either. It's not like if you try to jump off a cliff the game won't let you die. You'll die, and you'll die a lot. It's just that you won't die when you did the right thing in a slightly different way than the designers expected. If you did more or less the proper jump, chances are the game will let you land that jump rather than being a jerk about it and making you redo sections for a slight error in interpretation. It's a 3D world presented on a 2D screen, so there's no way you can be sure of the depth of the jumps. It's nice when games realize this and don't judge the player too harshly for making a slight miscalculation of the exact space of the jump. Tomb Raider is the best game ever when it comes to this. I appreciated it a great deal.In combat, you can try to be stealthy, go in guns blazing, or even try hand to hand combat. The great thing is that all methods of combat are viable. I took out the final boss primarily with dodging and counterpunching, with the occasional shotgun blast. If the game lets you do it, it's probably worth doing. That's the greatest achievement a game can have, really. Everything in the game is just absolutely worth using.I was also impressed with the voice acting and sound. The story is presented just beautifully, and the storytelling is incredible for a video game. Video games usually don't handle this aspect anywhere near as well as they should, even in story-driven games. Tomb Raider's story isn't exactly a replacement for a big budget movie, but it's told well, and it breaks a lot of cliches. You're a strong woman surviving, overcoming, and saving others. The people who survive alongside you are not the ones you'd expect, either. I wish I could spoil it here, but let's just say that this game will surprise you.This game has virtually no negatives to speak of. The only thing even remotely less than stellar in this game is the multiplayer, but that's not the main draw of the game. Even so, the multiplayer is still on par with other third person shooters on the market. It's certainly playable and fun in its own right. I give this game my highest recommendation. If I could choose to give one game 6 stars, this would be it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}

If you come back to use your computer, after a while you literally have to switch the mouse OFF and ON again by doing so underneath the mouse.  Apparently \"Sensei\" likes to test my patience.  Surely this may not be an issue if you only use this mouse for strictly gaming, but I'm sure most people will not have separate mice for other computer tasks.Don't get me wrong though as this is still one of the best and stylish peripherals that I have ever used and SteelSeries really do know their way with gaming products.

{"product_name":"B008CP6MA2","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"The god of bargains!","reviewText":"I spent $280 on all these games... $60 for #3, $100 for #1&2, $80 for the PSP games, and then another $40 for the HD remakes of 1&2... and I don't regret it at all. They were worth the money. For all of these games to be included in one collection, for $40, is an outrageous bargain. All of the GOW titles are incredibly fun, at least on your first playthrough. On subsequent playthroughs, I feel like the pacing is bogged down by puzzles that simply aren't that much fun, and consume too much time- disrupting what is an otherwise excellent pace set throughout. Combat in all the games is superb- smooth, satisfying, and easy to pick up. The available depth of combat (for those who wish to tinker) and the rudimentary leveling system for weapons further fills out the experience. But be warned- these games are among the most violent ever made, and are not for the faint of heart. I'm personally okay with the gore, even though I'm generally not a huge fan of violence, because I feel that it's in keeping with the traditions of Greek mythology, and the story is clearly rooted in fantasy, not reality.The first half hour of GOW3 is most likely the finest example of technology and scale I've witnessed in this console generation, and it's easily worth the price of admission alone. As Kratos launches his assault upon Mt. Olympus with the aid of the colossal titans, you will be blown away by the scale of the conflict. Poseidon, Zeus, Hades, Hermes, Hercules... this game has them all, in a mythological showdown of epic proportions.GOW1&2 hold up remarkably well, and the HD polish does a fine job of making the games more playable for those of us spoiled by HDTVs. However, the graphical limitations are painfully obvious, when compared to GOW3. Nowhere is this more clear than in the title screens, which feature a closeup of Kratos' face, as he awaits the push of the start button, and for you to send him into battle. On the PS2 games (1&2), it's pretty impressive. When you see the powerful graphics engine on #3, it's mind boggling. Here, Kratos' face becomes filled with lifelike detail and subtle movement. This type of attention to detail carries throughout the duration of #3, and is generally pretty stunning. Therefore, I recommend playing through the series in chronological order, which would obviously make a lot more sense for story purposes, too.As others have pointed out, it's disappointing that the PSP games are not included on the disc, but in the form of online voucher, but it's still the \"God of Bargains\". As far as how the PSP titles hold up, they're the best games ever developed for the handheld, and they make a remarkably solid transition to the big screen. Graphically, they're the weakest of the lot, but they are still excellent games, a ton of fun, and (somewhat) useful to the God of War canon. If you're late to the party, and haven't yet jumped into the Spartan's battle, then this is an excellent deal for any adult gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

Daneker","summary":"Other M wants to be played on Other System","reviewText":"The first thing I noticed as Samus steps of the platform for the first time in Other M is how dated the graphics look. This does not look any better than any Game Cube game a decade later. Maybe Wii is great for simple line-drawing exercise games, but if you've been on PS3, XBox or PC in the last five years, then this is like playing a dinosaur. The second thing was, wow, this controller is very awkward and uncomfortable to hold horizontally, and without the regular regiment of buttons how will I control Samus's cool, signature moves. Answer, you really won't.Other M. plays like a game built for the Game Cube and shoved hard into the Wii. Because there's no stick, there's no camera control, no L or R buttons, no on the fly missiles, aiming is vastly auto-controlled as is jumping. Firing a missile, well, that's a big issue. In Other M you have to let go of the controller with the left hand, swing it towards the screen (Samus is now frozen but to spin and look around) then aim, and lock, then fire while being a sitting target.Next is the storyline, after Super Metroid Samus is missing her baby... Metroid, and falls in with her old squad leader and deactivates all her cool powers until such point as he okay's their  use. Meanwhile, sappy, saddened Samus mopes around trying to find out what went wrong on a space station now crawling with baddies.The game is short, leaving much to be revisited in second play-round because you can't get it the first time. Mostly Samus clears a small section, Mini boss or boss battle, then the troops come in, cut-scene, next section, boss, troops, cut-scene, repeat, repeat. You run through two or three small sections then fight some incredibly hard boss with a controler that is making your hand cramp, trying to execute moves with buttons that don't cooperate. All the exploration of Metroid past is gone, this game just points you in short spurts to the next boss battle, and really, you can't ever move on without killing something hard to get the damn door to open.What I miss here is the awesome control over Samus from the Game-Boy Advance titles (both, far-superior to this one) and the sense of loneliness and impending doom that normally follows Samus around. She's a rogue bounty hunter, suddenly turned into a subservient, crying, chick ready and waiting to take orders from her once commanding officer.Graphics are okay, but dated and simple, not even close to other systems.Control is horrible, the Wii controller was not made for this, the FPS perspective is frustrating and the third-person is just deep side-scroll with a static camera and limited options. I wanted to just use my GC control so bad.Game is simple, clear area, watch cut-scene with what feels like endless boss battles.A low-point for Metroid, while it's great to see the original game screens and enemies in 3D, the nostalgia doesn't cut it. M is a weak attempt to tell a story featuring a character acting completely out of character.It's okay, a must have for Metroid die-hards, but not the thrilling return to third-person we hoped for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}

Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Legendary racing title...must-have for the genre","reviewText":"This is one of the best racing games I have ever played.  Being an automotive enthusiast in \"real life,\" I am also a big fan of simulation racing, and back in my PS2 days Gran Turismo was my game of choice.  Since I lack a PS3 at the moment, I cannot try the new GT5, but Forza has become my new favorite for the time being.  I first played this game shortly after its debut in 2007, but it belonged to a roommate and I never finished it.  When I became cognizant of the release of Forza 3 in 2009, my new roommate and I teamed up to complete FM2, doing so mere hours before the new game was released.  Now that Forza 4 is coming out, I have made it my mission to once again tackle this game AND Forza 3, bringing both to 100% completion on my own.That's right:  despite owning Forza 3 and having completed over 75% of that game, I am still enthusiastically playing Forza 2.  It's really that good.Forza 2 offers the same formula as many other racing games, but the particular way it delivers this content is quite appealing.  The game contains over 300 cars (counting DLC, which is included in the Platinum Hits version of the game).  There is a great selection of cars, with most popular vehicles included such as the Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Murcielago, Lotus Exige, Corvette Z06, Porsche 911 Turbo, Audi R8, Ford GT, and BMW M3.  In addition, a few lesser-known but historically significant sports cars are included such as the Lotus Carlton, Buick Grand National, VW Corrado, and BMW CSL.  This is obviously only a fraction of the cars, but illustrates the diversity of the game.  Inexpensive \"tuner\" vehicles such as Honda Civics are also included, as are a plethora of professionally built race cars (Le Mans & Touring, but no rally or F1) and several branded tuner cars such as Mine's Skylines and a Top Secret Supra and Silvia.Forza 2, and its successors, classify the cars by a ranking system known as \"Performance Index.\"  Each car is assigned a performance \"number,\" based on characteristics such as handling and acceleration; each range of numbers is then given a letter \"class\" to quickly judge the overall rank of the car, and to provide restriction for race events.  For example, class \"A\" ranges from P.I. of 700 to 850.  The cars can then be upgraded with various parts, which will increase the number accordingly.Upgrading cars is a smooth and easy process, but can be subjected to careful scrutiny to ensure the best overall performance.  Upgrades include engine parts, suspension and weight reduction, tires and wheels, and spoilers.  In the latter, some cars offer aftermarket body kits, while others can be modified only with adjustable race (\"Forza style\") wings, splitters, and diffusers.  The various upgrades are offered under real life brand names, such as HKS, K&N;, AWE Tuning, Bilstein, Pirelli, BBS, and many more.  While this has little effect on the actual performance of such modifications, it lends a realistic feel to the upgrade process.Cars can be painted in nearly any desired shade, and several dozen layers of graphics can be custom-designed and installed; this feature in particular gained considerable acclaim since its basic introduction in Forza 1.Once a car is purchased and upgraded, if desired, it can be raced in a variety of events ranging from short and easy \"Proving Grounds\" events to lengthy and challenging \"Endurance\" events.  The broad event categories each contain a number of race series, each of which has 3 to 5 individual races.  Completing each race awards money (credits) and experience points; completing each series awards a monetary bonus and a car (prize cars remain locked in the dealership until they are won).  Finally, completing each EVENT type gives an XBox Live challenge and an even larger monetary bonus.The amount of money given in races depends on the difficulty level selected; AI difficulty can be set to easy, medium, or hard, and assists such as ABS, Traction Control, Stability Control, and a \"recommended racing line\" can be turned on or off.  The game also allows manual or automatic shifting for all cars, with manual giving a small bonus.  Various AI drivers can be hired to perform races for the player, though they will take anywhere from 55-100% of the winnings depending on their skill level.  This is useful either for tedious races, or for racking up money to buy cars while doing something else.  I personally prefer to do all the races myself (to maximize winnings and \"experience the whole game\"), but I frequently use the hired driver to do completed endurance races for money while I am busy doing some other activity.As races are completed, the player gains experience points, which level them up.  The game is well balanced so that if all races are performed only once, the level-up process will continue throughout most of the game.  There are 50 levels, each of which requires more points to achieve, and each level gives an award such as a discount on cars or parts; every five levels achieved gives a bonus prize car, which varies depending on which region (Europe, North America, Asia) the player chooses at the beginning of the career mode.  The region can be changed during the career, but for a substantial amount of credits; the only things affected by the choice of region are the prize cars given for leveling up, and the types of cars which become discounted after a certain number of levels.  Races are identical.Cars themselves can also gain up to 5 \"Reputation Levels,\" each of which gives a further discount on various upgrade parts.  These discounts can be quite useful, as some parts for exotic cars tend to cost a great deal.The game's structure is well organized as described, but how about the actual gameplay mechanics?  In this regard, Forza 2 also delivers strong results.  Game physics are quite good considering its age.  I estimate that the newer Forza games are somewhat more realistic, in that they seem to communicate tire effects better, and also allow rollover accidents.  However, those in Forza 2 are certainly not bad, nor are they arcade-quality.  Driving must be done cleanly and carefully to achieve good lap times; running off the road not only gives a lap penalty, but also slows cars down significantly.  In particular, the grass and dirt around some tracks is modeled to behave like \"quicksand,\" in that it instantly slows cars to a mere crawl, making shortcuts a non-option.  The game also includes a good damage model.  Obviously, there is not enough computing power to accurately replicate 100+ mph wrecks, but contact between cars, rear-ending events, and accidental wall scrapes take their toll both visually and physically; in R1 (Le Mans Prototype) race cars, small amounts of damage to aero devices can render the cars nearly undriveable.AI in the game is the typical dim-witted lot found in most of these types of games (at least from this era), but is not entirely mindless.  As many times as they rear-end you, they will also stop to avoid collisions, and some try unique and aggressive passing maneuvers.  However, they also tend to follow a fairly fixed path on the track, and in most events there are plenty of places for the player to take corners much more quickly than the AI.  Despite this, some races are nearly impossible with the AI difficulty set to \"hard,\" providing a great deal of challenge.Graphics are remarkable.  While Forza 3 and 4 offer better graphics, the changes are mostly limited to track detail and lighting.  Forza 2 has carefully replicated each car with precise and crisp details.  It might not have the best lighting effects, but everything is sharp and clear, not blocky or poorly rendered.  Only some of the trees and other track features take on a tacky 2D appearance, but it does not detract from the game experience, at least not in my opinion.  The one graphical feature that is severely lacking is animated pit stops.  Gran Turismo 4, a previously released competitor in the market, provided this, whereas Forza 2 involves cars being magically repaired in a ghost town pit lane with no crew; surprisingly, Forza 3 did the same.The game features two other modes, arcade and multiplayer.  Arcade provides quick races, split screen competition, and a series of time trial events.  Multiplayer, of course, offers online racing.  However, as of 2012, this mode is no longer available, as the servers were permanently shut down to accommodate Forza 4.  That being said, however, Forza 2 provides such an excellent single player experience that unless someone is ONLY interested in online gaming, the value is still great.In summary, Forza 2 delivers a solid and time-consuming single-player experience that should please any car enthusiast with its broad scope of cars, upgrades, and race events.  While multiplayer is no longer active, the game still holds good value as a classic in the racing genre.  I actually prefer the upgrade system to that of Forza 3, and while the rewind feature in Forza 3 is handy, Forza 2 seems like a more challenging and \"raw\" experience without it.  In the end, Forza 2, 3, and 4 will all grace my game collection as solid racing titles that I would recommend to anyone who loves simulation racing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2008"}

I threw this disc in, hooked up the guitar, and held my breath.  Would the nay-sayers of \"latency / too many A/V setups\" win out the day?The answer is a resounding NO.  I play a note and there is no noticeable delay whatsoever.  My A/V system has become my amp (and oh, what an amp with a Pioneer Elite to back it up).Rocksmith, first and foremost, is an INSTRUCTOR, not a social party.  If you're looking for social party gaming like Rock Band, look elsewhere.  Rocksmith is intended to have you learn how to play guitar, straight and simple.  The game starts off with a sound check to calibrate the volume of your guitar and, more incredibly still, to TUNE YOUR GUITAR.  And it's a surprisingly good tuner at that.Once your guitar's in tune, the game eagerly throws you into the Rolling Stone's \"I Can't Get No Satisfaction.\"\"What difficulty should I play?\" you might ask.  Ah, that's where the beauty of Rocksmith comes in.  Rocksmith will ramp the difficulty up or down depending on how well you play.  Are you nailing every single note coming down the strum highway?  Well, here come a few more!  Ooops, you're missing just about every single note?  Rocksmith will ramp it down.  There's no \"failing\" here...Rocksmith will rewards you with the points that you rightfully earn for playing notes correctly.  If you play more notes correctly, you earn more currency to unlock more portions of the game.  If not, then you're not really ready for some of the other challenges...so stop punishing yourself.  :  Rocksmith wisely uses the point system to ensure that you're ready to tackle the challenges that you're capable of taking on.And it's just not about playing songs.  Additional challenges come in the form of mini-games where you're playing notes to blow stuff up.  It's a rather unique way to get people of all ages into the throes of learning to play guitar.  I'm in my late 30s and I enjoy the variety.What if you are actually proficient and just want to play your guitar?  Well, there's an \"Amp\" mode for that, too.  Just go over there and you're able to go through a variety of tone/pedal selects and play your guitar through your A/V system to your heart's content (for 5 dollars, you can unlock everything via DLC so you don't have to play the game).Note of warning - I did mention earlier that this is no Rock Band.  It's a LONELY game-play experience.  Don't expect to invite 3-4 friends and expect to make a night of Rocksmith...it'd be about as much fun as inviting your friends over to watch you play piano.  Yeah, that doesn't work.  But, as a primer, Rocksmith succeeds in spades and is going to be having me up many nights learning how to play a guitar.Thank you, Ubisoft, for making a game that actually lets you use a real guitar.  I'm hoping that the backlash of Activisions Rhythm Game saturation won't ultimately hurt sales, but I will be a dedicated follower to come.Suggestions for Rocksmith II if it should ever happen - include bass guitar!!!Cheers - and rock on!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

I had really enjoyed Treyarch's COD WaW so was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately it falls short for me on so many levels that I think any future efforts in this series should be left to the Infinity Ward team, but given the fact that is now defunct time to retire COD.Reasons I did not like Black Ops.1. Graphics don't snap as on MW2. Awful cut scenes supporting a pretentious story. I only mention them because you have to sit through them every time you (re)play a level.3. Awful voice acting (German officer uses the words [...] in 1944)..really Treyarch..you think that is cool? Whatever.4. Back to WWII..again.5. I expect linear with COD but the prescripted events (door opening, throat spitting, motorcycle riding). Talk about a game on tight rails. Don't look left or right.6. Obligatory gore. Sure its going to be gory, but add the pre scripted gruesome throat slitting and it gets ridiculous.7. How many explosions can you fit into 1 minute? Play this game and you will find out.8. Zombies9. More story than gameplay10. Price tagReasons I like Black Ops.1. Holds its value..can sell for my money back:)","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}
