{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"(Okay, a disclaimer up front: I am new to the Madden franchise, have only played a patched version of Madden 13, and do not play online.)I have thoroughly enjoyed this product.  I was initially put off by the low scores here at Amazon and the griping about the missing franchise mode.  For these reasons, I almost got Madden 12. However, I'm glad that I went ahead and got this one. The game can be very absorbing.  There is a good degree of realism in the gameplay, and you can set various sliders to make the game perform as you would like.  There are also a good number of modes.  In my view, the Connected Career mode (CCM) works like a franchise mode in which you can coach any of the 32 teams through 16-game seasons and post-season games.  You can micromanage to your heart's content, from developing the skills of individual players, changing playbooks, redesigning uniforms, chasing promising free agents/draft picks, and so forth.  Of course, there are various practice modes, single-player \"instant action,\" fantasy teams, and online offerings.  However, I've had a great time with (offline) CCM thus far.The presentation is well done.  Lots of animations, compelling on-field mechanics, convincing sound effects, suitably epic sounding music, etc.  To be sure, there are some occasional goofy post-play glitches, where players sometimes stumble over each other while trying to get up from a tackle.  However, this doesn't affect actual plays or gameplay in any way.  The announcers overall do a credible job, though they will eventually become repetitive once you hear all of their dialogue.  On rare occasion, they will also get something wrong, such as saying that you are on 4th down even though you actually just made a first down (again, this uncommon glitch does not affect gameplay--that is, you'll actually have the first down). In sum, I really like how the game gives you a sense that you are playing in the NFL and that your team matters.  There are post-game \"news\" and Twitter messages that keep up with how things are going around the league, and stats screens are available on nearly every aspect of the league.The controls are fairly easy to learn, but a lot has to do with your timing and ability to make quick judgments based on visual on-field conditions.  The game is faithful to the real sport, so expect penalties, audibles, onside kicks, draw plays, Hail Mary passes, etc.  On the All-Pro difficulty with most sliders set near zero (which makes the game more based on the actual stats of the players and less arcadey), I have found the game to be a good challenge.  My Falcons are now 8-6-1, so this last game is going to be a nail-biter (we probably won't make the playoffs this time)! The average player will have to experiment and come up with slider settings that fit their gameplay style, and there are many suggestions on the internet.I am really at a loss why this game is getting such poor ratings from some reviewers.  Either previous Maddens were so much better (which I doubt), the so-called missing franchise mode is just a deal-breaker (which it shouldn't be), or there is a lot of EA hating out there (very likely, though I understand it).  Anyhow, I'm impressed by the game, especially as a first-time Madden customer.  I haven't experienced any performance issues such as freezes, crashes, slow-downs, etc.  The in-game manual (man, I really wish that these things still came in printed form inside of the retail box) could do a better job at explaining a few things--I had to go online to find out how to kick the ball!  Otherwise, my complaints about this game are few and minor.  I highly recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

I only played this game for two days so sorry if I can't give you a full descriptive background story about the characters and plot. The reason why I stop playing this game is because it seem the characters are talkative. A little too talkative. The main character is brooding and his partner always nags, (and I'm five minutes into the game and I already don't like the characters).Then there's the fighting part; if you are not good at multi-tasking then this game is not for you. This was the main reason why I hate this game, the multi-tasking battle are so annoying. On the DS, when you're fighting monsters on the top screen there's your partner and you're at the bottom screen. The top screen you use up, down, left and right to do special attacks while on the bottom you use the touch screen to attack and dodge enemies as well.

The HORI PS Vita Game Case 12 is exactly what the description says it is.  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Game cartridges are easy to remove with no fear of damaging them from prying.+ Transparent plastic allows you to see what games you have stored without having to open the case.+ Holds 12 game cartridges or 11 game cartridges and 1 memory card.+ Inexpensive.Cons- Only 1 slot for a memory card.  Many Vita games take up a lot of memory so unless you have two large memory cards (one in the vita and one in the case) having only one slot in a case that holds 12 games isn't exactly ideal.- Plastic construction isn't as sturdy as I'd like it to be.Although I don't have quite enough games yet to fill this HORI PS Vita Game Case I'm sure it won't take me long.  Although it's slightly more expensive than the officialPlayStation Vita Card Casewhich holds 8 game cartridges and 2 memory cards, the HORI version is good alternate choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2012"}

It's one of those missions that you drive for about 10-15 minutes before actually getting into the mission which happened to be a chase scene. I tried and tired and tried and I finally gave up and never completed this game.

{"product_name":"B000B2YR74","reviewerName":"Craig B. \"Craig B.\"","summary":"Great game.","reviewText":"Well, I'm a little late as this game has been out for some time now.  So long in fact that you can't even buy the XBox version from Amazon itself, but from others in the Amazon Marketplace (new, used), which is what I did.  I was a little skittish at first to order it in this way, but it worked out very well.  In fact, I may have recieved it sooner than if I had been able to purchase it from Amazon.  The person must have shipped it the very same day.The graphics are really good for an Xbox title.  I also played the PC demo, so I know the graphics on the PC are much better.  One of the problems with having an XBox version is you can't play \"Episode 2\".  You also can't play multiplayer, it isn't even an option.  I thought it odd it had no multiplayer, then I read in another review that the PC version DOES have multiplayer.A few problems I had with this game were minor.  I'm not sure if it's the XBox controls, or just the game, but I would have trouble many times trying to do something as simple as get through a door.  I'd just get kind of get hung up for no reason that I could see (no clutter around me).  There was a lot of clutter in the game.  Not so much a bad thing, but sometimes it could make a simple task of walking hard as there was always stuff laying around.I also noticed some slow points as the XBox had trouble keeping up with the action.  This isn't a game issue.  In fact, I have a first gen XBox.  You may find a later generation works a little better.There are two driving levels.  I found them to be a pain.  The controls for the vehicles are not very good.  And, they just seem to go forever.  It may have been better if they split them up a bit.  They went on so long I found myself getting dizzy and had to take a break.Some aspects of the game were just amazing.  As much as I'd like to tell you about them, I don't want to spoil anything.  I know I didn't expect them, and it gave me a \"WOW!\" moment more than once.This isn't a straight up shooter like the Halo  series.  In many places you have to figure out how to get to the next area.  This can be frustrating.  I found myself in a room for about 15 minutes as I swam to the same places I had been to many times trying to figure out what the heck I missed.  And, it's always something really simple that makes you slap yourself on the head.One really nice thing about this game is the length.  I'm not sure how long it took me to beat it, but it was quite a few hours.  This is nice when you think of other games that only have about 7 to 10 hours of gameplay.  It really makes it feel like you got your moneys worth, even if it did only cost 12 bucks...lol","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2007"}

In a few specific areas of the game, there is a probability of your game corrupting when saving and due to the large footprint of the game there is only one save slot.Most annoyingly, this bug existed in the Japanese version, it was never patched... cruddy, but given the nature of Nintendo's online structure and rarity of patches, not unforgivable. However, Aksys picked this up, knowing that it had the bug, and brought it over completely intact never breathing a word of it. They have yet to respond to any concerns about it either, which most definitely lowers my opinion of them.Checking online, Rising Star Games, the company who published the European edition actually came out and said that they tested it throughly and could not reproduce a bug... which turned out to be total B.S.... What is wrong with the publishers of this game? Absolutely ridiculous, Nintendo should honestly revoke their license to produce and distribute the game until this is cleared up.If you plan on picking this game up, know two things.1.) If you have a Vita, there are no bugs in that version and it has a few other legs up (multiple save slots, better visuals, better sound)2.) If you're playing on the 3DS, DO NOT save in any puzzle rooms. Even if you're in the novel section of the game, try to restrict your saves to the warehouses and hallways.I've seen some people reccommend that you simply don't save and just keep the system in sleep mode between plays, this is not a good idea, this game is fairly crash prone in a few spots.

Through a series of events Kaim meet other immortals who have also lost their memories, it's through the help of these immortals, as well as some mortals that Kaim goes on a quest to regain his memories as well as the memories of the other immortals and ultimately save the world he has come to live in for 1000 years. All throughout your quest the main story of LO is supplemented with 'Dream Sequences' What these are is basically Kaim remembering things that have happened to him over the years. The dreams were very well written and I actually enjoyed reading them, but that's all you did was read, there were no cut scenes depicting these dreams (which would have been awesome) or anything else done with the dreams to make them more interesting. However some dreams were emotionally moving and most of them actually showed you the pain of living for 1000 years....And herein the problem lies, the dreams are actually better than the main story of the game, now don't get me wrong, the story in LO is good, but that's all it ever is, it never does anything to become great. And the dreams in LO are GREAT, if only they would have done more with them I could quit gaming knowing I had played the perfect JRPG. Anyways moving on, gameplay in LO is old school, its straight from the 90's. That's right I'm talking turn based battles, LO does little to try and change up this 20+ year old formula and for the most part I didn't mind, people who have played any Final Fantasy before 11+ will feel right at home, battles are all random and at first it was refreshing to see this come back in an RPG however by the time I was on the fourth (and final) disc of LO I was so freaking sick of random encounters I stopped fully exploring dungeons, random encounters were fun in the 90's, heck they were still fun in 2001 but fast forward to 2010 and now there just plain boring and completely unnecessary. I will say it again though that the random encounters started grating on my nerves on the 4th disc/ 30 hours into the game, by this time I was antsy to finish the game and that could explain my temporary hatred for random encounters :p.However after all is said and done LO is easily the best RPG available on the 360, the ending scenes of the game are great, dare I say even better than the dreams? It closes up all the loop holes and even has a very surprising plot twist (not to spoil anything but there is a certain member on your team who becomes the unlikely hero of the game.)Overall this is a must buy for anyone looking for a good RPG for the 360","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2010"}

The cinematics are, the difficulty is what makes up the time. The more enemies, the harder it is, the longer you will play, and easier is faster. ODST was rather boring than fun or exciting to play. Rated:3. Maybe it just didn't grow on me. As written on the cover it is a new hero and therefore another game,not like Halo 3. But the fact is that there can't be just one hero. All ODST members are more or less heroes.Spolier: Basically they just went into a fight and came back with their data. They didn't win over the city or that major fights. Therefore it's either all of them are heroes or none of them are.End of spoiler.I wanted the game to be better, I expected a lot from it, I hoped that many reviewers were wrong, but they were mostly right. It's not the best Halo game out there. You got your chance to play as ODST trooper, but I liked none of the ODST team members from this game. None but silent me, rookie. From all the money that was made from Halo games, they could have done so much better game. ODST is very repetitive. It has tactics that you must use yourself, but basically they all repeat. If they make ODST again, I want it to be fun and exciting. And new members would work best. Since it's a story, if they will suddenly change everything about the members of this ODST group it will be fail as well. I simply do not enjoy those characters. None of them. They seem to me to be boring and uninteresting.What pissed me off mostly about this game is that when AI's drive, they get stuck so easily. Imagine, a warhog hits a tree, they get stuck for a long time. If there is remains of some machine, the driver will probably unable to get past it. You often need to exit your vehicle, kick the other driver from their vehicle, move it through the obstacles, run after previous vehicle. Oh and the worst about it is that sometimes they turn back and drive the whole way back just to come back to that obstacle or not come back at all. I lost in a very mysterious way a few vehicles. They just disappeared. And on the map, it is not always possible to find them. Soldiers of UNSC are unfairly weak. Just a few shots in them and they turn dead. So no matter what you do, how you try to save them, take all the fire on yourself, they will die and not accompany you. Very weak, extremely weak soldiers. I bet that grunts are stronger than soldiers of UNSC. A few grunts vs. one soldier and I bet the soldier will loose. Yet I still have a hope that 1 soldier vs 1 grunt will be victorious.

Hold on tight because it's going to be bumpy..........Fall 1991. It was a great time to be a video gamer. For the past 5 years, the NES was on top of the world and home to so many memorable games. While the Sega Master System was its rival, it enjoyed more of a cult following as the majority of video games were released for the NES. But like all good things, they come to an end as Sega ushered in a brand new console. The Sega Genesis, released in 1989, featured new technology and more horsepower to display flashier games and brought a new video games icon to rival Mario and Nintendo. Nintendo responded by releasing the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and a brand new Mario game (Super Mario World.) This was the game packed in with the console and was responsible for maintaining the large fan base the original NES had built up for years.To say this made an impact to gamers would be an understatement.Hot off the heels of the excellent Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World was the sequel that showcased the SNES's graphical prowess and ability to display new effects. 8 new worlds to explore (plus the hidden star portals) and 99 levels lie in wait for gamers to explore. It introduced new enemy characters as well as the lovable dinosaur Yoshi. And above all, it was extremely fun to play. From the graphics to the music and the easy to get into controls, this game continued the proud tradition of the revered Mario games and set standards for all future platform games to come.While there are many ways to track down this title (the original SNES cartridge, the Game Boy Advance title and through Nintendo's Virtual Console service for those who have a Wii that is online), any true gamer has played this many, many times and can tell you that it was one of the finest games to ever come out from Nintendo.****HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2010"}

I was anticipating a lot out of this game and it let me down.  The character creation is very cool and had me ready to hop in game and test everything out.  The first thing you'll notice is the character's are difficult to see in game, so my friends really couldn't make out my cool Fallout gear I got from pre-ordering from Best Buy. I normally buy 90% of my games from Amazon, but really wanted the Fallout exclusive stuff. I had to find a very lit up area for them to really be able to see anything cool I added to my character.Secondly it is a GIANT pain to try and join or get friends to join when you first get the game.  There isn't a lobby system, so one person has to start the campaign and then invite the others and the others don't get to see the first main cut scenes, which takes away from the experience.Once in game its pretty chaotic.  You can accept different objectives, which is cool, but can be a bit overwhelming at times when there is a lot going on.  The campaign is very short.  My friend and I completed the Resistance part in just a few hours.  The challenges proved to be just as short.  We both completed all the challenges in an hour or so.So, after completing the challenges quickly and then beating the Resistance side of the campaign quickly we figured the game must really shine in multi player.  WRONG!!! We tried 10+ games and EVERY ONE was so laggy that we backed out.  I never had one multiplayer experience where we finished a round.  I would like to note that we play multi player games almost daily and NEVER have lag issues with any other game.In Summary:The game has a cool concept.  The SMART system is neat, but not anything like advertised.  The graphics aren't great, but I'm fine with that as long as gameplay is great, which it isn't! The sounds are just okay.  The guns all seem to be so alike that it doesn't really matter what you choose.  The gameplay is so fast paced that it seems to take away any strategy that could potentially be used.Seems like they wanted a game with a Team Fortress 2 feel with an xp leveling up system while adding a Parkour element to differentiate it from other games.  It doesn't do any of those well.  It's entertaining for an hour or two and then you'll find yourself asking \"What now?\".  The answer is \"Nothing\".  The game doesn't have a lot to it and the multiplayer is terrible.  I bought it Tuesday and traded it in on Amazon an hour ago.  This is the first game in a few years that I have bought and felt that I wasted my money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

The graphics are insane.  the sound is great.  The controls are better than the first and fun factor kept me going through to the next episode.  I beat all the bosses the first time through, so its not that difficult.  I don't know, some people just don't understand capcom games.  They trashed Bionic Commando, Love that game.  Dark Void,loved it.  I don't get it.  You have to understand the controls and get use to it.  Sure I have a few complaints about LP 2 like the grappeling hook not being long enough, but damn.  Turn the game up, smoke a blunt and delve into some badass fire fights.  The mechs are so cool and deal major amount of firepower to anyone in its way.  I liked the boss battles and you feel like you accomplished something when you take out a forty foot tall monster.  I wish Capcom would release monster hunter on Xbox 360.

I've been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor. since then, not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty. It was a wonderfual game and still is. Call of Duty 2 was even better. Does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on? in a word, yes. Although, it is alot more of the same. But then again, why mess with a great formula? Call of Duty 3 works because it is exactly what the original game was built around, sheer intensity....and also alot of fun. But then you might say, well i've played COD2, are you saying its the same? Yes and No. The basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense. Yea, its the same game. But this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier. Honestly, these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox 360. I dare say it puts my beloved COD2 to near shame. The lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold. The life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score. Oh, and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects, just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more. Seriously, the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated. COD3 is yet another amazing world war 2 game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content, meaning on the edge of your seat. The newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too. I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest, the best that money can buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2006"}

Yes, the game is easy, but that's what makes if fun to play since you don't worry about not making a difficult jump or dying facing an enemy, which brings up the character interaction I mentioned. Elika is what an A.I. controlled character should be. She does not get in your way at all. In fact, you will not make it through the game without her helping hand.Some say the game is too repetitive. I think that describes almost all action/adventure games: go from point A to point B by jumping, climbing, fight X amount of enemies. The difference is that in this game you want to do everything, explore the dark environments of the Corrupted lands, and just stare at how beautiful those same lands are once they are Healed.This is one of the best games of this year.

Most of the problems of the original were fixed, there was less or no repetition, very good puzzles and a great story. A win-win for the gamers.Unfortunately though, it turns out that the developers don't know their fans. The game becomes insanely difficult towards the end. Puzzles become completely illogical and require a lot of trial and error for solving them. What adds to the frustration is that this is a portable game and many times, you won't be playing this in a place where you have a pen/paper close. And no, can't use the screen, when this spans multiple levels.Controls - never an issue before - become extremely frustrating. You basically have to control 2 characters and select multiple items, while timed events happen. Considering how much you have to do, maybe the stylus control shouldn't have been the best choice for this particular game. Many times you know what you have to do, yet can't do it because of the stylus control.The game is so difficult that no kid could play and finish this by himself. This is pretty much designed for adults.  Playing the flute and using the tornado - were all great ideas, but are overused. Who wants to be somewhere in public and keep blowing in the microphone??Overall - this is a big disappointment. Hate to say it, but the Ocean Temple suddenly sounds like fun...

There are 14 different game modes, many things to unlock, 4-player action and much more.The 'Main Game' is a marble-madness-style game, where you have to get your monkey ball to the goal by tilting the board.  Along the way, you pick up bannanas, hit switches, go through transporters, find warps and much more.  There are reportedly around 150 new boards to clear in Super Monkey Ball 2.  80 are available immediately through the Beginner, Advanced & Expert modes; the rest are unlocked by getting through the standard modes within the alotted number of lives.New to Monkey Ball 2 is a Story mode.  This puts a backstory to levels, albeit a kind of weak and weird one.  It seems Dr. Bad-Boon has taken all of the bannanas from Monkey Island; our hero, AiAi, is determined to get them back.  Basically, you will watch a scene transpire, then proceed to solve a set of 10 levels in order to proceed to the next world.  There are 10 worlds, so it takes 100 levels to beat this mode.  The levels are taken straight from the Main Game, but are given different backgrounds (ie one world's levels are set in a volcano, so there is a lot of lava & smoke in the background of each level).In addition to the Main Game, there are 12 Party Games.  All six from the first Monkey Ball game are back and are available from  the start.  The remaining six need to be unlocked using the Play Points you will earn from playing the Main Game.Monkey Race has 6 new tracks, plus the ability to have 8 total players (1-4 human players plus 4-7 com players).  New weapons include a missle that launches at all players around you & a gravity ball that slows players down.  Expect to see more bumpers placed on the tracks to slow you down.  Monkey Target now lets you use 1, 2 or 5 monkeys at once (depending on the number of people playing; 5 is available in one player only).  When playing with friends, you now go at the same time in a split screen, and can knock each other off targets.  Bannanas get you points; power-ups are found in the air with the bannanas now.  Alas, the Wheel of Danger is gone.  Monkey Fight now has levels with walls that get damaged & destroyed, plus a tie-breaking mode where you fight on a crumbling floor.  Monkey Golf is less like mini-golf now, at least for the front 9 holes; the back 9 has more obstacles to get around.  Monkey Bowling now has a Special mode, where each frame has a different lane, some of them moving!  Monkey Billiards has several new game variations beyond 9-ball.New games include Soccer, a 5-on-5 battle for goals; Baseball, where you try to hit the pitched monkey ball into the right slots in the outfield to get hits & runs; tennis, including singles and the extremely fun 1-4 player doubles (is best with 4 players); Monkey Shot, a Virtua Cop-type shooting game (also 1-4 players, but can get verrrry confusing with 4 players); Monkey Boat, a new Monkey Race variation that uses the L & R buttons to paddle; and Monkey Dogfight, where you take to the air and try to shoot the other monkeys out of the sky.Play Points earned after unlocking all six games can be used to purchase 'Gifts', which consists of the movie scenes from the Story mode, the credit game from the end of the Main Game and the ability to start off with additional lives in the Main Game.  You can purchase up to 99 lives, which will be a big help in allowing you to earn the extra levels.Fans of Super Monkey Ball will eat this sequel up.  Newcomers, this is a fabulous game and the original is absolutely still worth picking up.  My friends & I logged well over 250 hours on my copy of the original, this will easily match that.  This is a great party game that will keep you & your friends laughing, arguing & gloating for months.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2002"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Key Wii Movement","reviewText":"With all the hype of the Nintendo Wii system, it is always essential for you to find a key sense of movement with its controller.

The nunchuck controller is a key add-on for movement on analog control on games like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, Red Steel for the Nunchuck fighting action, and the high-flying football tossing when it comes to playing with the New York Giants on Madden '07. The downside is that I honestly don't know why it has to be a sepearate accessory to the standard Wii controller, instead of being a part of the full controller.

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Incredible - did someone upgrade my XBox?","reviewText":"Wow. Doom 3 on the XBox... does it deliver? You bet!Graphically, I was expecting to be blown away by the visuals but worried about the frame rate, especially having played the PC version on a high-end PC which still ran sluggish. My worries were unfounded though; D3 on XBox is smooth as silk with little difference in terms of detail from the PC version. The lighting, the locations, the textures all blend to fully emerse you in the levels. Never before have I felt so deeply swallowed by a game's emersive graphical atmosphere. (And let's not even discuss playing this game at night with the lights off!)Sonically it's top notch. The breathy wails, the voice recordings, the mechanical creaking of the collapsing station all work in unison to convey the best sound experience you'll have. There's subtlety to the sound effects too - if you're leaving a particularly noisy area and a security door closes behind you, the sound from the previous room disappears. Open the door and just stand there and it's back even though you didn't move. That kind of level of sound control is phenomenal and is used very effectively.The control system is excellent and the button layout intuitive - you can even assign favorite weapons to the D-Pad. I had no problems navigating the levels and felt any death was entirely due to my lack of skill and not a bad control layout.And you WILL get killed in this game - it's a tough one even on the easy level. During play, pure fear urges you to run through the level hoping you'll escape with engaging the demons, but skill and patience should be the order of the day.Gameplay - it's Doom. It's not GTA; there's no missions, sub games or careful strategies. Like the original (and games like Serious Sam) this is a straight forward linear slugfest with very little thinking required.To be honest, even though I was aware before purchase the game was lacking in the gameplay department, I thought D3 might be 'boring' or repetitive... but it's not. It's an adrenaline filled, genuinely scary game that works despite the simplistic gameplay and 'samey' first half.If you liked System Shock 2 and thought that game was scary then you'll be blown away by D3. Nothing comes close to it in terms of graphics and no other game has more 'boo-mammy' type moments.Doom 3 is a unbelievable sequel to D2 and should be a part of every XBox owners' game library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SX1JO","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Not perfect but it's fun and it can be quite intense and challenging","reviewText":"Sports Champions 2 is an improvement on its first iteration as a Move controller sports game that was available on 'day one' of the Move launch. It offers six activities:, Golf, Tennis, Bowling, Skiing, Archery, and Boxing. The game is a good buy if you own a Move controller and it's at it best with FOUR. The controls don't always work right, like the turning in skiing or hits in tennis, making the game very frustrating at times but the experience is generally good. The game is at its most immersive and gets you the maximum amount of fun on events such as Ski and Boxing when used with 2 Move controllers for a single player and 4 (FOUR) controllers if you are playing against another human. Not too many of use own 4 Moves but we were able to organize a 4-controller event by inviting in a friend who didn't own SC2 but happened to have 2 controllers of his own.Golf and bowling work by doing the motions you would expect when golfing or bowling. In golf you can practice swings to get an idea of power and direction and you could aim and add spin to the ball in bowling.In Tennis your avatar does the running and you only need to worry about serving and hitting the ball at the right time. Hitting the ball every time and controlling where it goes takes practice.Archery works like shooting arrows in a shooting gallery. You grab an arrow on your back with the controller, and shooting in a way more like a gun, than accounting for the arch of a real arrow. You could use two controllers, but it is mostly the same as using one.Skiing, by far the most intense of the simulations, works by using the controllers for turning, using the poles, and for hitting if you can get close enough. With one controller, you turn by pointing in the direction you want to go, and with two you move one controller higher and the other lower in the direction your want to go. You can lower yourself to go faster and stand up for more control. The game is a racing game with obstacles to avoid, ramps to do tricks, and using other players for slip-streams. This functions well, but some maps are more bland than others.The Boxing game, pretty intense too, is fun with two controllers per person, use hands to punch and the triggers to side-step, but is not as good with one. With one controller, you use it to control one hand and use buttons to punch with the other hand. Using one hand for boxing takes practice, but really isn't worth it if you have two. The way the game works is by draining your opponent's life bar to knock them down. Knock them down three times in a round to win, but their are multiple rounds with a scoring system I do not understand. You also have a stamina bar that decreases with every hit, also decreasing power, making blocking and dodging  necessary to win.Unlike the first game, you can create a few custom avatars for you or friends. The level of detail is deep allowing you to change things like facial construction, to their personality when winning and losing, to a logo they where on their clothes and equipment. You can make it so that your avatar wears different equipment in the different games, or the same thing in all of them. You also get different haircuts and equipment, and more by playing in cup mode. You can also customize equipment and earn different sports equipment like a composite bow compared to a regular bow, or a flaming bowling ball as compared to a giant 12 sided die.This does not effect performance in the game however, unless you count moral.There are three game modes: Cup, Party, and Quickplay. In Cup mode you compete against NCSs and performance testing robots to get a one to three star rank in that event, earn more equipment and styles for customization, and move up to the next, more difficult event. Party mode is for playing with people in the room with you. There is no online. Each of you take a picture to represent you, make a sound to represent you, and play through a 3, or 7 or 10 rounds of randomly selected sports. By rounds, I mean one hole of golf, or one race of skiing. When a player wins a round, they get a few seconds to draw on the pictures of the losers - fun. Quickplay also supports multiple players but can be played in single mode as well. You pick one sport and play a full game. Full game in this case means 18 holes of golf, or 5 rounds of boxing and so on.Overall, this is a fun collection of games and is a good value considering the price and the other Move games currently available. It's not perfect but I am not aware of any similar game on any platform that is.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Take it from me","reviewText":"I get that there are already plenty of reviews for potential buyers to gather their own opinion of the game, but I just thought I would weigh in on a few things that people are saying are bad about this game. Spoiler free, of course.1- The Linearity: First off, plenty of games are linear in presentation. First person shooters create the illusion of freedom when in reality you only have a certain way you can go. Side scrolling games force the player to travel from left to right... Yet, these games (especially shooters) are lauded and praised up and down even though the next one doesn't do anything different than the one before it. With that said, FF13 is just like most RPGs. In dungeons, you must go to a certain point. There are a few paths that branch off and lead to treasures here and there, but for the most part you are always traveling towards your destination. Don't believe people when they say this game is just running in a straight line. Those people obviously didn't play anymore than the first ten minutes of the game.2- The Battle System: First off, let me just that that the battle system is very similar to that of any other FF game. People think that the game plays for you, and that all the player has to do is mash X. These haters couldn't be any more wrong. If you mash X, you'll find that you can only get so far until you continuously wind up facing the Game Over screen. I can think of plenty of instances in Final Fantasy (IV, V, VI) where all the player had to do was hold down X or A (depending on what system you were playing on) to automatically select the FIGHT or ATTACK command. Yet, you'll notice that FF IV, V, and VI are never once talked about poorly for this. They don't \"play themselves\" even though you can beat them without really touching the other commands. In Final Fantasy 13, Auto Battle is just a poorly named version of FIGHT. All in all, the system is actually pretty complex and unlike most other FF games.I have played and beaten every single FF game to date. If you're a fan you're a fan. If you aren't, then don't expect to like anything that tries something new.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

Soatthiamroong","summary":"3.5 stars - Good, but DEFINITELY NOT for casual players","reviewText":"If you are intermediate or elite players and love SF II and good at it, then go for it. You can skip my review.BUT if you are casual players, like me, and you didn't plan on training hard, please read my review and think carefully before buying this game.Pros:- Graphics and animations are top-notch.- If you like SF II, this one goes back to the old formula and add some new tweaks into the battle system.Cons:- If you were forced to stick with only a few characters like Ryu or Ken back in your SF II days, that situation is coming back. Ryu, Ken, Sakura are easy enough to master all the moves. Others are useable (means casual players would be able to do some moves, but not all).  But for many of them, most of the special moves are impossible for casual players to pull off effectively in the heat of the battle (ie. Vega). And the Ultimate move of some characters (ie. Akuma, Chun Li) are nightmares.- If you couldn't use the special moves well enough, then casual players might end up with just a few useable character from 25 of them (or half of them, with some practices and a sore left thumb). And you wouldn't stand a chance even against Medium opponents on Arcade mode with the characters you can't use well. Let alone going online to be a sand-bag for those elite players. And $[...] for a game that you could only having fun with less than half of the character rosters, it's the money not very well spent.- Controls can be too sensitive for casual players to do even some basic moves. For example, a split-second longer can turn command 'UP' into 'UP UP'. When you hold left and then quickly press right, if your left thumb is not precisely hit the RIGHT directional pad, you'd end up with 'DOWN+RIGHT' or 'UP+RIGHT' instead of 'RIGHT'. All these ridiculous sensitivity issues can really be annoying and ruin your moves.- Practice mode doesn't help much. You can practice with the dummy, but there's no advice or video to show you the timing or even what the moves should look like. You're on your own. All the moves and combos must be done respectively, no skipping. If you get stuck with any move, you can't advance to the next.This I'm not sure if I'm right or wrong, and it's not pro or con. But the difficulty level seems to be set higher. Medium level can be tough. Even on Easiest, computer can still put up a fight.In conclusion:I give this game 3.5 stars. Casual player might want to think hard before paying a full price.I'm trying not to be nitpicking here. I like the characters and moves. But as a casual player who likes to enjoy ALL, or at least, most of special and ultimate moves of EVERY characters after some amount of trials, without losing my head and my left thumb, I find this game quite frustrating. For me, Marvel VS Capcom, Capcom VS SNK, or Guilty Gear are a lot more fun.However, elite players may find this game fun and challenging and give it 5 stars, and they're not wrong either.Someday it might go down to $[...], when that happens, everybody should pick this game up just for the sake of its phenominal graphics alone. But for now, rent it first, see if you're up to the challenge.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2009"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Fun Game, But Filled With So Many Flaws. I'll Elaborate.","reviewText":"First off I got to hand it off that this game is fun, but I'll get straight to flaws. If you want to look at the positive things, just look at the other reviews. I always look at the flaws because I think that's also very important, maybe even more important than the positive side.Flaws:1. Events are usually very hard (some will take you 30-1hr to get it right) or some are considered to easy and will leave you saying \"uh, okay, yay! Next event!\" why? Because you seriously wouldn't really know how the heck you won because you didn't even do much. Luck. Really hard usually has to do with time trials, where if you make a single mistake, it means you probably won't make the gold time. Think about it, it's a car crashing game and you can't hit one car or bad end or you got to do it over and over again. I mean I dealt with this with Gran Turismo, but at least there's not a bunch of cars going your way and you crossing your fingers one won't get in your path. Many cars are predictable because they will usually appear there when you replay, but some are just random and you're going at speeds that are so ridiculous that seeing many of them is near impossible, considering also the camera angle.2. Rubberband AI, at least this is what I think it's called. It makes it so that the cpu's are programmed to stay close to you to make it seem like you're having a close race. What does this mean for you? It means a rigged race. You only won because the CPU is programmed to. Unlike many other games, skill and a difference in cars doesn't mean squat. If the CPU really wanted to, he can summon enormous, outworldly powers impossible for his car to put so much room between you and him that it'll make you crap in your pants. Read #3 for more.3. No navigation map when racing. I mean I'm sort of cool with it not being there but the creator is a sneaky little guy. There's more to this and it deals with Rubberband AI that I mention in #2. No matter how fast you go or how fast you zoom past your opponent, they will catch up with you. You can make them crash 3 or 4 times or so and be ahead everytime and still have them tailgating you again. They can do that because they have special powers, used because you don't have a navigator map to see how outrageous it is. No matter how well you drive, how many boosts you got and how fast you go they usually catch up (95% of the time), especially when you race with a rival. Now how do you win? Because for some weird reason towards the end they slow down considerably so if you go super fast, they'll LET you catch up. No joke. That or you somehow manage to keep him in the back most of the time and killing him if he gets ahead. I really noticed their so called special powers when I crashed and begin driving again, saw my opponent far ahead of me in the distance and he just vanishes, only to reappear much further away. I've driven long enough to estimate and tell that he could not have been that far away, it was also during a turn as well.4. LOADING! OMG, please remember to also turn off autosave. They'll try to make you save after every event. Loading is a bit of a pain in this game. If you make a mistake and you want to retry, load time! If you want to go out to the main map, load time! If you want to play another event, load time! I mean, what really gets to me is if you just want to retry the same even over. You should quickly get to, not have to load again. Loading takes a few seconds, but they add up. It is sort of like a song, if your song skips every few seconds even only for a fraction of a second, it'll drive you crazy, so when you're in the drive playing mood, you can't keep waiting for loading. It's not super bad, just not too great.5. You can't customize cars, tune them, or anything. The cars look neat, but they are very limited. Once you won them, thats what you get and many of the cars act pretty much the same so once you drive a few of them, that's about all there is to it, slight differences here and there.More Into The Previous Flaws or Additonal Stuff:1. There's no map so you'll be driving blindly and based on memory. Almost every single car game I've played has some type of map so you can see where you're going, for how much longer so you can determine if you should use the last of your boost or conserve, and see where your opponent is.2. The game is divided into different kinds of things to do. You can race like a normal car game, explode and cause damage and score based on that, and you can also take out other cars. However, in all of them, you'll find that you'll be scoring and winning most of your races based on luck. I have not tried changing camera angle or if that's even possible, but most of the time you can't really see the car and so you'll only succeed really if you have a lot of luck. You can't rely on skill much, skill is only secondary to luck in this game.3. There are a lot of events, but winning them is considered either really hard or easy. Like I said it's based on luck. Crash is the one where you explode and rack up points. This is nice and all, but takes a lot of tries. Lets say there are two tries, just for the sake of the example. Each tries I drive almost identically. I do the exact same thing and collect the exact same items. I crash pretty much the same, however, I got 350K, then I try again and I somehow get 650K. So what the heck happen? I got the exact things and it doesn't look like I cause much of a difference. So a lot of the time you're basically getting gold in this based a lot on luck, especially scores that exceed gold rating significantly. You can't say it's really based on skill, more like luck. Then there's time racing. One crash most likely means you've failed to get the gold. YouCONCLUSION:If you're looking for a fun crashing game, this is a good game, but a few events will probably annoy you to death so you'll probably find yourself avoiding them even though you need to complete them to open other events and cars.However, if you're looking for a real car simulation, this is a joke. The rubberband AI is ridiculous and makes your racing feel like a joke, it is so rigged it's not even funny. You win only because you're either lucky or because your opponent is programmed to let you win. Of course there's skill, but you can't rely on it as much as with other more realistic games.I know I'm whinning like heck, but don't think I'm whinning because I can't win my races. I got gold on every single race and event and I drive so recklessly and fast you'll probably get car sick just watching me play. This is just my opinion as a person that really played this game and this is how I really feel about it.Want a REAL simulation that is more on skills? Forza and Gran Turismo will be much better. This is just for fun. It is definitely fun, just a bit messed up sometimes. I got it for $[...], so definitely worth it. The graphics is cool, nothing to complain about.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Kicking off the season in style","reviewText":"Let's face it, outside of the games available on Xbox Live Arcade and the Playstation Network, the summer has been pretty awful for games unless you're a massive sports fan (Madden 10) and what was supposed to be the saving grace of the 2 month drought was Batman: Arkham Asylum, originally planned for tail-end of June but a delay put it at the end of August so instead of being the game of summer, it ends up becoming the game that ushers in the game heavy Fall season. In another way too is that it does set a standard since not only is this game for once a good Batman game, it's a really damn good game in its own right. I will say that the game can be somewhat addicting as I literally beat it in one day (mainly cause I was playing nonstop) and it's got incredibly minor issues but other than that, it's nice to see an actually good Batman game.Story: You play as Batman (obviously) bringing in the Joker to Gotham's infamous Arkham Asylum to throw Joker in jail however the relative ease in capturing him as Batman a bit uneasy which proves real when Joker, with the thanks of Harley Quinn, manages to escape, lets loose the inmates and has some fun. With some other villains popping up, some really genuine storytelling moments, fantastic atmosphere and a story written by Paul Dini, one of the creators of the awesomeness that is the Batman: Animated Series, this is Batman how he should be.Graphics: Arkham Asylum is powered by everyone's favorite Unreal Engine and the weird nitpicks do pop up (rolling towards a cliff doesn't actually roll you OFF the cliff and the shimmery textures in closeup) but no one can really deny that the game looks amazing. Incredibly moody lighting, some really cool locations and character designs and you got the makes for a great game on an HD set. Oh and just one thing: during a surprising second encounter with everyone's fear-inducing Scarecrow, no that is not your Xbox crapping out on you so don't freak out.Sound/Music: In a return to my love for the Animated Series, everyone practically makes a return from Kevin Conroy as Batman to Mark Hamill as the Joker. Now, obviously Heath Ledger did a fantastic Joker in the movie but Hamill is just as stellar with the right touch of manic and disturbing. Basically this Joker loves to actually laugh but we also have Arleen Sorkin as Harley and some characters like Riddler, Killer Croc and Scarecrow popping up (whose horror segments almost stole the show, especially that first one, brrr). As far as music, there's some cool tunes but it's not really as \"there\", it's mainly mood music but don't mean it don't do the job done.Gameplay: The game is not quite open world but you'd be saying it somewhat feels like one once you start. Basically there's certain main buildings throughout Arkham that you traverse as you make your way through the story. Examples including the penitentiary but also the intensive treatment building, Arkham Mansion as well as the botanical gardens (3 guesses who shows up here but you're gonna only need one). The bulk of the game is taking down your foes and unlike Gears of War's Marcus or any FPS main man, Batman can't just duck around a corner and let his health regenerate so you got to take down enemies quietly without them knowing with several options at your disposal. You can do the never-gets-old glide kick, the silent takedown, hang people from gargoyles and many more. Later it gets progressively more difficult as alarm-sounding necklaces, booby-trapped gargoyles and some instances where you literally can't touch a single enemy until you get to someone else. What makes these sequences fun is just how much you can freak out enemies and seeing the \"terrified\" status in detective mode makes you feel quite the bully...a good-natured bully.Speaking of detective mode, pressing LB will bring up the \"Detective mode\" filter which highlights vent accesses, destructible walls, and enemy positions. It comes quite in handy as you can keep track of everyone on screen however what might bug people, maybe, is that there's no cooldown. Unlike the Snake Eye in Metal Gear Solid 4 or Gordon's flashlight in Half-Life 2, you can probably play the entire game in detective mode so it might make the game a tad too easy since enemy positions will always be highlighted with red being the ones that are armed. There's also some sequences where you have to be in the mode when you're tracking down someone's trail which can either be tobacco smoke, fingerprints and even booze. But it also helps finding Riddler trophies and challenges which are basically your collectibles for the game with Riddler coming over your earpiece telling you how awful your smarts are.The other bulk of the game is the free-form combat which is not quite button-mashing but you can make do but it boils down to X is attack, Y is counter (with a Spidey-sense type indicator over an enemy's head), B is stun while you also gain moves the more you attack without getting hit. The animations for these are outstanding as it looks like one move never seems to repeat regardless of the attack and some of the takedowns look quite brutal. One complaint I have is that in order to permanently make an enemy stay down is by either attacking enough so that a slow-motion move is done or by doing a takedown (RT and Y) but trying to do these while in combat can be frustrating since they don't give you I-frames (when attacks don't do damage since you're doing something else) so be prepared for a lot of moments of trying to do a takedown when somebody punches you in the back of the head and it cancels the takedown, letting that enemy get back up. It's not so bad in early levels but when later guys have knives, stun prods and guns, it gets kind of infuriating. Boss battles are also slightly disappointing since the encounter with Croc is basically an avoid-and-run, Scarecrow is pure stealth and some of the bigger dudes called Titans are fought the exact same way. The only genuine \"boss battle\" seems to be the last 2.Batman: Arkham Asylum is like the movies that release in early May: they kick off the blockbuster season and get things going with a bang and this is no different. After this it's practically one big release right after another and it all starts here so instead of the savior of summer drought, it's game one in what's sure to be a fall/winter season filled with good games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

This marks the first time Starfox appears on the DS and in taking advantage of how it works, it's the first time touch screen controls have been incorporated in the game. So, take the touch screen controls, the classic Starfox universe and gameplay and what do you get? A rather odd mix of old and new Starfox gameplay that's hit or miss.Starfox DS has everyone from the Starfox universe return for an all new adventure with a new main villain taking over for Andross as Lylat is in danger of being invaded. You take control of Fox McCloud as he is joined by his team to shoot down the enemies. Go from stage to stage in which you must eliminate all threats on the screen while using the stylus to draw your flight of path. For the first time, there's RTS elements in a Starfox game where using a limited amount of turns, you must defeat all enemies before you run out of turns, lose all your lives and have the enemies reach the Great Fox (massive ship where Starfox reports to.) You control your ship using your stylus for most of the time while pressing any of the buttons will shoot your lasers and bombs. Your progress is saved directly to your cart. When you want to take a break from the story mode, there 's a tutorial mode to show you how to move your ship and an online multi-player mode to take against other players from around the world.The PROS: Nintendo did not mess around this time as the Starfox universe never looked better. The graphics, music and sound effects are excellent. They wanted to keep the gameplay fresh so adding the new RTS influence along with the classic frantic dogfights in the air this game is known for was a smart move. This also brings in a new and unique challenge so players will be kept busy trying to complete the game. Since most players wanted to take the fight online, now they can as this game was meant to have online multi-player enabled so see how good you are compared to players around the world.The CONS: Adding new elements to a tried and true formula is always risky as some people may or may not welcome the changes. In this case, Starfox Command falls into this category. While controlling the ship with a stylus seems practical, it takes getting used to. Most players will have to use the tutorial mode since it's easy to forget how to swing the stylus in the heat of battle compared to using the directional pad and shoulder buttons on a traditional controller. Also, depending on whether you like RTS games, you may or may not like going through turns and phases before you enter the action and that forces you to use strategy not unlike you've seen in an action game. I'm not sure if there is an online community for this game because when I connected online, it took forever for me to find other players to play against and after a few matches they disconnected. After a few tries for a couple of weeks, I rarely found anyone online.Starfox Command will certainly be remembered as the game where Nintendo tried some different things with it. It's clear that people loved it while others weren't too keen on the changes. You can tell that I wasn't too keen on it either. While the game looks and sounds great, I found the stylus-only controls were hard to get used and since I'm not into RTS games, I didn't like the turns and phases portion of the game as well. Connecting online was easy and while the matches I played online went smoothly, finding others to play was easier said than done.If you don't mind the changes they introduced to this Starfox title, give it a try. I commend them to keeping the game play fresh but it just didn't feel right to me in the end. It might be different for you but only if you're willing to play it for yourself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2011"}

One of the first things that I noticed was that this game suffered from a few stutter\\frame rate issues, nothing that would cause the game to be unplayable, but definately noticable.  With that said for the age of this game it still looked great graphically, the voice acting was excellent, and the controls didn't take me too long to get down.Gameplay wise I really enjoyed the first half of the game more so than the second half.  I thought the first half was more of an adventure and by the middle\\end it turned into a repetitive shooter with a strange zombie twist that I was not too fond of.  It was like a combination of Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, and Resident evil (newer ones).  Sounds great but, I felt like the game struggled with it's own identity.

Of the three titles I currently own, I would have to say Lego Batman is my least favorite. There was a lot of hype built around this game, and why wouldn't there be? In the past pretty much every Batman game ever made was complete crap and this game certainly one-ups its numerous awful predecessors while at the same time being a game of family-friendly content. There are numerous playable characters, tons of goodies to find and unlock, lots of villains to face and play as, the visuals look good on PS2, there are thirty missions, lots of things to build from Legos, lots of costumes, lots of things to collect, and there are lots of vehicles to drive. But despite the numerous cool things I described about this game, it has a laundry-list of problems which prevent it from amounting to the great Batman title it should have been due to the questionable design choices Traveller's Tales made.WHAT THE GAME IS: It was supposed to be a great Batman game, what people got instead was an average title that is focused heavily and almost entirely on casual gamers by being an insultingly simplistic beat 'em up and platformer. Batman and Robin have a problem, all of their worst enemies have formed an alliance and are trying to take over Gotham City. The duo most capture these numerous villains and beat up several thugs along the way to keep Gotham crime-free. The story is super-lame, and poorly told.GRAPHICS: This game looks pretty good on PS2. All of the characters have been nicely designed in Lego form. The environmental designs are also a plus. I did however notice that the game is a bit blurry and sometimes sloppy graphically. The visuals are good, but they could have looked better despite the aging technology of the PS2.MUSIC: The music is actually pretty good, which surprised me. It's always around and it knows how to make itself even better during the key moments. Props to the person who composed the music.SOUND: The sound quality is pretty good, though I found it annoying that most of the time the sounds were enemies being beaten up. The sound effects are good overall. There is also no voice-work, all the characters do is make grunting noises.GAMEPLAY: Let's just get the worst parts of the game out of the way. Despite the fact this game has a nice combat engine, it gets dull when you continuously beat up legions of enemies by pressing the same button non-stop for minutes on end. The beat 'em up gameplay at times gave me a headache because I had to do it over and over again, and I almost never get headaches even if I play a crappy game. The vehicle controls are similar to the likes of the excellent Xbox title Advent Rising, relying exclusively on the analog sticks. But at least Advent Rising had a good camera so you could get used to the controls. Lego Batman has a camera that is panned out too far and at a stupid angle making the driving levels (five of them in total) an exercise in futility and being a nightmare to play (especially when trying to control the boat). I also received more than a few cheap deaths during the platforming due to the camera. There were also times in which I couldn't figure out where to go and I would be wandering for minutes on end looking for a way out. The boss battles and puzzles are a joke and are poorly balanced. Boss battles range to mind-numbingly simplistic to somewhat hard. The puzzles are stupid (Sorry, but after solving Resident Evil 4's brilliantly designed puzzles, all other puzzle-solving challenges look like crap) and most the time are too easy. The unlockable costumes also were a bit annoying. For example: Robin's magnet boots allow him to climb up specially marked areas to solve certain puzzles. Climbing can take quite some time to do and I got bored waiting for him to get across something on more than one occasion. Batman's bomb suit was nice, but it got in the way when building something out of Legos because the circle button is used for both building Legos and planting bombs, so every two seconds he'd whip out a bomb while I tried to build something. I hated his gliding suit, it usually provided more problems than help and it pissed me off on numerous occasions. After all these complaints I have about the game how did I give it a 7? Two words: Multiplayer and collectibles. Those are the main saving graces of the game. Playing this game with a friend is a blast and collecting and unlocking all those special features is worth it. As I mentioned before this game has a nice combat engine and there's a ton of stuff to smash. Building and finding things is a nice feature as well.OVERALL: I suggest you rent before you buy. This adventure is worth trekking through once, but once you finish it there's no reason to ever pick it up again. This is great for kids who are just starting out as gamers, but it won't appeal to more hardened gamers.THE GOOD: Lots of stuff to collect and unlock, playable characters and villains, 30 missions, good music, lots of stuff to break, lots of things to build from Legos, good graphics, and a good combat engine.THE BAD: Repetitive beat 'em up gameplay, graphics are somewhat blurry, unlockable suits cause more trouble than help, stupid camera, awful vehicle missions, and this isn't the great Batman game you were expecting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2008"}

There is something very compelling about playing with tiger cubs.As you play the game you unlock:MinigamesMore CubsMore Map sectionsDecorationsSo the more you play the more you unlock.  In the first five minutes the tour guide (bumble) explains that as you play the game you will unlock a pirate ship, a golden cub, and more.  From the look of \"fur town\", one area with huts for all the animals, you will be able to unlock a LOT of animals.  So this gives you something to look forward to.The minigames include driving, throwing a frisbee, and many more things.  I didn't find any of the mini games to be particularly new or innovative after playing \"kinect adventures\" or one of the many \"mini game\" packages for the Wii.It was sometimes hard for my daughter to get the game to react.  for example, when you are trying to \"teach\" your tiger cub to lay down you get on all fours and pat the floor.  She tried this many times and couldn't get it to work.  I'm sure its probably because she is small, or because she was not doing it completely right (maybe needs to have elbows on the ground and pat her hands).

Everyone must have been having a bad year to have created this monstrosity. We left the world of Dante with high hopes for the next installment of the DMC (Devil May Cry) series. We knew there was going to be another game and we welcomed it with open arms. Until we got it. This game is downright bad. Though the first game had hokey dialogue, just like this one, it made up for it in the level of excitement and badassery that was Dante. Now we got a Dante that has a slightly longer coat, the ability to run on walls like in the Matrix and a nonexistent level of cockiness.Dante, as a playable character, is not alone. We are forced to use a separate disc with this Lucia woman to get the grand scheme of the story. Each disc, individually, can be played through in about four hours (eight total), but the creators of the game expected you to switch back and forth between the two to understand what in the world was going on. I value my PS2 tray too much to be switching between the two like that so I played them separately and stitched together what I didn't know without a great stretch of my imagination. Simply put: the story was awful. Why Dante would even get involved with the young Lucia and the ancient Matier is reduced to the simple fact that demons are running amok. At the very least, in the first game, Dante was interested in participating in Trish's request because of her resemblance to his mother. There is only a promise of a story from Matier. So I have to run around battling demon tanks, buildings, helicopters, monkeys, aquatic tendrils, and a boss fight that is as easy as eating pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving for a story? ...I'd rather waste my time watching paint dry.If you're hellbent on playing it, play the Dante disc and just assume the storyline.

{"product_name":"B000FDOTN6","reviewerName":"Joseph Johnson \"brother/knight templar\"","summary":"No Fun","reviewText":"Why Madden as an announcer, etc gets criticized is taking all the fun out of the game. This game is not fun to play because it's very difficult to beat the computer in season games to have a winning season and make the playoffs. It is also very easy to complete long passes of over 10 yards to the recivers. The running game either gets going or it gets shut out. Defense is harder to predict and stop opponents consistantly because the play book is wide open. When you blitz it usually shuts down the run esp. early in the game and can occasionally sack and put pressure on the quarterback to make him mess up the play. The game's technical glitches seem to be fixed allowing for more realistic game play as seen in the NFL on TV in real life, however it's no fun because you can't get much offense going all the time with this new breed of NFL players. Almost all the classic 80s and 90s players are gone and the defenses and offenses both are young and inexperienced. Again, taking most of the fun out of the game a little too realistic that you need to be a video game junkie or NFL junkie to get much more out of this than an angry waste of time if you're just trying to coast through the season and make the playoffs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2006"}

Hayes","summary":"Black Rock Studios Surprises Again","reviewText":"Taking a page out of Burnouts books, Split Second serves as an arcade type racer that isnt concerned with simulating the aspect of the intricateness of the real life racing experience, but more of speed, daring close calls, explosions, and destruction.  The game succeeds in taking this motive and making it last through the 12 or so episodes (features at least 4 different types of races and events in each one).Similar to their previous game PURE, the game is a gorgeous experience through its many locales.  The camera angles used emphasize the action well.  For example, whenever an opponent or multiple opponents fall victim to a power play (you can trigger these to slow down opponents, leading them to crash), the camera will occasionally zoom in to their location and show an up close view of the wreckage; when a level 2 power play (usually also results in a course change, in which the track will change), the camera will zoom into that location and even allow the option of an instant replay view from like a camera cam to show the wreckage and devastation. These camera angles and sheer scale of some of the powerplays leads to numerous mouth dropping moments.  The games story is told through amazing adrenaline filled sequences that are full of explosions as well. The music played through races is always quite on point for the high adrenaline and is there to pump the player up and make it more suspenseful, truly it all works.Although there are a limited number of locations through the game, there are many opportunities in races for the use powerplays and shortcuts, the experience can really never get old.  The game has opponents with high enough intelligence that they will always keep at the players rear and make each finish a nail-biting one.  Enemies utilize shortcuts and powerplays extensively, so even though a player could be 5+ seconds ahead of a car, they are still within distance to be caught in a play and go all the way back to last place.  The challenge in getting first place on all tracks is definitely there.The game has numerous unlockable cars and modes. The player will experience all modes in the story mode and some are able to be played in the offline splitscreen multiplayer and online.  Races are capped at 8 players as well.The game will probably hold most players for the 40 hours if they aim for all the trophys for the game and is definitely worth the $60 buying price.  The future of DLC possible is also there as there is a section called Downloadable Content on the games menu.  The only con to the game is perhaps that drifting mechanisms, which takes awhile to get used to, but once done it can be used to keep up the speed in racers.So definitely try this game if you liked Black Rock Studios previous high definition console racer PURE, and also if you are looking for an arcade racer to fill the void in your library of Playstation 3 games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

That really can be surprising from a world class video game icon like Mario. Arguably, when Nintendo developed Mario back in the 80's, he had proven to be the most successful plumber of all time. Still, the downside comes every so often, when a game does seem to actually rev up those engines today and back then, it does seem to cool down, and it has done it here a little bit too much. After the massive success of Mario Kart 64 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo thought they had a sure hand victor again with another Mario Kart, but they were wrong.Mario Kart: Super Circuit is the first racer for the Game Boy Advance that features Mario and his gang including Bowser, Yoshi, Wario, and Princess Toadstool who is known now as Peach, and a few others. Basically, it is the same gang as it was from Mario Kart 64. The game displays 20 different tracks, that really don't seem to break out as they did before, as well as the hidden tracks from the original Mario Kart. The game is mostly like the very first Mario Kart from the Super Nintendo, without a lot to showcase. The control here is also a lot harder to go around here, and can often try to frustrate you in the process, no matter what the course is. Although it is a little bit challenging, Mario Kart may seem more like a throwback than the successor to Mario Kart 64, or even the Mario Kart: Double Dash for the Nintendo Gamecube.In all in all, Mario Kart: Super Circuit for the Game Boy Advance isn't as surprising as I thought it was. It actually seems more like another dull racer that it is on the inside, rather than the box on the outside. I only suggest this, if you haven't played the first Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo, but not if you've enjoyed the mass appeal of the other two Mario Karts.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Since that time, and since personally encountering the now-infamous lag and stuttering in the PS3 version as well as having the subsequent patch actually corrupt my brand new PS3's file system, I have deleted my prior review and decided to give Skyrim a reduced 1 star.  I've been writing reviews on Amazon for over 10 years.  I have never had to do this before with any product.From both a programming and a public relations standpoint, the PS3 Skyrim version is a complete, unmitigated disaster.  The unpatched game becomes progressively more unplayable by the 20-25 hour point, with the variation seemingly based only on how robust your PS3 model happens to be.  As an inevitable certainty, the game is reduced to a slide show where simply trying to sprint or even turn around suddenly has a high chance of freezing play completely.  It is insulting for them to suggest that this somehow escaped the notice of the handful of narcoleptics passing as a quality assurance team for Bethesda.  Worse, the CEO of Bethesda SPECIFICALLY STATED pre-release that the PS3 version would be just as stable as the Xbox 360 version.  I own an Xbox 360. The only reason I bought Skyrim on the PS3 was 1) equal stability -- a lie, and 2) better graphics, another lie.  This company flat out lies to its customers.The recent PS3 1.02 patch, which allegedly corrected or at least \"improved\" these problems, was the programming equivalent of treating a terminally ill patient by burning down his hospital and then nuking the site from orbit.  Instead of correcting the lag, it simply delayed it slightly while threading systemic instability throughout the entire game.  Since installing the patch, I have had Skyrim crash upon loading, freeze in menu screens, fail to load textures, and grind to a halt anytime more than four characters tried to interact on screen.  But little did I know that this was just the throat clearing for the grand operatic solo that was Skyrim corrupting my brand new 320 GB PS3.  How did it accomplish this miraculous feat?  Why, by crashing to \"desktop\" when I foolishly walked into a village down the road from Windhelm.  That's it.  In that moment, Skyrim froze, and then kicked me out to the main PS3 menu.  I have never had that happen before with any PS3 game.  Ever.From there, my PS3 shut down completely as I stared in disbelief at the black television screen and my suddenly inert controller.  I had to get up and cycle a hard restart, at which point I was informed -- again, in a message I had never seen before in 4+ years of PS3 gaming -- that my PS3 had shut down \"improperly\" and the file system might be corrupt.  Rebuilding it would take \"2-3 hours\", which it then attempted to do before shutting down again.  Now, I cannot get it to even restart.To recap:  a game pronounced by its designer CEO as just as stable as on the Xbox 360 but in fact apparently coded and released by a bunch of giggling anarchists turned my $300 PS3 into a paperweight.  Do not buy this game.  Do not EVER buy ANYTHING from this company again.  If you already have it, return it, and for the love of Jebus himself do not download any patches.  I have had it with Bethesda.  I am done.  See you in court.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVMYA","description":"","reviewerName":"Joel McGee","summary":"Worth the money.","reviewText":"Ever since I purchased an original GBA back in the summer of 2007 I have been hooked on Nintendo's handhelds. Each incarnation holds better hardware, and higher quality games. The 3DS is no different. It represents a true next generation leap for the system, and brings a lot of new features to the table.In terms of graphics the 3DS does represent GCN style graphics pretty well. The worlds largley feel 128 bit-ish and generally have good texture work and character models. It's not quite up to calibur of it's console counterpart in terms of resolution and scale, but that is to be expected since it is a handheld. The real draw of the visuals is the option of autostereoscopic 3D. This means you can see 3D visuals without the need for 3D glasses. While it ultimately does nothing for gameplay it makes the visual package that much more impressive. Games come to life with the 3D effect turned on. From the moment I saw it, I knew it was something worth investing in. While the quality of 3D will vary from title to title, the 3D visuals are quite nice. However, it seems like the earlier titles don't work as well with 3D (Street Fighter IV, Pilotwings Resort) Whereas the more recent titles (Legend of Zelda: OOT, Super Mario 3D Land) offer a much better 3D look. We are still very early in the systems's life, but I can already see where developers are getting a better grasp of what the system can do. One problem you will run into is the limited viewing angles. You basically have to be looking straight at the screen to view the 3D properly. It is a major drawback, and means that 2 people will have a problem seeing the 3D properly. Not only that, it's hard to stay in that \"sweet spot\" at times, particulary when using gyroscope controls. The other problem is that the depth is not one size fits all. To aleviate both problems Nintendo (wisely) added a depth slider allowing you to adjust the intensity of the 3D and if desired to turn it off completly.Sound capabilities are good. Again comparing it with the calibur of sound that you will get out of the GCN. Of course this is not going to support Pro Logic II but I can easily hear detailied things like gunshots and footsteps adequately. The volume slider makes a return as was found on the DS lite. I do miss the actual volume buttons from the DSi, but it is a minor complaint. My biggest gripe with the sound is the lack of volume in general. It's fine if you are in a quiet environment or have headphones, but dont expect to get to hear much with a TV going on in the background.Controls take a step forward with a circle pad. This is Nintendo's answer to the analog stick. It may feel a tiny bit flimsy but had held up very well in the short time that I've had it (Christmas). It's not my favorite analog stick, but it's the one that I've ever used on a handheld, and better than some consoles (like the PS3). Bear in mind that the stick needs to be flat to accomodate for the clamshell design. The rest of the buttons are identical to the DSi, in other words: tried and true. The diamond layout with shoulder buttons works, and that is why it's not changed. With all due respect to the GCN pad, the diamond layout just work better. The only minor change to the layout is the D-pad has been moved down to accomodate for the circle pad. The 3DS (unlike the DS) has been made to play in 3D environments. A second circle pad on the right would have been nice for camera controls, but Nintendo has instead opted to sell that as an add on for current model. The slide pad pro is expected to arrive stateside in Februrary. Also new to the 3DS's control scheme are gyroscope controls. When in use the system becomes sensitive to movement. An example of this is in Star Fox 64 3D, you can control your arwing using the gyro controls, tilt the sytem in any direction and it responds in kind. For the most part they work quite well. I loved the gyro aiming in Legend of Zelda, and using the binaculars in Super Mario 3D land. As I stated earler using gyro controls with the 3D on usually doesn't work very well because of the limited viewing angles. As such there is usually a manual option using the circle pad, the ease of use is going to vary from title to title but the viewing angles are are hardware issue, not a software issue. The system includes 2 camera's, one facing towards you and the other facing away. These are used to record video, take pictures and scan QR codes. It's disapointing that the cameras are still the ridiculously low resoultion of .3 mexapixels (most cell phone cameras are at least 1 MP) and lag horribly like the DSi's. But with the added functionality of being able to record 3D pictures and video, it does make it a bit more digestable. You still have the option to save/export multimedia to an SD card (now included 2GB) and use the onboard tools to edit, so that is a nice feature. And yes, you still can play AAC files (still no MP3 or WMA for God knows what reason).At first glace the 3DS and DS are nearly identical, save for the circle pad. The DS design is (much like the controls) tried and true. That is the reason it remains fundamentally unchanged. That is not to say it is the same as there are numerus asthetical changes that have been made. First, the exterior shell keeps that glossy ipod like plastic. Yes, it's still a fingerprint magnet, but now the whole body keeps that design througout. I'm not sure why they reverted back the DS lite sytle ditching the matte (grittier) feel of the DSi, but they did. It's not a huge issue, and I even like it, but it is noteworthy. The sytlus location has returned to the top of the unit (like the original model DS) and is now telescoping. I am a huge fan of the new stylus, very cool, classy and modern. You can adjust it to fit your hand, a nice leap forward. The start and select buttons have moved to fit under the touch screen with a new \"home\" button in between. They may be more accessable but in all honesty I don't care for them. They don't offer a tactile feel like the DS lite's do. Don't get me wrong, they are buttons, but I always have to look and ensure I am pressing the right button. With the DSi the power button was the home button, you simply pressed it to reset as opposed to holding it to shut down. I miss that from the DSi. The power button is on the bottom right. It feels okay, and I suppose it's enough out of the way to keep me from accidentally pressing it, but I still prefer the DSi setup. At least it's not like the DS lite's power button on the outside of the unit. There is a nice amount of weight to the system, not like the DSi XL's, but a genuine this is a quality piece of hardware kind of weight. I can still play it laying down on a couch too, something I cound't comfortably do with the XL. One thing that most consumers might not notice (I certainly didn't) is the curious lack of a microphone port. The headphone jack is in the middle of the bottom of the unit, but alas, sans the microphone port nearby. Even as an avid DS player I have never bought headphones for the system, let alone even used the port. There was little reason to purchase said accessory, so few games used, I could hardly imagine many people online to even talk to. It seems that Nintendo is now intent on omitting the option entirely. I'm not entirely sure how to feel about that. I don't miss it, but isn't communication a part of playing online?The menus are much better. The home menu is a simiar sytle to the DSi and Wii but is better layed out. You have quick links for built in apps like friends list and internet, and your other apps (like Mii maker, and downloadable games) are found in a channel boxes. They can either be viewed in one long row (like the DSi) or in rows of two (more like the Wii) I chose the 2 row options. You can move around the apps by touching them (holding the stylus down for a sec) then moving them. It's not as intuitive as the other 2 systems, but does work. The shopping channel is VASTLY superior to both the Wii shop and the DSi shop. The shops on the Wii and DSi were horrible, bare bones, laggy and antiquated menues were a pain to navigate. The 3DS eShop is a godsend. It not only looks more modern, but is much more responsive, easier to navigate, and combines the shopping with the information. No more having to move from one app to the other, it's all in one place. Finally! The only gripe I have is that it doesn't archive very well. Sure you can search through different games pretty well (the new search function is great) but try to look through the 500 point DSiware games on the 3DS shop like you could on the DSi, not going to happen. They need a better system for that. Thankfully it's updated frequently, that should be an issue. The performance certainly better, I have very little trouble streaming 3D videos. The same cannot be said about the Wii.The DS also comes with some other features worth mentioning. If you close your system while it is still on, it will enter sleep mode (something original DS owners should be familiar with). This low power requirement mode will activate a function called street pass. When manually enabled (per title) you can can trade data between systems. It works like this: say two people have the same title such as Mario 3D land, you pass by each other, and without any manual imput, you trade data. Provided you both have street pass enabled for the same title, and both have the system on, the data transfers unbeknownst to the users. Now you won't be trading any personal information, but there is something immediatly cool about getting a present with someones mii attached. It's features like this that set the 3DS apart anything else. Another app called Nintendo Zone allows you to connect to a company's marketing (like Best Buy) and view videos or download content, from there you can seemlessly connect to the internet, no setup required. Finally there is the AR games. AR stands for augmented reality. This essentially means that you can combine the real world with a game world. The system comes with AR cards which are nothing more than cards with disgued QR codes that the 3DS can read with it's cameras. So you set the card on a flat surface, then the cameras read the code and suddenly a box pops up (in 3D!), you shoot the box with the A button, and more pop up, then a dragon appears, you have to move around using the gyro contrls to shoot targets from other angles. You can then take a 3D picture of that dragon using the camera. The first time I did that it simply floored me. That is the Nintendo I know, that defines the word inovation.Then we come to the games. We all know this is the heart and soul of any gaming system. While the launch lineup wasn't as good as it could have been, things are slowly starting to change. There is a small but growing collection of great games for the system. The list is as follows: Super Mario 3D Land, Legend of Zelda:OOT 3D, Mario Kart 7, Star Fox 64 3D Street Fighter IV, Dead or Alive Dimessions, Pilotwings Resort, and Steel Diver. While everyone has different tastes, those are the best games on the system starting with the first. Even the eshop is gaining some respectable titles, games like: Pushmo, Mighty Switch force and classics like Metroid 2 are now available. Bear in mind also that the 3DS is backwards compatable with DS games, and DSiware (with a few exceptions). While the library is small, it's constantly growning with some great games on the horizon. And if you haven't checked out the back catalog of DS games there are tons to chose from.Finally to conlcude an aready too long review, I have to address complaints. I have addressed the cameras, buttons, and screens. But one thing I do want to talk about is the battery life. For those of you who owned previous Nintendo handhelds and enjoyed 12-17 hours of battery life (depending on system, and use) you can offically kiss those days goodbye with the 3DS. The battery life is 3-5 hours, depending on use. It is disapointing, I truly thought that even with the improved specs we should have at least got double that. It does essentially make the system less portable. But not all is doom and gloom. Nintendo knew this was an issue and included in the package is a charging cradle. Now normally this would be somewhat of an accessory (at least in my eyes) and I probably would have never purchased this seperatley. But I must say, I do really like it. I leave it next to my other charger on a stand next to my TV. When I'm not playing it, there it is charging. It's not like the regualar charger that I have to kinda set up, it's acutally suprisingly convenient. It does take some of the sting away from the issue. And it uses the same charger as the DSi and XL, so you don't want to trade in that car charger! There are third party options for an extended battery pack, Nyko makes one for a reasonable price, and I've heard good things but I generally shy away from third party products. Most likley scenario, it will be fixed in a redesign sometime in the future.Other than that I have nothing really bad to say. While flawed the 3DS is a good system and hopefully soon to be great system. I really love how Nintendo has updated and modernized the DS; it's a natural evolution for it. And it comes with a 4 out of 5 star reccomendation. I'm sure the next version will have a lot of the issues worked out, with a larger library of stellar games. For those who are impatient, it's definitley worth the $169 asking price. you are getting a good product for the money, and it's something you wouldn't need to update for several years if you don't want to. The lowered price (the launch price was $250) makes it a much more reasonable purchase than it initally was. But for those who want a better deal, I would wait. The system isn't going anywhere any time soon. I don't see another price drop in the near future but a sysem redesign could be as early as this year. Either way you go the 3DS has got a great set of features at a reasonable price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"GintaxAlvissforever","summary":"An Addicting Fire Emblem Game that I Claim is the Best the Nintendo Has Given Us","reviewText":"This game is amazing. It's up there with the best 3DS games made along with Kid Icarus Uprising in terms of sheer epicness.They improved on everything in Fire Emblem and made it fantastic.Gameplay: The game is still the same in terms of the weapon triangle but some things have been removed or easier to use. The magic no longer has a weapon triangle, light magic is removed and dark magic is overpower (again). New weapons are added and its generally much easier to max out in weapon efficiency given it shows you how long until the next level. In this game, now you can partner up with your allies and they can increase your efficiency in battle from being able to avoid an attack, to higher hit rate and if your rank is high enough, they can join in on a double attack or shield you from a devastating blow at times. Oh yeah, and if the game stresses you out, you can turn off permanent death to enjoy the story and then go back for a challenge.Support: Now you support with almost everyone and getting everyone married. Only one S support person person though while everyone can have an A rank and be useful to pair up. My complaint about the support is that sometimes the S support romances come out of nowhere and seems OOC for some characters while others it's generally adorable and you can feel the romance bloom between the characters. The other complaint (and it's minor) is the lack of male/male and female/female character can get S support. Now this ties in with a plot point in the game but it's still disappointing for there to not be one gay support pairing (and we get it set up with Libra being the Lucius of the game complete with the feminine voice and complaining about being mistaken for a girl). Not enough to detract from the game but alas...Music: One of the best in video game history by far especially the song in episode 10 OST 37 and the final battle theme stand out the most in term of emotions. The music is so divine that saying epic multiple times wouldn't be enough. You need to hear it yourself or on Youtube.Artwork: I like the shift in artwork because it makes it cleaner and works for a 3DS game.Story: The story is similar to all Fire Emblem games. War is going to break out soon and Chrom's sister who they call Emm is doing all of her power to prevent the wall, but alas the war ends up breaking out anyway against the enemy nation because of his desire for blood shed. This is only THE FIRST PART of the game. Won't spoilt the second half of the game because that's where the major plot twists come in.Characters: Thanks to the support system of this game, the character development through the support conversation is perfect and you learn different things about the characters. With Robin (the default name of the Avatar I think), s/he is able to flesh out (and marry) many of these characters. In this game, most units are no longer terrible (I still look at Donnel though given how crappy his stats are even when I'm not RNG screwed). The problem I have with one character is how the English translation handled Henry. He's supposed to be a sympathetic character despite his insanity but the english version apparently changed his lines to make him more insane (think Russia from Hetalia or Joker from Batman in terms of insanity) and seems to remove his sympathetic qualities that made him endearing in support conversations where he gets married. Not like this stopped me from marrying him but it's still jarring how he gets changed while Tharja remains the same.Overall, I would give this game a 95/100 because of the small complaints I had. A must have game for the 3DS like Kid Icarus Uprising. Your money won't be wasted and if you get the game early, you'll get a free Marth DLC.Which is another thing. This game LOVES referring to the other Fire Emblem games especially the ones that didn't make it to the west.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}

N","summary":"Almost more trouble than it's worth...","reviewText":"Note: This review is based on this reviewer's experience with one of the earliest manufacturing runs of the new, slim design PS2. It is possible that Sony has addressed some of the issues I refer to in newer runs; though with their track record I seriously doubt it in some cases.In all honesty, to say the PS2 (and the original PS) was/is not a great gaming system would be a complete, bald-face lie. Considering their systems have beaten back competition despite never being the most technologically advanced competitor in the running speaks volumes, but to make such a statement is ultimately misleading. In reality, the PS2's success (and Sony's success for that matter) really has comes from the plethora of great titles from a handful of solid developers, not from the hardware.Playstation's biggest failing (other than the PS2 Hard Drive and any kind of quaility online play) has been overall quality. When I talk overall quality, I don't mean how many polygons the machine can push at any given second as that's relatively unimportant in the vast scheme of things, but rather the machine's overall durability and structural integrity. One might think this re-design might solve some of these issues from the original PSX and PS2. Well, in short, it doesn't.It may be true Sony is not the only company that has had hardware problems cast a shadow over their console (the original Nintendo would be a prime example), but Sony seems defiant in learning lessons from it's own past considering hardware problems have been a consistent factor throughout their history. Here are a few examples concerning the slim PS2:#1: Never buy a slim PS2 and think your going to kill two birds with one stone with a game/DVD combo. This is the biggest misconception people have; over time the PS2 will eventually have trouble running about half of anyone's DVD collection, especially anything that runs off a dual-layer DVD. The fact my Family Guy and Futurama DVD box sets won't run on the machine after having it for a year and a half proves this to me. The PS2 is no substitute for an actual DVD player, so don't be cheap and save yourself a headache and buy a DVD player to boot.#2: The situation with dual-layer DVD's also applies with many games that use the format as well. I can literally spend hours trying to get my Wild ARMS Alter Code:F and God of War to work, yet when I insert the same games into my friends old-model PS2 that is twice as old they work right off the bat. That's not right, especially considering those games where brand new.#3: The fact you can NEVER fully shut the machine off (less you unplug it) like one would with the switch in back of the older PS2's raises too many questions. Anyone familiar with the original PSX knows even when the power was shut off, that it still drew in a minimal amount of electricity. This was probably one of the main factors that attributed to the original PSX's problems. Why would you bring back such a potentially damaging feature? When I turn the machine off, I want it COMPLETELY off. That's what OFF means Sony!#4. Anyone who purchased one of the newer slim model PS2 shortly after it was introduced probably found it nice when there was a voluntary recall on the power pack. Yeah, that just makes me trust in Sony's products even more. The risk of fire and burns always goes well with any gaming experience.Despite everything I have said above, if you like the games the PS2 contains in its gaming library, you're going to buy it anyway (hell, I did). However, as with any system, I would definitely advise against buying any kind of Playstation hardware the minute it comes out (outside of the initial price).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}

Its half the size of the original! Still a rugged mainstream console.","reviewText":"I have used this for a few years now and have enjoyed my time with it. I have bought the stand to make a vertical system and have some extras like the remote control which I highly recommend if you like to watch DVDs. As a games console the PS2 is the leader and so it has a limitless choice of games, however I will say that for some reason over the past few years there has only really been a handful of solid gaming entries and everything else is mediocre and PC graphics are a way ahead of the PS2 now, so if you are a game player looking for the best gaming experience then the PS2 is not for you. What you need is a new computer and a very good graphics card with an ADSL modem or better. PS2 games can be very expensive (4 top shelf games and you have the price of a PS2 - 20 top shelf games and you have the price of a computer we where just talking about.) If you own a PS2 then a DVD store rental card is a bonus and really that rental store card is what the PS2 is about for you. If you do not have that card then I hope you have lots of money or friends to trade with.I find myself using this box for mostly watching DVD movies and renting games. I buy a new game once every two months (usually a top shelf game) and that keeps me going. For the PS2 I think the type of game that suits the console best is a 3rd person survival game or something like Grand Theft Auto. Beat em' ups are good on it as well. However the PC dominates Sims, RPGs and 1st person shooters. Maybe the PS2 has some influence on sports games like SSX and Tony Hawk but everyone knows that the better experience for these games is on the PC. So what games you prefer really has an impact on if you want a PS2 or not. Maybe a PC is really what you need?I watch lots of DVDs and with the remote control the PS2 plays like a joy including a special region-free disc that you can buy (its dirt cheap) allowing you to watch anything that comes on a DVD. I have found some incompatibility with some movies (2 in 300) but this is mostly the fault of the DVD producers and not Sony. So 99.9% of movies will play on a PS2. That is not bad. The image quality is not the best but pretty darn good all the same. You can also hook up surround sound to the PS2 no problem and play Dolby Digital or DTS. The PS2 does have one drawback in this department though. The internal fan makes a hell of a lot of noise so you need to keep the sound up to send that to the background. It can be annoying at times. As a DVD player the PS2 has really been used to the max and I have only good things to say about that.I have also used the PS2 to play CD music through my televisions sound system. It has made my hi-fi system now redundant. So as a console it has lots of media options other than just the games console and that is what really makes it worth its while. However as a games console I must say that I have not been let down that much (games like GTA: Vice City, Silent Hill 3, Manhunt, MGS, Devil May Cry, made the console for me) but there could be a lot better first class PS2 games out there by now. I think there are less than 10 really outstanding games on the PS2 and a way more options on a PC for better games.Anyway what you like in games is up to you. I have had the PS2 now for years and it is a workhorse that still does its job. I have no complaints about this system except maybe to hope that more developers try pushing the limits of what this box can do. I am currently looking forward to the new Resident Evil game.Pros:- Relatively cheap console.- A wide of variety of games to choose from.- Expandable.- Great DVD player (with remote control improves this vastly).- Reliable and rugged.- A standard that will never phase out.Cons:- Games are very expensive.- The fan makes a lot of noise.- A PC maybe really what you want.- It has taken ages for some good games to arrive.Overall this a great evolution for the games console. If you have the money and want a portable media system that plays games, DVDs and CDs then the PS2 is really convenient and manageable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2005"}

So far, in my book, Grand Theft Auto IV has that title. The characters are hilarious, and many times, have a story behind them.If there were anything I could change about this game, It would be the monochromatic environment. By that I mean, unlike San Andreas, there is, for the most part, only one terrain type, and that is city.

If there could ever be a game as graphically...amazing.... as GTA4, have the variety in vehicles, peds, and missions, and the same increcible gameplay, yet have the same massive and varied environment as San Andreas, that game would most likely win the best game of all time.So apart from the lack of terrain variety, and the strange appearances of vehicles of the same kind you are driving parked on the side of the road, This game is PERFECT.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

You stay for the bling.","reviewText":"Let's face facts: when it comes to certain purchases, you're buying it for more than the overall value. Such is the case with the Nyko Wiimote charger.Yes, you would ultimately save more money just buying rechargable AA batteries and a standard battery charger. Going the Nyko route, though, offers the convenience of not having to swap out batteries, and the luxury of ALWAYS having a fully charged controller.While I looked into getting this because I needed a rechargeable battery option for my Wiimotes, I ultimately got it because it straight up looks cool. The design of the base station and the replacement battery covers blends in perfectly with the Wii. If it weren't for \"Nyko\" being displayed prominently on the front of the base station, you'd think it came with the system.Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2007"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"You Better Have A Top of the Line PC to Run Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion","reviewText":"First of all, I want to say I was really lucky last night to find a copy of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion at a local CompUSA store.  I called around to different stores yesterday and most stores were already sold out of the game. That to me is amazing because the game just came out.  The game is already extremely popular.  Most stores are already sold out of the game and the game is on back order.  I bought the last PC version of the game at the local CompUSA store. I had put in an order to Amazon.com to buy the game, but they sent me a E-mail saying I wouldn't get the game until some time around April 5 because of back orders.  I'm sorry, but I can't wait that long.  When I found the game at CompUSA, I hurried and ran back home and got on the internet to cancel my order to Amazon.Now to tell you a little bit about the game, I installed the game and the game installed just fine.  Where I had a problem is when I went into the game and the opening menu and opening scenes came up at the beginning of the game, you're automatically taken to a screen where your supposed to make your main character for the game.  I noticed that when I moved my cursor around, it was moving super slow and skipping around.  I thought to myself this isn't good and I knew right then I have to not only bring down all the graphics settings, but also turn the music off.  So I turn down the graphics settings and turn off the music and then I got out of the game and then went back into the game again.  Same problem again so this time I took a lot of stuff off my hard drive to clear up more free space on the hard drive in my computer and then I did a full disk scan on my hard drive.  I then went back into the game and tried it again and this time the game worked better. The cursor moved around more freely.  I then made my main character for the game and then I started the game. The game itself is great. The game has a very rich storyline and all the characters in the game look great.  I have only played the game for two hours now, but for the first two hours in the game all I have been able to do so far is just go around through the dungeon.  I'm not even out the of the dungeon yet.  Can you imagine how big this game is if I'm still playing in the dungeon after two hours of playing?  I can already tell this game is massive in size.  It will literally take months to play and explore the whole game.  This game is very addictive.  So far, I have already fought against thieves, rats, and goblins in the dungeon. My favorite weapons so far are a short sword and a iron bow.  It's so much fun to shoot arrows into the rats.  It's also really neat that you can go pick up the arrows you already shot and use them again against something else.I thought I'd let you know I have a top of the line PC with a great graphics card and I have plenty of ram in my PC.  You need a top of the line PC to play this game.  My advice to you before you play this game is to free up as much of your hard drive as you can, get the latest setting for your graphics card, get the latest DirectX 9.0c, do a full disk scan on your hard drive and probably the most important thing is to use your Disk Defragmenter to defragment your hard drive. For most computers, that means it will probably take at least 24 hours to defragment the hard drive which means turn on your computer before you go to bed at night and let it run over night.Now do I recommend that you go out and buy Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion?  If you have the proper PC to run this game, by all means, definitely go out and buy this game.  This game in my opinion will be getting a ton of awards and will probably be in the running for the Game of the Year Award. It is one of those games that people will be talking about for years to come, it's that good.  I highly recommend that you go out and buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}

However, Nintendo--after having released Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on the Wii several years back--has gone back and taken its prizeworthy formula and implemented it on all 3 games and packaged it as a single game!  Is it worth the full price?  You bet!You get lovely eye-candy graphics (even for a Wii - it's beautiful) with Wii remote motion controls that allow you to pivot your aim naturally with the nunchuck controlling your movement.  It's such a natural fit that you can't believe that this game could ever have been played on a cramped controller without the ability to aim by pointing at the screen.  Most controls take a little learning curve, but once learned, you'll never forget them.This is how a FPS is meant to be played on a console that allows you to take aim with something that points instead of something that you try to get a feel for on a joystick that you twirl around, taking you out of the action.As for the game itself, there are plenty of puzzles to be had in addition to the shoot 'em up action that most FPS have.  Levels are not necessarily linear...you may go down corridors and mazes that end up in access points that you can't quite get through yet.  Some of these access points build-up on each other requiring different armors or weapon upgrades in order to completely pass unexplored areas.  Some upgrades are not necessarily required, but are nice to have thus requiring some skill in mastering how to jump, morph into a ball (one of Samus's--the character that you play--abilities for the uninitiated), and bomb-jump your away into certain keyed access points.  It's fun and the formula doesn't get old.Also, the ability to scan various aliens and objects gets you immersed in a wealth of background information of alien species, ancient alien cultures, etc., that augments the overall experience in the game.  Some of it is necessary and some of it is not, but it adds up to a FPS that goes beyond the conventional traversing from point A to point B and destroying everything in between because it's there to be shot.Levels are quite expansive and challenging, but not overly-challenging to the point of frustration.  There's a great blend of difficulty that will keep you coming back for more with many hours of gameplay ahead...and that's just for 1 out of 3 titles.  Now, imagine playing 2 additional games of that caliber in one package...and that's what you get in Metroid Prime Trilogy.I highly recommend this game.  This is how the Wii is meant to be played by FPS enthusiasts everywhere.  Keep it up Nintendo and 3rd party software vendors...please take notes!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"Amazing, An instant Favorite!","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts is an instant Favorite, from the first cut scene, to the defeat of the dark wizard.

The controls are quite responsive, and as in every previous iteration, it takes longer to watch the end credits than it does to beat the game in story mode.And... as in every previous iteration, there are unreasonably long \"Now Loading\" screens, though they've improved the speed in Arcade Mode.And now... a word about Star Wars...WHAT?Sure, I knew that Darth Vader was going to be in the PS3 version, and Yoda in the Xbox 360 version, and blah, blah, blah. I figured they were just unlockable characters that I was free to ignore.Not so, in Arcade Mode. Not only are you inexplicably transported to space after level 6, but the two Star Wars characters become ridiculously difficult to beat for no obvious reason. We're talking Shang Tsung or Motaro cheap from the Mortal Kombat series.It isn't that they're unbeatable. It's just that it makes no sense at all. I don't think I've ever seen a licensed product so obviously shoehorned in to a game. It totally kills the mood of the game, and the \"spend 15 minutes, then make a sandwich\" gameplay.Getting back to Story Mode, when you finish with a character, you don't really get any sort of story or closure as you did in previous versions of Soul Calibur. Instead, you get a three-second variant of \"now I have it!\", followed by a black screen with a sentence or two.If you haven't played any of the previous versions, you may enjoy this. Or, if you're really big in to Star Wars, I guess you'll get a kick out of playing as Darth Vader or The Apprentice.

Johnson","summary":"Just get a rocket launcher and blast away; Unplayable online","reviewText":"I bought this game for 49.99 and took it back the next day because I found it to be painfully boring and virtually unplayable online.  I then decided to give it another chance and bought it used for 17.99.  Nothing has changed. I should have saved my 18 bucks.First off I would like to say that the graphics in this game are excellent, but that is where the good ends.  If you have this game on PC, then don't waste your money on this.  It is virtually the exact same game, with more cumbersome controls.  Nothing compares to a keyboard and mouse and this couldn't be more true for this game.  The pace and speed of this game is not suited for anything other than a keyboard/mouse combo.  It seems Atari rushed this game out without taking the controls into consideration.Now for the XBOX Live portion, which is probally the reason most people bought this game.  First of all, finding a game on the servers can be a bit of a chore.  When you do actually select a game to play, you have to cross your fingers to hope that the game will actually let you in.  More often than not, you will be booted from the server before you actually join the game!  Expect to try at least 10 times before actually getting in a game.When you FINALLY get in a game, besides the lag in 80% of the games, you will almost immediately see that the game is nothing more than pure &quot;chaos&quot; as reviewer &quot;ultimatexhammer&quot; so acurately put it.  This game requires NO skill.  Just get a rocket launcher and fire away at random targets.  Sometimes you'll hit your enemy most of the times you won't.  And don't even think about stopping to actually aim at an enemy; chances are you'll be dead before you even get to shoot.  The weapons in this game are cool and all (minus the sniper rifle replacement), however you rarely have enough time to select them and use them correctly due to the cumbersome controls and the fact that this game is pure luck for the most part.  You get the occasional gamer that performs extremely well online, but for the most part this game is nothing but running around and shooting at anything that moves hoping that someone does not shoot you in the back for the 100000th time.  And if this wasn't bad enough, some custom levels actually have enhanced laser cannons that kill you in one shot no matter where it hits you. If you thought you died fast in normal games, imagine dying as soon as you spawn over and over and over again.  No fun at all.The other games on UC, like bombing run and capture the flag would be fun because in theory they require strategy.  But again this game is too chaotic and random for any strategy to ever be a factor in these games either.To bluntly put it, this game is boring.If no skill, random dying and ultimate chaos is your cup of tea, then you will feel right at home with UC.  Otherwise stay clear of this game.  It wasn't worth 49.99 and it is not worth 17.99 either.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2004"}

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Whipple McTeelson the Third \"Purveryor of Mad...","summary":"Being Late Really isn't Better than Never","reviewText":"Yikes.  Even after a year where the typical Wii U console has been spending more time on the shelves than in someone's home people still don't know this thing is not a Wii.  I've been to video game stores and heard parents trying to get Lego Underworld for their kids only to be told that it ain't for the Wii.  The shock on the people's face as the store clerks try to explain the Wii U as being a whole new console couldn't be easy when it came out.  Now imagine trying to sell one of these things right after the PS4 and Xbox One came out.  \"Yep, it's part of the new gen but nope it's nowhere near as powerful.  It's like the same level as a PS3 or 360 but 6 years late.\"  Luckily nobody is working on commission in retail anymore.And what is the point of owning any nintendo console.  Big whoop so I got the one and only Mario Kart game that i can play on my tv screen for the next 6-7 years til the next console comes out.  Big whoop repeat that sentence and add in 'Super Smash bros', 'zelda' 'mario 3d game' and maybe hopefully 'Metroid.'  Who cares if Nintendo has great franchises if they come out once a cycle.  Would it really kill them to crank out a Mario Kart game every 2 years.  I don't care if it's more of the same unlike the great militia that demands true innovation or nothing else.  Well, with Nintendo all we get is nothing else more times than not.  Is it that hard to create some fun unique tracks every few years.  Who can keep playing the same tracks or the same platform levels year after year????And what is it with that iPad clone controller.  Second screening is overrated for a game console or complementing whatever else is on the tv screen.  I don't have a second screen going to get more into what i'm watching.  that second screen is to feed my ADHD.  i got to multi-task.  And when I'm playing a video game the only second screening I'm doing is during the load screens-and on a PS4 I ain't got time for that anymore.  (Have you seen it-the thing is super fast.  They call it lightning.)What else?  I dunno.  Maybe Nintendo should scrap the entire console approach.  They make amazing games (however long it takes them just to be super redundant.)  They'd only sell far more if they were on cross-generation/multi-platform consoles.  And they wouldn't have the expense of making consoles.  They could do what Sega did but just keep making great games-something Sega forgot how to do.Seriously though.  I had a NES, SNES, 64, and Wii.  (seeing that the wii was a gamecube with motion controls then I had that gizmo too.)  But that's it for me.  I'm tapping out on the Nintendo experience.  The Wii U is pointless.  How could they try to come out with a true 7th gen console one year before the 8th began.  So the Wii U is technically more powerful than the PS3 or 360.  That's like WWII lasting into the 50s and the German luftwaffe rolling out the greatest propeller fighter as we roll out the jet fighters.  Big yip.And the name?  Wii U.  Great way to confuse the customers.  If a salesman has to explain it's a new gen console and not just another blatant needless accessory like the foot pad gimmick or the wii controller add-on gimmick or the other nonsense nintendo cranked out they weren't selling nothing.Cause let's just say it.  The Wii sold 100million consoles cause of that one gimmick-motion control that only worked on the demo free packed in Wii sports game.  And 50million consoles were bought by people that were never ever going to buy another console under any circumstances.  it's like the WWE getting Robert Downey Jr dressed up as Iron Man to fight Johnny Depp as a pirate at Wrestlemania.  100Million people would pay for that PPV but they ain't turning in next year when it's the Miz headlining the show.  And of those 50million people that bought the Wii they then bought Carnival Games and that was it for them.  Or they bought shovel ware having no clue cause they just couldn't be bothered doing a little research of their own.  The business model wasn't sustainable with the dreck software people foolishly bought.The Wii was the machine that coulda replicated the 1983 drought back during the glory years of the Atari 2600.  I lived through that.  We all bought games based on nothing more than the cheap price and the pretty art on the box cover.  The Wii had the same garbage being passed off by fly by night software companies.  Beer Pong?  Hulk Hogan's Wrestling Game?  Lawn Darts?  Entire games were sold for $30-$50 that had about .75GB of memory.  So Nintendo deserves what they got coming.  They sinned with the Wii and they sinned again.Sadly though I've outgrown the need for Nintendo in my life there are still some fools out there with the golden nostalgia that will buy a nintendo to put it in front of their kids.  Or they'll just buy some 'apps' on the iPad for the kiddies and swear that this is a great cheap way to kill time.  Personally i don't care.  People do stupid stuff all the time.  Nintendo's executives proved that over and over again.There is a reason there is just about zero 3rd party support.  To know which way the wind blows all it takes is one good whiff.  And the Wii U is a p-u on this issue.  If you like lesser versions of EA & Activision et al games then play this to your hearts content.  Me?  I got higher standards.  Things won't get better.  Nintendo fanboys can lie to themselves all they want.  You sad delusional fanboys break my heart.  But no amount of wanting something will make it come to be no matter how hard you click your ruby slipper heels.Still though I due rue the day I didn't pick up the Virtual Console for $40 at a EGB at the mall.  If I come across a Wii U for $40 in a year then I'm going back on everything i read in this review and I'm gonna love me some Wii U.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

It's easy to play and fun for the entire family.  There is just something grossly fun about knowing more trivia than someone else and getting more points than them.The bundle comes with Buzz Quiz TV game with 4 wireless buzzers (batteries sold separately).  I have heard some say that the wireless buzzers will also work with the Playstation 2 for the older Buzz games, but this version of the game only works with the PS3 since it is a Blu-Ray disc.You can play by yourself, which is very boring since there is no exhilaration from answering questions correctly.  However, when you get another person playing with you, and you beat them to the punch when the questions come out, that is pure excitement.  There are over 5000 questions, and they all range from stuff like \"Who played .... in .... movie?\" to \"Who voiced .....in this cartoon?\"You can even play online against others live which is great since you will always have a competitor available to challenge and earn trophies in the PS Network.  Surprisingly, every time I signed online to play people, there was always someone available.The Buzzers feel nice and sturdy and quite light.  The buttons are layed out in a straight 4 color sequence running down, and answering questions just correspond with the answers sequence on the screen.  The colors don't even matter if you cannot remember which button is which color.  There are 4 buttons, and only 4 answers on the screen and they all go top to bottom.  Anyone can instantly pick this up and play it.If you have a lot of family or friends, buy an extra set of buzzers, and up to 8 people can play together, or make teams of 2 for up to 16.The only complaint I have is that mine do not work with my Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries.  They only seem compatible with Alkaline batteries.  I am not sure if this is how they are designed or I just have a weird set of buzzers, but make sure you have a pack of 8 Alkaline batteries when you buy them.With over 5000+ questions and online updates, and the ability to create your own quiz questions, or download community made ones ( I haven't tried this yet), this game will keep you and your friends entertained for hours.Holidays are soon approaching, so make sure you have this ready so the entire family will have something to do.

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"More of the same, but a bit better","reviewText":"Well I might as well start off saying that GTA4 is a pretty good refinement of the well loved series. The story and voice acting are good, and actually flow fairly well. There is even some good character development, not a lot for the NPCs, but still some. There are also a good amount of interesting missions. But after not too long it starts to get very repetitive. Some missions are frustratingly difficult as is the standard, but must be beat in order to advance. As usually you are initially locked into one area when you start the game and unlock other areas through mission completion. Which is well and good but that prevents this from being a true 'open world' experience. I have never been thrilled with the GTA control scheme and this is no different. The controls are not as responsive as I like, and buttons are assigned to many actions. So you will find your character doing something other than you want him too fairly often. The shooting and targeting system is much improved, but the lock on system is poor. Personally I hate GTA4, I find it repetitive and annoying with a good amount of mission success resulting from just dumb luck. There are far too many chase missions, some you have no trouble with and some you will be constantly foiled by NPC drivers. If you are already a GTA fan this is more of the same, but slightly better and you will love it. If you are on the fence I would recommend a rental. And if you are luke warm to the series this iteration isn't going to convert you. Good gaming.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

At its heart, it's a co-op game where you team up with either an AI partner or a real life partner to take out numerous terrorist threats the world over.  Is it groundbreaking?  No.  Is it entertaining?  Yes.  It's a good game that has good gameplay and graphics.  However, it still doesn't compare to its cousins like Gears of War and Call of Duty 4.  That being said, you will still most likely have a good time.  The aiming and shooting mechanic mirrors that of Gears where you pull left trigger to aim and then shoot with right trigger.  The game is unique in that it does require team work with your partner to get through some of the levels.  The \"aggro\" system is a prime example of this. One partner essentially steals the spotlight and attracts the attention of most of the enemies, enabling the other partner to stealth around the battle field and get a better shot.  I also like the ability to customize your weapons and gear (all for a price).  Afterall, the point of the game is to get paid, and you do get paid handsomely for killing ruthless terrorists and protecting key targets.  It's a fairly linear game, but you do have some options of completing secondary objectives that might take you off the beaten path.  You would be hard pressed to get lost as there is a \"GPS\" system that basically shows you the path to take to complete the mission.  I think most shooter fans will like this game.  It just didn't grab me quite like Gears or COD4 did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000R37S78","description":"More Information Coming Soon.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Beautiful, Simple Game","reviewText":"Pros:+Gorgeous Graphics with some great anime cutscenes+An engrossing storyline+Really loveable characters+Easy to become acquainted with+Surprisingly large amount of customizationCons:-For those looking for innovation they won't find itThe PSP has slowly been gaining a lot of RPGs and tactical RPGs.  In late 2007 we saw the release of three Strategy RPGs in particular.  Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Jeanne D'arc.  While Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea were two fine ports from two fine systems, Jeanne D'arc stands on its own as an original creation.  The result is a beautiful, simple SRPG that while it doesn't change the face of the genre, it's a game that manages to be fun nonetheless.The story of Joan of Arc has been told numerous times.  However, it's never quite been told like this.  That is to say the story itself mixes in Fantasy with History.  In short, any student hoping to use this game has an interactive history lesson won't find it.  On the other hand, though, the story is well told through some fantastic Anime cutscenes that are by far some of the best to grace the PSP thus far.  There are some great characters to accompany you on your travels as well.  It also helps that the game has some spectacular voice acting with French accents that aren't overdone, but aren't too tame either.  The cel shaded graphics looks absolutely astonishing as well.  The environments are enormous and detailed.  The enemies are also pretty detailed as well.  In terms of production values, Jeanne D'arc exceeds by being both artistic, and showing what the PSP is capable of doing.  It's very rare when a game does both very well, but Jeanne D'arc does.A beautiful game can't stand alone without some good gameplay to go along with it.  Luckily, Jeanne D'arc has some good gameplay too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but the simplicity of the game makes it so that there is no need for overly long tutorials that plague a few other tactical RPGs.  While this can be a little annoying for those who dwelled into more complex SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea, it does have a few traits that make it overall fun to play.  As usual, you'll control characters on a grid and there are a set of objectives.  In some missions the goal is to defeat the enemy leader while making sure a specific character doesn't fall.  In other missions it's simply to crush all the bad guys.  The game adds a twist on this as well.  You must finish the battle in a certain amount of turns or its game over.  While this is a nice twist it's hardly something that merits being included.  You'll finish most battles long before you get that warning telling you how many turns are left.Much like other SRPGs you'll have a set of commands to attack your enemies and use skills.  Unlike many SRPGs, though, the counter attack rate in Jeanne D'arc is through the roof.  The good news is that this makes the battles go faster. That may be one of the things that helps this game out.  In many SRPGs battles are slow winded and last for a long time.  In Jeanne D'arc they go relatively fast.  In between turns you'll also see enemies and allies shout things out.  For a moment this is alright, after a while it gets annoying.There are skills at work in battle.  You can equip certain skill stones to let you do things like cast healing spells or perform special attacks in battle.  Equipping skill stones doesn't just grant you abilities or status enhancements.  It's also there to raise affinity with the three spirits, Luna, Sol and Stella.  There is no one spirit greater or more powerful than another.  This works in a Rock-Paper-Scissors, fashion.  One spirit is stronger than one but weak against the other.  This puts a lot more emphasis on strategy.  Some attacks deal far more damage based on which spirit you are affiliated with.  The same thing works for your enemies.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Jeanne D'arc is that the games transformation system.  Jeanne can transform once she has enough SP.  This gives her a significant boost to her stats.  It also gives her the ability to take another turn immediately after killing an enemy.  This is great, but because of the increase in stats in some areas it makes the game unreasonably easy.  That doesn't mean the entire game itself is easy.  You'll find that in many maps you're outnumbered.  And that a mishap or two in your strategy can cost you the battle.  Jeanne D'arc may be a simple game to learn but it can be a bit tough to master.Jeanne D'arc also sounds masterful.  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated.  While at some points the music can be repetitive (particularly hearing the \"Enemy Phase\" music over and over again), it still sounds absolutely fantastic.  If there was anything holding Jeanne D'arc back, it would be the games lack of voice acting.  While you hear a lot in the animated scenes, you don't hear them that much beyond that.  It'd be nice if some of their battle callouts, for example, were screamed out.  This is a minor problem and in no way detracts from the game itself, though.Any PSP owner looking for a fun, engrossing SRPG ought to look to Jeanne D'arc.  It's incredible story, simple battle system and good use of customization and balance make it an engrossing adventure.  It may not reinvent the wheel, but that keeps the game from being a needlessly complicated endeavor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2008"}

The narrative is well told, the voice acting consistently great, and together the creators give the player characters you really care about and invest in.  Without spoiling anything for those who can manage to remain spoiler-free, it all builds to an outstanding climax.  This game has few peers in the area of story-driven experiences.As much as I loved the game, I have to say the gameplay is its weakness.  There were several occasions when I forgot I had a controller in my hand, as there was quite a bit of cutscene watching.  For those who love the action of a good shooter or brawler, be aware this is much slower paced.  Much of the gameplay revolves around conversations with other characters and choosing responses or actions.  Sometimes this choice dynamic works incredibly well, with consequences that truly reverberate througout the rest of the story.  On these occasions I felt very connected to the main character and the outcome of these choices.  Other times it feels a bit like a gimmick, where it is a choice presented for its own sake with no real effect.  When the action does ramp up the game definitely becomes tense, but certainly does not present the tight response of a good FPS (nor does it try to, since it is radically different).  Obviously based on my rating none of this impaired my enjoyment of the game, but I thought others who are wondering what all the hype is all about might find this information helpful!  To sum up:Pros:+ Excellent story+ Well realized characters and voice acting+ Very true to its comic book source+ Much of the time, the choice system is greatCons:- Graphic novel style can detract from the realistic effect of the awesome story- Controlled character movement is a bit stiff- Very few puzzle elements (I suppose this could be a pro for some though)- Action sequences are great for story tension, but clunky from a control perspective","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

Awful gameplay.","reviewText":"&quot;Jedi Outcast&quot; is the third installment in the outstanding &quot;Dark Forces&quot; series.  Sadly, it is also the first misfire.  &quot;Dark Forces&quot; and &quot;Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight&quot; were superb games both in terms of graphics, gameplay, and story arc.  Admittedly, the graphics are good for &quot;Jedi Outcast&quot;, but it fails miserably with gameplay.  The keyboard plays a singularly important role in any PC-based video game.  With that being fact, it's imperative that actions that keyboards performs be smooth and fluid.  It was with the two previous installments in this series, but the control is nothing short of totally aggravating.  The movement is 'herky-jerky', almost like it regressed to earlier technology.  Aiming the weapons at the targets is nearly impossible because the targets move too fast to acquire with the current setup.  Also, trying to pan the player's view up and down and from left to right is very shaky.  The gameplay is so awful that I have been forced to stop playing the game because I do not have the patience to deal with it.  I suspect the game, itself, may actually get quite good.  Unfortunately, I cannot give a rating based on how good I think the game could be if only the gameplay were better.  The fact that the game is too aggravating to continue to play dooms &quot;Jedi Outcast&quot; to the lowest score possible.  Perhaps the versions ported for actual gaming systems perform much better.  If they do, I will review this game much more favorably for that platform.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2003"}

I totally agree with all the good reviews I read so far.  Instead of heaping on more praise, I like to say a few words about the three downloadable contents (DLCs), available online at Xbox Live.  They are the \"Operation Anchorage\", \"The Pitt\", and \"Broken Steel\".  Operation Anchorage is a training program for new army recruits.  It looks and feels different from the rest of the game, but The Pitt and Broken Steel are vintage Fallout 3 side quests.  Broken Steel is a must-have DLC. In the original game, the game ends when the main quest ends.  To keep playing, one has to reload with an earlier saved file and, so doing, breaks the continuity of the game.  Broken Steel modifies the ending of the game, such that the player can keep on playing, after the main quest is completed.  It also raises the ceiling of player level from 20 to 30, with new skill points and perks.  Therefore, theoretically, one can keep playing forever.  But, after 200+ hours, the game started to get old.  I decided to retire my hero at this point and park him and his dog, Dog Meat, in the Rangers Compound, rather to leave him in the middle of nowhere or his ramshackle apartment in Megaton.  If you play the side quest \"Reilly's Rangers\" and manage to save at least one of the rangers trapped in the Statesman Hotel, your hero will be welcome by Reilly and her rangers as one of their own in the Rangers Compound, where he can spend eternity among friends--a fitting end for a hero who saved the wasted world.Update:  A fourth DLC, Point Lookout, is now available online at Xbox Live.  Before you set out to the Maryland swamp, don your strongest armor and bring your biggest guns, because you are going to fight some pretty tough enemies, and, don't forget to stop at Marguerite's Moonshine Shack and have a sip of her famous brew, made of yeast and punga fruits, with a dash of battery acid for favor.More Update:  The fifth and final DLC, Mothership Zeta, is now available online at Xbox Live.

Wii Fit Plus is so much more fun.  It has all the old activities of the original Wii Fit, plus more . . . of everything!The fitness tests have added things like mental fitness activities (e.g., trying to add and subtract numbers to equal a certain value by moving our hips) or peripheral vision test (adjust balance to keep dot in center while choosing numbers in ascending order).  The variety certainly is not boring.Games are a huge improvement.  The bicycling and Sega exercises to find flags is a better workout and more interesting than the old run around the town.  Of course, we can still choose to just run around town.  There are also new workout games like doing Kung Fu, which is so much fun, but I'm just horrible at it.I like being able to choose a set of routines rather than having to choose just one routine at a time.  If I want to work out my hips, I can do that.  If I want to work on my arms, I can do that.  Wii Fit Plus will put together a bundle of activities to fit my needs.  If I want to customize my routine, I can do that, also.Wii Fit Plus is a hit with my kids (ages 6 and 9), as they try to outdo each other.  It's a hit for the whole family.  If you have Wii Fit and enjoy it, you'll like Wii Fit Plus even more.  I highly recommend it.For those without Wii Fit original, I recommend you getWii Fit Plus with Balance Boardinstead.

{"product_name":"B000W5Y49G","description":"The Wii Zapper is a gun peripheral that allows the user to insert a Wii Remote and Nunchuk, both sold separately, into either end and play a compatible game. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Not Bad But Not Great Either","reviewText":"The Wii Zapper received much hoopla when it first came out and then fizzled out after people actually got their hands on it. I purchased this well after all the hoopla had gone out. I think that this Wii peripheral can enhance your gaming experience if you go into it with not too many expectation.One of the problems, which others here have already mentioned, is that the trigger does not have any spring support. As a result, the trigger can sometimes get stuck. When I first started using the Zapper I found myself frustrated because the trigger would not return to position resulting in me fumbling with it until it got back into position. The result is that I missed quite a few shots. The solution to this is to slow down your shooting and to get into a rhythm in which you time your shots. The trigger cannot simulate rapid fire weapons such as those in Call of Duty. Also, if you find the trigger not responding well despite the slower shooting, try removing the Wii remote and re-seating it in the barrel.Another problem which I found while using this Zapper is that the cross-hairs tend to fly around the screen. It is not steady and tends to move up, down, left or right and float on you. If you go into it not expecting a steady cross-hair, you might be okay with this. Some will find this frustrating and want to go back to the game pad immediately. But if you practice, you may get better at it.Another thing I experienced while using the Zapper is that due to the design or ergonomics, my upper arms began to feel fatigued pretty fast. I lift weights and work out so I can only imagine what a person who does not work out must experience after a short time with using this peripheral. You can rest your arm on an arm rest and that may help. But be prepared for Zapper fatigue.Some complained that assembling the Zapper is quite tiresome. I found it to be not too bad. You have to unlatch the holder on the butt of the weapon and remove the cover on the bottom in order to install the Wii nunchuk. That is the extent of the hassle. Installing the Wii remote itself is very easy. You just snap it on while holding down the button on Zapper. I don't think that the parts will break on the Zapper if you simply do what you are supposed to.  The plastic material on the Zapper is actually decent. It is not exactly cheap plastic material. It lies somewhere between cheap plastic and quality heavy duty plastic.I have the Sony Move Rifle and I can compare it with the Zapper. I can say that the Move has a much better trigger due to a spring-like mechanism. Also, the cross-hair does not float like with the Zapper. But then the floating is not to be blamed on the Zapper itself but on the Wii hardware and software.For those of you thinking about getting this device, be prepared to find out that the relatively few games that support it are few. And be ready to spend extra as the games are even harder to find. You see, game developers did not get into this device. The only ones available for this device are rail shooters such as Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, House of the Dead and a few obscure titles. You can count them on your fingers of both hands. Not many. And if you are thinking of using it on first person shooters that are not listed as compatible titles, you will find out the hard way that the controls do not lend themselves well for such titles due to the fact that the controls will be at the top of the gun barrel away from your trigger finger.If you are planning to get the games mentioned above, you may want to invest in the Zapper as it does give you the feel of aiming a gun at your target. Nothing can compare to using a barrel to simulate a shooting experience.As for why the company decided to put the trigger on the front can be easily surmised by looking at the limitations of the Wii remote itself. If they had placed it towards the rear, there would be no room for the Wii nunchuk. Place towards the rear and the nunchuk would have to be at the front. Personally I would have designed the Zapper much differently. It would have moved the trigger more to the rear and still incorporate the nunchuk for its analog stick. If Nintendo would like to know how it can be accomplished, they can contact me and I would be willing to help them develop the peripheral for their current and future consoles.If you are not planning to get the games I mentioned, you don't need this peripheral at all.Pros:1. Makes it feel like you are shooting with a gun.2. Makes aiming a little easier.Cons:1. Trigger sticking.2. Hassle assembling.3. Floating cross-hair (due to Wii hardware and software)4. Arm fatigue.5. Extremely few games support it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2014"}

I'm going to review the system in parts because there is just so much to cover that it needs to be broken down.The System: The Dreamcast itself is very small,it's not as long as the original PS1 but it sits a little bit higher. Overall it looks very nice,Pictures don't do it justice,it needs to be seen in person. The Dreamcast's power light is also very unique,instead of being the usual green color,its orange (it's supposedly a very lucky color in Japan.) It also has 4 controller ports,and the usual hookup plugs in the back.The Controller: The controller is sort of a hit and miss,it looks really cool. But it's lacking in the button department,it has 4 face buttons,one analog stick,D-pad,and 2 triggers. Now the problem is the Dreamcast controller needed either another analog stick or 2 more shoulder buttons. I have a very good feeling if the Dreamcast would have been in the market longer it would have seen a redesigned controller. Not the worst controller,but not the best,It gets bonus points for possibly being the coolest looking controller I've seen.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU): The VMU is quite possibly the most unique memory card I have ever seen,it has a screen a D-Pad,sleep button,mode button,and 2 face buttons. While your playing a game it displays either what game your playing,your health,or to choose plays in football,every game does different things. Some games even have mini games you can download onto the VMU. There are some downsides to the VMU and the number one thing is battery life,it takes 2 watch batteries that cost $5 a piece,here is the kicker,they don't last long at all! It would have been smarter to just make the VMU use 2 AA batteries instead,they are much cheaper and would have probably lasted longer (rechargeable would have lasted much longer). And the number 2 downside is the memory on the card is small! Only 200KB available for use (there is a way to unlock 44KB more) if your playing a sport game it can take as much as 164KB! Most games will only use 4-60KB's depending.Games:This is a high point for the DC,at the time it had some of the best games for all genres listing them all would take up way to much space. It is unfortunate that most of the Dreamcasts best games have been ported to either PS2,Xbox,or GC. But there is something about playing the original that makes the games seem so much better on Dreamcast. I'm going to list the pros and cons of the system:Pros:+You can still buy NEW Dreamcasts for $100+Controllers/VMU's are a dime a dozen+Games are cheap and can still be bought NEW+Very nice design+Reliable as long as you play legit software (Tip:CD-R's will burn out your Dreamcast laser)+Awesome memory cardCons:-VMU's use expensive batteries that don't last-Controller needs more buttons","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2009"}

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"Nick Martinez","summary":"A fun game","reviewText":"The game is fun but gets repetitive pretty fast.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2000"}

But the missions and story are mostly boring and forgettable, with pointless side quests, and glitches horrible enough to essentially ruin the game.Long Review:Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's story.Having all but conquered city based free roaming games, it's no surprise that Rockstar would eventually brand out to try and allow players to conquer other areas, this time taking us back to the turn of the century Wild West, essentially creating Grand Theft Horse.  Instead of fast motorcycles and flashy cars, you have horses and stagecoaches.  And while it sounds like an awesome and unique idea, we get an end product that's very pretty and incredibly atmospheric, but is packed with boring missions and glitches so severe, it at times ruins the game completely.Red Dead Redemption follows former outlaw John Marston as he heads across the lands of New Austin, the last holdout of the wild west on the Mexican border.  His mission is simple:  His lovely wife and young son have been kidnapped and held hostage by the government, and if he wants to get them back and get a clean break from his former life, he has to hunt down and take out the members of his old gang.Taking on the role of John, you run around in a massive open ended world where you can go virtually anywhere you want to.  Every western cliche is here, including ramshackle old frontier towns, cactus, giant stone monoliths, forests filled with bears, adobe houses, and even tumbleweeds.  Like every other free roam game, you run around this world to find missions to complete, and thus advance the story.  It's an incredibly beautiful world, as unlike Liberty/Vice/Stilwater city, there are no skyscrapers, no malls, or giant buildings.  Everything here is turn of the century technology, with the biggest building being only two stories tall.  As a result, the world feels massive and virtually endless.  You feel like a tiny ant in the middle of a very large and untamed world, and gives the game an epic feel that very few games can match.However, Red Dead Redemption has the huge problem of feeling mostly pointless.  Almost all the missions follow this pattern:1.  Get on a horse and ride halfway across the map with a partner.2.  Listen to said partner deliver expositional dialogue to advance the plot.3.  Reach destination.4.  Kill everyone.5.  Watch as partner rides off, abandoning you.6.  Spend several minutes riding to the other side of the map to get your next mission, grumbling at how slow you're going.As a result, most of the missions are very forgettable.  There are a few exceptions, such as fort assaults, boat rides, etc. but for the most part, the missions do very little to distinguish themselves.  As a result, it feels like you're just slogging through mission after mission, wondering when things are going to get interesting.  Thankfully, the third act of the game does reverse this trend, as there are a few creative and clever missions that are interesting to play through, but it's essentially too little, too late.Outside of the story, there are a good amount of side missions, where you can become a bounty hunter and track down criminals, help random strangers out, go hunting for treasure, collect flowers, hunt animals, etc. but after a while, I realized that these quests are, in effect, pointless.  You mainly get money and fame/honor for doing them, but you get plenty of money from the story missions, and the fame/honor has barely any effect on the gameplay in general.  You can unlock rewards (such as riding stagecoaches for free), but it takes a long time to do so, and is not worth the effort.  I personally stopped doing all the diversions and side missions halfway through the game, because it felt like a waste of time.Red Dead's story, like the missions, moves at a near glacial pace.  While the core story will make you want to keep going to find out if John rescues his family or not, it takes forever to get there.  The story contains a ton of fat that could be cut out, from characters who add nothing to the main plot, to virtually everything in Mexico, which has little to no impact on the main story.  It isn't until the third act that there's a sense of real danger and threat, and the drama picks up.  However, it's made worse by the fact that Red Dead makes one of THE worst mistakes a story can make...after the climax, it just doesn't end.  You feel like you've reached the end of the game, only to find that it keeps going and going and going and going.  After an hour of playing pointless, tutorial like missions, I lost my patience and wondered when the hell the game was going to end.  As a result, when the ending FINALLY came, I didn't care at all about what happened.Then there's the game's many bugs and glitches:  If you hunt around on the internet, you'll come across humorous videos of people flying like birds, midgets acting like cougars, talking coyotes, etc.  However, those videos don't tell you about some of the other, more infuriating bugs.  Among the ones I experienced:*In one mission, I assisted a group of people in taking over a fortress.  Afterwards, I went exploring and opened a standard chest to get some money.  Then an informant was running away from me, and seconds later, I was wanted for...something, and EVERYONE I had just helped to infiltrate the fortress was trying to kill me.*Half my inventory would randomly vanish, ruining hours of hunting and searching for goods.*I save a woman from being raped, and kill her captor.  A guy starts shooting at me, so I kill him in self defense.  For some reason, my honor goes down.*I rent a room (AKA save/respawn point) in a new town, get involved in a duel and get killed, and get respawned several miles away in some OTHER town.*John is being attacked by wolves.  I aim and pull the trigger, but John refuses to shoot his fully loaded gun and is torn to shreds.*I run through a town, when the sheriff, for no reason whatsoever, shoots and kills me.*The game crashes, making me loose most of my progress.It's sad really...my first impressions of Red Dead Redemption were fantastic, but the more and more I played, I realized I just wasn't having any fun, and was starting to despise the game for how slow it was going, and how so many things felt pointless and annoying.  Add in how short and badly done the tutorials are (they appear on screen for about fifteen seconds, then vanish, often taking place in real time), John's annoying personality (he acts like Forrest Gump in a cowboy outfit, and I got the impression he was mildly retarded), and with the glitches, my annoyance turned to disgust.In the end, while Red Dead Redemption is incredibly beautiful and very atmospheric, the story needs much editing and trimming, the missions are forgettable, the annoying characters will get on your nerves, the ending goes on longer then \"The Return of the King\" and the glitches will annoy you to no end.  I personally think Red Dead Redemption is yet another over-hyped game that turns out to be, at best, mediocre, and at worst, infuriating.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}

The game play is similar to other Mario titles, but they've added a fair amount of new tricks and abilities here to freshen it up, with great results.People have criticized this game for being a little too easy, and I think that's valid, especially when compared to Mario 64.  It's pretty straightforward to recover most of the stars, whereas in Mario 64 most of the stars required puzzle solving which is often absent here.  The fights in Mario 64 were also harder.  However, for me this didn't detract from the game much because the art and creativity on display are just so good.  This game really shows what the Wii's hardware can do if used properly.

I started WoW on May 2009. I missed on Vanilla and TBC in their pristine states, and I got into WOTLK while the getting was good, but it was already six months old at the time.  2. I play with my significant other and while we got heavily into raiding, we never made it into progression raiding. We started ICC by the time that the realm first Kingslayer had happened a few weeks back, and we never got any further than Festergut. I wouldn't call myself a casual player, but I'm not hardcore. 3. Because I play my significant other, and because of her preferences, I've stuck with Alliance for most of my WoW tenure.Caveats out of the way...hehe...Well, talk about a breath of fresh air. I always thought that by the time Ruby Sanctum hit, the WOTLK expansion was feeling quite stale. Some of the more recent changes have for better or for worse given this 6 years young game a new lease in life, but the expansion is a kick in the pants to nay sayers and a jumpstart to the game itself: the game of course feels shiny and new, without feeling so different that it would take weeks to get your  wow-legs. Of course, the bigger gameplay changes have been around for a few weeks now after the more recent patches, but still...they should/could be considered as part of a bigger Cataclysm event. But then again, I'm here to review the expansion, not patches 4.0.1 and 4.0.3....so. The game.Graphics were reworked a few weeks back, and while not that noticeable with some character models, I must comment on the incredible level of detail Blizzard has put into the Goblin models. I thought I would want to instantaneously punt Goblins on sight, but I was wowed when I tried making one. Sure, they are green and ugly, but they look so believable, they make a lot of the alliance classes look disgustingly cartoony (looking at you gnomes) The settings are par for the course, re-worked recently, looking sharper and brighter, but still...graphics aren't WoW's forte.The reworked soundtrack and some of the soundtracks for the new areas are very refreshing: I was a huge fan of the WOTLK repertoire, and expected to hate this new offering, but I was so very wrong. Some of the Old World reworked music is absolutely masterful, and some of the new areas range from epic to quirky (Goblin zones have  pretty fun music, as do Gnome zones, hehe)The game mechanics are pretty much...standard WoW fare. Can't say much about that.  I roll a tank, I'm still bemoaning the action queue for warriors...it sucks, but oh well...adapt or die right?The meat of the expansion are really the two new races and the new areas. Now, the brunt of my exposition to the new content was the Worgen start area as well as Gilneas.  I must say that anyone that plays wow,  that does not hate the prospect of werewolves, should play this area. It's roughly 12-14 levels into the game, epic in proportions, with some very funny moments.  It's an instanced event which doesn't allow for much of backtracking, and that would be my basic concern, but that's about it. The Worgen are I would say a very nice addition to the alliance, the design is very fun, and their racials, although DPS-oriented, maybe even PVP oriented, are in my opinion some of the better racials around. They are pretty fun as races go. Some people are bemoaning having ground rep with Gilneas only to find out that they don't have mounts, but I don't really care about that.I didn't play much of the Goblins, but I already made a rogueling to try the starter area out.There are new areas for levels 801-85, of which I've only really played Mt. Hyal. Right now these areas are extremely saturated, so some quests are very difficult to complete. I haven't even been able to start gathering materials for the new crafting.Overall, I'm having loads of fun with the expansion. This review, in retrospect, feels a bit premature, considering I haven't really seen much of what the actual expansion brings to the game, but I will say, I'm very pumped to find out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

It was a fun adventure at times but I noticed a lot of things changing gradually. The game started to become less and less about being discovering adventure in a vast fantasy world and more about getting this item or achieving this preset goal.The mentality of the game changed for me and so did I notice the attitudes of a lot of the players. Since the end of Outlands it seems like the game shifted in a different direction to where it was more about achieving and acquiring items. This being backed by the notorious use of gear scores, item levels, the integrated dungeon finder, and the many changes to the dungeons that made it more of a chore than ever.The older games had some interesting dungeons (they all get old after a while) but the older dungeons felt like an adventure that you could enjoy even if you didn't quite make it to the end. I didn't feel like I was playing for a reward but like I was just playing to have fun. It was all a real adventure to travel to different areas in the game and not know what you could get into when you explored around. Mainly because there were other people playing everywhere seeking the same adventures in the game. You didn't just run into them because they were farming, people were actually playing and enjoying the game.It was only after Lichking did I notice how the game really changed and how vacant it started to become. People just wanted to focus on collecting stuff whether it be armor,badges,achievement points,titles,ratings, whatever that's all anyone ever seemed to want to do. In the earlier games all that seemed to be second hand. Yeah you wanted nice armor but you had fun getting it so finally getting that gear or sword was a pleasure. I remember the process of getting those PVP weapons was fun and finally getting them even more fun because people respected the effort it took to obtain them which is what it was about. From that it changed to just having the best gear so you didn't get picked on or alienated from events that required the best of the best armor. PVP gear was also fine for raids, it wasn't just about having to have this or that outfit.Sure, there were always those hardcore lifeless raid people with game elitist attitudes but who really wanted to join them? You could join plenty of raids with your blues and no one really cared unless you honestly caused a wipe. Which most of the time was because of another mistake non gear related.For me finally picking up Cataclysm pretty much confirmed that this game is no longer for me. Although the developers tried to bring more people back into the old areas by updating the look of them, the game seems really empty as there are not that many people playing anymore. I explored the old zones and never did I feel so lonely in this game barely running into anyone anywhere. It only reminded me of the BC days when places would be full no matter where you went. The element of being in an MMO without the MM is a desolate experience.Of course when I went to the 80+ areas it seemed there were more players present. Not a lot but enough (or should I say not as many as you'd expect if \"everyone\" is to be in the 80+ zones). Then by the 2nd week of release even those area's seemed to be thinned out. I could even spot the farmers as I remember them by name from seeing them so much. So then if even the new area's where seemingly empty where were all the players? Pretty much doing the same thing as in the other games before. They were farming (I'd call it grinding but I only use that word for real life subject matter where the reward is money well earned; someone working 3 jobs to support a family is grinding, someone sitting at home clicking on icons to kill make believe monsters to get a fantasy sword is not grinding it's lazy)and by far not enjoying it from the many complaints I saw being posted in chat.So just what was the point? If the game is no longer about the adventure of a world of fantasy but about keeping up with the Jones than what's the point? I felt like just another player and not a hero. I felt like I was in a game just mashing buttons to get points. I've felt more immersed in game of Donkey Kong. The RPG element of the game is now completely gone. The storyline of the game is shattered by the tedium of the game play. A hamster wheel is clearly present. There is no adventure to be had anymore it's long since been absent.I guess I was one of the rare players that enjoyed the adventure aspect the game \"used\" to have. Even though I had the \"best\" armor I never was concerned about it. It was just items I acquired through my journeys and my battles. To me that is what an MMORPG should be about. Cataclysm was just my wake up call that this game just isn't what it used to be.Since than I've been playing console RPG's where I can enjoy a great story to immerse myself in while I await the arrival of the next MMO that will hopefully put the adventure back into these games as it is greatly needed. When I play a fantasy RPG game I want to feel like a hero adventuring not like I'm a fashion designer trying to put together a dazzling new wardrobe.P.S. With each passing game I have always created a maxed character for that era. A max character being one that is decked out in whatever items are to be the creame of the crop for that WoW era. As I look at them, it's interesting to also see how the outfits went from amazing to bland... just like the game is now.Depending on what you're looking for if your interested in  farming and doing long tedious dungeons and honestly like making meaningless.... oh I mean endless achievements. Than you might enjoy spinning the hamster wheel some more with the other rodents that continue to play this game.I've long since jumped off and now I finally put the game to rest.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2010"}

Skylanders Spyro&#x2019;s adventure involves real life toys, which players will have to place on the Portal of Power to bring them into the game. The three toy characters that come in the starter pack are: Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy.

The fact that the various characters can be moved in and out of the game quickly and easily adds to the enjoyment.  While I do not intend to add on more characters with the character packs available, the fact that the game can be played (if not to completion) with just the three makes for an enjoyable start.  There are nostalgic bits (like the sheep) for those of us who remember the original Spyro games, which is a nice nod by the developers to the older people among us who may be playing the game, while at the same time it is very much geared to a youngish audience.  The ease of use of the game makes it very accessible.  The graphics are good and the controls pretty standard for Wii games these days (the occasional thrust or shake of the Wiimote being required to perform certain actions).  The story line is not exactly deep, seeming to fall more on the side of jokey and cartoonish, but given the target audience, I would not expect anything overly deep.I like the premise of being able to plop a character onto the portal and it shows up in game almost immediately.  That's a nice change from having to wait to switch characters (if at all) like many games.  Nice innovation if not a bit capitalist in nature with the near required collectible nature of the setup.My only complaint is the fact that the game, in some ways, almost requires one to buy all the extra characters for 100% completion.  But in terms of gameplay, Spyro's Adventure should provide plenty of hours of enjoyment and entertainment for those who don't mind playing as one of three characters provided for the starter set.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

I have heard a lot of good things about Mass Effect and thought I'd order it along with Fallout 3 since I could get both titles combined for under $30. I haven't gone too deep into the game but have logged enough hours to identify what I like or dislike about it.There is a lot of content in this game but I've been having trouble following what exactly some of the objectives are. It appears to be a pretty vast galaxy and has an open world feel to it. The controls were easy learn and the game came with extensive DLC on a separate disk so I can't complain as far as content goes. One minus I have with the game is the degree of difficulty I'm having with some missions with the game setting on &#34;casual&#34;. I'm new at this particular series and wanted to play thru one time just  to see how the story plays out but I am unsure that will happen. I think the game designers made &#34;casual &#34; more difficult than it needed to be. I don't expect an easy time and have played many games with the difficulty setting high. There were a few areas I just backed out of because I simply could not get thru them. I figured if I had success with games like Halo, COD, GTA , Assassins Creed and others I could handle this. Maybe its just me, maybe I'm giving up too easily.I highly recommend the game to someone with patience and a strong interest in RPG and Sci-Fi. I probably will not pick up Mass Effect 2 or 3 because of a couple of the dislikes I have. I do give the game high marks mainly because of the amount of content It packs and my experience has been mainly &#34;glitch-free&#34;.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"The Wait is over.....","reviewText":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) and Jade Empire stand out as two of the best RPG's ever made for the original Xbox. Bioware (the game developer for both) struck gold with their epic, morally charged RPG's, and when it was announced that Bioware would be releasing another game in the same vein on the Xbox 360 (Mass Effect), fans went rabid.  Two years before its official release Bioware hyped up Mass Effect in various magazine interviews, and soon demos were released showing off the graphics and gameplay.As with every A-list video game, Mass Effect was going to be THE next generation video game experience. Bioware boasted a massive universe; one that featured many planets available for exploration, an extensive and unique conversation system, and their usual good/bad choices. They also boasted a squad-based combat where you could control your AI team mates. Bioware also promised a slew of side quests and missions, which included a vast array of uncharted worlds to explore.Now, I have come to accept the sad fact that most of what a developer promises will never see the light of day, but in the case of Mass Effect it seems that some things were literally cut short without any reparation or reason.Before I get into my review, I would like to state that Mass Effect is a really fun and engrossing RPG that offers a really fun conversation system, a fully realized universe, an awesome story-line, and real-time combat a la Gears of War. Mass Effect offers a character creation system that allows you to customize your character and level-up him or her as you see fit, not to mention you get to choose from a handful of job classes (Infiltrator, Soldier, etc..)The graphics of Mass Effect are true Next Generation splendor. Everything we have come to expect of modern video game graphics is present, from realistic and lifelike character models to fully rendered and detailed backgrounds and items. In the graphics department, Mass Effect truly exceeds and surpasses most games. Optional grain filters and blurring effects are available as well.However, due to marketing schemes by Microsoft, the game is marred rather frequently by long load times, texture pop ins and the occasional jitters. What is this marketing scheme I speak of? The core Xbox 360 system that does not feature a hard drive.The soundtrack is very atmospheric and reminiscent of old school Science Fiction movies, and it does a great job of immersion. You will feel like you are in some strange science fiction movie. Sound Effects are pretty good as well. No complaints here...The control is very similar to KOTOR and Jade empire, except that Mass Effect has real-time combat instead of Turn based. Similar to Gears of War, there is a cover system, thought it is often very clunky and unnatural feeling, and you will probably spend more time just standing behind cover than hiding behind it. Weapons follow your standard shooter fare - pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles and shotguns. There are some grenades and such as well. The really draw however, is the biotic and tech powers; the meat and potatoes of the combat. Each character (your team mates included) have a range of biotic powers (Mass Effect's version of magic) available to them, and they all kick butt. Depending on what character you create and how you level-up that character, various biotic powers will be made available. Tech powers work in the exact same fashion.Mass Effect also offers a quick menu that pauses the combat, allowing you to use your team mates tech and biotic powers, as well as change their weapons. This is a handy feature as there are more than enough intense battles where you will find yourself outnumbered and out-gunned.The biggest feature of Mass Effect has to be its story-line and extensive background information. Through various \"codex\" entries, through conversations and surveying planets, you will learn the history of the Mass Effect Universe. The story line is perfectly intertwined with the history, and succeeds in being a deeply engrossing and involved story with a pretty interesting plot.The conversation system is truly unique in that it allows for perfectly seamless conversations that feel like cinematic cut scenes, or at least that is how it would feel if Bioware had put more time into it. While the conversations do have a somewhat interesting and engrossing quality to them, the characters facial and body movements are very repetitive and boring, and the conversation scenes hardly serve as the games cut-scenes (as Bioware claimed they would). They basically consist of a still scene showing your party and whoever you are talking to, with the occasional close up of a characters face or body movement. YAWN...Since a good chunk of Xbox 360 owners own the core version that has no hard-drive, all developers must create their game to run off of the game disc only; this leads to problems galore. Mass Effect is a HUGE game, and Xbox 360 discs are relatively small - do you see where I'm going with this? My guess is that in order for everything to fit on the game disc, and to keep the disc number down to 1 Bioware was forced to cut things out. This is evident in the \"explorable\" universe. The limitless universe that Bioware bragged and hyped about during development is NO WHERE to be seen. Sure, there are still various planet systems to travel to, and they all host about 6 planets, but you cannot actually \"land\" on all of them. In fact, the player will spend more time \"surveying\" (which involves pushing a button and reading the text that pops up) the planet or even reading a wall of text associated with the history of the planet rather than actually exploring them. There are only a handful of planets that the player can actually land on, and these explorable planets comprise a good majority of the side-quests.On these planets, the player controls a vehicle (called the Mako), sort of like a dune buggy, and can explore a very limited portion of the planet (which usually is a big square area surrounded by an invisible wall). Not only is the Mako incredibly annoying to control, there is literally NOTHING to do on these planets. Besides the occasional enemy outpost, the ability to mine for minerals (a push of a button), and a confounded sense of \"WTF?\" these \"uncharted\" planets offer little in terms of side-missions.Not only is there nothing to do on these planets, but their design is exactly the same. Every uncharted planet has the same looking sky (though  the color may change from planet to planet), and they all boast the same boring mountainous regions and rocky terrain. Seriously, this very lazy on the part of Bioware, though I feel that the poor design of these planets has more to do with time constraints than sloppy developing.Another big issue is the moral dilemmas that your character faces during the game. Instead of aligning with a \"good\" side or an \"evil\" side, the player can either align themselves with the Paragon side of the Renegade side. Essentially, the character cannot join an \"evil\" side, or even play a \"bad\" character, the choices boil down to this - what would you do to save the universe? Will you slaughter mercilessly for the sake of the entire universe, or will you play by the book? Don't get me wrong, this is a really neat concept, and if Bioware had more time I'm sure they would have perfected it.My biggest gripe with this Paragon/Renegade dynamic is that, either way you choose, you save the universe; the Paragon (good)/Renegade (bad) conversation choices and decisions really only serve as replay value, and only a few of these choices alter the course of the game.What's worse, is that your team mates don't really even question your authority if you do something horrible (like murder innocents); in fact, your team mates don't even really feel \"alive\". The only time you really get to know your team mates is on your space ship (The Normandy), where the romance plot lines and such take place. Other than that, there is little to no conversational exchange between your character and your team mates on missions. Not only does this break the engrossing quality of the Mass Effect world, but it makes for some very boring game play as well. Considering KOTOR and Jade Empire both featured extensive dialogue between the characters, the lack of such feature in Mass Effect can only be chalked up to a rushed development.Another tell tale sign that this game was rushed is the fact that you can only talk to certain NPC's (usually those associated with a quest). I may be spoiled by high profile RPG's like Oblivion, but you SHOULD be able to talk to various NPC's, they should have their own lives and daily routines. I mean, we are in the Next Generation of video games, the Xbox 360 CAN support this feature. In essence, the NPC's should be interactive; another missing feature that severely breaks the engrossing factor of Mass Effect.Negatives aside, Mass Effect is a truly fun game that is worth playing, just don't expect what Bioware promised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2007"}

Richardson","summary":"Fun Game With Some Buggy Controls","reviewText":"If you've ever played Knights of the Old Republic on the original X-BOX, you know what to expect of this game. If not, it can be described as an action-RPG, combining the best of action games (active playing which relies on skill and reflexes) with the best of RPGs (deep customization of characters). If you don't care for dialogue in your games, don't play this: extended portions of the game feel more like an interactive novel than a true video game. Some of the frustration of endless streams of dialogue is remedied by extensive dialogue tree options, which allow you to control the course of a conversation. This makes it so that you're not just watching a movie of sorts. This game can ve VERY involving and engage you for hours at a time in the various missions and worlds to explore. I have only two complaints about this game:1) Lack of Variety in Optional Planets: At a certain point in the game, you're given control of a spaceship and have free reign to explore any number of different planets and star systems. Sounds fun, right? Sadly, only about a third of the optional planets are explorable, and there is a shocking lack of variety among them. A great majority of them are just the same sand-strewn desert with occasional monsters and items thrown onto them. This was disappointing for me, as it could have been the best aspect of an already great game.2) Funky Combat Controls: The combat controls in this game are very loose and on occasion hard-to-work. They aren't bad enough to ruin the fun of the battles, however.I could also mention the bad AI of your team mates, who frequently and stupidly get themselves killed, and sometimes you along with them if you're in a particularly dangerous environment, but most video games have bad AI partners, so I won't count this against it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2010"}

Despite this the story is well put together and has a great atmosphere.Gameplay - Very similar to RE4 with a few differences.  You know have to cut off limbs instead of head shots.  There are portions with Zero-G.  You also has a cool stasis attachment that slows enemies for you to line up shots and a kinesis attaachment to move and shoot things (boy, where have I seen that before?).  Also, the game does a great job with enemies and atmosphere.  It doesn't throw wave after wave at you.  Instead, it plays with the atmosphere through shadows and music when things attack but also when they don't.Design/Graphics - The graphics are great.  The main character looks cool and the effects (fire/in space/explosions) are also great.  My only complained is the lack of variation in the enemies.Sound - Great.

{"product_name":"B004FUI84G","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Weir","summary":"Huge improvement over Prototype 1","reviewText":"Well this game sure was a surprise! When Prototype came out a few years back I bought InFamous instead--they both came out around the same time--and loved it. Upon trading it for Prototype with a friend, I found that I just could not get into it and quit after a few hours. Amazon recently had Prototype 2 on sale so I took a chance, and it paid off big time! I could not put Prototype 2 down at all this past weekend. It grabbed me early on with its constant rewards and steady character progression/improvement which had me wanting to play just one more mission, or unlock just one more skill or upgrade.The plot is fairly straightforward and generic, but luckily cutscenes and story bits are interesting and brief enough to keep me from getting frustrating between the action. But the real reason to play Prototype 2 is to mince, crush and murder your way through the three areas of New York City presented in the game. World traversal is some of the best I've ever experienced in an open world action game. Protagonist James Heller can sprint across open ground as fast as a vehicle, literally runs up the faces of buildings and structures (no clunky climbing like in InFamous - note: InFamous will be referenced a few times as that series looks and plays very similarly to Prototype), jumps vertically like a cat on steroids, and zips and glides through the sky in a fashion that would make most superheroes green with envy. Traversing through the game is rarely a chore and always a pleasure. Of course all your abilities, including your combat abilities, are all the more effective later in the game as you upgrade them by completing story missions and side quests. Typical stuff here. And yes, things can get a tad bit repetitive later on in the game but the dynamic action and slick, responsive controls mostly remedy this.Graphically Prototype 2 looks much improved over the original Prototype, which I found to be a drab recreation of NYC in muted greys and browns. Prototype 2 is rich and colorful and, for an open world game, which tend to sacrifice visual fidelity for long draw distances and lots of characters and action happening all around you, it looks really nice. Later in the game it's not uncommon to have three or four helicopters gunning for you, in a crowded street full of zombie-like infected citizens, and a few mutants and soldiers all attacking you, with explosions happening left and right. Sounds crazy, but James Heller more than has the means to swiftly and easily dispatch all these threats, especially if you've taken the time to do side quests and go after upgrades.And that gets down to the core reason why Prototype 2 is so fun to play: few games do this good a job at making you feel like an utterly unstoppable bad ass. Period.There's also the little things in Prototype 2 that make it obvious Radical Entertainment put a lot of thought into making an open world action game with nice quality of life features. All of the game's collectibles can be found without having to reference an online guide (to be fair more games are doing this, thankfully), and hunting them all down serves an actual purpose other than getting a trophy or achievement. The points you allocate into skill upgrades can be undone and re-allocated at any time (though I never found the need). And for a certain type of side quest the game gives you the option to automatically place a way point marker on the map while briefing you, saving you a step. Cut scenes and cinematics are skipable even on your first play through. You can pilot armored vehicles and, later on, helicopters. There's even a new game plus mode that lets you carry over all your upgrades into a new story or difficulty. They pretty much hit all the check boxes of what an open world action game should have.If you like open world action games like InFamous, but didn't enjoy the first Prototype, give this one a shot. I found it a steal at $30 but had I known I would've enjoyed it as much as I did, I would've gladly paid $60 for it. Also, grabbing all the trophies/achievements for this game is a lot easier than your typical game. If you care about such things.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2012"}

Just to make it clear, you get a controller, the standard $25 chat headset, the Kinect Sensor, the basic accessories, and Forza 5.  Forza 5 is tons of fun and is pretty similar to Forza 4.  Some cool new races and some great classics.  There is no N&uuml;rburgring unfortunately.  Still a great game though.Comparison to Xbox 360:Xbox one loads up much more quickly, and boots games very quickly.The graphics are beautiful, but not a ridiculous amount better.There is no more start menu. Instead you can freely navigate the main menu, even while in a game.The system is sooo quietKinect motion controls can be unresponsive and are not worth the effortKinect Voice Commands are pretty good and work most of the time.Party chat has a different interface, but works in mostly the same way.A major difference is that with a purchasable adapter, you can use any pair of headphones that you own to listen to game sound. It just plugs into your controller. If the headphones have a mic the you can also speak through them.You cannot, unfortunately, talk cross platform.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Nikodem Leszek Blach \"Nik\"","summary":"It's getting better","reviewText":"I want to give the game a 5 but I'm sick of waiting for things to get fixed.  During the betas and the first week of play I couldn't stay in a party with my girlfriend once we went through any portal since we'd get split up to different overflows.  That's better now, but not because of their effort.  It's better because players are more spread out now and 80% of all players aren't in the starting areas anymore.There are other things, broken animations, they're still fixing up the crafting system (first week you had to move every individual item to your inventory to use it in crafting, now it pulls from your collections automatically - except for jewels) and some difficulty issues that I hate to complain about, but I've been in too many parties going into Dungeons and 30 tries later we literally just have to give up.  Not saying it's impossible, nothing is impossible, but since the game throttles your level at all times basically you can't like.. leave and get stronger or whatever.  And that's OK, Guild Wars 1 was the same way, but the difficulty was quite different. Dying was a rare occasion in GW1, in GW2 you'll die quite frequently and it can be frustrating against certain enemies, bosses and situations.One of my biggest issues with the beta was dying in 1 hit by bosses, being revived, and then suddenly dying again.  It's not as bad, you can usually at least figure out How you died now (usually), but most harder missions have 4 of your 5 people dying, re-spawning and trying to run back ASAP while 1 player keeps the bosses health from regenerating. I guess I just feel like MMOs are not the place for one hit kills, and in GW2 even traps and such tend to kill players in 1 hit (I'm level 64 now, but just yesterday I did a level 35 dungeon and half my party died before they got to the first real boss).But that's all I have for complaints.  Things will improve, and Guild Wars 2 Will be a 5 star game, I have no doubt. I'm just disappointed that they ran so many beta events and had this game in production for so long but they couldn't fix or at least balance certain things.The last MMORPG i played very seriously was City of Heroes (and before that Guild Wars 1) so a lot of things in GW2 were very new to me.  I only played WOW briefly.Guild Wars 2 gives you 80 level to jump through but like Guild Wars 1, your level doesn't matter after a point - you'll always be the same level as your enemies. Level 80 gives you more to achieve and more to push your forward.The skills are a little lame to me, in concept, but in execution they're realistic and perfect.  You tend to use the same 4-5 skills just about the entire game in most MMORPGs it seems and so Guild Wars 2 just binds those 4-5 basic skills to your weapon(s).  It kills some variety, but it ends up being close to the same number of skills as GW1 had.  The weapons are just optimized to have skills that work together. The 'utility' skills are awesome and they're something to look forward to.  Eventually you'll find yourself in dungeons switching out all your utility skills to turn your character into a very different fighter, and I like having those options.I will put a note - I was a necromancer in GW1 and I focused entirely on minions.  GW2 doesn't let you do that to the same level, the max minions you can have is roughly 5-6 and that would be a very temporary arrangement. You can't have 10+ fiends following you.But, that works with the games systems. In GW1 i'd make all my skills minion based and I'd stay out of the fight, in GW2 I have all utility minion skills but I always have my 5 weapon skills.  And that works great. I'm more active this way and the game has more lasting appeal honestly.Anyway combat is pretty smooth, nothing is as fun as when 30 people fight a boss event in the middle of a field and you can hardly tell what's going on anymore, there is sooo much to explore to keep completionists satisfied (and for people like me who don't usually care about getting everything, there is such an advantage to getting everything in an area (a special chest and a bunch of experience) I do it anyway and it's a very rewarding experience.The environments are very pretty, scenic, and the game runs really smooth on my PC which has a slightly older video card in it - even at 1980x1080 w/ maxed out)I really like the mission system.. Instead of having a bucket of quests all quests are self contained - basically you walk into an area, see there is a quest going on, and you can join in on it.  There is hardly any reporting to someone (and never across the map or something - just a few feet away always). It's a little less personal but since side quests rarely are, this works fine.And finally, the 'my story' aspect of the game really bothered me at first, only cause I missed the cutscenes more than anything and I really enjoyed the 'world story' aspect of Guild Wars 1.  Over time though... The story has grown on me in GW2 and I probably feel a little closer to characters because of the dialogue based cut-scenes. I still do wish more missions were about 'the world' and not 'you' (now, things shift through the course of the story - and it gives you an excuse to play at least 3 times to see all organizations you can join and their unique missions)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}

I don't get it.The pawns talk way too much, and you cant set options of any pawn besides the main one, and there is no way to shut them up without turning off voices.Quest system is not great either, same old kill or carry type of thing you've seen a thousand times before, but you have to walk across a huge map without easy fast travel to do them.Save system is totally screwed..seriously. One save slot, I guess to stop crystal farming, but I just lost 35 hours because the save file became corrupted. I did not even dream that something like that could happen, but after looking around on the Internet this is a common problem, and you have to back up saves on a flash drive to protect yourself from this issue, which is just stupid..Great game with some flaws, but the save system really ruined the experience for me","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

For free you really can't go wrong and that is a HUGE deal when it comes to games .... especially if your considering buying a game, then you make the purchase, only to find out you feel you've wasted your money. Sleeping Dogs is EXACTLY that kind of game. I'm nearing the completion (after letting this game sit for a while) and I feel I've played enough to give my opinion on Likes and Dislikes.Likes: Good story, lots of content and side activities to keep you busy for a while. The Kung-Fu fighting can be pretty fun and rewarding. I know other reviewers have argued this isn't a GTA clone, but lets be honest here IT IS. Unless you consider driving on the left hand side of the road qualifies as being different, then I must be missing something. Look it's not a bad thing, open world games are among the best (in my opinion). Its a pretty good sandbox that's smaller than a GTA, but there's some exploring to do .Dislikes: I thought Midnight Club LA was the &#34;King&#34; of the failed Rubber-Band AI (I own the game) and Sleeping Dogs just proved to me you can do worse and I didn't think that was possible. Street races are equally bad (if not worse) and I've completed all but a couple of motorcycle races. Just an Epic and embarrassing failure for the game designers here. The blind fore system in combat is also terrible. It would be nice to have some kind of aiming mechanism to go with firing from cover, but there isn't. Just watch for where the bullets are hitting and try to judge. Hopefully you can do this before you run out of bullets.I can't say I would recommend buying this game, but if you can get it for free I would say do so. It has its moments, and it can be fun at times when your playing the main story, but the game mechanisms hold it back.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BI83EVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Eccentric Next Gen Game","reviewText":"One word keeps running through my mind playing this game and that is Eccentric. So we're perfectly clear this means: \"irregular; erratic; peculiar; odd.\" This doesn't mean the game isn't fun. It doesn't mean that it doesn't bring some new and interesting things to the gaming world. But it does it in such an odd way, and combines such disparate game features and design that I cannot help but feel that despite some visionary game play design, they tried to do too much and totally lost focus in the process.Personal preference will dictate if you find these oddities annoying, fun, or not even noticeable.When considering buying this: does consistency and/or details matter to you? The unique game play, hacking focus, great graphics, and general novelty keep it interesting, but it is utterly lacking the cohesive structure and design that marks the difference between good games and great games.Strange Morality:The main character can hack into people's phones to listen to their conversations - their personalities and discussions are wide ranging, funny, strange, and serious, which gives some needed reality and meaning to the game world. Between spying on citizens, you can hack their accounts and steal money - higher earners are better targets but you can still hack laundry store owners and sign holders. So now that you're done spying on these people, stealing their money, manipulating the city infrastructure causing deadly accidents and explosions, you turn into a vigilante, and set out on missions to save individuals from harm. A minor case of psychosis perhaps?Vehicles - you're so special, they turn special when you get inVehicles have decent though very race car simulation like driving. There are several different views, including interior with steering wheel which is rather fun and a nice change from say GTA series where you do not get this perspective. Vehicle damage is extensive and accurate, and they explode rather easily in accidents. They can also be magically and immediately delivered around the block with a phone call.Whatever vehicle you happen to be in turns into a monster-car wrecking-ball. You can easily push under and through other vehicles that are stopped or driving against you, and your car suffers far less damage than anything else on the road. The screen shakes and rumbles as you press the accelerator from a dead stop. Any car, reverse or forward, it's a jarring and strange mechanic.Side games and activities:Take a break from exploding city infrastructure - water pipes, explosive grates, gates, and bridges and play some chess games in a caffe.Feel insane yet? Take a nap and get into a demonic car mini game where an unknown speaker alternately taunts and congratulates you for running people over. It's not just a simple game, there are skill trees, progression, and leader boards to check! A couple other games of a similar trippy nature await.Buy one of two outfits in numerous different color styles. The clothing material/textures are visually stunning. Too bad you're a weirdo who wears the same outfit every day of your life, regardless of the occasion.Constantly interrupted with side missions, you either mark the waypoint or wait a while for your screen to de-clutter. Screen space is in short supply in this game, and is used to terrible effect.Absurdities of the game world:The world is deeply detailed with a massive amount of breakable objects. Trash cans go flying, fences smash apart, and telephone poles are knocked down, and shatter, as most large logs do, into numerous pieces when driven through.They call Chicago the windy city, perhaps that's why the trees are in an massive epileptic fit, constantly, regardless of the slow moving dust particles and leaves lazily floating through the air to showing off next-gen graphics. Your character's face mask is to protect from massive dust particles, not to conceal identity.Boats in the water have no wake - perhaps they hacked that basic and obvious aspect of water travel it into oblivion.Music is controlled through an app on your phone - it's not very clear how to set it up and seems to constantly reset. Also, you have to hack the songs from people, so getting the playlist you want may be difficult. Keeping that playlist playing seems just as difficult.Online AlwaysThe final piece is the online always, even in single player feature. A wonderful advancement in the gaming industry that should really be supported by buying any game that ensures constant server connectivity for the game experience.Thankfully, the game tells you, in a huge message box on your screen (that cannot be acknowledged and closed) when you have lost contact with Ubisoft. The game reconnects in the background, doesn't tell you when it has done so, and then drops you again. Expect to see the loss of server connection window a lot! Thankfully it lasts quite a while, so you can definitely read the lengthy message. You'll probably have time to read this review in the time that window takes to go away and let you play the game with your full screen space again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2014"}

But...1.) The worst thing about PS3 for me is that the number of games is limited. E3 Conference is going on right now and by the looks of it this will no longer a problem soon.2.) Free online play - does anyone else see the significance of this or am I missing something? I played R:FOM and Motorstorm - awesome! I just wish some of my friends would get into it so we can play online (Most of them have kids 5-7 years of age and bought Wiis so they can play together.)3.) Having true high-def is awesome. I'm sure as developers get more comfortable and Sony gives them more support in form of training and tools, more and more games will run 1080 resolution. It is kind of sad though - if you don't have a Hi-Def TV, I don't think you'd be getting your money's worth with PS3.4.) Wi-fi is a nice inclusion. It would only take me 1-2 hrs to run a network cable to the family room, but I didn't have to. This way if you are re-arranging the room layout and move the ent. center, you won't need to re-run the cable.5.) Blue-ray is cool. The online movie rental service I use made it easy to convert my rental que to Blue-Ray wherever possible, so it worked out well. I'm no viddeophile , but watching movies in hi def greatly enhances the experience.6.) Cable connections: Get the HDMI cable for this if your TV supports it. If it doesn't, the component cable will work just as well. I can not tell the difference visually, I just like HDMI because it's only one cable vs. 5 of them in the component. But whatever you get, MAKE SURE YOU DON'T GET SCAMMED by the local BestBuy or whatever into buying a $100 cable. Do your research and you will see it's a rip-off. $20 cable will work just fine.7.)

Then it got delayed but it was all for the best. I got it the day of release. Pop in the disc and took a deep breath before embarking on solid snake's final mission of his life. I remembered getting myself into the training portion of the game learning the controls and getting used to the new old snake's movements before starting the game and it has paid off tremendously. I knew this was a game in its own turf and what an epic porportion this is. I have played all the other metal gear games in the series so I know whos who in the storyline. This game is developed with the fans in mind as all the old characters shows up for a final battle. I now love old snake so much compare to when he was young. It just fits so well. All of us who played the other metal gear games from the early days have aged as well so when you play old snake it has a deep connection to him and it just flows so well. Snake is wiser, gained a tremendous amount of knowledge thruout his life as I have. I felt I was controlling myself in the game. The graphics, sound, gameplay and storyline is top notch especially when you play it on a HDTV. This game is immersive and intense as the story builds up. One by one all old charaters in the series emerges and it really touches you emotionally. They have changed quite a bit since the last chapter where they were introduced. So fans of the series really cared about them and it will stir your emotion while playing the game. I remembered I got really immersed in the game in one of the chapters towards the end that I weep and cried. I couldn't believe I was in tears. No game has ever stir my emotions so much in a game. Anyone who has yet to play this game should play the other metal gear games in the series before diving into this one. If you just play MGS4 without a clue of whos who and what's going on it will not have any effect on you. To fully get the impact this game project one must play the earlier games. I am grateful for the creater Hideo Kojima for an incredible experience. No other game has moved me so much. There are also a lot of cut scenes in order to tie in all the loose ends of the storyline and every metal gear fans should already expect this to be part of the package.

There are memories locked away, and her family has all perished. Alice will have to return to Wonderland, but there's a nasty new piece to the world that must be fought in order to help Alice regain what she has lost.Graphically the game looks amazing, sure there are a couple of texture issues once in a while, and sometimes the camera angle decides to go into very unique angles, but overall this game looks good, and the enemies and levels that you'll have to go through definitely tell of a twisted Wonderland, that only the darkest of thoughts would dream up. There's also the costume changes done to Alice for each stage which definitely adds a little extra flair to what  you get to see.The music and sounds of the level definitely fit the type of game you're playing. I do have to say that there were more creepy sounds than I care to remember, but that's what the game needed and they delivered. You will notice that if there are any speaking pieces that there's an actual voice added to the mix, which to me makes the game that much better.The controls of the game get more complicated as the game progresses. The amount of controls equals how many weapons you have at your disposal. There's also going to be the use of the buttons to play random music pieces in the game in order to advance.Having not played the first of game of the series I really didn't know what to expect. What I can tell you is that this is not your Disney Alice in wonderland. This is a much darker and bloody version. You are Alice, the orphan, ex-mental hospital patient, and more. The lines between reality and that of Wonderland continue to blur throughout the game. You'll get  to meet the Caterpillar, the replacement to the Queen of Hearts, the Mad Hatter, and of course the Cheshire Cat. The majority of your enemies will appear from blobs of what looks like tar or ink. Take then out as fast as you can, some of the can deal some serious damage to you if you let them show you what types of attacks they have. You'll have the Vorpal blade, a pepper grinder, a teapot, explosive white rabbits, and the Hobby Horse to help deal out different types of damage. You'll also be on the look out for pig snouts that will unlock hidden treats. Through about 2/3rds of the game I was enjoying the flow and found the story very interesting, but after that point I just got really fed up with the amount of time sequence platforming you have to do to get through levels. The game become steadily more of a strictly platforming game and less about the action. Though I will say this, when they finally remembered to put the action in they decided to add waves of enemies and make sure you have to fight for your life, and hopefully come out the victor.This isn't the best game I've played, but there's something about it that had me wanting to keep playing it until the very end. I think this game is probably best served as a rented game, but it is definitely something that needs to be checked out. This game gets a 7.9 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

The graphics is stellar.  Barely any graphical issues.  The map is so big that, after 24 hours of just driving around discovering areas, I was not done.  You will also have the ability to explore the ocean.  I like in Southern California, and I can say that they've almost got all of the locations down.  Some I wish they didn't since I know for first hand that those streets are horrible to drive in.Things about the game that drive me crazy.Biggest Problem is that you have to be online or have an online connection to utilize the stock market.1.  After getting into cars, it's strange that you have to wait until the character turns on the engine of the vehicle, even though the vehicle was jacked not broken into.2.  Cops and losing your wanted stars needs a bit more work.  I had 4 stars and hid in the sewers.  Never lost them.  For ten minutes, I waited and the wanted stars never disappeared like usual.3.  Updates.  I dislike having a brand new game and have to update them.4.  The beginning of the game.  Like all of the GTA games, you're limited in what you can do.  Remember in GTA: San Andreas you couldn't go into a clothing shop until a mission told you to.  Well, that kind of limitations to the gameplay in the beginning of the game is there.5.  Same missions as the last ones.6.  I really hate the fact that some missions has my character forced to do something.  During a gun fight, my character had to escape versus what I wanted to do.  My character, Michael, was running to a car to escape, but I keep trying to get him to cover.  After pressing the PS button, I was finally able to control Michael.  In some of the chase scenarios, I was force not to go faster than the others.  After a mission where I was supposed to race two targets, after gaining control over my car, I could NOT go any faster than the other two characters, Michael and Trevor.7.  You don't have a lot of bank heist to do.  After the story, you don't have none.8.  Limited amount of money to make during the story mode.  Not a lot of mission give you any money.  Robbing convenient stores and maybe getting into fights are the only way.  Stock market isn't that reliable obviously.  You can't just go to Cluckin Bell and cause their stocks to fall and Burger Shot up.A note for newbies, don't spend all your money on anything.  And don't finish Lester's missions for Franklin.  You may want to look up his mission so you won't have to restart and do the missions again.  The only downfall for want I'm trying to get at is you may want to upgrade your characters up for mission, but really you'll have a better time after the story.  Don't leave a favorite car in Franklin's/Auntie's garage.  The great think about the game is that, after a mission, your car you've been using may still be around.  Especially the main characters' specialized cars.  Michael's change though so don't upgrade his car unless you're putting it his garages.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Hamster Army","summary":"Barker Succeeds With First Game","reviewText":"Despite some of the shortcomings in the combat and difficulty balance, Undying is a classic video game that succeeds in immersing a player into a classic horror movie.The story takes place during the 1920's in Ireland, where a debt is owed, and a family estate with a history of black magic practice wields the ghosts of a bitter sibling rivalry.It's a viable story involving likeable, interesting characters, and pulls-off some of the scariest moments in the history of video games.The Howlers come out of nowhere and their blows are felt as your screen develops a red glaze and your vision becomes disoriented for a moment after each hit.Your weapon of choice is in your left hand and spells are cast in your right, which is odd at first but becomes comfortable enough. The interface is different, but well done and intuitive. You can also level-up your spell of choice, giving Undying a minor RPG touch.The Unreal engine for the most part looks great and the it's the actual artwork of the designers that makes the graphics so impressive and immersive rather than the Unreal engine's capabilities alone. At times the sky textures are very ugly and \"Doom-like\" for such a new game. But the great character models, foreground textures and over-all level design make up for it big time. Make no mistake Undying is an impressive game visually, you won't be disappointed in that area.The latter levels are a bit out of place but are fun regardless, and the boss battles involve patterns, that take a few times to get down, but are generally enjoyable as well.The gameplay does have a bit of variety, requiring you to find someone or blow something up, or find an object, which takes some exploring and logical thought, making it more than just your typical FPS.Finally Undying scared [...] me at times, the Howlers stuck with in my dreams at night while I played this game, and you know a game's done it's job when that happens.The only complaint I have is that the game's difficulty settings are too far apart, but playing on Normal is a good way to go through the first time, it still can be challenging in various areas.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Eh?","reviewText":"Back in 1996, Capcom introduced  both Japanese and Americans gamers a brand-new world of videogaming. Despite the rather awkward name of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, which is just plain out laughable, the title has become a household name. This movie-like, horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming, horror. Yeah, very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob (Aeries' funeral in Final Fantasy VII), some games built mystery or suspense (Gray Fox's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid), but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter. Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary, and the player's fear as the biggest opposition. In a sense, it is a movie.  Useless to say, Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation. The original game presented an amazing surface. However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story. Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel. Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced. Anxious gamers couldn't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy. Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry. Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot. Konami cashed in with Silent Hill. Survival/Adventure games went mainstream.  After RE2 respectfully lived, a third installment was introduced, this time hype was scarce. It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two. Fearing the worst, the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom.  And is.  From the experience of the two Resident Evil games, the player may expect the &quot;scare moments.&quot; While playing on a big screen t.v., with surround sound, the volume almost reverberating the room, and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window, I felt no fear. Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine, but original fans will expect each scare attempt. Though few changes have been added, RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2. In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving.  RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series. When catching a glimpse of RE3, excitement was absent. RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame. The story must take a new direction! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent, or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City. Nemesis, a ferocious, mean, bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player, proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge.  The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game's abrupt end. The slogan, &quot;if the Suspense doesn't kill you, then something else will,&quot; lives truly in the second game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2000"}

Coming back to it, it's still the second best game in my collection  (Deus Ex is hard to top).  If you enjoy FPS games, then you should give this a try.  It's a cut above the usual Doom and Quake type shooters, as you are allowed plenty of flexibility as to how your character performs in the game.  You are given upgrade points, and can put them towards whatever attributes you want..  which basically means you can play the game in a number of ways.  You aren't really given the freedom that a game like Morrowind or Deus Ex gives you, but the game does ask you to think about what you want to do, and it accommodates your decisions better than most games.However, after coming back a year later, the single player FPS part of the game isn't what keeps me playing it.  I'm addicted to the Light Cycle races, now.  The light cycles are the most innovative, hyper, and fun thing I've seen in a game in a long time.  I'd rather play Light Cycles than buy Half Life 2 at this point.Overall, this game has a lot to offer you.  It isn't the kind of game that you'll stop playing after it's done.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play.

Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller.

Jefferson","summary":"A welcome trip down memory lane!","reviewText":"As a fan of the original Punch-Out!! titles on NES and SNES, I knew that this game was a must have for me.  Having finally played the title yesterday, I am glad to report that it certainly does not disappoint!  This is hardcore Punch-Out gameplay at it's best!The thing that I love about Punch-Out!! is that, like the original games, it really isn't a brawler.  You can't button-mash your way through the game.  Rather, it really is more of a puzzler, in that each opponent has a \"tell\", and a specific fighting style.  Once you have him figured out, it is just a matter of countering him.  Don't be mistaken, however: this game's difficulty get's hardcore really quickly (much like the original games!).  For instance, last night, I was able to breeze right through the Minor Circuit (using the motion controls), but in the second circuit (Major Circuit I believe), the fighter \"Great Tiger\" (a welcome import from the original NES game!) gave me a really hard time! I found myself REALLY challenged, much to my delight!  Also, much like the original games, once you defeat several of the players in the game, you get to fight them again later in the game.... however, their fighting style (the puzzle element of the game) has completely changed, and the difficulty is ramped up drastically.  I am confident that this game will provide hours and hours of gameplay.  Anyway, here are some of my observations about the game:LOVED-*Art style - everything is hand drawn, colorful, and animated.  This game looks great, and doesn't take itself too seriously.  Also, several humerous head-nods to the original games were included (lik Doc urging you  to join Club Nintendo ringside!).  Also, some of the knockout animations (like the original games) are REALLY satisfying and funny.  When I knocked out Disco Kid, he spun around like a top and hit all four corners of the ring while making pinball machine noises.  Now THAT'S classic Punch-Out!! if I've ever seen it!*Difficulty - one thing that games are missing these days is hardcore difficulty.  The original Punch-Out!!, as well as titles like the Contra series or the Mega Man series tended to be so difficult at times that you were tempted to throw your controller at the wall!  There is nothing worse to me than just breezing through a game.  I was pleasantly surprised that, even though I knew how to beat most of the fighters that I have faced so far (since they were in the original games), they still were no push-overs this time around.  The characters are FASTER than they were in the old games, and the motion controls ad a new dimension of difficulty.*Achievements - this game has a simple achievement system where you are challenged, for instance, to beat a character in one round, or with only right jabs, etc.  Achievements are something special for any Wii game, since so very select few developers are including them in Wii titles.  This ads loads of replay value in my opinion (I am STILL trying to get all the trophies unlocked in Smash Bros Brawl! What can I say... I'm a perfectionist!)*Multiplayer - the game includes a simple multiplayer mode where you play head to head with a friend as Little Mac.  It is really simple, but it is fun.  I only wish that you could have played as other boxers and that some kind of online play was included... but this was still a welcome feature!*Controls - Wii Sports Boxing was fun, but really left me wanting a great boxing title where the motion controls really work well.  Punch-Out!!, while not really a \"Boxing\" game (it's no Knockout Kings for sure!), has implemented some really smooth motion controls.  Rather than relying solely on motion controls, you simply swing right and left.  You hold a button while swinging to do an upwards swing, and press a button while swinging to do a star punch.  The motion controls are simple, and they work. Later in the game, as the difficulty ramps up even higher, I have a feeling that I will switch to the classic NES controls rather than the motion controls (Wii remote on it's side), as this will allow for more speed and responsiveness (since a button press is always faster than a swing of the wiimote), so I'm glad this was included.Disliked:*Could have included a few more original/new boxers*No online playAll in all, this game is really wonderful.  Certainly a must-have for any hardcore gamer who owns (or is thinking about buying) a Wii.Scores:Presentation: AGameplay: A+Replay Value: AMultiplayer: BOverall: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"Don't Believe All The Exaggerated Rave Revies Of This Game","reviewText":"I purchased this game because of all the rave reviews and found to my disappointment that it was not all that.First, there was a lot of hoopla regarding the graphics. The graphics in this game is a mixed bag. The in-game graphics is okay actually. But it is not exceptional in my opinion. In one professional review it was said that the graphics in this game is one of the best on the Playstation 3. If I were to compare this to other games such as Uncharted, it would not even be on the same level graphics-wise. But then these are two totally different games so I will compare it to Zelda: Twilight Princess. ZTP blows this game away. Then there is the cutscene animations. They are terrible. They look like Saturday morning cartoons. Seriously, I am not joking. Obviously two different groups created the in-game animations and the cutscene animations.The music was highly rated in professional reviews due to a great composer being in involved with this game. I agree it is good. But I don't think that it exceptional. Zelda had better soundtracks than this game. And I can say that even the old Zelda: Windwaker had a better and interesting soundtrack.One thing that Ni No Kuni has though that Zelda does not have is in-game dialogue by the characters. And they are actually well done. But again, nothing exceptional. I played it under the English speech setting so it was an American voice-over. The actor did a decent job. But why did they do away with the speech for most of the game? Most of it involves reading texts with a silly sound effect to go with it.Story-wise, this game did not captivate me. It was too simplistic and rather corny. I guess that it is due to the type of anime this is. I found it to be rather girly and childish. This game is definitely for the kids. But I don't know if the kids would stick with this game due to the simplistic nature of the story and constant text reading. To give you an idea of what these dialogues are about, in one you spend a few minutes just discussing about a wand that you need to replace the twig you are using in its place. And that discussion runs on over how it is so special and that you need to test it in a big place because such a special wand needs a special place to test its special powers. And that goes on and on. And you can't choose what to say or how to respond. At least in games such as Mass Effect, you can choose what you are going to say. Here, it is all just boring repetitive dialogues. What makes it irritating is the canned Scottish accent that the side-kick Drippy uses.The combat is not like what I am used to in that it is not truly real-time combat in that it is a hybrid system in which is more of the usual RPG spell casting and turn-based stick bashing with a little freedom of movement added in. If you like Final Fantasy, you will feel at home with this game.Finally, the game play, the most important aspect to any video game, is not there for me. I found it rather boring and tedious. Given how dragged and artificially stretched out the dialogue texts are, I can see how this game will last you easily 40 hours or more. The story itself could probably fit in a 30 minute show. After a while of playing this, I felt like I was in a kiddie game and had to stop and put in a different game to get me out of that funk. This game is obviously for the anime fans, particularly Ghibli fanboys who raved so much about this game. Nothing wrong with that. To each his own. But this game is just not my cup of tea.As to those who fanboys who say that I should give it at least 3 stars because it is not a terrible game, I say to you, you got the ratings system wrong. 3 stars means that you like it. I did not like this game at all. As I have stated, it is a boring game. Now, maybe a ten year old would probably enjoy it. But not all of them would like it due to the dragging nature of this game. I'm sure that there will be fanboys bashing my review but to all of you who are reading these reviews to decided whether to purchase this game or not, you have been warned. This review is not for the fanboys. It is for those like myself who have been swayed by fanboy reviews and regretted it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00D4WTO1M","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Frye","summary":"More of the same is starting to get old.","reviewText":"Before I start the review, let me say one thing -- I love Call of Duty. Some of you may want to crucify me for that, but I still love Call of Duty, and I have been a big fan since I first popped Call of Duty 4 into my PS3 a few years ago. It has the same fast-paced multiplayer action in every installment, with a cinematic campaign and fun co-op modes thrown on top for an overall fantastic package. Ghosts is Infinity Ward's latest Call of Duty installment. It was hyped to have a dramatic story in its campaign, a unique new Squads mode, and the familiar Call of Duty multiplayer mode with the usual improvements made to keep it fresh. But how good is it?CAMPAIGNThe story has you playing as Logan Walker, a soldier fighting for a country that is under attack from the Federation, a power-hungry South American superpower. In the first minutes of the game, a Federation squad hijack ODIN, an American controlled space station that has the ability to shoot devastating lasers at Earth, and immediately begin firing on the United States. A nation that was once a powerful and influential power in the world is reduced to nothing more than a barren wasteland.The story starts off strong, with an initial focus on you and your brother defending San Diego from the foreign invaders. However, without spoiling anything, the story eventually becomes unfocused, and loses the desperate feel that was present early in the game. Instead of defending America from the Federation, you start globe-trotting to places like Venezuela and Antarctica, making it feel just like the Modern Warfare games. You go from one explosive set-piece to the next, with little cohesion between the events. For example, you go from flying a helicopter through an enemy infested base, to blowing up an oil rig in Antarctica, to swimming and shooting underwater, to shooting in space. Yes, space. It feels like the developers came up with cool set-pieces that they could put in the game, then tried to come up with a story to tie them all together. While it was like this in the Modern Warfare games, at least you genuinely cared for your teammate's lives, like Soap and Captain Price. In Ghosts, that feeling is gone. In the end, I didn't really care what happened to my teammates. I just wanted to see what the next epic set-piece was.In terms of gameplay, it is pretty much what you'd expect. Actually, it is exactly what you'd expect. You run, shoot, run, shoot, reload, watch the obligatory explosion that causes your character to fall back, run, shoot -- you get the idea. It's the same cinematic formula that has been used in other Call of Duty games, and it works -- at least, to me it does.Overall, Ghost's campaign features the same cinematic gameplay that has been present in all Call of Duty games. However, without a good story to back it up, this campaign felt noticeably more average than any previous Call of Duty campaign. It isn't quite up to par with the Modern Warfare games, and it certainly isn't up to par with the Black Ops campaigns, which I believe are the best campaigns in the FPS genre. If you are going to get this game just for the campaign, then I strongly recommend renting it, as it is not worth full price for the campaign alone.MULTIPLAYERNow it's time for what any true Call of Duty fan wants to hear -- the multiplayer. Anybody that has played Call of Duty multiplayer knows what to expect -- fluid and fast-paced gunplay that isn't too hard to pick up and play. Unlike, say, Battlefield, where you need to play for a few hours to familiarize yourself with all of the vehicles and classes, Call of Duty is as easy as picking up a controller and playing.So what's new? The create a class system has been retooled, allowing for more freedom in how you want to play. It is basically Black Ops 2's Pick 10 system, but only perks count, instead of everything from weapons to attachments. The better the perk, the more points it takes to equip it. For example, Sleight of Hand, which allows faster reloading, costs two points, while Deadeye, which slightly increases your weapon's power after every kill, costs five points. You can also customize your soldier -- a first for the series. Completing specific assignments award you gear, such as helmets, armor, and masks. The customization is a cool new feature, but it doesn't matter that much, considering you never see your character during gameplay.There are a few new game modes. In Cranked, whenever you get a kill, you have thirty seconds to get another kill, or you explode. During the thirty seconds you gain faster mobility, and faster reload speed, which can help you get the next kill. In Blitz, players must run through the enemy's portal in their spawn to score. Once you score, you get teleported back to your side. Grind is basically Kill-Confirmed, but instead of simply picking up dog-tags, you must take them to one of two banks in the map to score. In Hunted, you spawn with nothing but a pistol with a clip of ammo. To get better equipment, you must take weapons that drop into the map from care packages. In Search and Rescue, you only have one life, but if your teammate picks up your dog-tag after you die, you get to respawn.That's about it. While I still had a great time playing the multiplayer, I felt that it wasn't new enough. The back of the box states that the game features \"redefined multiplayer.\" I'm sorry, but I didn't really see what was redefined about it. It was basically the exact same thing we have played before, only with a few new modes and a slightly revised create-a-class system. However, while it may not be completely new, it is still really fun. It seems more balanced than previous Call of Duty games. With a few exceptions (the MSBS is a ridiculously overpowered one-burst, one-kill death cannon), the weapons seem to all be balanced. In Black Ops 2, SMG's seemed overpowered compared to the other weapons. In Ghosts, all of the weapons are around the same power level, and there is a weapon for every player. For example, I am a big LMG fan in this game, while in previous Call of Duty games I never really liked them that much.Besides multiplayer, there is also Squads mode. In this mode, you customize a ten person squad, and take a selection of them into a match, versus either another player and their squad, or all AI opponents. While it can be entertaining to take a squad of snipers into a match on a big map and dominate another player's shotgun-equipped squad, I found that Squads is mostly just glorified bot matches. Since the Squads matches are played exactly the same as a standard multiplayer match, I found myself wishing I was in an actual multiplayer match against more unpredictable opponents. While the AI for the squads is really good, I found that they never really switched tactics. They just run around and shoot, save for the occasional objective capture.The one mode that I absolutely loved in Squads was Safeguard, which is basically Survival from MW3, but with a few tweaks. For example, instead of buying weapons, perks, and equipment from pre-determined points around the map, they drop from the sky as care packages in random locations. It is also four player co-op, instead of two players. Safeguard is an absolute blast, especially if you're playing with friends.There is also Extinction, which is Infinity Ward's take on the popular Zombies mode in the Treyarch Call of Duty games, trading out the mindless zombies for quick and intelligent aliens. Instead of simply surviving wave after wave of zombies, Extinction has players drilling into alien hives with a drill that they must carry with them. There are 14 hives to destroy, with an escape from a nuclear bomb to end the game, which takes around an hour to play through. If you're playing with three other people that know what they are doing, then Extinction can be a blast. However, since there is only one level, it gets old after a few games. Infinity Ward is going to support Extinction with DLC, so that should increase replay value for Extinction if you have purchased the Season Pass.The graphics in Call of Duty are basically the same graphics that you have seen in any Call of Duty game since MW2 in 2009. For a next-gen game, Ghosts looks outdated compared to, say, Battlefield 4. While the PS4 version looks better than the current-gen versions, you can only tell the difference if you are playing the two versions side by side. If you have already bought Ghosts for the PS3, there isn't much of a reason to upgrade - even if you are taking advantage of the $10 upgrade deal for PS3 to PS4.The audio is pretty much what you would expect - tons of gunfire and explosions, and an epic soundtrack. The voice acting, while good at times, can seem pretty forced and dull, especially from Hesh, your brother in the campaign. His voice actor sounds like he's constantly waiting for the next lunch break. Other characters, like Merrick and Keegan, sound so generic that you can hardly remember their voices. Other than the voice acting, everything else is up to par with other Call of Duty games.Overall, I am a bit disappointed with Ghosts. For the first next-gen Call of Duty, I was expecting just a bit more. However, with that said, I still had a blast playing it, and there was never a moment of boredom in its campaign and multiplayer options. While some additions are lackluster, like Squads, I can still see myself playing this game for quite some time. However, for Infinity Ward's next game, I expect a bit more innovation. Just adding some new modes and killstreaks doesn't make the game next-gen.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Score: 8.0 out of 10Story: 7.0Graphics: 7.5Audio: 7.0Gameplay: 8.5Replay Value: 9.0","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

I'm sure most will feel the same way once God of War III is finally unleashed upon us. The graphics are some of the best ever on any system and it's very entertaining to play (gotta love survival horror), with a good variety of weapons and enemies. Your sidekick is a hot chick that many say does nothing more than get in your way, but I kind of like this addition. Sure she does stupid things at times, but she also stores items for you, so it's like having double the space to pick up stuff as you go along. I only gave her a pistol to use, which won't kill most enemies, but her shots often slow them down and warn me when they are getting too close. The main negatives for me are that you still can't move and shoot at the same time and the story is pretty lame. There is some replay value, but I'm glad I rented this one and took my time, beating it over a period of about a week. It might take you 12 hours or so if you take your time. It was great fun blasting through and ripping apart the various wild creatures found throughout the six chapters, but it's not a game that screams to be played multiple times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2009"}

Which would put me against playing co-op much. I rather just play solo. The computer A.I of my teammate, Sheva was usually manageable.Some things I did throughly like were the weapon selection.

Hutson","summary":"Fun Game! Easy to Control Movements!","reviewText":"I just got finished playing all of the sports in Kinect Sports and here is my evaluation:1. Track & Field: This area includes a variety of different activities that work well with the basic body movements the Kinect can control. These include running , jumping, and throwing things (javelins & discus).  I think young and old would both have fun with this! This may actually be my favorite activity in this game.2. Bowling:  Not as much control as Wi Sports bowling--but it is actually feels more like bowling when you can just stick your hand out to pick up the ball and then swing your arm to bowl.  No controller to hold on to or push buttons. Once again this is an activity that would appeal to both young and old. Personally, I still like the bowling in Wii Sports better because of the more precise control.3. Boxing:  I like this better than the Wii Sports Boxing--but there is still some lag time and I just don't get the feel that all my moves are translating accurately.  Plus, like an earlier reveiwer indicated it seems like punching wildly is actually a winning approach in this game. I do like how you can just hold your arms up to block--this felt very natural.  I'm waiting for the Kick Boxing version because when you kick your legs in this activity your avatar kicks its legs--but they don't seem to translate to \"hits\" in the game.4. Beach Volleyball:  This one will take some time to master.  It can get a bit confusing because there are several different techniques involved--jumping, hitting, and blocking. If you're tall--make sure you don't have a ceiling fan above you--or at least make sure it's not on!5. Table Tennis:  Once again it was fun to play without a controller in my hand but I felt there were a few times when the intensity of my hits were not reflected in what actually happened on screen.  For example, when an opportunity comes up for a \"smash\" the game announces it and then actually does it regardless of whether I swung harder or not.6. Soccer:  Fun and interesting.  You don't have to run around the field yourself. Your player magically appears where the ball is kicked to.  Simple body movements control your kicks and blocks.  Gray directional lines on the screen show the directionally options when kicking and your location when blocking.Throughout the games the Kinect takes photos and short videos of your movements.  These are played at the end of each game.  The images are saved so you can share them with others.  This feature will appeal to some and not to others.  For example, I find the images of my son interesting and humorous--but I need to find out how to erase the images of me!Adding a second player was extremely easy.  If I wanted to join my son all I had to do was step in front of the TV and the Kinect added me to the in-play game.  The graphics are also much better than the Wii!  Kinect Sports looked great on a 40\" HDTV.  We don't even play the Wii on this TV because of how bad it looks.Bottom line:  If you have an XBOX already--adding the Kinect and Kinect Sports really adds a nice dimension to your video game experience.  If you have young kids or older folks that have trouble remembering what buttons to push on a remote--it doesn't get any easier than the Kinect.P.S. It is a neat and strange sensation to be standing in front of your TV and the avatar on the screen is doing the same movements that you are. You can sway, move your arms and legs, and dance, and the avatar mimics it.  This alone makes for good entertainment!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

It's been a long time since Oblivion came out and...well...to be honest it's gotten to where I've played it as much as it can be played.  Two Worlds 2 seemed like a promising fill-in until Skyrim is released and the devs were making claims of having listened to the customers and changed the game entirely from the absolute abortion that the original Two Worlds was.The good:  Not a lot of difficulty in choosing what your character is going to look like.  He's got the same stupid braid in his hair no matter what color skin or eyes you give him...and you can make him taller or shorter.  This could be a bad, I suppose...but...meh...I honestly can't think of anything that stands out as superb in this game so far.The bad:  Oh...where to begin.Controls:  Clunky.  ...that d*mn \"X\" button that's used for jump AND to activate things.  Menu stays open after you loot a treasure chest or go shopping...how freaking annoying is that?  The \"X\" button that doesn't actually do anything when you REALLY want it to.  \"Push X to open chest\"  Nothing happens.  Get a little closer.  Same.  Get a little closer.  Same.  Step back to start over and step into a campfire.  Want to press \"X\" to open a door while moving?  Good luck.  Want to press \"X\" to talk to an NPC that will cause a sequence?  Sorry...have to step forward into the little square the game wants so it can activate a cut scene.Graphics:  Meh...GI Joes doing Broadway.  Arm movements are jerky...and, like I said, these guys look like you can clip a sword or whatever weapon you want in between their fingers and thumb.  Lips don't move in time to voices.  Oh...which takes us to sound.Sound:  Voice acting...THE HORROR!  \"Hi...my name is generic hero guy...you're going to be finding yourself frantically hitting the button to skip past the cutscenes because it sounds like I've been smoking since I was three years old.  It's obviously also made my joints a little stiff...because I move like a GI Joe that you left out in the rain...that once shiny screw inside the hole in my back will now leave a little rusty spot on that peg on all of your backpacks and radio equipment.  Attach a sword and watch me swing in the same moves over and over like Obi Wan Kinobi from Episode 1...another event promising epic win and delivering mediocrity.Auto-save.  Really?  I was jerking around after I finally figured out where I needed to go (because the flag and navigation system in this game is absolute balls) and managed to come across some enemies FINALLY!  FINALLY!!!  I get to roam and kill stuff...YEAAAAHHHHH!  I kill a few, level up, open some chests (oh, SOB the lockpicking...more on that in a minute) and then out of nowhere this little goblin (called something else in this game...but they're goblins) comes out of nowhere and Mark McGuires me from full health to nothing.  Yeah...that \"AutoSave\" that kept popping up in the corner must have just been screwing with me.  Started out back before I ever started exploring...at level 2 again.  At least I didn't have to suffer through the clunky tutorials and horrendous voice acting a second time...hopefully I don't have much storyline to suffer through.Lockpicking:  I wasn't thrilled with Oblivion's lockpicking...but it was WAY better than this.  Half the time I click when I'm lined up with the \"notch\" and I miss.  Friggen crappy controls!!!This...is a game you're going to want to wait on and get when it's down to about $29.99.

Once gamers reach the second inn, however, the game expands immensely with multiplayer capabilities and Internet items.\"Dragon Quest IX\" is a massive game that packs in hours of gameplay, side quests and the possibility to join other gamers in multiplayer quests.This game was a huge hit in Japan, where people all over Tokyo could join random strangers in wireless multiplayer quests. Although \"Dragon Quest IX\" isn't as popular in the U.S., it still provides infinite possibilities for group fun.The main quest starts with your character as an angel-like person called a Centurion, helping villagers in Angel Falls. Your character will rescue them from danger and do chores for them to receive benevolence energy in exchange. Supposedly, if the Centurions collect enough benevolence for the Yggdrasil tree, they can summon a celestial train to take them to the promised land in the sky above.Matters get complicated when a shocking explosion from the promised land knocks you down to Earth. Now your character must figure out how to return to the Centurion world.The main quest is a beautiful 3D game with the typical Dragon Quest battle system. Most quests require lots of tedious grinding, battling enemies for experience points. However, the extra features more than make up for the old style of gameplay. A character builder system allows you to design the look of your character, from the gender to the anime-style eyes. Each piece of equipment on your character has a distinguished look to it, allowing you to make your character look unique.Once your character reaches the Stornway Inn, you can also build custom characters with whatever class suits that person. So you could add in thieves, mages, martial artists and whatever other classes you need.The game provides tons of mini-quests in the style of the Internet quests in MMORPGs. Players can fight monsters for the items that are needed to fulfill the quest objectives. As a reward, they receive an item, as well as a \"CLEAR\" stamp in their record of quests completed.All these features add to an unprecedented experience that crams the best elements of MMORPGs in a handheld console game. The game even provides an Internet store, which is updated daily with rare items that you might have trouble finding otherwise. Players can update the store every day after 8 a.m.The game is a rich masterpiece of colorful RPG gameplay and Internet expansions. And if you know friends who play \"Dragon Quest IX\", you can join them for a Dungeons & Dragon's-style meeting. You can band together to defeat some of the especially difficult bosses on the treasure hunting quests.It's a marvelous game, one of the hottest games on the market right now. The game will expand even more when Gamestop provides extra downloadable maps for \"Dragon Quest IX\" players on July 31.

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"Perfect","reviewText":"Having opted for a Genesis/Mega Drive over a SNES during my youth, I never really had a chance to play Super Metroid and thus am not prey to the lingering nostalgia almost everyone who owned an SNES during that time now feels for this game. I had played the original Metroid on the NES many years back, but had never really explored it too deeply. And while I had played and loved the Prime series on the Gamecube, I've never owned a GBA and so missed the two Metroid games which were released on it.Boy, what a mistake that was.Which isn't to say that I don't still love the Prime games on the gamecube (I do), but they were an entirely different experience from the 2D bliss of the GBA Metroid titles: Metroid Fusion and Metroid: Zero Mission.While I enjoyed Fusion immensely, I find that the pacing of Zero Mission is just right to inspire in me a slavish desire to replay the game and achieve a better end-ranking. It isn't short, but it can be comfortably completed in a day when one had nothing better to do.The play mechanics are superb, with action and exploration never feeling awkward or unnatural. The level design is amazing (consider how deeply recent portable Castlevania games have been influenced by the style of play, which originated in Super Metroid, and, expanded over the two series, has come to be known as 'Metroidvania.' The essence of a Metroidvania is exploring a complex and highly interwoven environment where one must return to previous segments of the map to unlock new locations with some newly acquired skill.). The music and sound are not spectacular, but I found some tunes surprisingly catchy. Enemies are well-balanced with some clever boss fights. The whole game is a seamless and thrilling adventure. And it is one of the better remakes I've played: perhaps not as drastic in terms of quality shift as was the Gamecube remake of RE1, but this is still pretty impressive. Near the end of the game, there is even a new segment which surprised me with a new gameplay style.2D games don't come better than this. Get it while you still can.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2010"}

The public is gripped with fear as the police seem powerless to stop the carnage, and another potential victim &#151; Shaun Mars &#151; has gone missing. Now four characters, each following their own leads and with their own motives, must take part in a desperate attempt to prevent the killer from taking yet another life.","reviewerName":"Jerry P. Danzig","summary":"For Control Freaks Only","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wi has proved unexpectedly successful in the current generation of video game players in large part because of its intuitive controls (its lower price compared to the PS3 and Xbox360 hasn't hurt either).Even Granny who has never played a video game before can pick up the nunchuck, or whatever it's called, and throw strikes and spares bowling.To be fair to Heavy Rain, I have only played the demo but found myself so exasperated by the non-intuitive controls that I had no desire to go further, however intriguing the story, however beautiful the graphics.Someone else has mentioned that the game controls like Dragon's Lair -- a prompt comes onscreen, and you need to respond by pushing the correct button or moving the controller this way and that immediately.  Now maybe young gamers with sharp eyes and giant screen TVs can actually read these prompts from across the room, but to a middle-aged gamer like me with a standard-sized CRT TV, these prompts became invitations to push buttons randomly.Even a simple action like knocking on a door or pulling an asthma inhaler out of a pocket became an epic confrontation for me.IMO the best game controls are those that draw the least attention to themselves, and here the controls are the most innovative, if misguided, elements of the game.  I'm reminded of some contemporary rock bands who try to compensate for the weakness of their material by overplaying their instruments.Other reviews here claim that you can get used to the controls as the game progresses.  In the course of the first hour of play, I found my frustration only mounting.If you haven't played Heavy Rain, I STRONGLY urge you to download the demo from the PlayStation Store online BEFORE you buy the game.  If the controls are to your liking, then you may enjoy this unusual title.  But if you find yourself at odds with the controls here from the git-go like me, then you will want to spend your money on other games like Red Dead Redemption that feature equally intriguing stories and eye-popping graphics but which employ standard controls.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Regis","summary":"Guild Wars:  Good Value - No Monthly Fees = I won't try it again.","reviewText":"The graphics were okay, but the server problems even with a 50 Mbps connection and a Windows 8 Computer made it a horrible experience.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

The packaging seems rather cheap looking for a product selling for $200. The PSP is much lighter than before, but you can hardly tell it's slimmer. It seems that part of the weight was reduced by using thinner plastic. The plastic battery cover is so thin that it took me 10 minutes to get it back on for fear of cracking it. Don't expect a lot of extras like before. No carrying cord, no earphones, no cleaning cloth. And if you've played Daxter before and thought you would just trade this game in, think again. It does not come in the usual game case. Just a UMD-sized paper case.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2007"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"Mitch","summary":"Amazing Game","reviewText":"I was so surprised by this video game.

When you take an epic franchise and let the scoring system overshadow the campaign, many people aren't going to like it.Concept: 7/10Take Gears of War, focus on 7 short mini-stories with an Angry Birds style Rating System, keep the VS Modes, and replace Horde Mode with a Survival Mode.  Although, this is probably the weakest of the Gears series, it's still kind of fun.  But in the past, Gears wasn't about being kinda fun.  It was about being Epic!Story: 6/10Set years before the other games, the Gears are in military court for disobeying a direct order and each member gives their testimony on what happened and why they disobeyed their commander.  Each character narrates as you play through a Chapter of the game.  \"And there we were, surrounded by locusts...\"  There are 6 areas +1 bonus area that you can unlock later on called Aftermath.  Since the characters are giving their testimony, the suspense is gone because you know they all survived the encounters.  80% of the game is just a recap, so it lacks drama.  It just feels like empty narration as you play through levels.Graphics: 9/10The graphics are very well done as you would expect and there's some good variety in the levels.  There are dark, creepy environments, well lit ruins, a beach invasion, etc...  All of the levels look great and the characters, enemies, and weapons are all rendered well.  The special effects like explosions and very well done.Gameplay: 8/10The Campaign is about 5-7 hours long and you can blow right through it if you want.  It's typical Gears gameplay with a few new weapons added.  The AI works great most of the time and they stay with you, fight enemies, and if you get wounded (DBNA), they get to you pretty quickly.  Then there are times when the AI hiccups and good guys and bad guys are just standing around together, like they're on a break or the ref called time out.  It's really strange, but a grenade usually wakes everyone back up again.Each level begins with an optional Difficulty Option, like restricted ammo, restricted weapons, reduced visibility, more powerful enemies, etc...  If you select this, then you get a scoring boost.You are scored by how risky you play.  So, killing enemies is good.  Head shots give you a bonus for accurate aiming, blowing up enemies gives a bonus, and executions give you a bonus.  So, you're rewarded for not playing defensively,  hiding behind cover, and spraying bullets into the enemy.  These encounters are fairly short and involve moving through a level or defending an area against an onslaught of enemies.  On the defensive levels, you are attacked by waves of enemies and you have time to set up your defenses between waves.  You can place sentry guns, use grenades as mines, use a tripwire crossbow to set traps, grab a heavy weapon, etc...  Then you get attacked.The levels are all pretty fun and you can replay them on higher difficulties if you want a greater challenge.  Coop is available on every level, too.  Throughout the Level, you can see your \"Score\" at the top of the screen.  When you get a Head Shot, Gib, Execution...  you see the bar fill up.  As it fills, you get up to 3 Stars.  Once you get all 3 Stars, you never lose points, so you're good!  If you're into the Angry Birds style scoring system, it's fun.  If you aren't, it's a bit distracting because the scoring has more of a priority over the story.After you finish the first 6 Chapters, you unlock Aftermath, which is actually a cool Gears storyline where the characters battle through hostile territory to acquire a ship.  This part of the game feels great, but it's less than an hour long and shows you what the rest of the game was missing.  Then you ask yourself the inevitable question, \"Why wasn't the rest of the game like this?\"Multiplayer: 7/10In addition to Coop, there's the standard VS Modes and DBNO has been removed, so if you're shot, you're dead.  No more executions in Multiplayer.  I tried using a bunch of the different weapons, but why bother?  A Gnasher (shotgun) kills in 1 shot at point blank range.  Just dive at and enemy and kill them.There's also a Survival Mode, where you and a team have to defend an area from 10 waves of enemies.  There are character classes here, like Medic, Scout, Engineer, and Soldier.  Medics can revive downed allies with Stim Grenades, Engineers can build sentry guns and repair fences.  Scouts can get to high ground and snipe.  The Soldiers can drop ammo crates so everyone can refill.It takes some getting used to, but this game is challenging and fun.Sound: 9/10The sound effects are Great and like all other Gears games, it is best enjoyed when played LOUDLY!Replay Value: 8/10The Campaign is very short, but you do gain XP every time you play any mode and level up your character.  When you level up, you unlock different weapon skins, characters, or character skins.  Additional skins are available for purchase, too.  The Multiplayer Modes are at least worth trying out, but I didn't get hooked on them.Overall:  7/10If you were a huge fan of Gears, and you liked the dramatic stories, the intense battles, horde mode, etc... You're going to be disappointed here.If you want to play a Gears Game for Points and Level Up your Character to unlock skins for Multiplayer, then you'll enjoy it and play it for a while.  But this game is really lacking the dramatic impact of the previous Gears games.Buy it if you like the direction Gears is headed.Buy it if you'll take advantage of the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you have 5-7 hours and just want to blow through the campaign.Avoid it if you were a Hardcore Gears Fan and won't like the new changes.Avoid it if you like strong stories over scoring systems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004XOWT","description":"If the original PlayStation was the video game console equivalent of the  '60s-era Volkswagen Beetle--economic, reliable, loads of fun--the PS One could  be considered the new Beetle--a hip restyling of those same qualities.Make no mistake: the PS One has all of the same functionality as the original  PlayStation workhorse, will work with all of the same peripherals and  accessories, and will play the existing PlayStation game library, as well as  audio CDs (also note that, like the original PlayStation, it's not compatible  with the more advancedPlayStation  2). The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller. That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

You really hear the boom when you shoot them.The campaign is one of the better FPS campaigns I've played recently. It's well-laid out, with good placement and excellent art direction.But what I like most is the online play. The differing loadouts are well-balanced and interesting. If you just have a standard bolter you have a sneaky sort of mobility. If you have a heavy bolter you have firepower but not much mobility. If you have a jetpack you have wildly powerful mobiiity, but limited firepower.The jetpack in particular is the best jetpack implementation I've seen in a game. It is wild in its velocity and barely under control. It is very powerful, but you need to be smart about it. A smart player with a standard bolter can kill a jetpack player.There is also a \"horde\" mode which is fun at first, but eventually becomes quite a chore since each round lasts 20 waves of enemies, and so from start to finish takes like an hour. That is too long. even worse, people get bored and quit on you.Another DLC is the dreadnaught pack which basically allows one player in the deathmatch to become a heavily armored dreadnaught. This adds another level of tension to the game.Really an excellent and overlooked game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

The visual effects of this game are stunning, it is set in Christmas in Gotham two years after Zero Year and the snow is a wonderful backdrop, the characters all have their breath visible, everything you would expect to see if you were watching an actual movie with real live actors.  From the very first boss battle, I was hooked, it took me back to all the challenging boss battles I remember from the Nintendo/N64/Sony PS1 days where you cursed because it was actually a CHALLENGE to beat the boss.All the normal Arkham things are found here, Batarang, Detective Mode, Batwing, etc.  Because it is set so early, Commissioner Gordon is Detective Gordon still (which I liked that little detail they stuck to, they could have screwed that one up).  The cast of characters is phenomenal.So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  Here is my opinion why it did not earn that last star from me.  Roger Craig Smith voices Batman, and he just doesn't do it as well as Kevin Conroy has done Batman for so long.  Mark Rolston as Deathstroke just doesn't pull it off, they should have recast Ron Perlman to reprise the role from The Flashpoint Paradox or Fred Tatasciore from Young Justice.  I will say one casting that was well done, Nolan North as the Penguin was fantastic.The other reason I gave it 4 stars, they screwed up Copperhead and totally changed that character.  This truly was a departure from DC cannon and it bothered me.Do not let those issues though dissuade you from buying what is possibly thus far the best game in the Batman Arkham franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2013"}

So no check points, a loss of souls, and no mercy. You lose half your life when you're dead. The first time you're dead you will only have half life. From there you build. It gives you a real feeling of challenge that most games don't have anymore; and what this does is suck you to servive.(Gets very addicive) My beef with this game is that you cant pick up enemies weapons, and most items. It reminds me more of Two Worlds than Oblivion. Its a shame, because this game is very close to being great. The graphics are great, but close up graphics don't compare to Oblivion. But, the large level makes you really feel like you're nothing. The graphics from a far are second to none. How many games do you kill a dragon and feel like you really acomplished something. For those who can't get this game I will say this. It is a game that requires patients, good basic game skills, and decent intellegents. Your brain power is very important. You have to know how to use things sparingly. I just wish there was a way to make it alittle less challenging, because I just don't have enough time to spend with this game as I think it requires.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Crono \"Mega RPG gamer\"","summary":"Great, just don't get ripped off!","reviewText":"Super Smash Brothers Melee is great.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Reduce, Recycle, Reuse","reviewText":"If you love Call of Duty, then this is your game.  If you have already bought Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, you shouldn't even be reading this.  I have always been on the fence.  After CoD 2, the single player of every game that followed, even CoD 4, was just a light gun game.  You are continually led on rails to every checkpoint by bullet hose spraying enemies.  There is no actual squad or enemy AI to speak of, they all just fire blindly and never reload.  I know there are a few people who still play these games for the story mode, but I don't.  I'm not going to go on too long because these things come out every year so there's not much new to explain.Spec Ops is greatly improved and includes ranking and perks this time around which, as far as these modes go, is a HUGE improvement on the zombies and horde stuff from WaW and Black Ops.  I like it so far, but as with all of these side mission/survival deals, I usually get tired of them after a week.  Good improvement, but not a game changer.Well on the good side for multiplayer, there are a lot of maps.  On the bad side, the guns have had a serious working over.  More than ever before the weapons shoot like frickin lasers.  Nothing sways and you die much much faster than even in MW2. I'm pretty amazed they bothered to include a weapon power up to kill the weapon sway.  What sway?!?  Overall, the game really feels a lot more like the way Black Ops played than that intangible \"Feel\" of the Modern Warfare games.  Black Ops was the best selling game of all time, or something like that, so I doubt many will complain, but I feel a difference.  The theater mode does return, but there are no wager matches, which is kinda weak, but Kill Confirmed is good.  The kill streaks have been warmed over with strike package streaks that differ on classes.  This is welcome as some classes you can continue to rack up your points in objective based achievements instead of just kills, but lets be honest, people play this game for klilstreaks and I haven't seen any differences yet in how people approach their play styles here.  It's kill or be killed as it has always been.Oh well, I'm just looking over this thing after a few hours, and its just the same fun you always look for in CoD, but I'm sensing there isn't much left in this tube of tooth paste from here on out.  They are still relying on the stupid P2P host networking which means lag and ended games still crop up.  You still can hide in a tin building during an airstrike and live to tell the tale.  You still have massively overpowered guns that all feel the same.  And yes, you still can have fun with all these things deep into a Saturday night.  I'm just wondering what they are going to do next.  Unless they come up with something new, I don't see myself buying another one of these next year.  Heck, I still play MW2 a few times a week.  You aren't missing a whole lot if you pass on this, but if you're a fan, you'll enjoy it.****To be fair, I fired up the single player and I just made a few notes Infinity Ward missed.  -- You can play through most of what I have without firing a bullet.  You just run to the checkpoints and duck. Sooner or later the enemy there will get shot and you move on.  -- Sandman is the worst Delta Force short gunner in history, he can't hit the broadside of a barn. -- Also, Sandman is wearing reflective eye protection - big no no in the Army. Eye protection should be clear or non reflective ***READ Reply from T.A. Frank in the comments on the eyewear. Best info you'll find *** A real veteran could clear this up if I am wrong. -- The Multiplayer is fun, but the \"Lost host connection\" hasn't gone anywhere.  I'm enjoying , but just like any other heavily marketed product, just play it for what it is, don't expect this game to do your laundry for you.****After going between MW2 and MW3, I can say a lot of the quick death and lag issues come down to the fact that MW3 is simply set to play much faster. Back to back, you can just tell by running and toggling iron sights - in addition to the new avatar stances, the animations really are quicker.  I think Black Ops was also faster than MW2.  Unless you happen to be host, some games you are going to have a bad day.  I'm on 10 meg and watching kill cams and the Vault videos, about half the time, the delay I see from my character is not what I actually experienced.  Other times I get what seems like an endless supply of hit markers and no kill.  I've even killed people I'm not aiming at.  I'm not really sure if it is connection related or the networking part of the game is simply unable to keep the sync up accurately.****IW's Rober Bowling via twitter:  \"Yes, both platforms will be receiving updates to address lag concerns\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

I guess it shouldn't have suprised anyone.  At least one standard 2d scrolling Mario game per console, right?  That's the rule?  Why, though?  Why the repetition?  Why the same old format again and again?Because, frankly, if it ain't broke don't fix it.  And this stuff ain't broke yet.I'm not going to bother recapping what Mario is. If you're here reading game reviews on Amazon.com you know what Mario is all about, don't play innocent.  So the improvements in mechanics and visuals aren't even worth spending time on.  It's still Super Mario Bros.  If you like one, you like them all to some degree (controversial black sheepSuper Mario Bros. 2not withstanding).  I'll say the new level designs are fun, it's challenging without being murderously so, the new powers add an element of planning and strategy (sort of): all welcome and wonderful additions, if nothing groundbreaking.What is note-worthy is the multi-player.  For two reasons: it makes the game impossibly fun and it makes the game impossible. And this, THIS is what Nintendo has grasped better than all the other designers going today (the fun part, not the impossible part), despite how hard they try:  That GAMES are exponentially more fun the more people you can easily get invovled.  Mario is fun because it's silly, it's harmless, literally anyone with thumbs can play it at least a little bit (apologies to those without thumbs, no disrespect intended).  You can sit in a group of nine or ten friends, relatives or even casual acquaintences and pass the remotes around four at a time, bounce on each other's heads and fall down cliffs for a few hours with no real fuss.  It's a simple, side-scrolling social endeavor that reaps rewards while asking for almost no investment from the player.In fact, the less you get invested in the multi-player aspect the better, because it makes progressing through the game well-nigh impossible.  Quick, think of the timing and precision needed to beat the tougher levels in your favorite mario game.  Got it?  Now try and imagine four people matching that rythm simultaneously or even cooperatively.  Get the picture?  You will die, you will kill each other accidentally (and sometimes on purpose) and you'll fail at levels time and again. Yes, in multi-player you can come back from the dead (floating in a bubble until a friendly team-mate pops you free) but you share lives and goddamn do they go quick.  But here's the thing: it doesn't matter.  Because messing up the game en masse is easily as fun as beating it on your own.  It's a throw-away concept built into a pretty posh and polished platformer.  And that, my friends, is something special.If you don't care for Mario games, no, this one probably won't change your mind.  Though if someone asks you to play a few rounds with them, don't turn up your nose either.  It's not compelling, plot-driven, state-of-the-art anything.  It's not even anything new.  But it's good, good fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

I own a PS3 and play Madden online while biking on a stationary bike, but bought the Wii just for the purpose of the Wii Fit. I must warn you though, I ordered an additional Wii remote because the nunchuck attachment wire sometimes hits me in my chest and face. the punching combinations are much more complex than the Wii Fit step boxing. the graphics seem to blow away the Wii Fit games also. I can finally justify why I bought the 480p component cables. :-)  I love boxing in the room with the wooden floor with a nightly cityscape in the background (gym), although the other 2 scenes are also highly detailed. I also like the fact that I can choose a different song instead of having to listen to the same tune from the Wii Fit step boxing. I pretty much have been scoring 1100+ on the Wii Fit step boxing, and so far have been doing quite well with the Gold's Gym version. overall, this makes my Wii an overall great purchase. the only downside to this game is that you may want to order another controller, and that is another $35.:-(","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00F6YD2AK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"You Will Lose Your Souls... Over and Over Again...\"","reviewText":"In 2011, the original Dark Souls hit store shelves with the slogan, &#34;Prepare to Die.&#34;  It was an unapologetic challenge and a masterpiece.  One that spawned an enormous cult following.  Nearly three years later fans still talk about Dark Souls.  Fans of Dark Souls don't just like the game.  They love it.  They're passionate about it.  To this day I'm still thrilled, awed and challenged by Dark Souls.  Needless to say a sequel to Dark Souls has very high expectations.  It's especially daunting because the original is such a huge cult classic--one that didn't need too many major refinements to begin with.  Dark Souls II is definitely familiar to anyone who played the original or who played Demon's Souls.  But it also has some surprises.You play as an undead who is seeking to break the curse upon you before you go hollow.  That is the story of Dark Souls II in a nutshell, but the story of Dark Souls isn't comprised to just a basic plot alone.  The world you'll enter has a lot of diverse characters, lore and a lot of storytelling through more than just dialog to get you to understand what's going on.  It certainly has more dialog to help you along than the first game, but the emphasis here is still on exploring your surroundings, meeting a diverse cast of characters and the lore of the land in and of itself.  That's not to say the story is somehow bad or put under the bus.  It is only to say that the approach to storytelling here is not like every other game out there.As with the first one you'll begin by choosing a class and selecting a gift.  Each class comes with their own set of levels and skills at first.  A sorcerer, for example, begins with a little bit of magic and a boost in intelligence while a warrior begins with a boost in strength and will be able to wield better melee weapons at the start.  As with the first, however, no class is restricted in any way.  A sorcerer can still use swords and a warrior can still use magic.  You may, however, find your stats growing differently as they start off with higher stats in certain attributes than others.  There are a couple of new classes added to the mix.  The swordsman, who is able to wield two swords at a time with ease.  And the explorer who has some slightly more balanced stats but the real benefit is that they start off with more items than any other class.  You can customize your character to look anyway you want and you have a lot of options to choose from.Once all this is done, Dark Souls II becomes incredibly familiar with anyone who has played either Souls game before it.  You've got a life gauge and you've got a stamina gauge.  Each swing of your weapon drains your stamina.  When depleted you can no longer attack until it replenishes.  Your stamina also effects how long you can hold your guard against an enemies attacks with a shield.  Combat in Dark Souls II is just as meticulous as it's ever been.  Those who enjoyed the original Dark Souls, though, may have an edge up if only because some moments take a very similar approach.  What is slightly different, however, is that the AI of your enemies has increased.  Enemies no longer stand around watching as their allies fall to your blade.  They are more willing to jump in and attack you while you're in the midst of combat.  While this happened in the original, it was often easier to lure enemies away from each others and divide them.  This doesn't happen as frequently in Dark Souls II.  Combat also flows faster and smoother.  The strategic element is still there to a large degree.  You still have to be careful with your stamina and utilize dodge rolls and backsteps.That being said, it's quite surprising that Dark Souls II doesn't quite throw you in the same way the original does.  One of the hallmarks of the first Dark Souls was that it established itself as not being a very handholding type of game from the get go.  Dark Souls II's tutorial area allows for more exploration and throws some relatively weak enemies at you early on.  Where as the first one plunged you into a boss fight within the first five minutes, Dark Souls II takes a bit more care to let you get acquainted first.  This isn't to say that Dark Souls II holds your hand.  In fact, it is better described as a false sense of security.  There are markers and messages telling you the controls while also presenting you with an obstacle or objective to try and apply what it is you've just learned.  But it isn't as quick to throw you into a boss battle.  For the enthusiast this might suggest Dark Souls II is easier than the first one, but in truth it's not long before it actually start really punishing you.Dark Souls is a game where dying is an integral part of the experience and where learning from your deaths is also integral.  And make no mistake, you will die.  You will die a lot.  You'll fight bosses and perish a couple of times before learning their patterns and learning how to defend against their attacks and dodge them.  But the sense of accomplishment when you finally do overcome a boss is quite exhilarating.  Dark Souls II is one of the few games where the sense of accomplishment is the reward.  You are, however, rewarded in more than just a sense of accomplishment.  Usually either with better weapons, rare items or a multitude of souls which you can use to increase the attributes of your characters, or buy some much needed weapons, armor and items.  . Also make no mistake that Dark Souls II expects you to really work for those rewards.  To get to a rare item or a chest often takes a lot of work.  Sometimes taking some daring risk or getting past unusually powerful enemies to do so.  Dark Souls II is no hand holding experience by any means and it hammers this in several times.Death is going to happen.  When you die you will lose all your souls.  When you respawn from a bonfire you have a chance to get them back by running to place where you died and retrieving those souls.  Of course, what killed you is usually still lurking around as well.  The penalty for death is slightly more harsh than the first game, however.  Each time you die now, your maximum health will also decrease.  And this stacks until you are at fifty percent health.  The only way to cure it is by burning an effigy, which is a fairly rare item to come by.  Considering how many times you'll perish, this is an invaluable item.  The game also makes another couple of tweaks.  In the first Dark Souls you could keep respawning enemies and killing them to your hearts content to grind for souls.  Dark Souls II takes a different approach.  Eventually the enemies in the area will stop respawning, cutting off your ability to farm for souls or grind.  While this seems strange at first, you do have an item that allows you to revive every enemy in the area (including bosses) and they'll all be more powerful when you do.Dark Souls II still has a good deal of covenants to join, items to collect and deadly traps in store.  Exploring the world is both a fascinating and frightening experience.  It is a game where death can (literally) lurk around the next corner.  As I said, you will die a lot.  Gamers easily frustrated will find this is not the game for them by any means.  Dark Souls II isn't always unfair about death, but you will approach several moments where you'll have to die first before you can succeed.  You might stumble upon a trap that'll kill you, or find yourself encountering an enemy you weren't prepared for who will massacre you.  For the purist of Dark Souls, this is the name of the game.  This is what you've come to expect.  For those who ignore the warnings that you'll lose your souls over and over again (or who constantly ignore the &#34;Prepare to Die,&#34; slogan) this game is a rude awakening.  It can be frustrating.  Especially when you lose everything you've worked so hard to obtain, but Dark Souls II is still a rewarding experience.One of the most rewarding aspects of Dark Souls was always the online community.  Throughout the experience you'd find people who would leave messages.  Some were quite helpful like warning you of a fall or a tough enemy ahead.  Others were deceitful, such as tricking you into jumping off a ledge when you shouldn't have or leading you to your doom in other ways.  This returns in Dark Souls II.  And like before, you can rank them.  A lot of the time they're helpful.  Other times they can be deceptive.  That being said, the community serves as a nice guide at times.  Often you'll learn when new dangers are around the corner or when great rewards await.  The community works for and against you, however.  Soon you'll find yourself being invaded by other players.  One of the other new additions to Dark Souls II is being able to use an item to make the enemies in the area notice the person invading you.  This seems small, but it adds a nice layer into the experience.  Dark Souls has always had a unique online experience and it continues here.  You'll be invaded and you'll be able to summon an ally to help you fight off tough bosses.  You can also touch bloodstains to see the final moments of another characters death.Whenever you need a rest or need to level up or shop for wares, Dark Souls II provides you a hub area that is a lot more similar to the Nexus in Demon's Souls.  It slowly becomes populated with more people who can be both your friend or your ally.  Some of the NPCs carry valuable items and you can attack them at any time, although they're no slouches.  They'll come back at you.  But once you kill them they're gone.  While some carry rare items others are necessary for you to go through your adventure.There are also plenty of covenants abound.  You can join some that add layers to the online experience.  Some covenants have an emphasis on helping other players while others put an emphasis on invading them.  Most of them will be, from the outset, indistinguishable from the first game, but there's a little extra layer here.  There's a lot more emphasis on the online experience here.  In particular, a covenant that will summon someone to your aid any time you get invaded is rather nice.Graphically speaking, Dark Souls II looks really good.  The rag doll physics aren't present here as your enemies actually disappear when they die.  There are also fewer dips in the framerate.  Every now and then there is still a hiccup but the game runs smoothly.  Likewise, the game sounds magnificent.  The sound effects are good, but the music score is just as haunting as it can be.  There is certainly a wider range of music here than in the previous game.  It's a good looking and sounding game.  That's not to say some issues don't get in the way.  When listening to other characters speak there are some strange pauses.  The dialog and voice acting itself is quite good, but sometimes the game has to load the next line of dialog.Dark Souls II is a huge experience.  The world is enormous in all sorts of ways.  There is plenty to explore, lots of characters to meet and plenty of enemies to kill and be killed by.  Dark Souls II is a good game and great for those who want a challenge.  It can feel unfair in its approach to difficulty sometimes.  Dark Souls II doesn't hold your hand in any way, shape or form.  When you explore the game will throw just about anything and everything at you without ever preparing you for what is to come next.  This makes the game exciting and exhilarating, but it can also be dreadful.  Players who simply rush into any situation expecting to be triumphant will be knocked down a few pegs.  Dark Souls II is hard, but not for the wrong reasons.  A lot of the time when you die you'll feel it is through your own doing or missteps as opposed to the game itself.  The game also expects you to learn from those deaths, however.  Obviously this means that Dark Souls II is not going to be a game for everyone.  But it's difficulty is meticulously well designed.  If you accept that several deaths are inevitable going in, Dark Souls II is apt to be a fun experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

The key is to learn the order of the rings, so that you can eventually play through a level. You have to wonder just who builds these temples full of moving spikes and falling pillars!I have to comment on the sound. It is really odd. Sometimes you get gentle Arabian tunes, as befitting the storyline. Most of the rest of the game, though, you get a head-banging rock anthem which gets really old, really quickly.Intriguingly, in a Disney-like twist, you're trying to rescue the King of the Arabian Nights story - when in the real myth, the King was the 'bad guy' of the stories, the one who would kill the storyteller unless she came up with a new, intersting tale each night.There are party games to enjoy with friends, and oodles of replayability to get the top score in each level.

I own RB 1 and 2.  I own Karaoke Revolution 1, 2, 3, 4, Country, Idol 1, and Idol 2.  I own Sing It 1 and 2.  So yeah, I've seen a number of these types of games.This game is fully compatible with the GH:WT system, so all you need is to buy the game, and use existing peripherals.  In fact, this game is also compatible with the RB guitar and RB mic (not sure if it's compatible with the RB2 guitar or drumset, since I don't have either, and I doubt it's compatible with either the RB1 or 2 drumset, since the RB drumsets have one less cymbal pad [basically, RB has a 4 +foot configuration, whereas GH:WT has the 3 +2cymbal +foot]).The game plays exactly like GH:WT.  Well, actually, it plays more like GH:Aerosmith, but with mic and drumset, in that you play as your own band, but during encores and such, you become Metallica (like how you turned into Aerosmith for GH:A).  I love Metallica, so having all the songs available together (as opposed to spread throughout the GH and RB sets) is great.  For about a buck a song, this collection is worth it.So, why not 5 stars?  I don't like the way GH throws big banners onto the screen when you reach certain streaks or point streaks, just let me know that at the end of a song!  With 4 instruments on at the time, the characters moving in the background, and the individual streak counters and scoring and overall band performance meter, I have enough information to see the stupid streak info.  I wished there was a way to turn it off.  I also think the RB series does a better job tracking your tone as you sing (in fact, RB's tracking is more like KR's tracking).  RB also shows via a moving piechart the fraction of each portion of your vocals fills the meter, something you don't get in GH.  Without the better tracking and the moving piechart, it's hard to figure out why you didn't get perfect scores in vocals.Again, though, still highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2009"}

Although you have loyally served King Halaskar, you have reason to believe he is being corrupted by ultimate dark forces. Sensing your distrust, Halaskar sends you off to quell an uprising in the barbaric borderlands. However, upon your return home, to your utter amazement, you find the land of Dureth a horribly changed place.Greater sources reveal to you that it is very possibly your own king who is responsible for brutally torturing and mindlessly killing many of the innocent people whom you were once sworn to protect. In order to save your Kingdom and restore peace and order to the lands, you and you comrades agree that the only solution is to assassinate the king.On your journey, get ready to explore mystical lands drenched with deceit and betrayal as you venture to save your people. Teleport to the first site of anguish, the Sunken Cathedral located in a flooded portion of the city where the king's sorcerers have animated the long-drowned people to keep them in eternal pain. Or battle your way through The Kiln, a terrifying place where Halaskar relentlessly burns citizens alive to further fuel his power. Race to The Grinder: a gigantic machine that mixes unwilling slaves with blades and saws and save Dureth before it is too late.The future of your Kingdom lies in your hands...Opportunity knocksEncounter numerous foes on your quest and defeat them with skills beyond your wildest imagination. Encounter the following four characters as you attempt to put an end to Halaskar's madness:Warrior- The awesome might of his steel-clad fists leave a trail of shattered bodies in his path. His magical abilities mirror his physical strength. This includes rippling shockwaves, controlled blasts of force, and other earthshaking attacks.Scout- Using shadow magic, poisonous attacks, and vicious direct assaults, the Scout is a fierce close-quarters combatant. Her agility and skill with bladed weapons giver her an almost snake-like appearance as she weaves through throngs of enemies.Mage- The Mage wields a staff in addition to his mastery of arcane elements. The Mage's basic attacks are weaker than the other classes but he makes up for it with his commanding power over the elements of fire and ice.King- Halaskar is a man driven by the pursuit of power an security. When Halaskar assumed the throne, he vowed to secure the Kingdom of Dureth from al aggressors once and for all. Yet as the years passed, the kingdom descended deeper and deeper into an era of war and suffering. Today, rumors whisper of great atrocities against the people of Dureth...atrocities committed by monsters bearing the King's orders.Not only doesUntold Legends: Dark Kingdomfeature rich next-generation visuals and engaging combat, but it also offers players a unique multiplayer online co-op mode. Take on Halaskar yourself or ask a friend to join you on your quest. Either way, the Kingdom hangs in the balance, and a world looks your way for help.","reviewerName":"Samuel Ray \"RPG Fan\"","summary":"I really wanted to like this game","reviewText":"First the good. The story wasn't too general, and you didn't really get involved with your character's story too much. Combat was simple, but despite this you could implement strategies and skills more suited to specific enemies. Not too much customization, but for a 2006 game the variety isn't that bad.The bad... well, I'll try to limit what I say. First off, the camera will kill you more than anything. Early in the game during a rock chase event, just before you are clear, the camera will, for lack of a better term, &#34;spaz out&#34; and most likely you will die. Many times. Some early bosses are too easy, and some later bosses are just kind of confusing, as in you have no idea how to proceed or win. The grinder's final boss (or the last I could get too) is simple, but surviving environmental hazards just makes you give up.If you really want a game to occupy time and have a few bucks, you can buy it used. Otherwise, avoid it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"My introduction to Japanese RPGs &amp; I'm glad I made the trip.","reviewText":"Before I purchased a Playstation 2, most of my favorite RPGs were on the computer.  I'm an RPG vet who has played through many popular titles such as Ultima, Baldur's Gate and the Elder Scrolls.  I reluctantly went with Final Fantasy X (FFX) as I've always heard Japanese styled RPGs were designed differently than the western RPGs I was used to.  I'm glad I made the trip though because I thoroughly enjoyed this game and am now eagerly flying through the entire Final Fantasy series as well as other popular Japanese RPGs.  If you're the type of gamer who enjoys heavy story, interesting cut scenes and strategic turn based combat, FFX is for you!  It has one of the best stories I've ever played through in a game and I felt myself wanting to help these interesting futuristic characters in an alternate universe.  If you're not familiar with the Final Fantasy series, one of its claim to fames is each sequel has a different story and characters, so you easily start with FFX and not miss anything from the previous games.  I wouldn't recommend the game for action gamers with little patience as the cut scenes can sometimes take several minutes to complete and the turn-based mechanics of combat make for a slow process but entertaining for those who enjoy this style.  The combat system is almost identical to the turn-based system in another popular RPG, Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. FFX is the first game in the famous series to publish a quasi-sequel so after you're finished with FFX, if you'd like to find out what happens in the story, you'll need to purchase the game Final Fantasy X-2 which basically is part two of the story.  If you're like me, you'll order FFX-2 halfway through FFX because the game is so enjoyable, it's a foregone conclusion that the sequel will be on your future agenda.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2004"}

We recently tossed it because it could no longer hold a charge.  I didn't know what to expect of this headset at the price point but it's actually pretty good.  It charges and pairs quickly and sound quality is pretty decent.  The microphone is very sensitive and communication while playing Little Big Planet is decent both ways. Sure, it's not on par with a $200-300 high-end gaming headset, but for half the price, it's every bit as good as Sony's Bluetooth headset. The only thing I wish it had were a micro-USB charging jack instead of a proprietary one.  It means you can only use the included proprietary USB charging cable to charge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2013"}

It's basically another telling of the Frankenstein story.  A man is created not born and is a slave trying to find freedom and a life worth living.  I've been wanting him to get together with his handler Diana so I was sad at the end of the previous game because I thought she killed him (Well, I wondered)  So (Spoiler) I was shocked when you have to kill her on the first mission.  After that I kept thinking, where will 47 ever find love, find and end to his bloody path. I was so happy at the end (super spoiler) to find that he did not kill her and that there was maybe hope for him to maybe have a happy hitman family some day and the thing with the cop also indicates that maybe he might have an actual friend some day.  47 really needs one.  I always feel horrible for him.Also the game play is amazing.  There are lots of cops you are not sure you should kill.  Agency thugs who you also feel bad about killing.  Only one level in the game do you really feel no pity for killing everyone.  I loved it.  I can't wait for more.  More!!!! More!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2012"}

If you're somebody who loves first-person shooters or FPS games you'll love this game or if you're somebody who loves role-playing/quest games you'll love this game. It is a combination of summary good elements it's just fun. And I would recommend playing Borderlands 1 if you plan on playing Borderlands 2, while not required it will give you some back story on certain characters.I've played through this game many times using all four of the available characters and it is just a great time. Also want to be excelling parts of Borderlands is that it's a great cooperative game. If a few of your friends have this game and you can play simultaneously with each other it's so much more enjoyable.ProTip:If you're new to the Borderland experience here's a tip. When you kill enemies or scavenge in garbage bins etc.  You're going to find loot - guns class modification units shields - and whatnot. Now the loot in borderlands is color-coded just remember When Grandpa Burps Patrick Obeys why would you need to know that? Because the loot in the borderlands universe is color-coded as to rarity. Now in general the rarer the gear/gun the better it is. So hence When Grandpa Burps Patrick Obeys applies to the colors of white, green, blue, purple, orange. Now Orange weapons are also referred to as legendary weapons they are the best But they are also super rare and hard-to-find. But as you come across weapons and gear look at the colors in their name card. This will help a ton in deciding what gear to keep and what gear you want to throw away.But yes I recommend borderlands to all gamers as I think it has many things that appeal to gamers of all types.Thanks for reading!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

The single player mode was impressive in my short experience, and the opening section allows you to practice and get a pretty good handle on the controls if you're new to the series.  I can only imagine how intense the following chapters will be based on my near heart attack trying to jump onto the helicopter during a violent thunder storm (stage 1).The online mode is simply incredible.  By far and away the best I've seen to date, it's seamless, lag-less, and very intense.  It feels as if you're not online at all, there are absolutely no lags in shooting and graphics.  There are few things more satisfying then onlocking the sniper rifle then hiding in the bushes, holding your breath, and nailing some unsuspecting guy in the back from fifty yards away.  The sound effects are insanely realistic, you will hear another soldier's footsteps as he approaches you especially on the metal stairs.The producers really evened the score online too in this installment.  I'm still on the receiving end of stabbings far more often then I'd like, but you're put into games based on your skill level and the unlocking of new weapons motivates you to keep going.  I have never played the online version of a game so much more frequently then the single player mode, that's how intense this game is.
