Some of the courses are really great like the inside of a giant clock, or two ships at sea (you actually get blasted from one ship to another!) + much more.For, me the wireless implementation is the best part. You can easily sign into your WiFi connetion to race against others around the world, very fun and quite addicting!The game can be quite challenging at times and there are many different combinations of character and carts to choose from, so the longevity/playability is very good.

I am familiar with the Devil May Cry series and understand it is a more action oriented third person style game, with some puzzles and combat. Bayonetta doesn't disappoint with the eye candy. The audio and visuals are amazing. Some of the levels are designed in a mundane run of the mill style, but quite a few of them are impressive in scale and design. It is unfortunate the maps are entirely linear.The bosses are often gigantic in scale, and it is easy to just fall into a button mashing frenzy during combat. I tried the more difficult settings, but it didn't add any enjoyment to the game in my experience. Although the visuals were great, the game wasn't mentally challenging. I didn't really feel a sense of accomplishment as I progressed, and the different combos didn't add any depth to the game. I found myself skipping the cutscenes at the end because the dialogue just dragged on and on.Overall, as a game I felt Bayonetta was well designed and had a above-par premise. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the combat was different (to say the least), and was enjoyable at all difficulty levels. However, if you strip away the eye candy it is just more of Devil May Cry.Overall: 4/5 stars, a crowd pleaser of a game, don't expect it to be a thought-provoking or mentally challenging game - set your brain on cruise control and enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

It improves upon Two Towers in many ways, adding a whole co-op mode, more characters to play as, and updated graphics. It might not be perfect, but hacking and slashing your way through hoards of orcs is undeniably enjoyable.Return of the King follows the movie pretty closely with three separate ways to go with. You can go on the Path of the Wizard with Gandalf, the Path of the King with Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, or the Path of the Hobbits with Frodo and Sam. You can go to any path at any time, which is nice. While the Wizard and King paths are really cool, the hobbits are a pain to play as because they are very weak and their levels are very difficult as a result. The rest of the game is very challenging as well, even on the easy difficulty setting.The game's levels are pretty huge long with tons of enemies to slash through. The combat system is pretty basic but as you buy more combo moves it gets more complex. Getting to Perfect mode with combos also becomes easier once you start taking advantage of all the cool upgrades. Unfortunately, though, the combo meter is always steadily falling whether you are taking damage or not, which is really annoying as you naturally want to keep a combo when you are progressing through a level between fights.RotK's main attraction is definitely the two-player co-op play. Grab a friend and you'll have much more fun with the game and it won't be nearly as difficult. This is the main improvement over the Two Towers game, but there are also improvements in the area of graphics. They are a bit less choppy and the details depicted don't look so strange, which makes for a much better visual experience overall.One of the issues RotK didn't fix, though, is the camera. When you enter another area, it will suddenly shift and make you lose track of where you are supposed to be going for a moment, which gets awfully tiresome.RotK is also a very cinematic experience. The cut scenes are very cool; with clips from the movie (which are actually a little choppy, unfortunately) perfectly and seamlessly shifting into the game's own visuals when the time comes. Playing as most of the major characters from the movie also makes the experience very cinematic, and although the voice acting is a little cheesy at times it is pretty well done overall. The game is also very epic, particularly when you have hoards upon hoards of orcs to fight.Overall Return of the King is a great game. It improved upon its predecessor in a few crucial ways without overdoing itself and offers a very epic, cinematic experience much like Two Towers. So if you are a fan of Lord of the Rings I highly recommend you get this game, and if you aren't I would still encourage you to look into it because it really offers some fun, simple action and is great to play with a friend.Gameplay: 8.0Graphics: 8.0Sound: 8.5Value: 8.5FINAL SCORE: 8.4/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

The dungeons were simplistic but fun, the bosses were imaginative, and frankly quite amazing given they were on the DS. Unfortunately the makers put in a temple you must return to after EVERY FREAKING dungeon. The temple is soooooo boring, and repetitive. That would be bad, but not only is it boring and repetitive, they've filled it with the worst possible game play mechanics possible. So every time you finish one of the dungeons, instead of a feeling of elation, accomplishment and excitement of going on to the next quest, you're filled with a feeling of dread knowing that you have to go back and starting from the VERY BEGINNING go through the same tedious temple you've been through a thousand times before. They say half-way through the game you can start halfway through the temple. No. You can start halfway through the temple if AND ONLY IF you get to this save point with enough time left to make it worth while to continue, which if you're playing it for the first time you don't realize and start at the beginning. Like I said this wouldn't be so bad if the temple weren't so devoid of any fun what so ever. Here's a list of why it's so bad:(1) Time limit. You're constantly watching the clock. If you get to close to the end and run out of time, you have to start over again(2) Unbeatable guards you can't kill, if they catch you, you not only go back to the start, but you loose 30 seconds(3) Annoying eyeballs you need to shoot, and while the controls are good, more often than not when you have to react quickly you'll be hitting the walls more than the enemies(4) Floors that attract enemies, so not only do you have a time limit and all the crap I mentioned above, at certain points you have to move so slowly you're basically crawling(5) IT TAKES FOR EVER TO GET THROUGH THESE HORRIBLE DUNGEONS - They're not fun, just tedious you want them over fast. It's seriously feels like they're punishing you.DOES ANY OF THAT SOUND FUN!? (If it does man, then you just knock yourself right out with this bad boy)This dungeon was so awful I put the game down. Seeing the new one is out I picked it up again determined to finish it, but every time I get back to that same temple, I come very close to giving up all together. SHAME ON YOU NINTENDO, I EXPECT MORE OUT OF YOU THAN THIS! This game was really good too bad this one temple RUINED IT.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

With the toggle feature on, activating a spell or talent unpauses the battle, but it's still easily workable.~Battles are not very strategic-consisting of switching back and forth between party members, healing them constantly, and doing the same list of attacks over and over again until you run out of stamina or mana.~Battles are fast paced, so it's more of a chaotic hack and slash that you can pause at anytime to consider your next move (which usually isn't anything spectacular ).~Getting your characters to say different things is kind of lame. Stroke their egos with good replies to boring conversations, and find or purchase these lame gifts for them, so that you can finally get them to say another couple more boring sentences, so that you can get their approval meter up, so they can get some kind of extra bonus to their stats. I don't see any reason to say different things to party members, when the main goal is to get their approval meter up. Who would do anything else?~Fun game, but I don't see why anyone would want to play this huge game more than one time through. They're is way to many parts that I don't think I could play, or set through more than once. If people replay this game more than once, then either they are really bored, or they live in this fantasy world away from reality. It's just too tedious to play through more than once-even if you can play it differently each time.~Not too many differnt kinds of weapons and armor, and the ones that are different are usually rare and special and it takes forever to aquire the whole set (armor). The weapon enhancement runes aren't that special neither.I'm sure I could find more positives and negatives about this game, but you get the basic idea, and the way everyone explains this in the reviews is like this game is totally unlinear in dialogue (which it's not). It does have quite a bit, but the characters are pretty boring, and I really don't want a homosexual rogue assassin in my party, but the only other rogue I've came across besides that is a girl that talks like she's ADHD. This game is definitely worth playing, but the characters are not very interesting and the world in general is not anything worth freaking out about.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2013"}

I bought a pair a couple of years ago and delighted with them.First thing you'll notice is that the headphones come nicely packaged so there is little chance of the equipment being damaged during shipping. Inside you will the headphones, a package of cables and connectors and a little instructional booklet.  There are seperate adapters for the Xbox 360/PC and the Xbox One.  Also there was a note inside stating that you need to download a software update on the Xbox One for these to work.  The update was released by Microsoft at the beginning of March.Setup and easy and straightforward, you plug the headphones into the in-line amplifier and the in-line amplifier into whichever device you are connecting to. There are multiple connection options depending on which device you are connecting to.  Even easier is the Xbox One connection as you simply plug the supplied adapter into your controller and your headphones into the adapter and that is it.Comfort and Durability.The headphones are fully adjustable in every way that you could want. The ear pieces rotate, the headband is expandable and snaps into place at various stops so as not to slide. It actually reminds me a bit of zip ties in the way it does it. The leather(ish) (it's not actual leather but looks and feels like soft leather) headband is well padded, soft and won't hurt your head, as are the ear pieces. It fits very comfortably and snugly and I've worn them playing Forza 5 and GTA V (on the 360) for a couple of hours with no soreness (something I've had with other headphones). The microphone plugs into the ear piece using a standard 3.5mm jack and is on an adjustable plastic &#34;wire&#34; for want of a better word, so you can adjust this to be as close or as far away from your mouth as you wish. If you don't want to chat, playing a single player game or just listening to music on one of your devices, simply unplug the microphone.The headphones are very well built with hard plastic and good sturdy joints. The leather(ish) comfort pieces on the headband and ear pieces are also well constructed and shouldn't rip or tear easily. These headphones should last you for a long time.Sound Quality.What good are nice comfortable headphones if the sound quality doesn't match up? I'm happy to say that the Titanfall headphones have excellent sound reproduction. It handles treble very well without getting too tinny and has a nice deep bass, although I found they do struggle a bit on the very low range bass. I tested this using various songs connected to my iPad as well as connecting to my Xbox 360 and One. In game sound is excellent.Overall the Turtle Beach Titanfall headphones are an excellent addition to your gaming library and outstrips the free Xbox headsets by miles. The difference in quality and sound reproduction is just laughable. They are comfortable to wear and will last you a long time.The only thing I'm not so hot about is that these are wired Headphones for the Xbox 360 and PC (wireless for the Xbox One), so you do have cables trailing over your living room floor when you use them.These definitely fall into the recommended category.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2014"}

For Example, if you went into the woods in the game and did not use a map you world get just as lost as you would in a real-world forest with no map.- Hundreds of quests (really big and really small) to perform you can skip any you want or do them all, plus you deicide the outcome weather it be good or bad.- Interact with NPC's, there are literally hundreds of them and they are all voiced acted and display emotions on there faces.- A very life like world in which Police chase thieves, wives nag husbands and wolves prowl the woods looking for prey.- Do just about anything you can think of like steal (anything), save people form gangs, fight in arena's, hunt animals, sail ships, become a vampire (pretty cool) or just hang back and do almost nothing the choice is yours.BAD:- This game may be way to hard for most casual gamers.- The loading in this game is can get annoying, this game will load often and some loads (not all) take a long time. The hard drive cuts down on some loading, but it's still a pain.- Some of the character animations especially those of your character are a little sloppy (but in 1st person you cannot see your own animations so it's not so much a problem)- The Hit Detection (or hit boxes) sometimes doesn't work well.- While the world is huge it's also mostly wooded forest area, which can be a little bland after a while.- Morality seem to play little in the game in terms of your characters development, you can do evil/good act but will not really be considered evil/good in the same way that you see in Fable or Jade Empire. In the end it's more realistic but a little underwhelming.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A first person Swords and Sorcery RPG (Click in the left thumb stick to toggle third person mode).- The games theme is very much close to that of the Lord of the Rings books or movie trilogy, by Peter Jackson, other similarities are found in the tabletop RPG Dungeons and Dragons.- This is a do as you please type of RPG (like Fable or Jade Empire), this not anything like Final Fantasy, you pick [...] and you choose the outcome, that said there is little to no character identity outside of your deeds and don't expect a party of other characters who tag a long like in most other RPG's (like Final Fantasy).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind- Fable: The Lost Chapters- Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain- Thief III: Deadly ShadowADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is downloadable content missions/quests and areas for this game out on PC and Xbox-Live. Examples being horse Armor, Spell Tomes, The Wizard's Tower, The Thieves Den, Vile Lair, The Knights of the Nine, and The Shivering Isles just to name a few.- The Special Limited Edition (Xbox-360) comes with a bonus disc, which has a lengthy behind the scenes documentary, also on the disc you can view concept art work for the game, plus the limited edition comes with a small book on the history and people of the Elder Scrolls world and you get a real-to-life coin from this games world.- The world in the game if measured in real-world miles would be about 16 miles not including underground areas like caves, crypts, basements, and bunkers, also most areas in the alternate-dimension of Oblivion are immeasurable due to the fact that they are randomly generated and huge.- All Elder Scrolls games are first Person (the other Elder Scrolls games besides Elder Scrolls III where on the PC).- In the game (at the main city) you will see a poster for a gladiator type of fighting arena called Arena, the poster is the same picture found on the box art for Elder Scrolls first game called Elder Scrolls: Arena.- More lots more information go to this link [...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2006"}

It just goes to show that the mainstream is not always correct on every game Now let us get onto the review.In Alice Madness,this game is a platformer/hack and slash with hints of puzzles and RPG elements(upgrade you're weapons and figure out where you need to go with exploration) . This game becomes simpler once you get the hang of fighting and jumping, because as you progress there will be more enemies, and you will have more weapons in you're arsenal to tactically take out each enemy.One part i found unique about the game was that when you look at the backgrounds throughout each level it does make you believe you are in Wonderland and the memories help you relate to the backstory of this game and the original. One part that kept me from giving this a 5 was the framerate,textures which was rare.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2011"}

Obviously, gaming has changed much since the days of those titles, so the game has been updated significantly, and yet somehow it still feels like its predecessors, which is an accomplishment worthy of notation. The gameplay is suitably mindless and addictive, and will tax your reflexes at every turn (and sometimes your temper as well - but that is all in the Ghosts and Goblins tradition, is it not?). Unlimited saves or continues would have brought this game up to date and made it more player-friendly (when you've used all your saves and continues, you're going to have to start from scratch), and some of the levels are too similar to one another, but Maximo is a fun ride while it lasts, and comes recommended to fans of platformers and arcade-style action games.Final Score: B- (or 4 stars)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2002"}

All of the complaints Morgan Webb laid out in her review of the game I simply didn't see at all. Maybe the release day update fixed the problems she saw or something, but few of her complaints did I actually see in game. I can see that playing this single player can cause a few problems, but playing online with friends is FUN. Graphics, while not extremely detailed, are still a sight to behold just because of the art style and color schemes. The sound effects are just like the movies and the voice acting is right on. The voice actor for Gandalf sounds just like Ian McKellan. The gameplay is not deep... you have some basic attacks, some power attacks and long range attacks, but it's hack n slash fun. My friends and I just finished the game and we logged about 20 hours making sure we did as many side quests as we could.

Developed by Starbreeze, makers of the excellent \"Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay\" (2004) and the lesser \"The Darkness\" (2007), the futuristic world of \"Syndicate\" is controlled by mega corporations where a hostile takeover literally means going to war with a rival company. You play as a ruthless, high-tech mercenary working for one such company, who gouges a big metal spike into the ear or eye of certain victims, extracting the implanted computer chip from inside their cranium to use for upgrading various skills. Everything revolves around hacking and extracting data. The environmental aesthetic of the game is like \"Minority Report\" meets the lens flare of the new \"Star Trek.\" It's actually one of the prettier games I've played on PS3, with a very unique sci-fi look, and while the aesthetic can make firefights difficult to negotiate, there's a \"detective mode\" type ability that can help by highlighting enemies. The game's two main shortcomings are: the campaign is a little too straightforward and brief, and very few players are online to play the 4 player online co-op with (if you can organize friends to jump on with you, co-op is a lot of fun). Despite this, I enjoyed it. \"Syndicate\" has a lot of thrills and a lot of style.Note: make sure to play in 720p and not 1080p or the image will look unusually blurry.--- 4 STARS ---","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Rampage+Freedom Fighters = Happy","reviewText":"Red Faction remains on top of the massive destruction sandbox genre with Guerrilla. Mars is under iron fisted control by the once liberating EDF, who has now become a openly genocidal tyranny, because covering up mass civilian slaughters is apparently not worth the effort. You are Alex Mercer, demolitions expert and new found point man for the Red Faction, a underground resistance that you've been a member of for 11 seconds... wait, what?Your missions are the basic story driven resistance on the run until you become the revolutionary juggernaut. Weapons are the basic plethora, either plundered from enemy dead or cobbled together from scrap materials, which are your basic monetary funding. The story however really, truly, desperately needed a runup, as you arrive on mars, brother dead, you, resistance, join, lead demolition missions. That story is rammed into your gullet in about as much time as it took me to write that sentence. At least doom had you on a boring seeming hunt for a lost technician before dropping you in the soup.Prepare to destroy anything and everything in sight. Entertaining propaganda and spin stories from the controlling forces are hilarious, and background chatter takes a while to become repetitive, giving it a good feel of gritty, downtrodden rebels. Despite being instantly promoted to point man, you are treated with some disdain and contempt, and are sent off with sanctions to not screw up by just about everyone. Sabotage and insurrection actions actually make sense, and rather than send you against strongholds first, you can cut power, destroy fuel reserves and checkpoints, and generally cause mass chaos rather than charge headlong into heavily guarded meat grinders.Graphics and audio are entertaining, though some buildings look pretty pathetic when they're collapsing, giving the feel of watching a scale model rather than a real building. Voices are well acted and appropriately emoted, though the blatant love interest side arc is about as subtle as a hammer to the face.Nits are widespread, and cause enough teeth grinding to cost this a full five stars. Your sledgehammer is your best weapon by far, and theres not even a halfhearted explanation as to how you manage to plow through meter thick rebar enforced concrete walls with a lazy swing. You need scrap to get more pockets to carry more demolition charges. Hills with more than a 5% incline are unclimbable, and you can't exactly be sneaky when you have to plow through every wall rather than climb over them. Physics of building collapses are nice, but momentum physics are godawful. You can knock soldiers over the horizon with a well timed hammer blow, and an atv can knock a twelve ton dump truck out of the way like its a tinker toy. Alarm levels don't go down with finding good hiding places or killing off small patrols, but reentering a hideout with a small army on your butt drops it to zero. For a game that tries to be as serious as your basic medal of honor, it fails horribly in some portions of suspension of disbelief. There's no briefing on the main bad guys in your codex, or even on your sudden new found allies or superiors outside of loading screens.Regardless of some major gameplay and story issues, the game is fun, which is what matters. Charging into HW without any backup or preparatory work will instantly get you killed, and while you definitely have superhero level endurance and amazing combat skills for a technician, this manages to be a game that will always make you giggle as you tear through buildings and army battalions like a wrecking ball. I'd still make this a rent first, as there are enough issues that can rub certain gamer types the wrong way.As an aside, seeing as how almost every one of my reviews now reads 0 of 1 helpful votes, please comment why if you don't find this review worthwhile. Thanks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Z. A. Recht","summary":"War Is Hell, but Call of Duty is Heaven","reviewText":"I'm not sure where to begin.I think my first clue that I was playing a real keeper was in the first level where some Japanese soldiers banzai charge your squad, and I realized I was actually mildly frightened to see these guys bearing down on me with bayonets. Next thing I know I'm on the ground and there's a blade coming down at my chest--I knock it aside and was treated to the sight of my combat knife being plunged into my assailant's throat.I pushed the corpse off of me and stood up, grabbed my M1, and ducked behind cover just in time to see a fellow Marine blow apart from the waist up in a haze of blood, rendered aerosol. I watched with horror as another pair of soldiers, in mid-run, pitched forward, little clouds of red mist blossoming out of their backs. Snipers. I could hear battle cries over the tense music. Black smoke blotted out portions of the sky.We fought through a field later filled with spider-holes and snipers in the trees. I strapped on a flamethrower and went to work, burning the tall grasses and flushing the snipers out of their trees.Then came the rapid staccato of machine-gun fire, and I heard my sergeant yelling to get the flamethrower up front. I popped smoke, and as it clouded the battlefield I heard once more that dreadful cry of \"BANZAIIIII!\" and out of the smoke came indistinct forms, phantoms in the mist--Japanese soldiers charging forward, bayonets at the ready. I shot one in the chest, but he didn't die. He crawled backwards desperately, grasping at his sidearm. I put another round in his head. He dropped back to the Earth, unmoving.I could see the muzzle flash of the machinegun nest ahead through the fog. My smoke was starting to disperse, so I popped a second, hoping to keep the machinegunners blind to my advance. I sprinted from rock to rock, dodging rounds from Type-100 submachineguns. They ricocheted off my cover, and I hit the dirt as low as I could go. After a moment--perhaps thinking I was dead--the fire grew sporadic. I tossed a pair of grenades over my cover, waited for the explosions, and then went for broke.I stood up and sprinted toward the machine-gun bunker, and as I came into range, I opened up on it with the flamethrower. Fire jetted out of every firing slit in the bunker, and after a moment, the ammunition inside exploded, blowing the side out. The Marines behind me rallied, and we advanced inside, where I found a Japanese soldier, still alive but badly burned, clinging to a table. There is no mercy in war. I drew my pistol and shot him in the back. One less enemy....that, my friends, is what playing Call of Duty: World at War is like. It's so immersive, so brilliantly choreographed, that you really lose track of the fact that you're playing a game sometimes and will catch yourself shouting encouragement to your squadmates--even though they're fictional characters and could never hear you, it still makes you feel like part of the team.You can't miss with this game. The drama--oh, the drama--Private Petrenko's opening scene in Stalingrad is amazing. Easily the best level in the game. You feel for the soldiers around you--even the Japanese and German enemies--because of the shocking brutality of what's going on around you.You'll see unarmed German defenders mercilessly gunned down while trying to surrender. You yourself will gun down a few other helpless soldiers along the way--if you so choose. And that's not just put in there for shock value. This is how it was when the Russians entered Berlin. There was no mercy. \"Their land, their people, their blood,\" as Sergeant Reznov says.Combined with excellent graphics, a heart-pumping and at times terrifying soundtrack (especially in the Pacific theater missions--a rising but low tone every time you're ambushed accentuates the fear that these men must have really felt. Here I am, safe in my own home, and my heart is going at 120BPM because I have no idea from which direction we'll be ambushed next.I could go on and on for pages listing amazing moments and somber, even depressing ones, but it can all be condensed herein: Call of Duty World at War manages to present you with WWII without pulling a single punch. You will be disgusted. You will be revolted. You will be shocked and awed. You will feel a real sense of triumph when you finally plant that Russian flag on top of the Reichstag.I cannot recommend this title enough. It's an excellent game. Highly recommended for purchase.PS - Once you beat the campaign the real fun begins...Zombie Nazis. That's all I'm gonna say. You'll have to beat it yourself to find out. =)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}

Lastly, I will also state that after liking the music, I got the soundtrack, and found it to be hightly lacking in overall originality in composistion.

While Call of Duty is the superior WWII series it's just as guilty for having constant sequel after sequel. The reason why the WWII genre is dry is because there is so much you can do with actual events that happened. You can only use D-Day and Market Garden so many times before new explosions and updated graphics won't even save those scenarios. Call of Duty at least tried to use new events in WWII and this was the battle for Chambois also known as the Falaise Gap.The game has you playing four, I repeat, four different people and these are the Americans, Canadians, British, and Polish. The game does develop some attachable characters that have personality, but since the game is so short this can't be done properly. This is also the first \"true next-gen\" WWII game that came out (no CoD2 was just a PC port) so you have high-res textures, flowing grass, realistic weather effects etc. The game looks really good even for today and helps add to the realism of the game.Everything here is the same as the past though with all your WWII weapons and I can't even tell which ones are new or old since it changes every time. You do have new game play elements such as button pressing sequences these are fun and break up some of the monotonous shooting. Now instead of just attaching explosives to Flak guns you have to do button presses to do this. You do, however, have to use cover a lot more in this game since the AI has improved a lot. Your teammates will actually shoot back and HELP you and the enemies target you and run to cover you pretty well. You can't just run around like Rambo shooting Nazis out in the open because you'll die pretty fast.One thing I do love out the CoD series is the sweeping orchestral soundtrack and that tear jerking theme song! They put the right songs to the right moments of the game and it really makes the game feel epic (not as much CoD4 of course!) Basically, the single player game consists of 9 levels and is pretty much the same as before. You have driving sections, turret sections, tank sections, every WWII weapon you can think of, a decent story, decent characters, and a wonderful soundtrack so this makes things really solid.When it comes to multiplayer things really shine since there are a lot of modes. You have all your typical modes, but what makes it great is you can play with 24 people on one map! This makes things chaotic and addictive and you'll never stop playing. You have (I think) six or seven classes to choose from such as medics, riflemen, assault troopers etc. All of these classes are well balanced and the map are nicely designed. When you die though you don't just die you can call for a medic (but no one is ever medic). The multiplayer is pretty straight forward, but it's highly addictive and this is always a plus.I just wish they'd make a game on WWI or the Revolutionary War! Once you finish everything here you can look under the extras for concept art, videos etc. The achievements make for playing the single player more than once and overall this is a solid WWII shooter, but we all know it wasn't the last one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Both games are basically identical in terms of gameplay, which is a combination of first-person shooting, melee, and stealth. These games can be frustrating at times, and while I was able to get used to some of the unusual gameplay elements, I could see casual gamers getting fed up with them and simply giving up. In both games, Riddick finds himself in enemy territory, namely Butcher Bay prison and the ship Dark Athena, and trying to find a way to escape. He'll talk with (or kill) other prisoners in order to find a way out, making use of his strength and wits to best his enemies, which consist of guards, mercenaries, mechs, drones, and even monsters. These are games that don't hold your hand in any way, aside from the brief tutorials in the beginning. Figuring out what you're supposed to do next can be tough at times, especially in Escape from Butcher Bay since that game requires a lot more backtracking. Sometimes, looking at your mission descriptions will help point you in the right direction, but you'll mostly have to pay attention to what other characters tell you or keep an eye on your surroundings to figure out where you're supposed to go and what you're supposed to do. Other gamers have mentioned getting lost in both games and also dislike the fact that the first game has a very basic and useless map, while the second game doesn't have one at all. I personally only got briefly lost a couple of times in the first game due to the backtracking, but otherwise the environments aren't all that big and getting lost shouldn't be an issue if you look at the signs on the walls and pay attention to mission objectives. Side-missions especially require lots of backtracking. Both games have side-missions that entail doing favors for other people, with the first game having a much larger number of available side-missions. However, these missions are optional and completing them merely provides you with PSN trophies or collectibles that allow you to view concept art and so on.The combat has quite the learning curve, especially for me since first-person combat has always taken a while for me to get used to in other games like Aliens v.s. Predator and Dishonored. The melee combat in the Riddick games is even more technical and requires movements of the left stick while attacking to change up the attacks, as well as countering enemies as they attack you, which requires PRECISE timing. Even figuring out how to manage Riddick's health takes time to get down. Portions of his health regenerate when he stands still, but the only way to restore his health completely is by using med stations located in specific areas; there are no health pick-ups to make use of and the med-stations have a limited number of uses. There are also some specialized med stations that increase Riddick's health limit, but the game itself doesn't point out the differences with the med stations, so I actually skipped one by mistake since I was currently at full health. The unusual health system encourages gamers to get past enemies through stealth tactics as opposed to the usual \"run and gun\" type of gameplay normally associated with FPS games. Riddick can be killed pretty easily, so just going in guns blazing will normally result in you waiting through the reload screen. While \"run and gun\" is a viable and sometimes necessary option in both games, it is largely not encouraged. In fact, there are many instances, especially in the first game, where Riddick will simply not have access to firearms and must instead rely on melee weapons like shivs, knives, clubs, or even his bare fists. At times, Riddick also has use of a tranq gun which lets him temporarily knockout enemies and make them much easier targets for termination; this is especially useful when Riddick has no guns and is facing fully armed enemies. The tranq gun can also be used to shoot out lights and make the environment dark without putting enemies on full alert.Speaking of darkness, unlike most other games, both Riddick games will have you feeling safer when in the dark...at least after Riddick acquires the eyeshine ability early in the first game. Eyeshine allows Riddick to see more clearly in the dark and sneak right up on enemies without them noticing him, although it blinds him when in more well-lit areas, requiring gamers to switch it off when not in complete darkness. The enemies themselves, even the basic ones, don't make things easy for Riddick. If armed enemies spot him, they will blast away at him with unusually precise accuracy. In melee combat, most regular enemies can be taken out with a few simple, direct attacks, however certain tougher enemies require a more tactical approach. Some cannot be attacked directly and must be struck when they are preparing to attack you, others have attacks that cannot be blocked, and some have a lot of health. There are even a couple of enemies that have all three of these qualities, making them very daunting foes to overcome. Personally, I think they should have eased up on the challenge levels of some of these enemies, the way some are able to block all of Riddick's attacks and immediately attack him seems rather cheap to me. Furthermore, enemies will sometimes be able to figure out where Riddick is even when he's sneaking through the darkness, which is kind of confusing. Sometimes it's scripted, but other times enemies seem to possess some sort of limited omniscience and know that Riddick is nearby, no matter how quiet he is. The combination of uncertainty with mission objectives and tough enemies that can kill you quickly give both games high levels of trial and error.The biggest issue in both games are some occasional lag glitches and hiccups in framerate. Once or twice I was aiming at enemies and they teleported several feet to the side and avoided my shots. Hit detection can be spotty at times as well, mostly when Riddick hijacks a mech or drone and uses their machineguns on enemies; at times it appears to take an unusual number of shots to kill enemies with these weapons. A couple of other times I shot enemies at point blank range and did no damage while the enemies were pumping me full of lead. Also, there were moments where I was hit by missiles and the screen went black for a couple of seconds, which was strange and annoying. These issues were not too common, but still noticeable enough to mention. Both Riddick games are still quite entertaining despite the balancing issues and occasional glitches. A third game is apparently in development which will hopefully improve on the previously mentioned issues of these two games, while keeping the fun combat and stealth mechanics. I also hope to see a more developed story in the third game, although the stories for these games were still decent, with Assault on Dark Athena having a more involved plot. Both games are prequels to the Riddick movies, so as far as movie tie-ins go, Escape from Butcher Bay and Assault on Dark Athena are awesome. Generally speaking, the games are flawed, but still good. If you have any interest in Riddick's story and enjoy FPS games that include plenty of gunplay, melee, and stealth, then these games are worth looking into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2014"}

Riddick:Escape from Butcher Bay was horrible to look at on the Ps3. The camera would only focus clearly on one part of the scene. Athena had no such camera issues. Athena was marginally better looking than Escape. One scene in particular, at the start, when Riddick is outside the prison, three times, the facade of the building is a blur. On a pc, it gives you a real look at what you are in store for, a visual treat that I had never seen on pc. The game moves slowly at times and gives you plenty of time to enjoy what they have created.OK, I admit I am a little, no a lot, spoiled by the ridiculously good looking graphics on pc for the Escape game. I think the PS2 or Xbox versions look better than this ps3 game. Seriously, it is horrible. Escape has been out on the market now for quite sometime, and I have played it through several times. This game visually holds up so well against the games today it is crazy. It is a visual masterpiece. Starbreeze Studios(The Darkness, as well) did a super job on this game. Game is fun and not too terribly demanding.I just recently got a ps3, and have run nearly twenty games through at least a level or two, and the ps3 version of this two game set is the worst visually. Escape will not be finished(been there, done...), but I will finsh Athena.I have heard that Athena has some real problems(DRM) on pc, which Escape does not have. I may try to get the pc version through Steam and see what Athena really looks like.Escape has the greatest menu feature in gaming history. Athena's is similar, but not as graphically cool. You have a giant cube of smaller rusty/shiny metal looking cubes. As you choose items it spins with smaller cubes temporarily flying out and settling back in. My older XP gaming machine sometimes had trouble processing this intense menu action(a menu?). It even looked like it had a mind of its own as cubes would involuntarily shift and change positions while you ponder the menu options.Escape is a great game, and does get good reviews, on PC!! Athena reviews are bad, for pc(DRM), but many liked the gaming, when played. I don't really know much more about the gaming of the ps3 version yet. I personally think the graphics had to be dumbed down for these games on ps3 to the point of ruining them, well, for my spoiled tastes.My recommendation, buy them for pc, if you can. Any pc option will need a decent video card. Riddick Escape has no issues on XP or even my i7 win7 gaming machine. Athena may be better purchased through Steam, so they can handle the DRM issues. What I've seen so far, forego the ps3 purchase. I'm really more surprised Starbreeze put the stamped OK on this package.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

I was wrong in all my fears.  This game is simply amazing.  The graphics are smooth, well rendered, not blocky (they stopped using polygons finally :) ), and there is no slowdown in framerate even in the fiercest of battles.  It is so well done, it almost looks like it could be real.  The music is perfect for each level, and never gets annoying.  The music is actually key in some areas as it can designate something about to happen.  The sounds are well done, with every little sound from rain falling to electronic static in your suit.  On top of all that, Metroid Prime supports Dolby Prologic II Surround sound.  The controls are the only downfall to this game.  It can be difficult to target enemies at frist, but after 30-60 min, it becomes almost second nature.  But even so, after 10 hours into the game, you will still be firing missles when you try to bring up the map.  Although it is a little awkward, the controls are fairly easy to pick up as you usually get another upgrade after you've perfected the current upgrade.The gameplay is simply excellent.  Definately a well written story line.  It is supposed to take place just after the first Metroid game, after you've killed Ridley, Kraid, and Mother Brain.  Samus has discovered that the Space Pirates have begun to regroup on the nearby planet of Talon IV.  When she arrives at the orbiting pirate firgate, she finds it nearly deserted and sees evidence of the pirates mutating creatures using a substance known as Phazon.  After exploring the ship and fighting the boss, samus gets knocked back and loses nearly all her current upgrades.  She then heads down to the surface, which is where the story really begins.  While on the surface battling your way through the levels, you must find both upgrades to your suit (visors, weapons, morph ball, etc) and ancient artifacts to unravel the mystery of the Chozo and the Phazon.  To get through the levels and defeat the bosses, you will have to solve \"puzzles\" such as opening three doors within a time limit making this similar to tomb raider.Now, I know some of you are worried about the Morph ball.  It is somewhat difficult to control, but you will get used to it.  When you switch to morph ball mode, it brings you out to a 3rd person view so you can see the morph ball and most of your surroundings.How long does this game take?  Quite a long time.  As in the 2D metroid games, there is quite a bit of backtracking involved.  You will end up going through each area multiple times as you can reach new places with almost every upgrade your suit receives.Metroid fans will love this new addition to the series as well as newcomers.  I reccommend you stop worrying about the controls and just go buy this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2003"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving.

With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Konrad Kern","summary":"A Satisfying Racer","reviewText":"My son and I have been playing this for a couple weeks now.

{"product_name":"B000R3BNHE","reviewerName":"Vocaloid \"Digi\"","summary":"Crystal Castle of Dreams","reviewText":"As an original owner of both the sega saturn and Nights Christmas/Into Dream titles, I was pleased to see that Nights:Journey Of Dreams would continue off the legacy that it's original successor brought to the system.Those who have played this game before will notice similarities right away. The revamp of the original title music as well as the little egg-headed creatures named nightopians and others that fans of the original will appreciate.Graphics: The graphics in this game aren't bad but they are colorful in some places and helen looks like a miniature barbie in the face. The cut-scenes in the introduction are well-made in video format. Fans may notice on the Second Door (first level) that the mirrors inside the castle are the same ones used in the museum garden for Helen's dream.Sound: Revamp of the original music along with new editions is easy on the ears.Controls: There are three ways to control Nights; Wii Remote, Nunchuck+Wii, or a gamecube controller. Nunchuck+Wii is the easiest configuration to use. The game refers to the wii remote use as 'mind synch' but to simply but it move the remote an inch off of Nights and she/he won't move. I also found the control-scheme for this particularly unresponsive and jerky.Gameplay: Players are meet with choosing either girl or boy with their respective dream scenes. I was surprise how creepy helen's mom looked as though she was going to jump out the window at any second. After the cut-scene your able to explore around the dream-gate area or synch with nights for a flying tutorial. Rings are collected in each level as score-points and are used to speed night's flight bath. Blue chips are used to get the keys from the birds or as self-defense on foot. Each level is enormous and will change from Nights to on foot, and you'll be para-looping often to collect orbs and enemies. Boss battles consist of timing and good aiming/reflexes to advance to the next stage. Linger around a stage for too long and it's game over.Wi-Fi: Left my wi-fi on looking for 2p for 15-20 minutes and found no connections at all. On the flip side, by visting my garden I had atleast 4 or 5 connections so far. \"Talking\" is very limited in the game in which players interact with other players by use of symbols and pictures. There is no explanation in the booklet what all the symbols mean which can lead to guessing what another player is trying to say/do. There is no buddy list except by those which you already know, this can be obtained by their game ID number(ex.400-900-65784). Gardens sadly are also very limited in customization. Objects cannot be moved and things need to be collected in game to use them and with wii weather on changes the sky.Similarities: The bosses are the same yet they are not. They have been 'replaced' with new editions but the methods of squashing them is the same with new tweaks. Such as the first boss, by ramming into the top of the bosses head and bouncing off causes the enemy to be down-sized, but this time by para-looping particles.The music has been revamped with old tunes such as 'In The Night' and the loading screen, along with the start menu.Remember that glowing purple stuff that covered the 'off-limits' part of the games? There is now an explanation for it and a side-effect. No more bouncing off purple stuff and getting stunned so the clock can come. In the game it's explain that it'll immediately wake the person if they touch it, meaning game over.Some of our favorite bosses/villians are back such as WiseMan and Reela with certain stages. And the egg-headed nightopians are back too.Differences:-New Bosses but basicually same methods.-The addition of the Wi-Fi connection.-Players choosing several doors in up to 4 stages are needed to complete-No more Giant Clocks, 'Awakens' are used after the timer is up to capture the players.-Players have more time on foot than the original.-New characters with the addition of owl.-Nightopians and Nightmares could only breed/exist on the stages. Para-looping them meant death but now they are sent to a garden instead.-Nights can now transform into different items to unlock areas.Set-Backs:-Owl's tutorials are annoying once they have been done once. Why do I have to repeat the tutorial? And during the beginning when he was talking about NiGhts seemed to be an inside joke when he made the remark \"if your into that sort of thing\".-The lack of customization and communication for the garden limits the wi-fi experience. And a 2P that takes forever searching for any other player for 2P.-Particularly I don't like the way the character designs were for this game. Helen looks like a plastic little barbie and the guy character has been camping out in the woods for too long.-Sometimes the colors are crayola bright and look poly-gonish, especially during the cut-scenes. Owl is a shinning example of what we call \"texture lazy\".-NiGHTS is still an 'it' or as reela preferred...perhaps Nights is not an it! Far as I'm concern she's a chick.-Helen and the Boy's personalities are somewhat cliche.Scoring:Graphics 7/10Music: 8/10Control: 8/10Wi-Fi: 5/10Gameplay: 7/10Overall: 7/10This game is a good remembrance of those who played the saturn title, or for those who want to spend some leisure time.

Thankfully, we now have Diablo III. What was once old, is now new again. To say this game is a breath of fresh air, would be an understatement. Diablo III provides a nostalgic experience, that is both timeless, and absolutely relevant in 2013.This is a genre that was in dire need of resurrection on consoles. Survival horror has been equally ignored in recent years, which is shameful. While everyone and their neighbor is playing Grand Theft Auto V, i am happily plowing through dungeons with friends, looting and leveling up, and downing more than my fair share of beers in the process. Good times.Obviously, what drives the addictive nature of these games is the looting, and character progression. Both are handled well here. Those new to Diablo III should look at the loot system as being similar to Borderlands. Weapons are color coded by their respective value and rarity, and those sweet legendaries are a sight to behold. There are five distinct character classes, and all bring something valuable to the table. I am currently playing through as a demon hunter, whom specializes in ranged attacks, evasion, and deception. Very cool stuff.Ironically, Diablo III feels specifically designed for consoles. With the improved user interface and control scheme, it really plays exceptionally well. Blizzard really dropped the ball with the pc version of this game, as many of you know from firsthand experience. Auction house, drm, unfair loot balancing. They really created a mess. Their reputation has been undeniably stained as a result. Thankfully, none of these issues are present on consoles. Diablo finally feels like Diablo again, and not some frustrating grind, fueled by corporate greed.PROS:+ Classic dungeon crawling gameplay that harkens back to my personal favorite gaming era.+ Leveling up focuses on attaining new skills, and assigning those skills however you like. I found myself enjoying this over time, because i could customize my moveset, and constantly experiment with new moves.+ 4 player drop in/out co-op online and local. What could be better than that in this type of game??+ Loot Loot Loot!! It really drives the experience. Playing with friends will only enhance your enjoyment.+ No auction house or drm, both continue to plague the pc version, as of this writing.+ It isn't a FPS game! I know, shocking!+ Very addictive, with enormous replay value.+ Art design was consistently appealing. Especially in acts III & IV.+ Your town areas are conveniently laid out. Everything from merchant interactions, jewelers, and blacksmithing are relatively easy to understand.CONS:- Some may not like that you no longer distribute skill points when leveling.- Story will fail to hold your attention. Although, some of the especially cheesey moments may induce a grin!- Voice acting is lacking in some areas.- Very bare bones player stats. I expected more detailed accounts of my adventures in an rpg!- Would have liked an assortment of story focused \"act specific\" quests, that could be pursued anytime during said act.instead of these lame world events, that usually involve clearing out a cellar or cave.Verdict:This is a fantastic game. I realize some Diablo purest's say that it can't hold a candle to the second one. But, this is very subjective. I prefer playing 3 (on consoles) because you now have direct control over your character's movement. Plus the new multiplayer options improve the overall experience. I will pour hundreds of hours into this game.Score: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

So basically this means you shouldn't but hey nothings perfect, have any issues if your xbox was made with the new jasper chip from around october of 2008 till now. Check your manufactures date on the bad of the unit. Well all and yes i mean all the ones i've seen as far as the elites and pros where all produced before this, meaning? Microsoft basically had an overstock of refurbished systems or ones that didnt sell and packaged them with game bundles to sell the last few months or so. People have been very upset that these models contain the older Zephyr chip which is one of the worst for the red ring of death, among other problems. So after checking out the Halo 3, Fable 2, and Kung Fu Panda, Lego Indiana Jones bundles i saw that in all the stores i checked the dates of manufacture where all last year, some as early as January 08. And every arcade version that i checked was anywhere from december of 08 up till july or 2009, WITH the new chip, so beware of ANY other version of the Xbox you buy at this point, anywhere. Don't get the bundles and ask someone, or just look through the square hole in the top of the box to see when it was made and make sure you get a newer one. Thats not to say the old ones will just blow up when plugged in, but in the long run there's about a 95% chance you will start having issues. I ave had this one for months and not had one single hick up with it. So pay 199, the get yourself 99 dollar 60(or 160 dollar 120gb)gb hard drive and your off and gaming. So hopefully this was helpful, Microsoft should be sued for repackaging older systems they KNOW are more prone to failure, and thats all i'm gonna say.

McKenzie","summary":"Not The Classic We Want To Remember","reviewText":"\"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\" was a truly pivotal piece of gaming back in 2002.  The deep mythology, the unnerving ambience, the easy-to-learn gameplay, the \"Sanity\" effects......but some years have passed.  I have revisited the dark tale in order to once again discover its brilliance.  But the simple truth is that \"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\" is a product of its time, and was put on its pedestal way too soon.I am not writing this review to simply analyze the videogame's faults.  Frankly, there are ton of 5-star games available on Amazon that are well worth your time and money in spite of their flaws.  But with \"Eternal Darkness\", you must tread carefully.  You are reading the reviews of memories, not the review of the game as it is in 2009.I guess the best summary I can give you is that for every great idea in \"Eternal Darkness\", there's always some sort of caveat to remind you that you're holding a controller in your hand.  So, my personal review is going to be a \"This Is Good, But\" kind of review.  Let's bullet-point this one, shall we?* The game's combat is much simpler and easier than most survival-horror games.  You will often control a sword, or other form of blade, with the occasional pistol or projectile thrown in.  Frankly, the guns are worthless.  The game will quickly teach you how to take down your enemies.  BUT \"better\" doesn't mean \"great\".  The combat leaves much to be desired.  Even with the magic system (more on that later) implemented in the later stages of the game, you are still hacking and slashing some pretty boring-looking foes.* \"Eternal Darkness\" is famous for its sanity effects.  Whenever your character is spotted by the enemy, you slowly lose your sanity, which can eventually lead to some very frightening moments.  I'll leave those moments for you to discover, which I'm sure are on YouTube in case you wanna pass the game up.  BUT, other than eventually harming your health, these sanity effects get old once you've seen them.  The only way to really enjoy them is to deliberately delay killing your enemies.  Some may get a delightful cackle from going nuts, but it's not THAT genius when you think about it.* The game uses a magic system in order to not only enhance combat, but to solve some nifty puzzles.  As the game progresses, you learn more spells, and can make them more powerful.  There's even a Ro-Sham-Bo kinda system to the magic.  BUT, learning the spells is kinda cheap.  In order to create spells, you need Runes.  In order to use the runes, you need to decode them.  Learning the spells requires little to no thought whatsoever, because you learn them by just searching for different pieces throughout the stages.  Because you take little part in creating the spells, learning them is tedious.* \"Eternal Darkness\" has a mythology and story that spans centuries.  You will play as various characters who've encountered a supernatural evil, leading to moments of sheer horror.  BUT this method of storytelling means you only get a brief adventure with the characters.  Their histories, their dreams, their motivations, their effects in time...you will learn less than you hope.  It becomes very apparent that main character Alexandra Roivas is merely someone who just finds their different stories in her family mansion.  You want to know more about how her grandfather was mysteriously & gruesomely murdered.  Instead, you begin reading the stories of others, waiting a long time before Alex is personally involved.* The game featured some great graphics for its time.  The levels in particular look pretty sharp even today.  I never understood the criticisms for \"Resident Evil\" graphical presentation, because it immerses you in artistic creation.  The environments (except for the Persian desert) are uniformly strong.  BUT, the character models aren't consistently good.  Some look amazing in closeup, while people look blocky.  Some are very well-animated in their movements, while others move like constipated apes.  Even the corpses aren't consistently drawn well.* Sound plays a major role in this game, and it's the only near-perfect element in the game.  The music is subtle and minimal.  The screams are terrifying.  The shocks are heart-stopping.  The voice-acting is excellent.  The weapons sound good.  The creatures are intimidating.  What's most remarkable is the background & surround effects.  Early in the game, you're in a monestary where if you approach an office, you can hear a muttered secret meeting taking place.  Other than maybe the Roivas mansion's \"gong-gong\" rhythm, I've no complaints here.* The game has three different endings.  BUT, the differences are mostly cosmetic, and minimal at best.  Finishing all three versions of the quest will unlock the ultimate ending for the game, but the drive to complete the game three times is questionable.* \"Eternal Darkness\" has some good scares in it, some of them \"BOO\" moments, others just disturbing.  BUT, while disturbing moments leave long impressions, this game is only as scary as you want it to be.  Once you go through the jump-out-of-your-seat moments, you're not likely to be scared on your second playthrough.  And going back to the sanity effects, only you are in control of how mad your character gets.  Sadly, there are only a few moments when the player doesn't control the sanity...those are the best surprises.I first played \"Eternal Darkness\" in July 2002.  I thought it was extraordinary.  If I had done an official review, I probably would've said 9.5 out of 10.  To this day, most critics' reviews average out to that score.A few years later, I popped the game back in.  I finished the game, but somewhat reluctantly so.  I put the game aside, and told myself, \"Maybe I'm just not in the right frame of mind to enjoy this fully.  Another time, perhaps.\"  After all, some great games can't be played on a regular basis, and need time to grow in your memories before you revisit them.So, now it's 2009.  I have tried a third time to play \"Eternal Darkness\" from start to finish.  About halfway through, I have decided to stop.  It's just not that fun anymore.There is nothing shameful about a videogame that pioneered a genre years ago, and has fallen by the wayside.  Our memories are real.  We really did enjoy the worlds, tales, and experiences that \"Eternal Darkness\" gave us years ago.  But it's time to acknowledge that its core value as a videogame is diminished.If I may quickly sidestep, one of my all-time favorite series is the \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise.  Those have much more emphasis on story & cinemas than they do on actual gameplay.  But the differences is that those stories are brilliant, a pleasure to revisit, and the gameplay itself holds up in the time passed.  \"Eternal Darkness\", on the other hand, has a good story that isn't worth playing through.  I loved the end, but don't like getting there anymore.\"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\" belonged on its pedestal in 2002.It's time to gracefully bring it down, and not pretend that it still possesses the same magic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

His head has been taken, but there were no hints about what could have done that. Alexandra decides to stay in Rhode Island, trying to find out what happened to her grandfather. But, to do that, she would have to fight against her sanity, and fight against the darkness, the Eternal Darkness.- Graphics: There are some good graphics in this game.

When you see a monster or whatever, your sanity drops, and if you let your character with less sanity, it will start to hear screams, babies crying, it will talk to itself, it will see bugs in the camera, blood in the walls and MANY other things. To recover your sanity, you can use magick (yes, it's magick, not magic...) or explode monster's guts, finishing it...- Educative: There are some educative things because you travel through different centuries with many characters, so you (and your kids, if you let them) can see what weapons were used in that time, what clothes, how were the constructions... But there is also plenty of blood and violence.- Durability: It is well-kept if you keep it at the package, don't worry.Nintendo has finally done a mature game, with violence and blood.

Like Paper Mario(N64) and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga(Gameboy Advance) before it, Partners is an engrossing RPG that is not only addictive to play but humorous as well. Mario and Luigi travel back in time to rescue Princess Peach, only to come face to face with baby versions of themselves, the princess and Bowser. Teaming up with their baby versions send Mario and Luigi on an adventure of their life as players must control both the adult AND baby versions of the Mushroom Kingdom heroes. The result is absolutely hilarious, at times. Apart from the second screen and character aspect, Partners in Time doesn't stray too far from the Superstar Saga original. It has more elaborate puzzles, and more action-based fights than the original game, though, and it's alot meatier in terms of gameplay time. Although it doesn't explore the Nintendo DS like other developers have, Partners in Time definitely approaches the system in more extremely creative ways. You'll see what I'm talking about when you play the game. It's defiitely a game that diehard and casual RPG fans should pick up.My biggest gripe, however, with Partners in Time is the graphics. Alphadream coulda, at the very least, spiced things up a little bit in that department instead of giving us GBA visuals, which is something I've noticed lately on games coming out for the DS. Why are developers giving us GBA graphics when the Nintendo DS is capable of so much more? With games like Castlevania, I could understand the reason why but, even then, Konami made certain aspects of their latest Castlevania adventure more 3-D'ish.Once again, though, Alphadream delivers an outstanding RPG worthy of your time.

If you thought MGS2 was a dissappointment, this one won't surprise you.The gameplay is the same as the previous games, for all intents and purposes.  The much heralded new \"CQC\" system really doesn't change the game much at all - in fact I went through the entire game the first time without using it at all (I didn't read the \"new\" manual at all, and didn't have any problems at all).The plotline is ridiculous, I don't know which I despise more, MGS2's story or MGS3's story.  Equally ridiculous are the bosses (as usual), which is a dissappointment, since the bosses from MGS1 were at least tolerably realistic, whereas MGS2 and MGS3 went overboard (was there REALLY a roller-skating bomber in MGS2?  I'm trying to convince myself that I was just hallucinating).  MGS3 introduces an (almost) brand new cast of strange bosses with super-powers seemingly taken straight out of a cheap anime movie.  And if you were hoping (as I was) that MGS3's story would make MGS2 make sense, you're out of luck.In fairness, the praise for the production and direction of the game is well deserved.  All the movie scenes are well done, and the voice-acting is above average as usual (though I am starting to find David Hayter's Snake rather annoying).In the end, the Metal Gear Solid \"trilogy\" suffers the same fate as \"The Matrix\" trilogy.  A fantastic start, a dissappointing sequel ending with some well deserved euthanasia.  RIP Snake.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

I recently bought a PS3 and needed some games to play. Based on the [...] review I decided to but this, as I found a deal for it ([...], free shipping).As my first Final Fantasy game that I've actually bought I think it's pretty good. The gameplay is complex but fun. I haven't finished it so far but I'm definitely enjoying it so far. The game makes you follow a linear path in the beginning, but as you progress the world opens up and you have the freedom to choose quests and go where ever you like. The story is confusing in the beginning, especially if you aren't familiar with the series, but it slowly starts to make sense. The characters are incredibly cheese and the scripting is lame to the point where it'll actually make you laugh. But don't be too hard on it, it's translated from Japanese!The presentation of the game is amazing! The graphics look great and the cut scenes are breathtakingly gorgeous! The in game special effects look great too without being too \"in your face\" or lame. Everything from the levels, characters and enemies look good.If I had to complain about anything the learning curve may be a little steep if you're new to the series and especially if you are new to RPG's (Role Playing Games). The game slowly reveals and teaches you new things in a pace that makes it easy to keep  up however, so this isn't really a huge issue. The game is very complex and deep. There are so many things to do as far as character development and equipment/weapons/items are concerned. You'll probably end up spending almost half the time in the menus.I don't know how long the game is, I haven't finished it yet at the time of writing, but I've played enough to know that this was a good purchase and a really fun game. If, like me, you had previous doubts about the Final Fantasy games, this game is for you. If you like RPG's you'll enjoy it. 8/10.One last note - I recommend buying it for PS3. I have both a 360 and PS3 and I looked at various sites comparing the two versions. The 360 one has 3 DVD's, the PS3 has 1 Blu-Ray disc. The graphics on the PS3 are slightly better and the 360 version is missing a few small cutscenes due to space limitations. The load times are slightly quicker on PS3 too.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

Of course we all know now the developers were spending all that money and time on graphics and strippers. Take everything you love about FF and flush it down the toilet then make some other game that is not like FF at all. That's what this is.It's really obvious square-enix was just trying to appeal to as many numbskull gamers as possible, like the reviewers at IGN who are distracted by sparkly things. They amped up the graphics and oversimplified everything to a fault.  You are barely involved in the battles and the \"free roam\" section of the game is a joke. You basically just walk forward and hit x every so often. Maybe they should have just put you on a rail. I heard in FF15 you just need to yell teh words \"I WIN!\" to defeat enemies. That should make the game accessible for 99.9% of human beings and some animals like the parrot.  I guess even some robots or a cleverly placed cassette recorder would enjoy the game as well.Honestly if you want to buy this game...wait til one of your friends buys it and then wait outside their window while they play for 20 min.

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Fast, Fun, but Flawed","reviewText":"I had been looking forward to this game ever since it was announced at Nintendo's E3 press conference. When I finally got my hands on it, the game itself did not disappoint. Donkey Kong Country Returns is a proud addition in this cherished series, and Retro studios did their usual fantastic job revitalizing an old franchise. If only Nintendo had been satisfied with that. That brings me to the games biggest problem; Nintendo's selfish and short sighted insistence on shoe horning uneccessary motion control into every one of their first party games.Mario, Zelda, and even Metroid were able to include motion controls without them getting in the way; Donkey Kong was not able to do that. Several essential moves are controlled soley through waving the wii-mote around, and when the action gets intense switching from holding a controller to shaking it like a hyper monkey can be controller breakingly frustrating.Nintendo made a wonderful little device called the classic controller, but for reasons that I still cannot fathom, next to none of their games support it. Had you been able to play Donkey Kong with the classic controller, than this game would have been perfect.The levels are bright, big, colorful, and extremely varied. In one level you are riding a mine cart, and in another you are dodging attacks from a giant squid throughout the level. You will not get bored playing this game. Be warned however, this is not an easy game. This series has never been a cakewalk, but the added frustration of sloppy motion controls makes a couple of levels much harder than they should be.The bottom line that this is a fast, fun, challenging platformer that has its flaws, but still manages to outshine almost every other game like it out right now. The controls make get a bit sticky some times, but I promise that they will not stop you from enjoying this excellent game. A definite buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

Not a bad combination on paper and I'm glad to say that it also translates out very well when playing it.  As you are playing through the story, you can go down three general paths: good, neutral, and evil.  At the end of each level, the game will declare what path you are on with a 'High, Medium, or Low' Chaos rating (where High is akin to evil, and Low is affiliated with going down the good path).  How you trek down each path is determined by the amount of people you kill in each level.  The more people you kill, the higher your chaos rating will become, and more enemies will be present in the next level you play.  You can kill everyone on the map, or no one, or a select few, it's all up to you.  Even the main targets (who your supporters in the game want you to assassinate) can be dealt with in a non-lethal manner.If you finish the game with a High Chaos level, you will get a different ending than finishing this game having a Low Chaos level (the Low Chaos level ending being the \"Happy Ending\" one).  Killing is usually the quickest and easiest way of dealing with guards or others that want to harm you, and there are many ways of doing that in this game, but know this, there are at least two different endings in this game.  Unfortunately, there are only a few non-lethal ways of dealing with people, and it almost seems as if the game encourages/seduces you into choosing the lethal route.  I chose the non-lethal gameplay route, and as a result I noticed there was quite a bit of repetitive slow stealth techniques that I had to use.  I was constantly in this altered state of view mode that reminded me a lot like Batman Arkham City: where I was always in this altered view (where it highlights enemies, items, points of interest).  And usually end up creeping up behind the enemy and choking them out, or shooting them with a sleeping dart.All that aside, the graphics are top notch, controls feel tight like Borderlands 2, and the framerates are nice and fluid for the amount of draw distance and lighting effects going on in the game.  The game overall is very polished and has very nice easy to navigate menus and relatively short loading screens.  I can see why a lot of the official critics have rated this game high, but for me this game was of really high polished quality, but a little too short to feel really satisfying.My score is a 3.5/5, but I'll round up to 4 for the Amazon scoring system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}

I just finished the 1st witcher recently and just picked this up on amazon and soo far this game hasn't disappointed me. It was great being able to bring my save from the 1st game over to the 2nd and having it have some sort of influence on some of the conversations in this game. I romanced and picked triss in witcher 1 so it was nice to see her at the start lying next to me lol. I have to say I did like the combat of witcher 1 a bit better just because it was so much easier to change weapons and fighting styles at a moments notice. The combat of witcher 2 is a bit annoying at first but once I got the hang of it things were somewhat better. The visuals on my pc make this game look really good and the game looks way more better than it did in the 1st one. The storyline so far is really good and with the nudes scenes (which some of them made my jaw drop) is definitely a mature game. All in all so far this is a great game to pick up just make sure you play the first one but be warned that the combat for this second one can be frustrating at times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"Red Dead Redemption's father","reviewText":"Before I begin this review, I would like to warn players that this game only works on the Original XBox console released in 2001. If you try it on the Xbox 360, it will only work for a third of the game where suddenly, everything freezes. I just wish that Rockstar could rerelease this game as a game on demand like they did for Red Dead Redemption, its sequel happening in the 20th century.Now for Read Dead Revolver, released in 2004, this third-person shooter is an awesome hommage to the elements and figures of this legendary movie genre. It is the tale of a bounty hunter called Red Harlow who, after the murder of his parents when he was in his teens, goes on the search of his parents' murderers. During this adventure, he will have to fight ordinary outlaws, bounties, and psychotic criminals while uncovering a big conspiracy surrounding his parents' death. At the same time, it is a game where the player gets to use not only Red Harlow, but other characters such as Annie Stoakes, Jack Swift, Shadow Wolf, and other fascinating characters. Each of those charecters are used in distinct levels which are all introduced with a stylish animation featuring each character doing moves in front of a silhouetted background, a visual treat that I found excellent. As much as the slow-motion shooting feature that was first used in Max Payne and that other western games like Gun, Call of Juarez, and Red Dead Redemption have also used.Of the story, I found it as explosive and entertaining to watch that I just wanted to keep playing this game over and over again, even when the game was finished. Why, I loved so much the characters that I wish that they could have introduced Red Harlow in its sequel's storyline.Visually, the game's models might seem dated and simple compared to other games released at the time like Halo, however that aspect didn't matter to me since the models looked pretty much like those in Gun Theft Auto and Bully, and also because I felt the game's real concern was to make the most memorable spaghetti western tribute in a video game. First in Red Harlow's Clint Eastwood designs, then to the movies' grainy image quality, in its villains and the towns that they fight which look exactly like the movie sets in those movies, and in the soundtrack which used important music from Spaghetti Western composers such as Ennio Morricone (A Sky full of Stars for a Roof, Stark System), Piero Piccioni (Minnesota Clay), Francesco de Masi (Seven Dollars on the Red, Ranch of the Ruthless,etc.), Bruno Nicola (Django Shoots First, Dead Men Ride,etc.) and other composers that each have contributed to the Spaghetti Western movie genre. Personnally, I was disappointed that they didn't release a special feature in the game, or a CD soundtrack, with all the tracks used in the game and that we could be listening again and again. It would have been a treat to the game players, but also to the fans of those movies.As such, Red Dead Revolver is a game that should have had the same recognition that Red Dead Redemption got in 2010-2011.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6CACS","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"I think I like SSF4 more","reviewText":"Street Fighter IV is my favorite series of the past several years. I really like the games and have sunk hundreds of hours into them.What is Arcade Edition? Well, SF4 first came out in arcades in late 2008. However, arcades are really only relevant in Japan, so Capcom quickly ported the game to PS3 and Xbox 360. Along the way, they added several characters (Cammy, Fei Long, Sakura, Gen, Rose, and Dan). Capcom then released, a year later, a nicely upgraded version of the game, Super Street Fighter IV, which contained balance changes, an expanded roster (Juri, T. Hawk, Dee-Jay, et. al.), new backgrounds, and so forth. This didn't come out to arcades, which meant that console players had a game that was vastly superior to arcade players. Capcom released SSF4 in arcades in a version which added Oni (Akuma in pure demon form), Evil Ryu (Ryu afflicted with the same demon stuff as regular Akuma), and two twins from SF3, Yun and Yang. Now we are getting this version at home, which marks the first and only time the home and arcade versions of SF4 are the same.So how is the update? First of all, this is kind of a mediocre add-on. You get the extra four characters and the balance changes, but little else. No new online modes (or even the return of my favorite from SF4, Championship Mode), no new backgrounds, mini-games, etc. You don't even get Trials for the four new characters, which is a major bummer in my opinion. The only noticeable thing is an \"Elite\" channel which sets the replay channel to only show high ranking matches. It's a nice addition, to be honest.But let's talk about the characters. First of all, Yun is a monster, just like in SF3. This guy is ridiculous. His combos are simple and do crazy damage. He's very flexible and very powerful. It's almost frustrating to go against him because he has so many advantages over most of the cast. Yang plays similarly, but is a little worse in every way. Evil Ryu is like a mix between Akuma and Ryu, but not really a very strong character. Oni is another Ryu-like character with a few differences - he's more like Gouken in that regard. Early talk is that he is just an alright character. He's fun to play as though.Here's my problem: SSF4's balance was very good. Throwing in a monster of a character like Yun kind of screws that all up. I dare say that he is even more powerful in AE than Sagat was in regular SF4. This is, IMO, a clear step backwards for the game. One of the fun things about SSF4 was playing so many characters, because so many were viable. I fear now we will see lots and lots of Yun online, and practically zero Yangs.The game does give you the choice to switch from AE to regular SSF4, but obviously most are on SSF4 AE. I gave this game four stars because it's still SF4 and I like it a lot... but my early thought is that AE is just not as good as SSF4.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

It had me laughing throughout (it's extremely funny... not always by design, I suspect, but that's beside the point). Oh, and did I mention that it's UNIQUE?If you're looking for something different, this is it. It's not like \"God of War\", it's not like \"Bayonetta\", and it's not like \"MGS\". It's just... bizarre, weird, and downright quirky. In a good way, in my humble opinion. However...DO NOT buy this game if you can't stand QTE (Quick Time Events... the timed button presses made popular by \"Resident Evil 4\" and \"God of War\"). QTE... there's a LOT of it in this game... undoubtedly a world record, as a matter of fact!Also... DO NOT buy this game if you can't stand anime... we just might be looking at another world record here, boys!Finally, DO NOT buy this game if you're not willing to accept the fact that there is a relatively small amount of hands-on gameplay.The story is entertaining (and hilarious in its absurdity, as I mentioned earlier), and I really didn't mind all the cut scenes and non-playing portions, because the presentation of this game is so outstanding. I'm not a huge fan of either anime or QTE, but I was able to overlook their enormous presence because this game is just so unique. Developers in the gaming industry need to be more innovative, more daring, and less fearful of failure. This willingness to tread uncharted territory is what's required for the industry to grow and evolve. \"Asura's Wrath\" is a perfect example of a developer (and the publisher... hats off to Capcom for supporting this project) taking chances, and pursuing a fun idea that they're passionate about. Every aspect of this game is filled with HEART.If you're not sure if you'll like this game or not, just download the demo from PSN or Live. The demo is very indicative of the entire experience... that experience being a very unique insanity :DUpdate on 6/23/12: Went back for another go-round, and this game still makes me laugh and smile.

Worth printing.BEHIND THE SCENES VIDEOActually titled 'Behind the Game', it's a set of 3 QuickTime 720p videos, 4-6 minutes each where producer Nei Hirono gets as acquainted with the father/author of Dark Souls and Demon's Souls, Hidetaka Miuzaki and the game's major themes. We learn that Hidetaka dreamed Dark Souls ever since his childhood, having been inspired by such books as 'Sorcery'.The game's three major themes are:- High fantasy (Kings and Knights)- Death and Darkness (we knew that)- Purgatory and Flames (we are aware of this)Overall, good clips, worth watching.SOUND TRACKThis is a full album. 23 tracks of hauntingly beautiful, incredibly depressing music.

The tin box could be a collector item for anyone collecting these things. The videos are nice but too short. The map or something like it should become available online soon if it's not there already. I am pleased with my copy.

{"product_name":"B002EE5ROO","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode, an optional prologue to the game available as downloadable content and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","summary":"The Dead Rise Again...Time For Some Fun!","reviewText":"Dead Rising was one of the initial XBox 360 Launch titles that left a huge impression on fans of Microsoft's titanic console.  You either loved it, or you hated it.  Now, 4 years and several generations of 360 console design later, we have Dead Rising 2, a modest but ultimately rewarding update to one of the 360's most classic \"killer apps\".Story:Picking up several years after the events of the first game, we are introduced to a new protagonist.  Chuck Greene, a former motocross champion and devoted father, has been doing anything he can to obtain Zombrex, the only drug that can successfully counteract the zombie virus.  His daughter Katie was infected a few years prior to the events of Dead Rising 2 in the Las Vegas outbreak (non-gameplay story element).  Unfortunately, Zombrex is a severely temporary measure and the poor girl must receive her Zombrex dose every 12 (and later, every 24) hours or else she too will turn.  Chuck enters the \"Terror Is Reality\" Pay-Per-View game show in order to win money for Zombrex, but the flamboyant and over-the-top host of the show may have other plans.  Soon, Chuck and Katie find themselves stuck in the middle of another major outbreak...now the third major U.S. outbreak since the initial Willamette incident.  However, Chuck soon discovers that this outbreak was definitely not an accident, and has only 72 hours to clear his name and escape Fortune City.It's not too complex, but the story picks up nicely after the events of the first game, and 2 years after Case:ZERO (DLC prequel).  Chuck is an extremely likable character, and even his daughter Katey is too sweet not to like...an unusual trait for a capcom game as their child characters are commonly irritating.  In typical Capcom zombie game fashion, there is a huge twist and conspiracy.  Thankfully, Dead Rising 2 does not seem to be getting as out-of-control as Resident Evil's story has become, though I fear for the future of the franchise.  For now, the story is typical horror movie and zombie game fare and is an enjoyable element to the game, not to mention there are plenty of characters to meet, from devious incestuous sisters to sultry reporters and a whole new slew of irritating psychopaths.Gameplay:Similar to Dead Rising but much improved, the newest and best feature has to be the weapon creation system.  Seemingly random pairings of objects can create devastating new weapons for you to use, and half the fun is figuring out how to obtain these said devices (unless you cheat and use the internet you ninny).  There are now more zombies on screen than ever before, and Survivor AI is VASTLY improved.  No longer will they stand around like idiots, getting themselves killed...stick a weapon in their hands and you've got a very useful AI partner to tag along with you for as long as you want to keep them around.  Unfortunately you still can't issue them any orders other than going to a specified target area or calling them back to you.  Chuck has different abilities than Frank, and the RPG-ish character progression system is identical to Dead Rising, except you don't have to worry about taking pictures for \"PP\" (Prestige Points).  I can't help but chuckle when the game tells me I received 10,000 PP, but that's besides the point.The Mission system is also virtually identical to Dead Rising, though there is a tad more variety this time.  Some rescue missions require you to fetch object, or even pay money to the survivors to come with you...sometimes thousands of dollars!  The game is designed so that you basically cannot beat it in one play, as there is simply too much going on and you will not make it in time.  It is identical to Dead Rising in that the game basically boils down to a hectic and stressful time-management game.Mechanics:The game moves and sounds great.  Load times are awful but it is to be expected...the game is HUGE and there are more areas to explore than the previous game.  Vehicles, weapons and random objects all function fine, and the single player experience is relatively fluid with few glitches.  However...Multiplayer:A first in the Dead Rising series, now your friend can jump in as a second Chuck to help you with the game.  This is LOADS of fun and adds tremendous replay value, though it is incredibly glitchy and can result in strange things happening to your save files and characters.  You cannot separate and must always remain in the same zone, but you can split up to cover more ground within that zone, and the game handles it VERY well.  However, the competitive multiplayer \"Terror Is Reality\" mode can be very glitchy and completely unplayable...many times my \"Zomboni\" wouldn't grind any zombies, leaving me scoreless in the Zomboni game.  Other times the system lag or poor connection just totally botches your scores or progress in each mini game.  While fun, TIR gets stale when you spend 75% of your time losing connection to your opponent or experiencing glitches that make it unplayable.Overall:A fantastic update to one of the 360's best launch titles.  Capcom nailed it in the fun department but there really isn't enough difference from the previous game to truly set it apart.  IF anything, it is a great upgrade, but still feels the same.  Let's finish up with Pros & Cons:Pros:- Weapon Creation system is fun and discovering all of the combinations is half the game- Fortune City is huge and there's always more stuff to find...you may NEVER find everything in the game- Improved Survivor AI makes rescue missions less of a chore and more fun.  They fight so well that chances are you'll inadvertently kill them, not zombies!- Multiplayer Co-op is ingenious and adds a whole new (if glitchy) dimension to the game- Tremendous replay value - there's so much to see and do that it will take you many playthroughs to experience it all- Not for the squeamish: When the gore isn't in your face, there's enough sex and innuendo around every corner to satiate all your primitive desires (no nudity or actual sex, perv).- Game is designed for multiple playthroughs - you just won't beat it all in your first tryCons:- Extremely glitchy multiplayer Terror is Reality game, as well as possibly character/save file damaging errors in co-op- The game boils down to  stressful and frustrating time management for pretty much the entirety of the story- Archaic and unforgiving save system means that if you neglect to save you could potentially lose HOURS UPON HOURS of progress.- While replay value is very high, repetition can tedious and ultimately the game may become boring- No user-designated waypoint on the map...seriously?  NO WAYPOINT MAKING ON THE MAP?  It's 2010 CAPCOM!  YOU'RE 15 YEARS BEHIND!- Psychopaths are ridiculously hard at earlier levels, and some have no obvious weaknesses making them exceptionally irritating and a chore to fight- Game is designed for multiple playthroughs - you just won't beat it all in your first, or second...maybe even third try.- Overtime Mode (the game's post-story climax) is ultimately a letdown- No more survivor death scenes, one of the first game's most gruesome features.  In fact, it's a CHORE to get the survivors killed!- Overtly racist and viciously anti-American overtones and stereotypes may offend some playersIn conclusion, I would say that if you loved the first game, give this one shot.  If you're moderately interested in sandbox-type games, give it a look.  Casual gamers turned off by replay and tedium may want to stay away.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

The most blatantly obvious fact:WHERE'S THE BRIDGE?You cant hail other ships from it, cant engage to warp speed from it...in fact, there absolutely nothing you can do from the bridge.There's a story Arc, but its not completed so while it fills out you are left grinding...and it's during the grind where you start noticing stuff... like how apart from a few sound effects and songs, this is just yet another rushed out the door, 'develop-as-we-go' MMO.Which would be fine, except that you have this entire 25yr money making cash cow  called Star Trek bank rolling your project...and it still feels very generic.Also during the grind you start to notice things, like how star ships, docking stations, even underground caverns all have 35ft high ceilings, like giants lived here. I never watched a ST episode where I couldnt see the ceiling of any hallway, room or location they were.But I will say, even after all that - I still signed up for a subscription because despite it's shortcomings, make no mistake, it's definitely FUN - and the ships look awesome and the space combat is epic (well, the first 500 fights are). You can mix n match parts to customize the look of your starship.The expose/explot combat system removes the tedium of killing mobs by looking for/ waiting for/ creating explots on your enemies.The game is less than a year old, so hopefully they have time to make improvements before everyone starts to bail.But in closing, its time for these PC Video game makers to start finishing their products before releasing them.No other manufacturer does this - imagine you buy a car and the brakes are weak, the steering wheel is missing and you only have 2 of 4 tires - but they want you to pay the full price and MAYBE we'll ship out your parts at a later date - thats BS","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2010"}

It's true that it has several of the DKC basics, including several monsters, massive bosses, the Kong Family-Donkey, Diddy, Candy, Funky, Cranky, and Wrinkly, as well as newly introduced members Chunky (Kiddy's brother), Tiny (Dixie's sister), and Lanky (DK's second cousin). However, the game is really more like Banjo-Kazooie, which is unquestionably Nintendo and Rare's trademark N64 series. Rather than having various levels in multiple worlds to trek through in a platform adventure, we get eight massive worlds for heavy exploration. It really just isn't quite the same. As true as it is that it is fun as hell to play, it doesn't get as high an overall rating because it strays so far from the classics.

Another aspect is the Music, which is amazing! it adds to the atmosphericness of the game, and is very well written. I recommend this to anyone with a whole lot of patience...and a brain.

Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges.

Morales","summary":"(4.5) Hardcore Gamers Need Only Apply","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Prestine Diamond-solid controls PERFECTLY balance skill and fun; gorgeous environments; phenomenal cut-scenes; ridiculously depthful combat system and attacks; very challenging difficulty; intense sound; incredible main character; nice special edition add-ons: insane replay valueTHE BAD: Some annoying and vague backtracking; some slowdown during intense fights; camera can get in the way; can be irritatingly difficult about remedial tasksDIFFICULTY: HardThe original DMC3 was absolutely notorious for its completely unforgiving checkpoint system and intensified difficulty, therefore Capcom decided that this game needed more; more balance and more fun, so it came out with this special edition. With it, there are great unlockables once you finish the main quest, like getting to play through as his twin brother Vergil, the 9,999 level Bloody Palace mode (level after level of nothing but intense combat), a more humane difficulty, and a couple of new boss fights. Now, even with all these new modes, the gameplay pretty much stays the same.After everything, DMC3 is really a game about its combat system. You get to choose and select throughout the game a different set of fighting styles; if you like gunplay, choose the Gunslinger style; if you like sword melee, choose the SwordMaster style. You will level up these styles as you play with them, gaining new moves, as well as being able to buy new moves, upgrades, and powerups between missions. The amount of moves available and learned throughout the game will take you roughly 4 playthroughs just to master all the styles and moves. Considering you're rewarded with more red orbs (or dollars) to upgrade later on, it's worth learning to play through more and more. And because controls are so precise with all this, and dodging attacks takes quick reflexes and a good eye, it's enough to make you want to learn more.Enemies in DMC3 come in all forms, shapes and sizes and won't hesitate to learn your moves and quickly dish out an asskicking, which is part of what makes this game so hard. Enemies actually FIGHT back. On top of this, the boss fights are some of the most intense in all of videogames. You'll try again and again to beat these quick and tough guys, eventually doing so, but not after going through about 3 or 5 tries each, if not more. In the old DMC3, you needed to puchase orbs to continue from a checkpoint. What makes this game so fair is that you can restart from a checkpoint no matter what. But once you get to the boss, you have to beat him, because you cannot save mid-level, and going through that tough and long mission again isn't something you'll want to do.Now, though this game offers tremendous replay value, and I did love it a lot more than the original DMC, there still are a few things holding it back. One, is the camera, which can be hard to find a good spot at points, and can sometimes be static in certain areas, making the direction you're supposed to be moving in feel wrong and imprecise. Also, some backtracking requires you to go through a level without a good clue as to where you'll have to go next, so you'll sometimes wander and wander and wonder why the game couldn't be better at clueing you in. Lastly, though the battles are hard, doesn't mean that remedial tasks like destroying certain objects to gain a powerup has to be. Some statues need to be destroyed by using a series of creative moves that'll fill up your style meter. Unfortunatly, you can spend a good 20 minutes at a statue just trying to destroy it, making its reward feel so unnecessary.did I mention the cut-scenes though? The John Woo/Matrix style scenes are so intense that after FINALLY beating that tough-as-nails boss, you're rewarded with what could be an ending in itself. there are just too many things to bring you back, like the combat system and great unlockables.BOTTOM LINE: Incredible replay value, fair checkpoint system, awesome add-ons, etc will keep you coming back again and again.

This game walks all over the GTA game that was released on the GBA by a long shot.  Gameplay is open ended as always and so far difficulty is not too bad.  The controls will take some getting used to but you can switch from using the analog nub to using the d pad if you wish.  I am very impressed with the graphics and sound quality isn't too bad.  Now I'm not sure but have read that in order to access the custom soundtrack abilty you have to reach level 20 before you can access the feature.  I would give this a soild 9 just for the gameplay alone.

Well, that's the problem.  There isn't anything else.  This game is fun if you and your friend want to  play Pokemon with better graphics.  There is almost nothing else to do with  this game:  although it offers multiple other features, none of these  merits any praise.For example, the game comes with 9 &quot;mini  games&quot; of sorts...which are all basically variations of each other in  that they all require mindless button mashing.  Some require TIMED button  mashing...woo hoo.  The only one that speaks to be something worth anyone's  time is the Clefairy memory game, which requires you to remember sequences  of arrows and repeat them within a time limit.  These games get real old,  real fast.  But that's why its worth RENTING, not buying.  Blockbuster will  even give you the nifty little controller pack to upload your pokemon  should you so desire.&quot;But it comes with other stuff too, you biased  punk!&quot;  It does?  Oh yeah, that silly single player thing where you  can fight against a bunch of ridiculously easy trainers to...earn nothing.  No exp, cool items, secret endings, or anything interesting like that.  Why  bother when you could be kicking the living crud out of the elite four  again and again for experience?The one redeeming thing about this game  is the single player one-on-one vs computer mode.  You choose 6 pokemon -  all level 50 - and your opponent does the same.  These pokemon all have  attacks pre-assigned to them - and higher evolutions aren't necessarily  better, because the lower evolutions have superior attacks (so that  everyone isnt choosing charizard over cute lil ol charmander).  In essence,  the only way to win is pure strategy, because you can't go out and level  your pokemon a bajillion levels and try to use brute force.But then  again, the primary audience of Pokemon is little kids.  And since when do  little kids use strategy in these games?  Excuse me while I go knock on  wood.Again, to summarize, its a renter, not a buyer.  It'll keep you  entertained for a night or two, and is GREAT for pokemon trainer parties,  but beyond that, the game is a waste of everyone's money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2000"}

That means all new character models, all new stadium designs, new cutscene animations, tackling animations, everything is brand new.  And guess what?  All of it has less than a year to be designed, tested, and completed.  It takes time to reimplant all the game modes due to the fact that they had to redesign the whole game for the 360 and PS3. Madden is Madden, football is football.  Character models are developed in similarity to that of ESPN, and that is because EA partnered up with ESPN, hence the ESPN radio over Xbox Live.  Now to strictly gameplay.  It's not bad, its a whole new separate game from that of the original platforms.  Buttons changed, models are different, animations are tweaked, and the feel of the game is at a different level.People need to stop complaining about game options missing, about choppy screens, and all of it.  Two years on new software and you expect a perfect game built from the ground up in under a year of work while still developing for the original consoles.  You have to be crazy.  Football is football.  Get this game because you want to have a football game, play against friends, and have a fun time on your 360.  EA just listened to the reviews of ESPN NFL 2K series and developed it more into the essence of that.  And in about two years we will see how it goes.Don't complain that EA is messing up.  All sports games won't be the same for a while.  New system.  So don't complain and write reviews on that.  Write reviews that reflect the development of a new franchise of Madden for the Next Gen.

However if you didn't like the first one then skip this one and stick with Guitar Hero because its not that much different.  The only thing that is different is to unlock songs but its actually easier this time around and less time consuming.  Also when you unlock songs you can play any instrument (as long as its required) to unlock it so you can actually play bass or sing on any song if you wanted.  This time around they eliminated solo mode, so this time to unlock songs you have to play in tour mode or challenge mode and they give you challenges to do so eventually you will unlock all the songs.  This game is almost identical to the first one except they added a few things here and there like Modifying the game so you can't fail or speed the songs up or select the venue you want to play.  The graphics look basically the same as the first and the gameplay is the same as the first.  This time around you can do World Tour Mode online as well.  You can also export songs from the Rock Band 1 disc to play on Rock Band 2 which is probably my favorite feature because I liked all the songs for Rock Band 1 and now I don't need to switch discs and of course all DLC automatically loads into the game and all your Rock Band 1 instruments work just as well.

Do that for about 3 minutes, then go up to the Archdemon and slash away at it while using health poultices.The only \"bad\" thing I can say about the game is the combat system, which really isn't that bad at all.  It just gets a little too repetitive at times.  Other than that minor issue, this is a pretty decent game.  I put in 45 hours just on the main storyline, and I haven't touched any of the DLC yet (working on that now).What I also found decent was the voice work.  You have Kate Mulgrew and Tim Russ (both from Star Trek:  Voyager), Claudia Black (from Stargate SG-1), Dwight Schultz (from Star Trek: The Next Generation, \"Lt.

Age of Empires 2 is not your typical RTS. Unlike WarCraft and StarCraft, AOE2 requires more thinking on your part rather than creating an army of soldiers and storming the enemy base. That doesn't cut it in AOE2. You actually have to think in order to outsmart the computer (oh my gosh, some of you mindless people actually have to use your so called brains). In regards to AOE2 and the major change I had to go through from playing WarCraft and StarCraft, was the fact that I had to learn how to multitask my characters. In WarCraft and StarCraft the only resources you can gather are either two or three resources. In AOE2 you must gather food, wood, gold, and stone in order to keep your civilization alive. Also the many different upgrades and research items in AOE2 was a big change from WarCraft and StarCraft. In an overall rating, AOE2 outperforms WarCraft and StarCraft by a considerable amount and is 10x more fun and challenging.

{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"A memory card, yes...but it gives you what you need!","reviewText":"With the PS2's improvements in graphics, control, and, most importantly, gameplay, it makes sense that Sony would upgrade its console's memory storage to make the gaming experience even better. While the end result is a memory card and not a hard drive, the PS2's memory card is a vast improvement over the PSX's in many aspects.Because the PS2's games require more space to save than a few bytes, the PS2 memory card has 8MB of storage, which is FAR more than the PSX's. But one of the biggest improvements has to be that there are no more \"blocks.\" With PSX memory cards, there was a predetermined number of blocks that games were saved in. One game was saved in one block, no matter how small the file was, and this wasted a lot of storage space. With the PS2 memory card, gamers can use ALL of the memory storage space; they can save as many games as they want until the memory card is full. Plus, the PS2 memory card loads data faster than the original PSX card, and if you want to play your saved game on another PS2, all you need is your memory card and the game disc, nothing else.Of course, there is one drawback to the memory card: it's space limitations. While 8MB is quite large, it's still a set amount of space, and hardcore gamers can eat up this space very quickly, which forces them to buy more memory cards. It would've been nice if the amount of space were bigger or if the cards were cheaper.But still, the PS2 memory card is a solid purchase, mainly because it's required to save games on the PS2. While it is a memory card, it does its job better than any other card on the market; other cards, like the infamously bad CD-loading 16MB card and third-party cards, are either a hassle to use or can easily get corrupted and lose data.

There is tons to do, epic quests, super world bosses like the massive Sha of Anger, new dungons, very powerful new gear, spells, glpyhs, mounts and endless dailies so you'll get to run the same content over and over and over and over needlessly until you tire of it just to get a mount or gear. At first I was not sure what to expect when I heard about panda's, I have no plans to ever level a panda or a disgustingly OP monk but I liked some of the new content, level 90 cap and the new abilities and areas.  Overall the new expansion was tolerable until path 5.3 where Blizzard eliminated world PVP from the game where PVE players can kill anything PVE or PVP and tyranical/malevolent PVP gear was/are simply a waste of time and effort as PVP power is now usless and everyone now has a min resilence of 65% and resil is now removed from PVP gear...again making it useless and giving PVE a free ride. Blizzard says world pvp was a necessary sacrifice to get PVP players to raid and that world pvp is a small insigificant part of the game compared to PVE.  PVE players would also have an easier time getting into PVP without having to get gear.  Well I did the grinds to get PVP gear in crappy unbalnced, boring, battlegrounds over and over and over and over and over where a monk or druid could kill your whole team and druids have like 10 forms with the abilities of every class in the game....well all that effort was for nothing as world pvp was the only thing that kept me playing, now with full PVP gear I do the same damage as a level 85 with cata greens to another player.  Blizzard ruined their game to the point that it's not worth playing anymore.  PVE players with raid gear dominate BG's now and arena's just plain suck as they always have becasue in order to get conquest gear when it was worth somthing you had to face already conquest geared players...? They took point trading out of the game, again another bright move...PVP in this game is the worst I've ever seen in terms of balance and fairness but now it's unplayable.  Soon they will have it where no one can get killed, well it basically is that way as world PVP is offically dead and im not turing to raids to re-gear again just to be able to survive in world. I had to do that twice in the last 4 months.  Moving to LOTRO and other better MMO's where they know how to design and mainain a game.  Hope wow loses another 4 mil subs after this ignorant, self indulgent, unfair, insanly stupid tragity. A total disrespectful spit in the face to PVP players from Blizztard.  FFWD 5.4 - Volgin new warchief....Garrosh is taken away to panda cuddleland and everyone gets along is peace and lives peacefully (not to mention heals quickly)....base resilence increased to 72%...82% if you have two pvp trinkets from season 12 and up...PVE gear still dominates, PVP even worse than 5.3 if that's possible.... Unsubbed.Update:  Re-subbed for 1 month to see if Blizzard actually fixed the rediculous BS from 5.3/4....well it's even worse now, even more free PVP resil for all, fights take even longer and seem like pillow fights, there is more CC, druids and healers are retardedly OP to the point where it takes a raid group to kill them even with the new PVP gear which is pretty much useless.  PVP sucks worse than ever, with the addition of isle of thunder and timeless isle you just get two more Isle of Grinds (dailies) and a boring raid that ends with a horrid ending mentioned above. They also added a blizzard store to sell pets and mounts which are all grossly overpriced as well as a level 90 boost for 65 dollars....WOW is now also pay to win.  Other far better MMO's with microtransactions dont even have that garbage, they have increase XP from killing stuff for limited time but not instant max level.  Deleted all my toons and gave away my gold, goodbye forever will not be buying WOD or resubbing to this garbage ever again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

They are as follows:1)It was the exact same price2)The games looked really awesome and I wanted several of the titles (namely Animal Crossing 3DS, Super Mario 3D land, and Mario Kart 7, and Tetris Axis to start with.3)It will play Netflix (I watched a movie tonight, and it plays beautifully!:4)It's backwards compatibility. (I still want to buy plain ds games lol)5)Ability to connect to the internet without WEP.6)The analog stick! That was one of THE best ideas Nintendo has come up with! It makes playing Super Mario 64 DS so much easier! ;-)7)Last but certainly not least was the amazing 3D graphics! They really pop out. The best way I could describe it would be to say its like standing outside of a house and looking in through a window. (Another plus is the ability to turn off the 3D setting if, after playing for awhile, it irritates my eyes or gives me a headache.)The only plus on the side of the dsi xl was the big screens (which I did want) but the good on the side of the 3ds totally outweighed the benefits of the DSI XL.P.S.

{"product_name":"B000R0SR9E","description":"A supernatural horror action game with a story devised by the master mythmaker, novelist and filmmaker Clive Barker. Mingling the darkest elements of Barker's horror fiction and films, Jericho deals with the mysterious reappearance of a lost city in a remote desert. When a form of evil that goes right back to the dawn of days resurfaces from there, a Special Forces squad, trained in both conventional warfare and the arcane arts, is sent in. Their mission: hunt down and destroy the evil that lurks at the heart of the city before it destroys humanity.","reviewerName":"Lars Kingbeard","summary":"Absolutely brilliant","reviewText":"I was really looking forward to this game before its release, but I ended up not getting it because of the largely negative press it recieved at the time. All those reviews were wrong. dead wrong.Ill start with the graphics - they are phenomenal. Rarely has a game evoked the sense of space that Jericho does. Grand panoramic vistas of crumbling ruins and blasted terrain are commonplace. The squad is dwarfed by soaring pillars and gates. There are incredible atmospheric effects that simulate dust, storms, fog, mist, and beams of light. The designs of the creatures and the environments are top-notch, and there was a real feeling of exploration and a of a fully realized and sustained  game world. The sound and music are also excellent.The game features a great story by clive barker, and I found myself really engaged by the different characters and by the unfolding drama and wanting to see what was in store for the jericho squad at the end of their quest. All of the boss characters you meet also have a deep backstory which was one of the main appeals of the game. If you've seen hellraiser or read the books of blood then you'll know that clive barker writes a uniquely visceral and psychologically nuanced brand of horror, which is thankfully well represented in jericho.But what about the gameplay? This is the portion of jericho that was most heavily criticized, but I found that jericho played brilliantly from start to finish. This is not a slow, tactical shooter (as some reviwers thought) or even a standard shooter like halo. Jericho is a no-holds-barred, unrelenting, adrenalin rush of action. Its more similar to games like doom and quake, but I found it to be more intense than even these. The firefights in jericho can reach truly epic proportions as you blow away dozens of enemy monsters, frequently with one hit kills, but they just keep coming. You have to be on your toes to stay ahead of the onslaught or you will be overwhelmed. Alot of reviewers said they spent more time reviving downed comrades than they did fighting. I hate to say this but really, there is no other way to put it - they dont know how to play the game. I dont consider myself a shooter expert or anything like that, just an average gamer, but I died only a few times during the course of the campaign. If you are agressive you can stay ahead of the enemies, but if you aren't (e.g. you keep reviving people) they will overwhelm you and kill you quickly. So just leave the healing to father Rawlings and concentrate on gunning down the enemy as fast as you can.The fact that you control a squad led many people to believe that this was in some way a tactical shooter, and the description on the box even seems to suggest this. In my opinion, the reason that the game features a squad is to develop clive barker's narritive. Most of the story is told through interaction of the squad members, and since you spend the game venturing ever deeper into a nexus of evil, completely cut off from the outside world and only rarely encountering npcs who dont want to rip you head off, the conversations of the squad members are a natural and effective way to move the story along. In practice, I thought of each squad member being equivalent to a certain weapon so if I wanted the chain gun I switched to Delgado, or if I wanted the sniper rifle I would jump to abbey.People have also complained about the button tapping sequences (quick time events). There are about 5 or 6 mandatory qtes in the ENTIRE game. If you are grabbed by an enemy, it will also trigger a qte, but this only happened to me 2 or 3 times during the game. really, its not a big deal. I like the qtes since they allow you a chance to see the enemies up close.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It is one of my favorite games of all time. awesome story, design, and gameplay. The only drawbacks to Jericho are that it could have been longer, and the ending was not great.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"S P","summary":"Much Improved","reviewText":"If you wanted to enjoy Final Fantasy XIII, tried your best, but just couldn't make it work, you will probably enjoy XIII-2. In terms of its gameplay and design, it's the game the original should have been. While the story is less epic and actually a bit apathetic, you are likely to enjoy yourself much more with this title. The battle initiation system is rather brilliant and brings back some of the live battlefield aspects of XII. Paradigm switching is snappy and rewarding and allows you to be more tactical. The real-time button presses make cutscenes more dynamic. The fragment fetch system helps you actually visualize your progress and makes the game feel a bit more sidequest-y rather than one never-ending story (pretty sure I'm not the only one who begged XIII to end every time the team entered a new world).By far the best addition is the introduction of non-linear levels. You actually have some freedom to roam around the battlefield, and you can choose the order of the levels you fight in. Seriously, this makes XIII-2 a totally new game. You might be surprised at what a significant difference it brings.The addition of monster battles expands the customization options and gives the game a more playful feel. The Mog companion is also a lighthearted element that makes the game fun, rather than a slow drudge (cough cough XIII).I'm not too concerned about the plot here either way as I wasn't a fan of the original - perhaps XV will bring a set of more likable characters. Who knows. I pay half-attention to the plot and find it passable. I was mildly annoyed by the framerate drops during some cinematic-intensive scenes, though.XIII-2 was a rush job by comparison with previous installments, and certainly given the amount of time put into it the results are stunning. Even if it had taken five years to develop, this would still be a respectable entry. Trust me: if a western game company developed this, the expectations would be much lower and people would be blown away by this title. Imagine if EA had developed a title of this ambition and polish! It's inconceivable to me. Square is a victim of high expectations - and that's all for the better. We trust them to make the best RPGs around.If Square decides to develop a XIII-3, I feel confident they will carry over the best of this game and finally pull together the disparate elements around a unified plot. I can't wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2012"}

While this may sound like it'll get boring after a while (like many games of the genre do), Heavenly Sword manages to keep things pretty fresh by implementing different play styles, playable characters, and puzzle elements as well.  The game also boasts some incredible production values, excellent music and sound effects, great voice acting, and entertaining cinematics and story as well.  The only real negative to Heavenly Sword is that the game is quite short.  It won't take you long to get through the game (you could beat it in an afternoon if you so desired), and though there are a nice selection of unlockables and extras to find as well, the replay factor isn't very high here.  Not to mention that the puzzle elements aren't anything we haven't seen before either, but these negatives don't take away the fact that Heavenly Sword is one of the best, original games to hit the PS3 yet.  All in all, Heavenly Sword is a fun blast while it lasts, and needless to say, if you own a PS3, this is one of the games you've been waiting to get your hands on since you purchased the console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2007"}

This is definitely a game for the avid fans of side-scrollers who think they have the skills to take on anything.Your mission is simple. Stay alive. Kill every single thing you can - your ultimate goal would be to kill 100% of everything you see. Really though, you just want to try to stay alive and make it on to the next mission. That in itself is a real challenge.The sound is just a hard rock soundtrack and the eternal thrum of bullets. You don't need anything other than that. Your attention will be solely on trying to not die.For graphics, in traditional side scroller layout you have some nice textured backgrounds but the main characters are fairly straightforward. Again, that's fine. You don't have time to be distracted looking at gorgeous cherry blossoms floating in the background. You solely want to dodge that bullet. Now.The game lets you hold in a button to unleash a killer continuous hail of bullets streaming out from your gun, so in essence you can run around with that non-stop stream going out while hitting 'jump' with another button. Many of the enemies will just keep coming and coming while you move forward across the level.I do want to reiterate that this is not a kiddie, easy game. It is deliberately meant to be very hard. I think it would have been better if they offered varying levels of difficulty so new gamers could get used to it then replay at the harder level. For whatever reason they decided simply to make it really hard. For some gamers this might mean that they never get past the first boss and bring the game back. Be warned.Rating: 4/5 because of this lack of ramp-up. For expert gamers, you're all set!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"The1and0nly","summary":"No stone cold steve austin","reviewText":"Was extremely excited about this game as I loved wwf revenge for the Nintendo 64.

The Charge Station includes 2 NiMH batteries, exclusively designed for the Wii Remote, each providing up to 25 hours of play time. Each battery is easily recharged by placing the Wii Remote in the charging dock. The charging dock conveniently plugs into any standard wall outlet, allowing for rapid recharging of both batteries in 8 hours. The Charge Station includes 2 custom battery covers with contact pass-through points so you can charge the batteries while they are still in the remote. Each battery cover is also rubberized for superior grip during intense gaming sessions. The Charge Station matches the d&#xE9;cor and styling of the Wii, and is small enough to fit in any home entertainment center.","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Very useful, and will end up saving Wii users money","reviewText":"I've had these Wii Remote chargers for quite awhile, and I have to say chances are I've already saved myself quite a bit of money I would have spent on batteries throughout my hours and hours of playing. One of my biggest gripes about the Wii Remotes was that they are battery-powered; wireless controllers are great, but consoles and their accompanying games are expensive enough as it is....I want my spending to be done with once I've actually got the console, the games and the controllers in my possession. Thankfully, this device relieves that concern. Simply place the charger units into your Wii Remotes (I recommend you buy two of these, if you have three or more Wii Remotes or are an avid gamer) and then plug the Wii Remotes into the Charge Station. It takes awhile for them to fully charge, but the initial charge is pretty powerful-charging it for only 5-10 minutes should get you to be able to use a dying Remote for a good couple more games. For those who are wondering, no, you do not have to remove the wrist strap to get the Remotes to fit in the station (thank god); they fit very comfortably and the wrist straps go through the side edges. Those who use Wii Remote protective skins will have to remove them before charging, however. This wasn't a concern for me because I don't use the skins (found them to be a little too wonky-feeling for my taste). You will be able to tell that the Remotes are charging because the lights beneath each charge port will glow blue. When the Remote is fully charged, it will glow green. The only potential problem in this is that the charge lights are very, very bright-so those who hope to charge their Remotes overnight or while they sleep might be better off not keeping the Charge Station in their bedroom, because the lights can be obnoxious (though if you don't mind some subtle light while you sleep, you likely won't care. Better yet, just put something over the lights). The cover for the rechargeable battery packs is slightly bulkier than the ordinary Wii Remote cover; you may notice that your Wii Remote will have a slightly different grip than before (and it may not slip into Wii accessories, such as the Wii Wheel or the Wii Zapper from Link's Crossbow Training, quite as easily). This is a minor concern, however. It still ultimately ends up getting into these devices just fine (I frequently use the Wii Wheel and once I got used to the fit can easily slide it into the accessory), and worst-case you can simply remove the cover and it'll fit even more snugly (the Remotes don't require the cover to function, and obviously unlike batteries, you don't need to worry about anything falling out, because the charge packs are form-fitting). In some ways, the new cover is an improvement, because you'll have a stronger grip on your Remote and won't find it slipping or dropping out of your hands nearly as often as before. I've had my Charge Station for almost 2 years and have had no problems. Overall, this is almost a necessity for avid Wii gamers who are tired of wasting money on batteries.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2008"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A stunning achievement","reviewText":"I honestly didn't know just what to expect upon hearing of the looming release of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars on the DS.  I had figured that there would be little to no chance of the game bearing any sort of resemblance to the franchise we all know and love.  Well, I was wrong.  Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a stunning achievement in every sense of the word, as the series' debut on the DS not only manages to retain nearly everything that made the series so great and revolutionary on home consoles, but in some cases even improves on them.  Taking place in Liberty City, Chinatown Wars finds you in the shoes of Huang, who is looking to avenge the death of his gangster father.  While the game provides a good story and memorable enough characters, Chinatown Wars also features the tried and true classic GTA gameplay, which is a surprise and an achievement in themselves in translating all of these features to the DS.  Translating the Liberty City from GTA IV is also brilliantly done, and there are tons of side missions and optional activities, along with two-player multiplayer modes; all of which will keep you busy for quite some time.  The game's graphics can appear occasionally grainy in some spots, but for the most part, achieving these kinds of visuals on the DS needs to be seen to be believed.  Chinatown Wars also makes great use of the touch screen and stylus features, and does so without over-complicating things as well.  All in all, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars isn't only the best third-party game to hit the DS yet, it is a stunning achievement that needs to be in the hands of every DS owner.  Even if you aren't that much of a GTA fan but you own a DS, Chinatown Wars is definitely worth playing at the very least, and stands as one of the best games available for the handheld.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2009"}

You had the great Zelda, Mario, Ninja Gaiden, and the RPG games like Final Fantasy and Dragonwarrior.  Among my favorite series of all time happens to be the blue bomber (as we true fans called him), Mega Man.  There were six on the NES as well as the 7th one for Super Nintendo and the eighth one for PlayStation.  For years I anticipated a treatment like they did for Mario All-Stars (although they made The Wily Wars for Genesis, which had the first three, but that wasn't enough...), and I finally got my wish... all eight original games on one disc.THE GOODNot ONLY do you get the original games on the one disc, you ALSO get the two previously Japan-only arcade games, Mega Man: The Power Battles and Mega Man: The Power Fighters.  The arcade games you must unlock before playing.  I don't see that as a drawback because gamers must experience the original games (especially you poor gamers that didn't grow up playing it).  Most of the music in the first 6 games are remixed, most of them sounding quite good; the music in Mega Mans 5 and 6 are VASTLY improved over their original counterparts.  Not only that, but you have the option of playing the games in their original forms as well.  Mega Man 8 doesn't change much, but remember its crappy load time between sections?  GONE.  The game loads very quick-paced, and I am forever grateful to those involved with the game that eliminated it.  Another secret you can unlock---and this surprised me---is the first episode of the short-lived Mega Man cartoon series (y'know, the one with Mega Man voiced by a GUY, and he was also Goku??).  Not just a clip, not a collection of clips, THE ENTIRE EPISODE.  That's the best secret to unlock aside from the arcade games.  Also included amongst the secrets are picture sets of early drafts of characters, titles, and so forth (one of the original names for Mega Man is &quot;Knuckle Kid.&quot;  What a weird name.).THE BADThere's few wrongs with this game, but I mention them nonetheless.  First off, when I said MOST of the music is remixed, by that I mean that Mega Mans 4,5, and 6 have totally remixed music but the first three do not.  You'll hear, for example, Cut Man's theme and then when the boss music comes up, it's the original 6-bit music.  Not necessarily bad, but I do wish they would've remixed every piece of music.  Also, most of the secrets not mentioned in THE GOOD are mostly remixed music that has nothing to do with the series.  Also, and I didn't see this as a terrible thing since the controls are set in my preference anyhow, but you can't change the control scheme.  That might irritate some people, but thankfully, it didn't irritate me.OVERALLI didn't find much wrong with this game.  It's a great anniversary edition of gamers' favorite blue bomber, and I'm glad that they finally brought them over to the PlayStation 2 and Gamecube for all gamers to play (Xbox, however, got the shaft.).  Not only that, but it's only around $30.  That's a GREAT price for 10 classic games on one disc.  New gamers, do have the patience and the initiative to try out this collection.  It's a piece of gaming history and my generation of gamers understand what I mean by saying that this is one of the best game series to ever enter our fertile imaginations.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Best Video Game Yet!","reviewText":"This game is sooo much fun.

Convery","summary":"Beautiful graphics and music","reviewText":"Fable for the XBOX is a tough game to review.  I am not going to touch upon what the game should've been.The graphics in this games are beautiful.  Very neat character models and tons of customization options, from haircuts to tattoos to boots.  Character development and aging is noteworthy as well, being that through the course of the game, his physical features change due to the way he's acted over his lifespan.  Hell, if you're evil, bugs follow where you go, swarming constantly around your body.  Horns rip out of your skull and your eyes turn red.You can also interact with many of the environments from breaking windows to breaking down doors to handing some broad a beer and getting her drunk.The sound is very nice in that the NPCs talk as you pass them by in the forest or on cobblestown village street.  They say different things to you depending on your algnment.  The music is a dramatic orchestration that really sets the game's mood.So why only 3 stars out of 5?  The first few hours of the game were kind of fun (once you get past your training).  It was fun to explore and develop your characters alignment, see his physical features change from doing good or bad deeds.  When you start doing the missions, you realize that the game's complex menu system doesn't work in your favor.  The \"quick\" menu, the D-pad on the left of the controller, allows you to assign different items for use in combat.  The left stick is for character movement and the right stick is for camera control.  To lock onto and enemy, you press the L button and attack with \"B\".  To block and attack you hit the \"A\" button.  To use magic, hold down the R button and use A,B,C,D button which executes a spell (user assign spells to these buttons).  Fable is a game of many things.  With all these commands, perhaps too much.Here's the problem.I said earlier that the first few hours of non-mission play are fun.  But rarely in those first few hours are you thwarted by hoards of enemies.  One, two, or three enemies attacking you at once?  No problem.  Six or seven hacking away at you?  You will find your fingers in a knot from trying to use that control scheme I described above.  Trying to remember all those commands, enemies swarming you at all sides, health restoration, locking on, switching from sword to magic, BLOCK THAT ATTACK!, use the D-pad to heal!  After all is said and done, the battle system feels like a bad hack and slasher.Your forearms will be sore.  That shouldn't happen.To wrap it up, while the graphics and sound are great, I must say that I'm not addicted to the game.  Some games I can't put down, especially ones that give high level of customization.  Based on my reasons against, I've concluded that once you get the feel of the Fable world, you find that it's faults strip away much of the fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"All Powerful Wizard Of Oz","summary":"Misses the mark.","reviewText":"All I kept wanting to do with this game was get it over with to write this review. That right there should tell you everything, but just in case lets delve deeper into the multiple issues this game has.STORY:From the very first mission where the narrative is established of why you are playing this game we are provided with a story outline that feels too familiar with a hopeful mindset that maybe this will go somewhere you don't expect. I am here to tell you that's not gonna happen. The story itself plays out like a text book paint by numbers rehash you've played before.GAMEPLAY:If you enjoy repetitive game play that becomes more of a chore then exciting then Watchdogs is certainly a great game for you.Here's the breakdown:a. investigate. enter building, scan, hack cameras, follow a line, hack more cameras, find target, cause diversion, move to next area, repeat, story cut sceneb. driving. exit building, enter car, avoid police or assailant, hack traffic lights, get frustrated with horrible car controls, , finally arrive as destination, rinse repeatc.  gun play. pick a gun any gun, they all pretty much do the same depending on the type you choose, then it's the good ol cover, fire, rinse repeatGRAPHICS:There is no doubt this game was designed for last gen. It's not impressive what so ever and you've seen it before. It's basically every Assassins Creed Game up until recent with a new coat of paint to make look like a modern city with last gen gloss.There was never a moment where my jaw hit the floor that this was next gen. Not even close.FINAL THOUGHTS:The way this game played out for me personally and being a fan of Ubisoft as a developer is pure laziness. It feels like they tried so hard to make something fresh but fell short and got lazy near the end by trying to combine every single one of their AAA franchises into this game. As if this was nothing more then a cut, copy and paste effort pulled from their various titles in the Ubisoft library.While at times the game has it's &#34;moments&#34;, it falls short of eliciting the emotional punch or fun factor that I was looking for and misses the mark.That being said I can't give this game anything more then 3 stars and recommend you wait for the price drop if you really have to play it. When I say price drop, I mean like wait for it to reach $20, or buy it used once it hits that price point.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"One of the best games of 2012, outstanding.","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic visuals, huge island to explore, memorable characters, amazing voice acting and animations, fun campaignThe Bad: Hunting and crafting feels forced and under developed, side missions get boring after a while, multiplayer is so-soSkyrim with guns. That was Ubisoft's description for Far Cry 3. While it isn't quite Skyrim with guns, that's okay because no one really wanted that. Far Cry 3 is still a huge open world game, and is exactly what Far Cry 2 should have been. After Far Cry 2 left a bitter taste in my mouth with its boring empty world and mediocre story and missions, I just didn't have much hope for Far Cry 3. Thankfully I was wrong because this game is truly great with memorable characters and a great story. The whole world feels more lively this time around and less empty.Far Cry 3 has an awesome opening and really shows that this is already the best game in the series. You play as Jason Brody, just a regular guy who vacations to an island with his girlfriend and a few friends. Of course things go wrong and you are captured by some local pirates. The story has a lot of torture scenes spread throughout, but the beginning jail break with your brother really shows off the amazing voice acting and animations. You immediately get attached to these characters, and you are introduced to one of the most memorable game characters in recent history, Vaas. This guy is a sick and twisted psychopath and is truly demented. His relationship with Jason reminds me of Joker and Batman a lot. Jason makes Vaas question his own sanity and he is NOT comfortable with that. Jason seems to always come back from the dead, and this infuriates Vaas all the time. Every time Vaas comes on to screen you can't help but get excited for what thing he's going to do next. Truly, a well-developed character.Once you get past the first scene you are dumped into this huge luscious jungle and start getting introduced to various gameplay elements. Hunting is introduced as well as crafting. This includes crafting with animal skins to hold more things like ammo, weapons, and syringes. You can gather plants to craft syringes for health, enhance perception, hunting, steadier aim, and various other things. While these two new elements are fun, they seem a bit disconnected from the formula of Far Cry. The hunting is a bit under developed because stalking these animals isn't anything like in Assassin's Creed III. You can try sneaking up on them, but most are hidden in grass forcing you to use hunting syringes. When you fire off a shot all animals scatter and some take quite a few hits to take down. If you don't get them down in one shot you have to chase them down and eventually you lose them. The crafting requires different animal skins for each set, but I really felt it a hassle to do this.The same goes for plant gathering. Certain plants are required for certain syringes, but early on these fill up your lootsack forcing you to hunt for the skins for a bigger one. You also get a small wallet and have to craft a larger one for more money. Not exactly economical game wise, but this is to the taste of the player. I didn't mind it, but never really pursued hunting specific animals. I just gathered whatever got in my way. There just isn't a huge incentive on hunting and gathering this game.There are a few side quests such as hunting specific animals with certain weapons, killing marked targets, racing, Trial of the Rakyat which requires you to complete certain goals such as killing everyone in the area with headshots. These are fun and can break up the main story. The map is actually completely blacked out until you find radio towers and take them offline. This involves climbing the towers and figuring out how to scale them. Feels a bit like Assassin's Creed actually. There are also loot containers and relics spread throughout the island, but I honestly didn't bother. I really hate item gathering in games because it is a lazy way to extend the play time, but some people out there like it.My favorite part of the game was the main story. Missions vary greatly, but I looked forward to the new characters and the ever evolving story of Jason, Vaas, and Hoyt (the main bad guy). The whole idea of going from a city slicker to a powerful tribal warrior is really interesting. There are some fantasy elements thrown in when you go through trials to become the most powerful Rakyat warrior on the island. You have to defeat a giant boss at one point with a bow and arrow. Pretty exciting and fun. This is probably one of the more interesting FPS campaigns I have played in a long time, in fact most FPS games seem to bore me these days. Far Cry 3 was a nice change of pace.When it comes to visuals Far Cry 3 pushes PC's yet once again like it did back when it first came out. The game has amazing DirectX 11 features such as SSAO and HBAO as well as anti-aliasing, high-resolution textures, high quality shadows, and some amazing lighting effects as well as some great shaders thrown in to make this game look like a lush jungle. You will need the latest PC gaming hardware to run it like this though, even my rig couldn't run it 100% maxed out. The PC version is definitely the best. When it comes to multiplayer I really can't say much other than you won't be coming back too often. Nothing really exciting there.Overall, Far Cry 3 sports amazing visuals, a great story and memorable characters, the huge open world is fun to explore, but the hunting and crafting mechanics feel a bit forced and under developed. Multiplayer isn't as interesting you think, but the co-op campaign is where it's at. If FPS games have been boring you lately take this for a spin.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play.

The single player campaign has over 30 missions and you play against or team up with as many computer players you want in the random map play (This very tough but has a lot of good battles). Some of the cool myth units they have are Cyclops (which pick up other units and throw them to the ground), Medusa's (which turn most units to stone), and my personal fav, the Fire Giant (who throws flaming fireballs). Some of the god powers are a Tornado (which does the most damage of any of the god powers) and Meteor (which has very cool explosions that send units flying through the air).

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A unique, refreshing \"pilot episode\" that isn't without some problems","reviewText":"Have you ever started watching a new TV series that was really interesting, with superb artistic flair, and it was just very compelling overall?  With a pilot episode on television, you can get a rough idea of the great potential of a series, but it's not without some serious problems and issues that will undoubtedly get worked out if the series is greenlit. Well, with Mirror's Edge, this is like the \"pilot episode\" to what could be one of my favorite game IPs in the last five years. It's got an awesome concept, the art design is awesome, the 1st-person parkour style is very well done, it gets your adrenaline pumping in a good way, but it definitely has some serious issues that probably will get worked out with subsequent game releases.You essentially play as a living-on-the-edge messenger who transports private messages between people who do not want the 1984-esque government to stick their noses into their business. These \"runners\" are parkour athletes who perform all sorts of risk filled acrobatics across the rooftops and city streets in order to deliver the messages. The main character, Faith, is one of these and before you know it, is trying to clear her sister's name for a high-profile murder that's been pinned on her. It's an interesting premise, but not very well executed. I really didn't care much about Faith, who is woefully underdeveloped, or any of the support characters that are involved throughout. This is unfortunate because the setting really provides the material for a great story, but alas. Cinematics are delivered via Esurancelike commercials that are catchy, but not very good for conveying a story. Poor story and underdeveloped characters aside, however, Mirror's Edge has a lot to offer.The art design on display here is absolutely spectacular! The city all looks like it is brand new, shining beautifully in contrast to the decidedly dark story premise for the setting. Oftentimes the levels are designed mono-chromatically, with a single bright color contrasted with the stark white that is ever present. It's beautiful, to say the least, and I really enjoyed my time with the game that way. I cannot recall very many games recently that had such a compelling, unique setting as I thought Mirror's Edge had. The music is also quite good, with a very ambient, cool electronica focus.The gameplay in Mirror's Edge is a bit of a mixed bag and is where most of its problems lay. The first-person view is very, very well done and you get a genuine sense of weight and momentum while playing. Bravo on that. The focus in gameplay here is on adrenaline induced speed over calculation that other platformers of this nature (likePrince of Persia, for instance) focus on. The problem with this, is that to encourage you to go as fast as possible, they constantly have you outrunning bullets, and unless you know exactly where to go (this game gives you hints by coloring parts of the environment you're supposed to go off of a very saturated red color), you will die countless cheap deaths due to pressure from the omnipresent wall of turrets behind your back. You will also die numerous cheap deaths because the detection for grabbing on poles and ledges can be spotty. The combat is also atrocious and probably the worst part of the game. For every moment of incredible parkour success, there is equal if not more frustration from a broken mechanic or cheap death. I'd say this game is equal parts frustration because of the aforementioned problems and exhilarating thrill from success. That said, the good outweigh the bad by a little bit in the gameplay department.If anything, Mirror's Edge is one of the most refreshing, unique games I've played this entire console generation. I played it over a year and a half ago the first time, and whenever I reflect on the games I like the most in recent memory, images of Mirror's Edge's awesome art design and well-executed first-person platforming (in the moments it truly works perfectly anyway) always come to mind quite quickly. To be sure, this game also pissed me off more than most when I played it at the time too. It's a mixed bag. If DICE makes a sequel, where most if not all of the problems from this game are fixed, I can guarantee it will be in my top 5 games of this generation, without a doubt. A refined \"Mirror's Edge 2\" would be amazing, and according to DICE, it's happening, but not much more than that is known. I can't wait. In the meantime, Mirror's Edge 1 will be a nice little \"pilot episode\" to enjoy, warts an' all. If you're looking for a refreshing, unique world to play parkour in, but not without some faults, then give Mirror's Edge a try. Encourage the publishers and developers to make another by buying this one new. It's a decent price now, so why not? Buy it, parkour all over it, and feel the virtual breeze through your hair as you sprint, roll, and fly through this beautiful, dystopian city.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2011"}

The Reaper, led by a demon lord possessed with the great power of darkness, invaded the human world with their armies of demons. The humans pooled their battle strength, and it extended into a long conflict. In order to seal the evil, five chosen warriors of battle created five armlets and, using their power, sealed the demon lord and the reapers into sacred jewels.Time passed until the dawn of the 15th century, and territory disputes between France and England are ongoing.In the middle of a festival held in the small French village of Domremy, the town is beset by attacks from demons like nothing the citizens have ever seen before. Suddenly a girl in the village, Jeanne, hears a voice from heaven telling her to \"defeat the enemies\". She picks up her sword, and destroys them all.On her right arm was an armlet quite like the ones used by the warriors of the War of the Reapers.Guided by a voice from heaven, Jeanne, along with the young girl Liane and former mercenary Roger, heads for the castle of Charles the Dauphin. But, the destiny of Jeanne and her friends, who embark on a long journey into battle to save their mother country, has yet to be determined.Story: 4.5/5Almost perfect... this story is not for anyone under 13 years old.You start out as a young girl that finds a magical armlet that lots of people are looking for and will kill many people to get it. This game has good guys that lose it and become monsters themselves. This game also has a good old fashion witch burning. Also, your friends are never what they seem.Sound: 4.5/5What a great musical score from such an adult game.Graphics: 5/5The opening, closing and cut scenes are movie quality. WOW! I was so drawn into the story that I didn't notice that the game had begun. The art style that Level-5 used to tell this dark tale was perfect!Game-play: 4/5Turn-based strategy, I really liked the battle system in Jeanne D'Arc because as soon as the game starts to feel worn and tired out, they toss you some new skill or magic attack that will draw you back. Also, the FROG is super cool! Feed him well.Replay Value: 1/5I'm truly afraid to replay this great game. I'm not sure that I can handle the bonfire scene again... This game is not for little kids and any adults that have issues with death, destruction and lots of drama.Overall: 4.5/5This drama filled adventure into pseudo history is one that will haunt your nightmares for many a night. Jeanne D'Arc is one of the most memorable games I've ever played. I will never forget this game. This game will leave you with more questions than answers and that is ok because that allows us to fill in the blanks. I've kept this gem of a game in my personal collection. I recommend this game for any story driven RPG fan that likes drama.Again, this game is not for kids...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

You play as Ryu Hayabusa, last ninja of the Dragon Clan lineage, and your mission is to seal the ancient Arch-Fiends away before they destroy the world. The action is almost non-stop in NG2; Ryu has a wide array of acrobatic actions at his disposal to aid in his swordplay. There are fast and slow attacks that can be linked as a combo for different effects, and there's a lot of leaping and diving to throw into the mix as well. In addition to melee weapons like a sword, a staff, claws, and a scythe, Ryu also has a few ranged weapons as well - shurikens (regular and exploding) and a bow. Finally, Ryu has certain magical abilities like fireballs and cutting winds to attack his enemies with, though their use is limited. His enemies range from ninjas - armed with equipment similar to Ryu's - to demons, large and small.The gameplay is smooth, but fast and unforgiving. Your enemies attack ferociously and without mercy - no fair-play \"one on one\" duels here, your enemies will be doing their absolute utmost to make Ryu die. Human enemies (the ninja) have a wide variety of \"abilities\", for lack of a better word, that differentiate them from other random grunts in other games. The ninjas in Ninja Gaiden can lose limbs (arms or legs) and keep fighting - and this will happen a lot, be assured. Heavily injured enemies will try to grab on to Ryu and detonate their bomb as a last-ditch suicide attempt. Ninja types range from melee combatants with swords and claws to ranged types with bows and magic spells. Even without these skills, it's hard to keep up with their attacks, which require dodging, guarding, evading, and counterattacking to deal with - you can't just wade in and mash the attack buttons and expect to survive. The demons are even harder, being less predictable, depending on their type. Some are small, bat-like creatures that swarm Ryu faster than he can swing his sword, while others are hulking colossi that can grab Ryu and squeeze the life out of his body. There are bosses on every level as well - these enemies are generally much larger than any regular enemy, and their strength makes guarding useless, forcing Ryu to jump and dive for his life. Furthermore, they're not fazed by your attacks, requiring you to time your attacks so that you'll have time to escape before they counterattack. Overall, Ninja Gaiden is a relatively simple game in that it keeps the same basic premise for combat; there aren't really any segments that deviate from the established gameplay.As a whole, the controls are good and also notably responsive. In some other games, you have to adjust your timing to the game and pause between pressing buttons so that the moves you've inputted can be executed. In NG2, the game moves roughly about as fast as you push buttons - if you're smashing the buttons really quickly, then the moves will get executed really quickly. To give an example, Ryu has the ability to walljump between two adjacent parallel walls. At first I thought I had to adjust my timing to wait for when he landed; I quickly realized that I could just mash the A button and ascend as quickly as I tapped. The game really rewards you for having good reflexes, and tries not to hinder you as best it can. The only really annoying parts about the controls are the camera (which is kind of unresponsive at times) and sensitivity with regards to hanging on pipes and running on walls, both of which have to do with the camera (since running on a wall is \"running forward\", if the camera changes it can mess you up mid-run).The graphics in the game are really good looking, though \"realistic\" isn't quite the word that I'd use to describe them. They're clearly fake, but it's on purpose, so even though the characters have flawless, one-tone skin with no wrinkles or anything, it looks good and like it was done on purpose. The in-game graphics are really good, too. Combat is quick and highly cinematic without distracting or detracting from the gameplay experience. The most notable detail is the bodies, which are persistent - kill a bunch of ninjas, and their bodies don't fade (not while onscreen, at least). Furthermore, I never thought I'd think of blood and severed limbs as being \"artistic\", but this game really has the prettiest blood sprays and dead bodies that I can think of. Blood splatters on walls depending on the angle that you cut, and you really get the feeling with this game that you're an absolute ninja murder-machine. One of the more impressive details is the blood that accumulates on your blade - when a fight is over and Ryu stands idle for a few seconds, he whips the blood off the blade (throwing an extra splatter onto the floor) and re-sheathes it.The sound in the game isn't particularly notable, except that the sounds of combat are really well shown - the clangs and screams, in addition with the music, create a mood-setting level of background noises that keep you in the action. The music in general doesn't have any tracks that are particularly good, though.As a whole, Ninja Gaiden 2 is a really fun game to play - one of the first games in a while that really feels like a game and not just an interactive story. Flimsy demon-based story aside, Ninja Gaiden 2 is really just an excuse to kill a bunch of ninjas and demons with fancy moves and look really awesome while doing it. The only real problem is that the game is so hard that it might be intimidating to casual players, but for players with good reflexes and a strong will Ninja Gaiden 2 offers nothing but good, fun gameplay.9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

Space Horror done right!","reviewText":"I absolutely love this game. It is incredibly well made, polished in every aspect and accomplishes what it sets out to do - entertain and scare the living crap out of you. My favorite horror game since Resident Evil 2. It is far better than Bioshock, in my opinion, and beats Condemned hands down, a game I enjoyed immensely.The graphics in this game are exceptional. From the dark and macabre art style to the detail and crispness of the visuals, you will be in awe at what you see as well as thoroughly grossed out. The game is dark (it IS a survival horror after all) and it takes place in a Space Station but rarely do the visuals get repetitive. It is an adventure for your eyes all the way through and the sights to behold get more impressive as the game progresses. You have to see it for yourself.The main character, Isaac, looks fantastic and his upgradeable suit makes feel like a complete badass until some creature tears you half. The animations are very well done and Isaac labors around in his heavy suit just as you would expect him to. It looks so convincing you might feel yourself getting an asthma attack if you're not already suffering from a panic attack thanks to the games surreal atmosphere. The creatures you face are equally as detailed as Isaac and move just as fluid. They look like something out of your worst nightmares and most likely will be in your next nightmare. Shooting off legs and arms looks as grisly as it sounds and there is nothing quite like shooting off the leg of a creature only to have it clawing its way toward you at an increasing pace while you frantically reload. The creatures you face have a decent range in variety but a few more types would have been perfect. The ones we do have are well thought out and must be combated differently from one another. The mini bosses and bosses you come across are jaw dropping. Fighting them is intimidating and intense while defeating them leaves you with a pure sense of accomplishment. Do not be surprised if you are gasping for breath afterwards. This game just looks stunning and that is only part of what makes it such a memorable experience.The sound equals the graphics in quality and pulls no punches when it comes to creeping you the hell out. You will be tense and under constant duress thanks to the ominous noises you hear while making your way through the bleak, massive mining ship. The music is great, a classical score which sets the mood perfectly. The grunts and groans of Isaac are convincing when he gets hit, you can just feel his pain and terror. The shrieks, hisses, growls and howls of the creatures will send shivers up and down your spine and cause tightness in your chest. Some of the creatures make noises I can't even describe, all I can say is they sound inhuman and demonic. You will hear these creatures scurrying about in the vents above and around you, waiting to strike or you will hear something massive off in the distance in the direction you are heading. The sound in this game, particularly if you have surround sound or a surround sound headset (I use Tritton AxPros), will fill you with dread while the graphics finish off the deadly one-two combo leaving you begging for mercy. No movie and no novel can get to me the way Dead Space has. To top it off, the voice acting in this game is as high in quality as an animated feature film. The potency of the graphics and sound created such a disturbing atmosphere that I felt like a kid watching Halloween or The Exorcist for the first time. I loved it.This is not a movie or book though, it is a game, and the most important part of a game is the gameplay. Once again, Dead Space does not disappoint. The controls are tight, responsive and intuitive. Never was my experience compromised because of unresponsive or whacky controls. You and Isaac will move through the ship as one. Now some may think Isaac moves around too sluggish for their tastes, he is wearing a heavy space suit after all, but his slow movement actually adds to the tension and immersion of the game. It seems every aspect of this game was thought out and pre planned a head of time to provide you with the ultimate experience. The only slight gripe I have when it coems to his controls is that the melee seems a little too sensitive. Sometimes I just want to hit a creature once, to knock it back, but because I am a little freaked out I might tremble a bit and ever so slightly hit the button a second time causing Isaac to immediately melee a second time, backhanded. This leaves me open for an enemy to strike. A minor gripe in what are otherwise near flawless controls.The game is essentially a corridor based survival. You will go from room to room and blood soaked hallway to blood soaked hallway. Thanks to the graphics and sound all of this sucks you right in but the gameplay mixes up your experience very well. I don't want to spoil anything so I will keep this brief but you do more than just walk around a \"haunted\" spaceship being scared and killing bad guys. You will find yourself in zero gravity situations, spacewalking where you must watch your oxygen level, shooting a turret like Luke Skywalker and Han Solo on the Millenium Falcon and even spending some time at a shooting range or playing a futuristic game called Z-ball. You will also find yourself in massive rooms with gorgeous views of an asteroid field and other sights and in thundering, fiery engine rooms which will make you sweat. Now I don't want to spoil anything so I can't go into too much detail but trust me, the game keeps you in interesting situations and surroundings right up to the very end. It does not let up.You also have abilities (powers) such as Stasis which freezes your enemies as well as objects (for solving puzzles) and Kineses where you can control objects telekinetically. These abilites are a godsend and work great with the weapons for combat and are used in some interesting puzzle solving situations as well. The weapons in Dead Space can get pretty creative and go well beyond your standard pulse rifle (in the game) and flamethrower (in the game). My personal favorite was the Line Gun which shot out a laser like beam horizontally; perfect for severing both legs at one time. This weapon had a secondary fire where it fired a timed proximity plasma mine and it worked beautifully. All the weapons have a secondary fire.The pacing of the game is very well done. All survival horror games start off scary and then lose their steam as time goes on. The same does happen with Dead Space as you get used to the game world but the game manages to evolve its gameplay very well to keep you interested. You will always be creeped out thanks to the graphics and sound but as you progress through the game you will find yourself more involved with the upgrading of your equipment, advancing the storyline and exploring new areas. The game goes from pure horror to action horror to thriller and then back to horror again. It does a real good job keeping you interested and satisfied and always has one more scare to make you jump and keeps your heart rate a few beats above normal. The pacing of the game is very well done other than a slight slow period around the middle of the game, but then it's back to burning on all cylinders again. The end is fantastic and unlike most games does not feel rushed at all. The ending is perfect climax to a wonderful game.Obviously I loved this game. It is such high quality that it may sound like I think it is perfect. well no game is perfect and there are areas I think Dead space could have been better in. As few as they are, I'll just list them briefly:- The creatures aren't as dynamic as I would like. They crawl through the vents, this is how they get around the ship and get to you. The problem is they only do this in unexplored areas or areas that story has lead you to. If you go back to an area you have already cleared out just to get a health pack you didn't have room for in your inventory last time you visited, nothing will attack you or follow you there. Now I don't need to be constantly harassed because this would make the game tedious but no area should ever feel \"safe\" just because I have been there before. Once in a while I should have heard some clanging in the vents as something was coming for me. Makes the times you will be attacked less predictable.- I already mentioned the sensitive melee button. Not a big deal but a slight gripe.- A couple of the middle chapters were slow moving but all in all the game was a complete rush.- The story is somewhat generic, with an alien infection plot line, blah blah. The storytelling however is very well done however. Very few cutscenes and everything done in real time. I just wish horror games would go back to using the supernatural and forget all this infection stuff.In Conclusion:Everything about this game oozes quality and production value. When I first heard of Dead Space several months ago I was interested. I desperately wanted a good survival horror game based in space. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected Dead Space to not only meet my expectations but surpass them completely. There is no multiplayer here, no coop and no established license for the game to fall back on. Dead Space stands on its own two feet as an exceptionally well made single player experience which keeps you captivated until the very end. When it is all over (it took me over 20 hours to beat it on hard mode) you will find yourself watching the credits until the very end because you will appreciate the effort that much. At least that is what I did.I couldn't recommend this game more. My letter grade for Dead Space would be an A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2009"}

The guns and ammo are plentiful enough usually you will be out of ammo or close to after you have cleared the area. I like the fact that you can cancel your grenade throw instead of wasting it when the foes are gone.The story is where you buy the game. It  has a very good Apocalypse Now, Heart of Darkness. There are multiple endings one is far better then the other and there are multiple endings to one of the multiple endings, say that five times fast. You lead a team to search and rescue the US army battalion that tried to save the city from a horrific sand storm. The lead character Captain Walker goes insane as he searches for the leader of the army battalion. The story line was dark with a lot of mess up scenes. The ending really made me appreciate some of the stuff the game put me through. And spoiler white phosphorous.It had an ok multiplayer but the community wasn't there. Its one of the few games that I found all that collectibles. The intel you find delves deeper into the minds of the characters with audio logs and personal opinions of picked up items. Its definitely not a 60 dollar purchase its about 40 or 30 now and that seems more appropriate. For those looking at a different take on the modern shooter this was surprisingly good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000GEDN5E","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Fantastic Gameplay Makes This a Winner!","reviewText":"It's obvious what the Wii's intentions are.  Gameplay.  If you want a game that truly takes advantage of what the Wii can really do, then you owe it to yourself to play Rayman Raving Rabbids.The game begins with Rayman having a picnic with his friends.  Things suddenly go awry when the Rabbids attack and kidnap Rayman and his friends.  As Rayman, your job is to entertain these Rabbids by doing a series of mini-games.  In the process you'll gain unprecedented accolades, and even a means of escaping your imprisonment.The game is broken up into days.  Fifteen days, and each of them is chock full of mini games.  It follows a simple pattern.  At the start of each day you can choose between four mini-games.  You only need to complete three to move on to the big game, but if you want to experience all that Rayman has to offer, you'll do all of them.The mini-games themselves are outrageous.  Again, it makes full use of the Wii's controls.  In one game, for example, you'll have to move the nunchuck and remote to make Rayman run so that he'll be able to get rid of an exploding package in time.  In another game you'll have to use the remote to shave sheep.  Not every game requires the nunchuck, but every game requires the remote.  Some games are quite the challenge, but for the most part they're not bad games.  That's not to say every mini-game in Rayman is great.  Some are far too troublesome, such as the one where you must reunite a piglet with its mother, or the jump rope game where the sensitivity controls just don't respond all the time.Part of what makes some of these games good, however, is that none of them are by any means difficult to learn.  Before each game begins you're given a set of directions and there's even a diagram to show you how it's done.  Even if you mess up, you get as many tries as you want.Whenever you complete three of the four mini games availible in a single day, you can then take on a somewhat \"boss\" level.  This level is usually either a first person shooter on rails (similar to Time Crisis) or a race.  The shooter levels are definitely more fun, seeing as how you must use the wii remote to aim and shoot.As you progress through the game, you'll not only get plunger trophies, but you'll also unlock different music soundtracks, costumes and you'll even notice that your cell changes as you go through the game.Perhaps the problem with the story mode campaign is that eventually all the mini games become rehashes of older mini-games.  You'll play through some of the mini-games several times, and with the exception of an increase in difficulty, the experience is no different than it was before.  At some points the lack in variety of games is daunting.  Enough to the point where going through the story mode again is more of a chore than excitement.  However, once you complete a mini-game you can play it again any time you want while you're in your cell.The multiplayer aspect of the game isn't as fantastic as the single player, however.  It's fun to play some of these games with your friends, but you'll usually end up taking turns rather than actually competing against one another.  Most of the rules for multiplayer games are also not explained in enough detail.  However, at least in the games where you do experience split screen action, it's fun.  Still, the multiplayer could've been done far better, and expanded so much more.  It's still fun to play with a friend, just not as rewarding as it could be.As far as visuals go, Raving Rabbids is pretty to look at.  In all honesty it looks no different than a Gamecube game, but that doesn't mean it looks bad at all.  There are a few moments of slow down, and moments where certain parts of Rayman look clipped (like his hand going through his hat during a victory dance), but the game looks good.The true treat of the games presentation, though, comes from the sheer hilarity of the game.  The Rabbids will keep you doubled over laughing all the time.  Their screams and actions (even their insane look) is just all out hilarious, not to mention (in some bizarre way) cute.The game does indeed sound good as well.  The music definitely gives you the feel of a party game.  Also, there are some mini games where Rayman must be a DJ and these mini games play some good music such as \"Good Time\" and \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\"Rayman: Raving Rabbids is a brilliant game.  For parties, it keeps your friends and family entertained.  It's comical, takes advantage of the wii remote and nunchuck, and some of the games are so much fun you'll feel compelled to play them again.  Overall, the game is nothing short of fantastic.  It has it's small little gripes, but for the most part should please just about any Wii owner.The Good+Absolute fun!  Mini games are creative and some are addictive+The game completely takes advantage of the Wii's motion sensor controls+Hilarious just to watch+Pretty to look at+Quite a few unlockables+None of these mini games are insanely difficult to learn at all, anyone can pick up and go+The Rabbids are just hilarious, no matter how you look at itThe Bad-Some mini-games are just too short-The games begin to repeat themselves too soon-While there's multiplayer, so much more could've been done with it than what we got","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"I Haz Ps3 And X Bawks And PC","summary":"A quality review from an impressed player!","reviewText":"This is one of the few games that I can say is a masterpiece. I actually didn't go into this game expecting to love it so much, or to even get halfway through it. But I did, and boy am I glad! It's as close to perfect as games can get. Sure the multiplayer and pvp isn't perfect yet, but with more people to try it out, more fixes are to come. I have a lot of awesome ps3 games. In fact, I have over 60 ps3 games, most of which I really like. But this game is definitely in my top 3, along with Bioshock and Borderlands. The world of Dark Souls is vast and atmospheric, and filled with a variety of items, enemies, and challenges. I'll break down my review:GRAPHICS/APPEARANCE: The graphics are sharp and detailed. For an RPG, they are unbelievable. Having sharp graphics is one thing, but creating an ominous thought-provoking world is another. Dark Souls completely succeeded in drawing me into the world and becoming a part of it and the lore it contains. The world feels so real and empty. For some people it may be depressing, but to me it was so mysterious my thoughts wandered and I could think up whatever I wanted to be the story behind an area. Also, Anor Londo is by far the most impressive city I think I've ever seen in a video game. Just wow. When I entered the city I sat and stared for 5-10 minutes. Also, I remember when I first got to the Ash Lake, I was so taken aback. I couldn't believe that I had just spent 20 minutes working my way down the inside of a giant hollowed out tree, to come out in this deep-down sand bar in the middle of a seemingly endless swamp filled with literally thousands of those large trees. The scale of this game is tremendous. Long story short, yes the graphics are sharp and detailed and yes you feel like you're a part of the world.GAMEPLAY/CONTROLS: This game has superb controls. I don't know how people could complain about them. Each weapon has its own set of moves and animations, all of which are great. In the right hands this game could be played without any grinding or dieing. The controls take a little skill to master, but not too much. The gameplay is solid. I loved the perry system and the back stab system. Occasionally enemies get stuck or just charge you, but it's not an issue. The combat is amazing, it feels very inclusive, like you are the character. You will NEED to black a LOT and learn how to get around the enemies and manage your shield. The combat is a lot better than in Skyrim, if that's what you'd like a comparison to. The one flaw in the controls, is that the locking system is broken. It was fine in Demon's Souls, so I have no idea how they broke it (lol) but you get used to switching enemies the longer way. It's not anything more than an occasional pest.SOUND: Normally I could care less about sound, but the sound effects are top notch. The soundtrack is stereotypical for this type of game, but very well done.LENGTH/SIDE STUFF: There aren't 'quests' but there are side covenants and all kinds of hidden passages and goodies to find. Each 'rescued' NPC shows up in several locations and has a story to follow. Also, there are some NPCs with dialogue-affected paths. The game took me almost 70 hours, including lots of dieing, farming, and some preparing for NG+.STORY/CHARACTERS: The characters are.... well flat. The world is so ominous and mysterious that all you really need to do is get the jist of the story, and the rest is up to you to decide. Personally I loved this. It sounds corny, like when your parents would tell you to entertain yourself or use your imagination, but the game is really better off allowing you to believe what you want. The story is there, you just need to find it and think about it. The game doesn't hold your hand while some british female narrator spoon feeds you mouthfuls of the story. You will need to pay close attention. Back to the characters, they all have a back story, and most are important. Again, you'll need to pay attention. For example, one of the characters is an assassin. See if you can find out which one. For the most part, if you're looking for a game with detailed characters and an in-depth story, this isn't it. This game is supposed to have a thought-provoking story.LEVELING/CUSTOMIZATION: This is a key part of Demon's Souls. You don't have to have the beast armor or weapons. You don't need all the spells or levels. It's totally up to you. Farming souls and leveling up your intelligence will sure help on bosses weak to fire or easily killed by soul arrow attacks from a distance. Maybe you like the slow moving character who wields a desk-sized greatsword; then you would probably level up your resistance, strength, and (I forgot the actual name) stamina. It's up to you. The leveling system doesn't punish you for choosing one thing. Maybe one minute you're lighting up all your enemies with great combustion and fire orb spells and the next you've switched to your Havel's Armor and Black Knight Greatsword to beat some skeletons to a pulp. You never are forced to specialize in only a few things. You can be everything. Also, the weapon-upgrade system is very intricate and requires the collection of souls, a variety of titanite, and embers dependent on the blacksmith.DIFFICULTY: I can't stand seeing people put this game down because of it's difficulty. That's like saying you don't like Assassin's Creed because it has too much climbing. The game is advertized as an intense and difficult game! It WILL frustrate you. Those people online who can beat bosses without healing and without armor are crazy! This is the only game they play, and they play it too much. Don't feel bad about needing help on parts or being stuck. It will happen. In Dark Souls, you learn quickly that if something isn't working the first time, chances are it won't work the second or third. You need to use strategy, especially on bosses. The first boss had me stuck, until I tried using the gold pine resin I found on my right hand weapon. I beat it the first try doing that. The game requires some patience, but isn't unfair. The challenge makes you feel very rewarded after beating a section.ONLINE: I don't do too much PVP or anything, but I really like the system of messages. You can leave as many as you want on the ground. Also, people leave messages EVERYWHERE to help you. It's really useful. The invading can be annoying and can be fun, depending on the conditions. The summoning of other players for help is extremely helpful for bosses. There is no shame in getting some help on a boss. *cough* Ornstein and Smough *cough*VARIETY: A quick note, this game really does something I LOVE in games. It keeps things fresh. You aren't in castles the whole game. The areas are always changing dramatically and so are the enemies. That's something I hated about Crysis 2! The enemies NEVER changed. But in Dark Souls they always change it up. The only repeats of enemies are very slight and usually important.I never expected this game to be SO great, but it is. I am taking a break for now, but I see myself playing in New Game+ this summer. I cannot recommend this game enough to anybody. Casual gamers, hardcore gamers, RPG lovers, etc. The one thing I must suggest is that you learn a bit about the game. I don't want to make a guide here, so I'll put a quick list of things that will be easy to learn by searching. They are all VERY important.-HUMANITY: I wish I knew what it did, aside from heal me, earlier on.-PERRY/BACKSTAB: Look it up.-Sliding down ladders. Hold the circle or B button.-Use wikis! There is no shame! Or at least skim through one before playing a level. It will help a LOT!-Weapon Upgrades and Armor Upgrades: You need this if you are not extremely advanced at these type of games.-DO NOT USE THE DRAKE SWORD AT ALL: You get attached to it but I promise once you get to Sen's Fortress it's useless. Don't even get it or you will get to fond of it like I did. I finally got rid of it though.-USE HELP ON BOSSES: You can summon players, so I suggest you do it.-Where to find NPCs and hidden locations: For those of you who like Achievements/Trophies-Leave and Rate Messages. It helps the community.-Farm souls for levels early on. It will put you on the correct track.-Understand the menus and what things mean like the markings on armor and weapons.-Switch it up, don't always use the same armor, spells, weapon, and shield-Strategy-Learn what being cursed is, because it sucks. A lot.-Do not kill any NPCs. Just don't. They can all help you here or there. Maybe kill them in NG+.Oh and my only complaints with the game are:-Blighttown: You'll find out when you get there. Or just google it. Ick!-The Dinosaur things in Lost Izalith. Unfair and made me rage more than anything else.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}

This game however takes beyond just simply being a remake and has changed into its own exclusive title for the wii system.Immediately from the start the player is plunged into an active environment. No long tutorials or reading here, it's all about experimentation. Earlier levels have signs to help players figure out the game.The Animation: Smooth, crisp,clean and drawn in an almost fairy-tale like world. Don't be fooled by the cover into thinking \"A Boy and His Blob\" is another shovelware wii title or a game that only younger people can enjoy, this game can be played by anyone who likes puzzles, casual gaming, or played the NES game. The graphics present a time-telling story that can be related to the newest Disney title \"The Princess and the Frog\". Modern mechanisms used such as ominous gray skies in the swamp area, or the sweet soft glow of light peeking through the darken corners of a sleeping forest. I love how after the first boss battle the boy's silhouette emerges from the dark with only the moon and city lights to guide him to his next hideout. The characters are also hand-drawn in 2D glory, an effect that we haven't seen in awhile since the days of \"Monkey Island\".Music: Relaxing most of the time depending on what stage the boy is on. It doesn't loop and offers a change of pace from time to time. Sound effects are quirky improvised. One area includes where you can hear the boys shoes squishing against the ground, or the 'kerplunk' of a bad blob.Control-wise: Game runs pretty smoothly. There has been one or two mishaps however, where the blob ends up getting itself stuck in a tight area and hugged a wall until it turned red in an almost glitch-like state. Another is the bean projectile can be sensitive in these areas, even when the projectile is pointing a certain way the beans can still end up being stuck or blocked by an object when they were suppose to go bounce over it.The Wii Remote isn't the star but the secondary control in this game. The Nunchuck is used to move the boy and give beans while the remote is the a/b/home buttons. It's an easy interface use of control scheme with only the D-Pad, Numchuck, A/B, 1 and - buttons used throughout the game.Gameplay: From Pear Parachute to Apple Jack the blob is allowed up to 4/6 slots(depending on stage) of jellybeans . Unfortunately these beans are pre-picked, meaning that I wouldn't be able to use the Pear Parachute to experiment if the bean isn't available. Aside from that certain beans perform certain actions. Pear Parachute carries the boy down safely out of a fall to the Apple Jack, which can lift up enemies and squish them on the ceilings! Since this is a puzzle game there is thinking involved how to survive and progress in the different areas. Things won't go as 'smoothly' as there are different enemies that roam the maps that require thinking and wittiness and a quick hand, some blocking the very exits to beat the level. Some of them stay in one area and float, others wait to eat beans, others spit out blobs and some wait to charge. There is a boss on each map that requires strategy and timing to be successful. The only things that can be negative about this game is time waiting for the loading screens to finish(10 seconds at most, the sensitivity of bean-tossing in tight areas, and the boy's yelps/commands(Not as annoying as they were in the previews though. On the flip side the boy is alert to the danger in his surroundings which gives the reason why he's demanding sometimes)Over All Review:Graphics :8/10Sound :7/10Gameplay:9/10Control: 8/10Pros:-Fabulous Graphics-Remake of an Nes Game-Ease of controller-Fixes the blobs ultra slowness that was in the original.-Bonus Content, Extra Stages, Boss Battles, yippee!-Good Sound Effects/MusicCons:-Loading Screens are about 10 seconds long for every map-Projectile needs both accuracy, timing, and the right footing in certain areas to work. Trial and Error.-Boy calls blob for every action (\"Hey, Look,Listen!\" sound familiar?)-Some Mushy scenes with the blob-Death animation is the same except for water.Total: 8/10This Wii edition of a Boy and his Blob has toned down the insane difficulty of the Nes version and made it into something fun. No more of the boy coming to a running stop and meeting his doom, or bouncing off the trampoline too high just to hit the ground and bounce up again dead. A total upgrade on sounds and graphics along with new bean editions, bad-looking bosses and hidden content, this little game is a game that can bring back fond childhood memories.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX9VO","description":"","reviewerName":"Chuck Bittner \"Disabled comedian & gamer!\"","summary":"Borderlands 2 will be game of the year and Gearbox is awesome!","reviewText":"I'm going to break this review into 2 sections the 1st will be geared towards those who have never played the original Borderlands before and part 2 will be geared toward veteran Vault hunters. So let's do this thing!Before I begin I want to say that I think Gearbox has the game of the year with Borderlands 2 in the bag. Gearbox is a company/developer stands in a league of their own. I have so much admiration for them and what they set out to do with this game. I appreciate them because they added full button remapping and toggle aim down sight to this game. As a disabled gamer (I play with my face and cannot use my fingers) remapping and toggling down sight means the world to disabled gamers. That should be noted that the original Borderlands had neither of these features and I was still able to beat it 12 to 15 times and I loved every minute of it. If you have not played the original Borderlands do yourself a favor buy it now.For information on the button remapping petition search this on YouTube: Dn7IagvPCFYPart 1: To the new Vault Hunter - get your gear!If you're somebody who did not play the original Borderlands this part of the review is for you. Borderlands 2 Is a first-person shooter/RPG game that has countless hours of replayability. The basic idea is you control 1 of 4 playable characters ( they will add more through DLC which is awesome) and your mission is to stop the antagonist Handsom Jack.Let's talk about loot and loot and more loot! One of the key features of Borderlands 1 and 2 is its random gun and gear generation (Borderlands 1 did not have random gear generation but it's gun generation was revolutionary). Basically every gun you find the Borderlands is unique and different from every other gun when they say 87 bazillion they are not joking. And you will find that spending hours looking for a different and more powerful gun is super amounts of fun. It truly is a great feeling when you find a legendary weapon that no one else has ever had. And a Borderland 2 the grenades are even randomly generated and highly different from one another.As you play through the game you gain experience points for getting kills and completing mission objectives and this XP allows you to reach new levels with your character. The cool thing about reaching new levels is you unlock skill points that can be used to change your character's abilities. And each character has a different action skill that you can use throughout the game that really makes each character play completely differently from one another making each play through with each character a different challenge and experience. But I will tell you personally the action skills and skill trees (where you spend your skill points and modifier character) are where this game shines I've spent many hours thinking about maybe moving a few skill points from one skill of my character to another because for my play style. The skill trees & skill points need to be used wisely.Another thing that Borderlands 2 as going for is the 4 player co-op. Basically your friends can join you and play through any of the missions together it truly is great to be able have a friend just jump in your game ( you do have to agree that they can join your game) and help you out on your missions and level up with you. It was one of the strongest features from the original borderlands that I enjoyed. The 4 player co-op and down adds to the replayability of this game.It is been reported that the game takes 40 to 60 hours to complete I'll be back whenever I have my solid take on a number but there are over 100 side missions that range from difficult to completely hilarious. Side missions do not need to be completed to finish the game but they are so worth doing so much fun and so hilarious. And even the in game non-playable characters are all truly amazing funny clever witty you find yourself wanting to find ways to interact with them more and more as you play the game.And the one thing I think is most important about the Borderland series is a gearbox is such a clever and brilliant company. This game has humor that's in your face and also super subtle. They may also movie references via quotes or in game posters and signs. It's just an awesome game and the humor is top-notch.So if you've never played the original Borderlands can you play Borderlands 2 and not be lost in the story? The answer is yes and you will find it is still super enjoyable. But with that being said I do recommend you go back and play the original because it is a masterpiece in its own right. So yes that is for all the new vault hunters among us.Part 2: To the Bad Ass Valut huntersJust go buy it... I mean seriously if you have ventured through the world that is Pandora You need to go buy this game right now. I mean the things you loved from BL1 are here and a ton new stuff - random gear generation has been added along with an even more beefed-up random gun generation engine. The 4 player co-op is better now and you won't get stuck with missions that maybe got screwed up because you are online with somebody and you didn't finish it. They'll be adding downloadable characters with completely unique skill trees. The bad ass rank system now rewards you for the hours you spend playing with buffs that help your character.I'll be back with more as I get deeper into the game. I hope you've enjoyed reading this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

Cadieux","summary":"Review of single-player campaign only","reviewText":"I'm not one for co-op or competitive online play, so if you're looking for information about that, this is not a review for you.  I'll be reviewing the single-player campaign only.I liked this game overall, but it does have some flaws.  The one that is most obvious is that the final boss battle is terrible!  As in, awful, easy, boring, sucks!  I beat it on the first try, and it was pretty unsatisfying.  The final battle in the original Resistance was much more challenging and more interesting.  Actually, the final battle in nearly ANY game is much more challenging and much more interesting.  Take off one star for bad final battle.A more subtle flaw for me is that the game requires a lot of trial-and-error.  Many times the only way to get through is to die a few times until you learn where the enemies are going to come out from.  It's not challenge and doesn't require skill, it's just memorisation and learning their patterns.  I don't like that, and I also noticed it in the first Resistance game.  There's one type of enemy that (almost literally) comes out of nowhere and one-shot kills you.  I found this enemy type to detract from the game and wish they had just removed it.  It isn't fun, it's just cheap.With that out of the way, it is a solid game overall.  I liked the weapons, it has good production values, and definitely has some intense moments.  If you only plan to play the single-player campaign like me, then I think it is an average value at the Greatest Hits price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2011"}

I am a huge fan of the original Rayman that was released for the Playstation, but I haven't actually enjoyed the series since. Rayman 2 just didn't click for me. I took one look at Raving Rabids and thought I would never play the series again. Then, when Rayman Origins came out, I thought there might be a chance for me to get back into the Rayman universe. Unfortunatley I didn't like the art style of the characters, and the gameplay in the demo was really boring to me. Fast forward to now...and Rayman Legends is what I've been waiting for since the original Rayman.Rayman origins looked kind of like a Ren and Stimpy episode with beautiful animated backgrounds done with Flash animation. Rayman Legends looks like a modern side-scroller should look. The background artwork has been seriously kicked up a notch, and everything has a more 3D effect. It's a bit like some of the better animated films that have 3D and 2D combined, giving us a gorgeous side-scrolling animated world that seems like a living, breathing place. How good is it? It's better than Castle of Illusion HD, better than Outland, better and Shadow Complex. It just MIGHT be the most beautiful side scroller ever made. True, it feels a lot like a downloadable game on Xbox Live, but I doubt any Xbox Live downloadable side-scroller would have quite this much polish put into it.Where what I played of Rayman Origins felt kind of bland and forgettable, this game sucks you in and begs you to progress just a little further. It is incredibly easy to pickup and play, and amazingly fun, inventive, and addictive.This is the game I've been waiting for. A light-hearted 2D platformer with Triple-A polish. Highly recommended to anyone who likes side-scrollers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

This is easily the best western game ever produced, and Rockstar has done an outstanding job.

This is a boon, considering that a large portion of the gaming community will instantly be familiar with motions.There is so much to do and explore in this world. It's value for replayability is great! I've noticed some negative reviews, BUT I have yet to see any valid reasons why this is not a good game (unless it's style/genre isn't your cup of tea). It has an interesting narrative, hours and hours of playtime, good graphics, great details and lots of fun things aside from the main plot. It may handle like GTA IV, but button control does not make it the same game. A point of gripe seemed to be other games have had better graphics. This game is massive and to expect highly polished graphics is unrealistic.So if you don't like this game, snap into a slim jim and get back to playing Ratchet & Clank.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

We have some information and some short clips where players can see all three characters in action.","reviewerName":"Cute Chihuahua","summary":"One of the best Wii games, very fun but additional characters are very costly","reviewText":"After watching my Son play Skylanders for several weeks and then playing it for myself I really think it's one of the best Wii games out right now. We own both a Wii and a PlayStation 3 and I normally don't play the Wii much nor does my Son. However this game is a lot of fun and got me back into the Wii. The levels remind me of a Jack and Daxter type of game and my Son and I both like it a lot. This starter pack comes with the game, portal or power and three Skylanders. Each Skylander has its own special attack powers. For example Spryro can breathe fire, fly and does a belly smash. As you play through the game you will earn coins and gems that can be used to purchase new upgrades at the store. The fact that you can change characters and constantly upgrade keeps the game interesting. You place the Skylander onto the Portal of Power to switch characters in the game. This starter pack comes with three Skylanders. Spyro, Gill Grunt and Trigger Happy. All three are cool characters but you can purchase many other characters. My son would like to own all the characters but the coast of purchasing the additional characters is extremely high. The cost is so high in fact that to purchase this starter pack along with all of the other characters then you would be spending many times the coat of the game. I find that very unreasonable to say the least. We let my Son purchase a few additional characters but we had to stop at that point. If you only get the starter pack then I think it's fairly priced but they get you when you purchase additional characters. I am not knocking the game because it's great but I would like to see the cost of additional characters come down substantially.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000WCE9XK","description":"Uncover all the mysteries of Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword as you fight enemy ninjas and battle various fiends while taking on the role of Master Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, in an all new storyline for the Nintendo DS.","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"Excellent addition to the franchise","reviewText":"The basics:Is this game fun:  Incredibly.How do the Stylus controls work: Generally very well.Is this game a recommended purchase:  Highly at the now greatly discounted price.Ninja gaiden DS is set 6 months after the events of Ninja Gaiden  and the story continuity is a welcome feature.  Though, if you've never played the original xbox game or its subsequent editions (Black, Sigma) you are really not at a significant loss.  This game is basically an intelligent hack and slash actioner and story is an added bonus.As other reviewers have noted, production values are top notch.  The graphics of this game has been rightly acknoledged with being some of the best on the DS.  They look fantastic with only the large bosses looking blocky.  Music is excellent and appropriate with the only downside being the virtually non-existent recorded voice work.  Couldn't we at least have some for cut scenes?  Oh well, not a huge disappointment.Controlling Ryu is accomplished with the stylus and generally this is well executed.  Ryu has quite a few combos and new ones can be bought with souls (?) that are collected as you progress as well as upgrading your magic and your sword (Dragon Sword, DS, get it? :) ).  A few complication can arise due to map layouts as you are sometime deep into the foreground where combos and actions are harder for the the DS to decipher as Ryu is quite small during these situations.  Again, mostly a minor nitpick.Additionally, Ninja Gaiden games can be known for their \"challenging\" difficulty.  NG Black was supposedly especially difficult and the PS3 remake contained an unlockable easy difficulty if you died enough times, which the game mocked you for choosing.  IMO, that easy difficulty was the right one making Sigma a joy to play.  NG DS falls into about the same difficulty as the Sigma easy (ninja dog) difficulty - it isn't a cake walk but it isn't as challenging as the main series by far.My only other nitpick is the game's length.  I logged approximately 7.5 hrs into the game including looking for extras and playing optional \"challenge rooms\".  The main story could probably be finished in much less time if someone was speeding through the campaign.  Replay incentives are there for the person looking to collect all extras AND is interested in playing a more difficult level.  This is because extras can only be fully gathered by playing the \"hard\" difficulty, something that doesn't interest me.So minor issues aside, I had a blast with this game.  It features excellent graphics and great hack 'n slash action with functionable stylus controls.  For anyone who is a fan of the genre this is a highly recommend. Additionally now that this game can easily be found with a greatly discounted price, it is easy to forginve any shortcoming in length and makes this an easy recommend for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Kratos Meets Link","reviewText":"First of all, let me say I do not own this game. I rented it. That said, I will most likely buy this in the coming days, it is that good. The reason I rented it is because I, like most people, read lots of negative reviews concerning the screen tearing on the Xbox 360 version. Well, after playing it for a bit, I can say that there is no visible tearing from what I can tell. If there is any, I cannot tell and it doesn't affect gameplay at all. OK, now on to the actual game review...What would happen if Kratos and Link had a love child? Well you would get something very close to Darksiders. This is a game that truly appeals to gamers, (like myself), who were longing for another console Zelda. Well knowing Nintendo, this very well may be the best Zelda we get. The graphics are awesome, not cartoony like some other games... The game is very dark, a lot like God of War, which is good considering we Xboxers can't play GoW. Another aspect I really like is the puzzles, and the simple combat. To use a cliche, the combat system is easy to learn, but hard to master. OK, being a 21 year old male, I must say that the amount of blood and gore is perfect! Instead of just continuing to kill the enemy, if you press B at the right time, War will rip the enemy apart and/or decapitate it, with blood gushing. All of this is displayed awesomely and in slow motion.Bottom line: If you are fans of Zelda, GoW, Prince of Persia or other similar games, then buy this immediately. If you want to see for yourself without dropping the cash, rent it from GameFly. If you like it, then you can keep it for $42.99, the same price as Amazon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2010"}

Morales","summary":"INCREDIBLE, MUST BUY GAME!","reviewText":"This is indeed the SCARIEST game I've ever played, and I don't get scared easily by things like video games or movies. This is indeed right up there with Resident Evil as one of the best survival games ever created.In SH2 you control a man named James Sunderland, who's wife Mary died three years ago but yet he recieves a mysterious letter from her telling him to come back to Silent Hill. Once you arrive there it's up to you to explore the town and find out who sent the letter, why, and the truth about Mary Sunderland. The graphics in this game are a kind of grainy but it looks like it was done on purpose to give the game that horror feel, even though other effects like fog, lighting and shadow were done with flawless precision. The music is excellent, and the enemies are creative. What I also liked about this game is the replay value, b/c on top of the Sunderland story,  you can also play as a character in the game named Maria in a sub-scenario. There are also multiple endings depending on how you go about things and various difficulty levels. I've honestly never felt more hooked to a game simply b/c I wanted to know how it all ended, the story is incredibly gripping. The best thing about this though is the detail put into this huge town, even the most pointless of rooms are made with such precision detail. In most games like Resident evil you don't really get to go outside and are pretty much trapped in one area, in SH2 the town is  yours for the exploring and things like cars,traffic lights, stores, etc are all there. It's just amazing how much work went into creating the town.Even though I gave the game 5 stars b/c it truly deserves it, the game isn't perfect. The #1 factor I had a problem with was the controls. They are nowhere near as crisp and responsive as those in Resident evil and were overall a little sloppy but tolerable. The other down factor is the voice acting, although I have heard A LOT worse (i.e. Resident Evil 1), and it seems as though they do try hard, it comes off a little unbelievable and cheesy, they almost make the character look stupid. A third (and I'm kind of stretching it here) is the weapons and fighting scenarios. Your basic weapon is a hand gun, and most enemies (except for the bosses) can be defeated with this easy, giving things like the hunting rifle, shotgun, and huge blade no real fun factor, it's also very hard to run low on ammo and health kits, giving the game grade D on challenge.These are minor hindrences, and don't effect the game hugely at all on a whole, it's still very fun and will have you picking up the controller again and again. To any fan of action/adventure game...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6Q8","description":"","reviewerName":"D","summary":"If you can look pass the \"disc locked Content\" its a great fighting game","reviewText":"Street Fighter X Tekken is a great fighting game. Tekken purists may or may not like it, cause this game is suited more towards 2d street fighter gameplay, some tekken fans might find the change as something diffrent and good for once but its aimed more towards street fighter fans as it was made by Capcom. However there's also a sequel in the making that is being aimed at tekken fans that is being made at Namco. Graphics in the game while cartoony (agian street fighter styled)are good maybe not the best and not to much improvement since Street Fighter IV but it keeps the game running fluid. Gameplay is where this game shines as while it is on a 2d plain and has the speed and style of street fighter think Tekken tag tournament when it comes to rules since the tag system is if one person is knocked out your team loses even if the other person is at full health.  They only problem I had with the gameplay was playing online when it first came out it lagged to the point where the game was almost unplayable that way however more recently since its been patched and updated it runs just as smoothly as the single player minus a few sound problems sometimes. My other problem with the game is the \"disc locked content\" that makes you pay $20 for characters already on the disc. While I admit it is a ripoff and should have been free I'm pretty sure its not the first game to do that or pressure you into paying dlc for. Which speaking of characters theres 50+(ps3 version) of them on here and while a few of the characters in the game it could have done without (pacman, megaman) most of them fit very well into the game. Anyway I would recommend this game to any one who likes old school fighting games as this is a very good *street fighter* game and one of my favorites. (my personal faviorte is alpha 3 though)I think some tekken fans might want to rent it first but if you liked both or street fighter I would recomend it since its going down in price fast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

TOOK ME 1000'S OF TRYS BUT I FINALLY BEAT THE LEVEL 4 SLOW MASS DRIVER GUN & ASTEROIDS MINI GAME!","reviewText":"Ok I finally beat DEAD SPACE so by definition I MUST GIVE IT FOUR STARS IN MY REVIEW! Dead Space was a good game. Dead Space was easily the hardest game I have ever played even on its so called EASY MODE! There were some parts of Dead Space on Easy Mode that were in fact pretty easy. However there were areas of Dead Space game play that were so difficult I put the game down for over a year. Unfortunately I hate giving up on anything I like and I LIKED DEAD SPACE. Dead Space was the creepiest game I ever played. Set in the distant future Dead Space was loaded with tired old looking ships that looked as if they lived a hard life even before the necromorphs came calling.Certain parts of Dead Space are much harder than others. I almost threw Dead Space away because; the Mass Driver Cannon Mini Game near the end of chapter four was so hard. The flaw was that you had to successfully beat the Mass Driver Cannon Asteroid shooting game before you could proceed to the next level and complete the main storyline. I found that changing to a TV with a much smaller screen made it easier for me to track and hit the asteroids with this lame slow easily overheated Mass Driver Cannon. Its nice to see that even in the distant future ships are still outfitted with the lamest technology submitted by the lowest bidder for the contract. There are a few other places where Dead Space gets harder notably where you encounter monsters that can not be killed that can too easily kill your character.All in all I found much of the Dead Space game play tedious but there was enough fun to make the hard parts worth it. I hate to say this but having beaten and gotten to the end of Dead Space I like it a little bit more. Dead Space is not a game for people with slow reflexes even on its so called Easy Mode. Dead Space requires lightening fast reflexes and I only just barely managed to survive much of the harder boss battles. However I must say this about the Mass Driver Cannons. There is a second mini game in Dead Space where you kill a creature. I read online that many people had trouble with this second Mass Driver Cannon Mini Game. I did not have much trouble dispatching the monster in the second Mass Driver Cannon Mini Game. The cool thing about the second Mass Driver Mini Game was we started with 100% strength instead of 85% with 100% to start I had more of a cushion between me and failure. Had the Asteroid Mini Cannon started at 100% I am sure I would have won with strong effort.Many Dead Space Boss Battles were just right not too hard on the easy mode but hard enough to make me always mindful that being killed was possible if not likely. I hated the tentacles at first but grew to love them. The Dead Space game was fun but it will remain the hardest game I ever won bar none. Dead Space was the hardest game I ever played but now that I have beat it, I am happy I stuck with it till I won. When the last BOSS Monster died by my cerebral palsied hand I felt a rush of joy and accomplishment nothing else can equal which made Dead Space worth all the trouble and aggravation. Dead Space will test you in so many ways. Dead Space will test your tenacity and patience. I took a star off because even on Easy Mode game play was not consistently easy. If certain parts of a game like Dead Space are painfully hard then the Easy Mode becomes a joke. In Dead Space I took off one star in my review because the Dead Space Easy mode in some parts is so difficult that its entire Easy Mode is a JOKE!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

And there's almost constant frame-ripping (when it looks like there's a tear down the screen because the graphics hardware cant keep up with the frame-rate).  There is some repetition of enemy types but the game will change things up with sub-enemy-types (wolf versus dire wolf) and -- even more fun at later levels -- create swarms of different types of enemies.Otherwise, as console RPG's go this one is surprisingly good.  There's at least some strategy needed in the combat -- you will genuinely need to choose the right weapons for different enemies or you will die.  The game is not nearly as difficult as \"Dark Souls\" as a point of reference, but the combat is certainly more difficult than Skyrim or Mass Effect 3. Difficulty is always subjective but at least in this game I occasionally died when swarmed by enemies and not defending properly.  The key is to be *fully* rested before venturing into any unsafe area.Some things you need to know before buying:There is no quick travel option until later in the game, and even that option is very expensive and limited.  So if you dont like walking around and exploring, this is not the game for you.You can change your character's type (mage warrior or archer) at anytime when you are in the cities.  And you dont lose your progress in your previous role when doing that.  This is a great way of changing things up in the game without having to create a whole new character and starting from the beginning.Like many RPG's, the game doesnt really open up until a full 10 hours into the game.  If you dont have the patience to go thru some of the initial linear quests, then this isnt the game for you.  Eventually you can ignore any of the \"kill X number of enemies\" quests -- they are not essential at later levels.Bottom line?  It is a heck of a lot of fun to head up into the hills and away from the safety of the roads just to see what is up there.

WOW is an appropriate acronym for this game as it simply caters to power games and casual alike.The interface is simply easy to use and colorful.  Playing solo with some of the classes can be a challenge and the skill system tends to be a bit limited, but the amount of explorable area, diverse missions and game design greatly offset any disadvantages.I was amazed at the wonderful job Blizzard did with guiding you from area to area based on your level.  You start out in a low level area and as you progress through levels, the world starts to open up to you.  While it is possible to stray into higher level areas, the missions and layout of the maps keeps you in the areas that are appropriate to your current level.Simply the best MMORPG I have ever played and well worth your money if you're only going to try one of these games.

This model is superior to the other models in many ways, the key one is that it offers HARDWARE based backwards compatibly(It basically has a PS2 inside the PS3) that plays over 99% of games (not 100% like some people will say) The PS3 can also 'upscale' PS1 and PS2 games, on some PS2 games the graphical difference will be very minimal, on other it will be a big step up, On PS1 games it will eliminate a lot of the 'jaggies' that are apparent in a lot of the 3D games.Like I mentioned earlier, The 60&20GB offer 99%BC Only one game in my PS2 collection did not work, that one being Orphen. I have experienced some minor trouble with PS1 games but they are just minor graphical hiccups that don't affect the game in anyway.Good games for the PS3 have been few and far between for awhile, but this years line up seems to be promising for the PS3 (white knight story,Final Fantasy Versus 13-to name a few) However I wish there were more exclusives to the PS3 to justify it higher price (why buy a $400-$500 system with the same games as the $300 system? -c'mon Sony get your act together!)Another cool feature of the PS3 is it allows you to change the HDD yourself (does not void warranty) It uses a laptop HDD and can support the biggest size available at the moment 500GB!!Firmware updates for the PS3 have been somewhat of a nightmare for Sony with the 2.40+ versions, There forum has a lot of upset people who have to pay $150 to get there system fixed because a FW update has crashed there system. My recommendation would be to download the updates to a flash drive and then update the PS3 via the flash drive as people who have been getting crashed all download Via the PS3...Well thats about all I have to say for now, overall this is a very good system although the older 60&20GB models command a much higher price now, I'd say your best alternative would be to get a 80GB BC model it uses software to play the PS2 games witch lets you play 97% of PS2 games (no longer in production but are cheaper than the 60gig model)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2010"}

The playstation is a wonderful system that at first i didnt like but got hooked on since the first Playstation. Naughty Dog and Insomniac, creators of the crash bandicoot, jak and daxter, spyro the dragon and ratchet and clank series, still follow Sony with games that are a must have. The trophy idea is a fun system to try to just collect as many trophies as one can to level up. Fast downloadable which doesn't interfere with gameplay since you can download it on the background. Interestingly enough, the ps3 has printer features which you can connect your printer to the ps3, not sure how, haven't tried it.The slogan \"It only does everything\" is sort of true since it can't play ps2 games but the online accesibility is fast and reliable.The downloadable content is well done, however more games should be added like the call of duty series from the ps2.The fan and noise issues aren't that bad as people suggest. The heat isnt as strong as the xbox360 pro, but havent checked the elite to compare it with.Online gameplay seems cool however some disconnection issues may occur. For online chatting with your friends I would reccomend the accesories though they arent needed but help with communication. Bluetooth connection allows you to use your bluetooth headsets so no need to buy the playstation headset.Overall it is a great console with many features. Like all systems it has its features and the lacks. But if youre into gaming mainly single player or co-op or maybe even online without paying 50 dollars yearly, it is a good console to buy.The extended warranty sony gives to the console is unbeatable by any non-online retailer. 100 dollars for 4 years.

Does this all-star lineup lead for a quality game?The story's main character is Shu, a young boy from a remote village. Every year, the village is attacked by a massive \"land shark\". One year, Shu and his friends decide to attack the land shark to avenge those it killed. Catching onto it as it tries to flee, they find a cavern full of ancient machines. The land shark turns out to be the fin of a great airship, which carries them up to a sky fortress. The story's villain, Nene, reveals himself and indicates that he had the land shark attack the village to amuse himself. The heroes are quickly defeated by him and removed from the ship, but an unknown benefactor carries them back up to the ship and grants them each a power hidden in their shadows. The friends work their way through the world, trying to gain strength and find allies to fight against Nene.The game plays like almost any other RPG, with the same hit points, magic points, and turn-based system found in so many other games. There's a couple things that set Blue Dragon apart, though. Firstly, there are no \"random\" battles - like a few other games, Blue Dragon has enemies that appear on the map and can be avoided or pre-emptively attacked (or you can get attacked, too). Blue Dragon's main innovation in this part is that you can corral your enemies together in a radius around you before you start a battle, or specifically choose only one enemy when you are surrounded by a multitude. The main purpose of this is that sometimes enemies will fight each other - usually the strong preying on the weak - which means that you can level the playing field by finding monsters that dislike each other and grouping them together so that they fight amongst themselves.In the battles themselves, Blue Dragon's main feature is the charge system - certain spells and attacks have a bar that, if stopped when they're full or close to full, do more damage but take longer to cast (whereas if it is empty or close to empty it takes less time but does less damage). There is also a class system, but rather than the characters the classes are assigned to the characters' shadows - the giant creatures that fight for them. These classes are nothing special - the usual mix of fighters and mages. There are different spells that can be bought at stores throughout the game.The graphics in the game are really nice - they're in a smooth, non-gritty style appropriate for Toriyama's artwork. Everything feels \"right\" - the effects, characters, and environments all seem appropriate, and none of them have the problem that some games have where they feel too artificial. The designs in the game are definitely Akira Toriyama's style, the characters and airships especially are reminiscent of his designs in the original Dragonball.The sound is nice - as expected of Nobuo Uematsu - but not really exceptional in any way. There were no songs that made me really take notice of them. During some boss fights, there are rock-and-roll type songs with actual singers and lyrics, which was pretty neat. There is voice acting in English, French, and Japanese, which is a pretty wide choice for such an expansive game. Each seemed to be pretty decent in quality, though none of it really stood out as being particularly well-acted.As a whole, this game is \"more of the same\" for RPGs. It's good, but it's not different. If you like traditional RPG gameplay, then that's great, but it doesn't bring enough to the table to really distinguish itself. By itself, though, it's a pretty solid package.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Now that the other games have been released in the US this game has been given its original title, and I will refer to it as FF4 throughout the remainder of this review.This port manages to stay faithful to both the American and Japanese versions of the game.  The Super NES version was easier than the original Japanese game, and this edition retains the difficulty of the Japanese version.  And though there are a few new additions--a new dungeon, a quicksave feature, some new items--these serve to improve the overall quality of the game rather than detract from it and do not diminish the game's nostalgic appeal in the least.When FF4 first appeared on the Super Nintendo almost 15 years ago the graphics were stunning, and while the visuals are not as impressive as they once were this game still looks great on a Game Boy Advance (or Nintendo DS) screen.  The soundtrack to this game is also one of its strengths--this isn't one you'll want to play on mute if you can help it.As for the game--well, it is one of the best games I've ever played, RPG or otherwise.  The gameplay is fantastic--FF4 pioneered a time-based attack system that strays just a little from the typical turn based combat system prevalent in so many RPGs before it.  Essentially this system gives each of your characters a time bar that, when filled, allows you to attack with him or her.  Unlike strict turn based combat, however, the enemies can actually attack you while you're mounting your attack, which spices up the combat a little since you have to be more quick on your feet while fighting.Final Fantasy 4 features a vast array of weapons, armor, and items.  What really makes the game stand out, though, is the incredible storyline.  The story revolves around Cecil, a Dark Knight who feels remorse for some deeds that, though done under orders, he feels were wrong.  This puts him at odds with the King he serves, and eventually he finds himself deciding to protect a little girl the King wants dead, thus effectively making himself an enemy to the crown he once served.The story quickly picks up after that and continues strong throughout the duration of the game.  Final Fantasy 4 was unique (at the time) in that your party was always changing--there are a total of 12 characters who each have their own strengths and weaknesses and who come and go at various points in the game.  They have unique abilities but also their own personality quirks and traits.  The intent of some of the characters, such as Cecil's love interest Rosa and the loyal Cid, is usually pretty clear, while some, like the enigmatic Cain, will keep you guessing throughout the game.  This is one of the great aspects of the story--you never know who is going to show up, who might have reason to leave, or who you might encounter next.I cannot praise Final Fantasy 4 enough.  In fact, I would recommend this game to just about anyone, whether in this format or in the Playstation release in Final Fantasy Chronicles.  This is a time consuming game, and at times very difficult, but it is incredibly rewarding.  If you're new to Final Fantasy or missed this title, do yourself a favor and pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"","summary":"Two Words: Frickin AWESOME!","reviewText":"I first got into the BF series in 2010 with \"Bad Company 2\" and eventually was able to get the original \"Bad Company\" game. Both games are fabulous in their own ways. I personally prefer the \"Battlefield\" series over \"Call of Duty\" myself but let's not get into an argument here. \"Battlefield 3\" is NOT a sequel to \"Bad Company 2\" but a previous game called \"Battlefield 2\" which as of this writing, I've never played.CAMPAIGN: The game begins with an epic sequence that for the most part, portrays the feel and mood of the entire game. The campaign mode of this game is the weaker side with your usual political/geopolitical upheaval in the Middle East involving an insurgency by an Iranian revolutionary group called the People's Liberation Front also known as the PLR involved in a major three-way urban battle with both American and Russian when an major earthquake strikes and compromising the entire operation on the American front. Later, surviving American soldiers are abducted by PLR insurgents and one of them, who manages to avoid detection must help to rescue the captives and apprehend the leader of the PLR. What is later revealed is far more sinister and threatens civilization itself unless the main madman is stopped.Overall, the campaign mode of this game in my view is kind of 'Meh' although the fanatastic graphics provide redeeming qualities, not to mention the sound effects. The primary weaknesses of this side of the game are the weak character development. None of the characters really grab your attention nor make you want to follow them or enjoy their intereactions. The \"Bad Company\" spin-off series had the leader of the group Sgt. Redford Haggard, Preston Marlowe, and Sgt. Sweetwater: Four almost fundamentally incompatible, and conflicting, personalities working together to bring an end to a World War. All four characters in that series I found very entertaining, especially Marlowe's somewhat intelligent persona interacting with the 'Southern Texas Hillbilly' persona of Haggard. On \"Battlefield 3\", none of that is present which limits wanting to come back and play. The upside though are the fantastic graphics, and detailed look of the environments. These provide some redeeming qualities to an otherwise average and unengaging campaign mode.The Co-op mode of this game is similar to campaign except it involves playing online with another player: I found Co-op kind of dull and uninteresting at best. The only reason I found myself playing this was to grab achievements and unlock weapons. Still, great graphics and some really fun sequences in parts.MULTIPLAYER: The multiplayer is where \"Battlefield 3\" shines the most, both with me and probably a majority of Xbox gamers. If you loved \"Bad Company 2's\" multiplayer, you'll want to have a bit of an open mind as the feel of BF3 is very, very different. Many of the weapons are completely different and the two games share little in common, when it comes to weapons in each class. That's what makes both games worth returning two on alternating circumstances. The realistic and detailed graphics lend so much to the MP that even after you grab all the achievements for the game, you'll want to keep playing more. There are five DLC additions for the MP which add various new dimensions and enhancing an already fantastic MP. Included are new game modes, and for a real treat, are assignments which can unlock some truly fantastic weapons for different classes. The graphics are FANTASTIC, and the destructible environments, and various choices of weapons are why I still play this game a lot, even after getting 95% of all multiplayer achievements. The addition of jets makes the game even more fun to play online. The \"Call of Duty\" MP is ravaged by a toxic combination of too much 'cheating' or 'hacked' lobbies and trash talking teenagers or pre-adolescents who likely cannot yet understand that what's fun in video games is horrible in real-life. Listening to the trash talk is entertaining only for so long before it gets tiring. And the hacking makes the MP unplayable too many times.On BF3, those problems are far less common and there is far greater emphasis on team work, and objectives all of which make the game so much more entertaining and enduring. I found that the Team Deathmatch is my least favorite of the MP but if you can find a lobby, one can find up to 500% games where one can season him/herself up with his/her weapon of choice and build up weapon service stars.My favorite though is 'Conquest' mode which include the use of tanks, jeeps, helicopters and yes, jets and involving air combat and all of these are required to capture objectives for the attacking side, or defending them by the defending side. The jets are a real pain to use and take a great deal of practice. Overall, the MP is where Battlefield 3 shines, so much so that any drawbacks on the campaign mode are completely negated by the multiplayer.As of this writing \"Battlefield 4\" looms around the corner but even then, I still find myself played \"BF3\" even two years since it's release. It's that great a game. Of all the FPS multiplayer games I've played, and that includes \"Call of Duty\", \"Ghost Recon\", \"Halo\", \"Medal of Honor\" and even \"Gears of War\", \"Battlefield 3\"s multiplayer is by far the best. Only BF4 is the only one that looks the most likely to inherit the crown in my book. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Ciriello \"AdWhois\"","summary":"Great graphics, seems very real. Gotta love it.","reviewText":"After spending much of yesterday playing the game I feel confident in throwing up a review.First of all, I spent most of the time playing the campaign because EA's servers were down (which is why I knocked off a star, by the way). And the campaign is actually pretty good, Battlefield usually does a better job than COD (at least since COD2 which was fantastic) so I don't know why I would be surprised by this fact. The graphics are fantastic, the surround sound is done masterfully and unlike some other games you start sympathizing with the characters (kinda like you do in Medal of Honor). When playing the campaign I couldn't help but think of it as one giant demo, it doesn't give you extensive use of any vehicle really but it gives you a taste of a bunch of them. As far as a campaign goes, I'd give this game a thumbs up, its interesting, has great graphics and for the most part is pretty fun (but be prepared for some Black-Ops style flashbacks).As far as multiplayer goes, I was only able to play 5 or 6 matches before I \"lost connection\" to EA's servers, they went down... This game is of course an EA game and as with all their releases, they are never prepared (server-wise) for the release so I'm just giving them a few days to get things working right...In the matches I did play I was pretty happy. It is definitely an all out battle with games of 20+ people...I will say however, sniping is rampant and makes the game very frustrating (having to take out the sniping camper every time you go anywhere.)The best improvement on multiplayer however, is the ability to select individual servers (like you would on a PC online game), this has to be the best thing a console multiplayer has done in a long while...The biggest down fall of the game's multiplayer is still around, the inability to quit from a server in between matches. I fail to understand EA's reasoning on this but it's been like this for BF3, BFBC2, BF1943, MOH, NFSHP, etc... It's just an annoying time waster and I wish someone would tell EA to get with the program...One final problem to mention with the game is that you have to switch discs to play campaign or multiplayer, I assumed installing the campaign and multiplayer discs to my hard drive would solve this issue but it didn't... I still have to switch discs out to play one or the other.All in all, its a good game, not sure I like it as much as BF BC2 but I like it a hell of a lot more than Black Ops, once they fix their servers the game will be fine and I'm sure I'll be playing it for a long time to come!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0038N0A24","reviewerName":"Mr. Bey","summary":"One of the Best Video Games Based on a Movie","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting much from this game based on past experience with video game titles based on movies. More often than not, these titles are poor efforts for the studios to cash in on the success of a blockbuster. That is not the case with Toy Story 3.Toy Story 3's story mode loosely follows the movie with some creative liberties taken along the way. Players can play as Woody, Jessie, and Buzz. The levels can be a bit tedious at some times but there are plenty of checkpoints. I'd say that this game is marketed at younger fans so it is just the right difficulty level for them.Toybox mode is where the game really shines. Players play as Woody, Jessie, or Buzz and they assume the role of the sheriff of a Western town. The town is populated with small toy characters and green aliens who you can customize outfits and hair for. The players get to earn money to buy new characters, build new buildings, and unlock new levels. Past characters such as Bo Peep and Stinky Pete make appearances as well as newer characters such as Lotso. The game features voice work from most of the cast of the movie. Toybox mode is easily the best part of the game. The split screen two player mode is also a great future.I would recommend this game for kids aged 8-13. It's a fun game but can get a bit repetitive at times. Any fan of the movie is sure to get a kick out this game as it is very faithful to the movies while maintaining a personality of its own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2010"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"The classic RPG is finally on the GBA","reviewText":"For a while now, Sqaure has been porting their classic 16-bit Final Fantasy titles to the GBA, which have been pretty faithful and provided all kinds of RPG goodness on Nintendo's never say die handheld.  Final Fantasy VI wraps up Square's 2-D RPG series, and in what a way it does.  For those of you who don't already know, Final Fantasy VI is actually the Final Fantasy III that was released for the Super Nintendo way back when (not to be confused with the Final Fantasy III released recently for the DS, the numbering of the series differs from shore to shore, which explains the gap from III to VII over here), and for the most part, the game is excellently recreated on the GBA.  Anyone who played Final Fantasy III for the Super NES back then most likely has fond memories of the game being one of the best RPG's possibly ever made, and for those fans, this GBA conversion won't disappoint.  The first thing you'll notice is that the game has the kind of deep and involving story that the Final Fantasy series is known for, along with colorful characters that you actually end up caring about.  The battles are fluidly animated and the game isn't hard to get into one bit either.  It also goes without saying that Final Fantasy VI Advance features some of the best music and sound effects you'll hear in a portable RPG.  Like the previous GBA conversions in the series, Square threw in some extras for longtime fans to enjoy too.  There's a music player that can be accessed once you complete the game, along with new espers, spells, and a new dungeon as well.  While a majority of the extras don't really add up to much, the bonus music player alone is fantastic for fans of the series.  If there's any real negatives about the game, it's that some of the graphics look pretty dated, and the game can be slow (especially the battles) to get into for newer gamers.  All that aside, Final Fantasy VI Advance is still an excellent RPG classic that feels right at home on the GBA, and fans of the series new and old should definitely pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"H. N. T.","summary":"A mediocre game","reviewText":"It is very sad to see after all this time and effort AC III ended up being inferior than AC II (the first one - not even counting AC Brotherhood or Revelations).The texture and overall look of the game are very good, but the colors just seem muted and unappealing.  They went for historical realism too, so, for example, we see pigs on the streets of Boston (far fewer than there but would in fact but nice touch); but for the veterans of the series it is hard to shake the feeling that it is such an inferior and less interesting world than 15th century Italy, or the 13th century Palestine for that matter.I could never really relate to the Connor character, which I found a massive flaw when they should clearly be considering the impact of changing the Animus target.  Altair had a past, had a community he believed in, had a mission... we knew the guy.  Enzio was an improvement on that, he had a family, he had his own ambitions, and he was becoming an assassin.  Connor... we see some stuff in the game and later in of his background, but he is never even close to similarly developed and relatable.  And finally what is done with Desmond Miles in this game is just a joke, let's just say that to have been building up Desmond over so many games to go in the direction they went is just a cheat.The game is buggy and clearly unfinished and rushed out for holiday sales.  The combat has frequent clipping problems where in order to correct superimpositions between characters they teleport a few feet away from where they were.  Not only it is sloppy but it really breaks the flow of combat which depends on reasonably predictable positioning.  There are major bugs (as in restart the PS3), average bugs (they spotted you when they were on the other side of the wall), and minor bugs (their lips don't move when they make a major emotional speech in a cutscene).  Add them all up and they profoundly damage the gaming experience.  Where the combat on AC always seems to flow, on AC III we have clipping problems, camera problems, and a variety of difficulties and imperfections.  The franchise once excelled at this, but now that we have seen better on Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, to see the AC series downgrade it quality instead of elevating it was just sad.The missions are often very task specific and oriented in how to approach the problem, where at previous games you could just for fun trash everyone as opposed to being stealthy; here there are many places where you just have to be stealthy and others where you just have to trash everyone.  The problem is that put together it makes no sense, they only added some stealth elements to avoid letting the game be too short (it can be finished in about 20-25 hours tops).A profoundly mediocre addition to the series which is inferior to what AC II was in nearly every way.  Also if you are hoping for more explanations and closure on the story forget about that, there is very nearly none of that (remember how exciting it was piecing together \"The Truth\" in AC II... it didn't tell you jack, but it hinted at a very interesting master design.  Yeah, forget about that).  The ending itself is so abrupt that it suggests deadline issues.We will see how the sales goes, but I think this is another series that bites the dust on a down note.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"J. Finkel \"Jack of Trades\"","summary":"A Perfect Family Game","reviewText":"Toy Story 3 (the game) begins just like Toy Story 3 (the movie).  As Woody, you are tasked with rescuing orphans on a runaway train while fending off the evil Dr. Porkchop (piggy bank pig).  This first level is hectic, slightly challenging (aside from not penalizing you for dying), short and sweet.  It works as a great introduction to the world of Toy Story 3 - and it is a surprisingly big world for a licensed kid's game.==Production==Toy Story 3 is really divided into two games: story mode, and toy box.  The story mode loosely follows the movie, while the toy box mode gives you free reign over your own up-and-coming Wild West town.  The production values are genuinely impressive in both modes.  Voice-acting is performed by the actors from the movies and there are way too many cutscenes to count.  Difficulty is extremely forgiving, but there is enough challenge that even season video game addicts will have to attempt some challenges multiple times to land a gold or collect every item.  This easy to beat, tough to complete generally works well in family titles and it works great here.  The moderate challenge is made all the more palatable for adults by allowing quick completion of most challenges and levels with the right combination of skill and haste.==Gameplay==While both modes have you controlling Woody, Jessie or Buzz from 3rd person perspective, each provides a distinct gaming experience.  The story mode is a barrage of puzzles and action (and obviously a great story).  The toy box is more casual since you can go about things at your own pace, but still busy enough to keep the most sugar-addled child glued to the screen.  Playing solo, two hours flew by in toy box mode before I realized I wasn't supposed to be having so much fun with a kid's game.  There's just a ton of stuff to unlock, explore and decorate (yes Decorate!).  The best part is that two people can independently or cooperatively explore and conquer this Wild West town.  In other words, two players can help each other out, but you don't have to worry about your kids fighting over what to do in the game.  I don't have a PS Move, but Toy Story 3 makes use of this peripheral as well.==Conclusion==Toy Story 3, much like Pixar's movie, is family entertainment gem.  It's a solid game that caters to its audience perfectly, which is impressive because it's an audience that includes players of all ages.  I strongly recommend this game to any fan of the Toy Story movies and to anyone with kids.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"teejay","summary":"A surprisingly good title that will satisfy the kids and even entertain the adults.","reviewText":"I tried this game out as a free-hour demo on PS3, because my (2 year old) kid loves Toy Story and I figured it would give me something to do besides watch the same movie for the 30th time.  Given that this is a movie tie-in my expectations were pretty low, anything tolerable would've been acceptable but I was pretty surprised about how good this game actually was during the hour I played it. The target audience is definitely under 10 which makes sense given the subject matter, but despite that surprisingly few corners were cut (from what I saw).PROS:- Solid gameplay. This is a fairly straight-forward 3rd person platformer.  The player can play as Woody, Buzz, or Jessie and has a fairly standard set of moves (run, double-jump, throw balls, charge, etc), which are appropriate for the type of non-violent style of game this is. Aside from the story mode, which I hear is somewhat short, there is an open-world environment called \"Woody's Roundup\" which strikes me a little like Animal Crossing meets Red Dead Redemption. Yeah, Really. The things you can do are all fairly non-threatening (paint a house, mine for gold, etc), but varied and interesting. There's a lot to keep the little ones (and even the parents) entertained for a while, and the gameplay is fairly tight.- great voice acting: A combination of voice talent from the movie and excellent sound-alikes make this game really feel like an extention of the film series. The game takes place after the events of Toy Story 3 and in the hour that I played I encountered Hamm, Rex & that blue Triceratops that Kristen Schaal (of Daily Show fame) voices, all voiced by the same talent from the movies. Woody and Buzz are not voiced by Tom Hanks or Tim Allen, but the sound-alikes are amazing, I really wasn't immediately sure if they were fake or real. Overall an excellent job.- gentle difficulty/easy to learn. As a game primarily meant for children, this game is not that hard. the penalty for dying is basically restarting where you died, and along the way there are cues to hit R2 for hints at challenging spots, so it's very easy to figure out what you're supposed to do next. My 2 year old obviously is not going to be playing this game yet (although he likes to watch), but by the time he's 4 he will probably be able to handle it, and in the case of the Woody's Roundup area he could probably have a lot of fun just moving Woody/Buzz/Jessie around the map and can do so without fear of getting stuck.  Despite the easy learning curve, the game isn't without challenge, and there are a few tough spots and enough interesting things to do to keep me (the parent) occupied.- I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were options to configure the camera controls exactly the way I wanted. In a game like this, meant for kids, I kinda wasn't expecting to find the ability to invert all the Y-axis controls but nonetheless they were there. Kudos to the devs for this.CONS: This is a limited-budget movie tie in. Not surprisingly there are a few issues.- Graphics are below average. You would think with the movie's art style would be easy to duplicate on a modern videogame system, given the general lack of detail.  Despite this the graphics are REALLY simplistic, and there are polygons noticeable in places they shouldn't be, like Hamm's nose. in 2010, there is really no reason why a featureless cylinder can't be easily reproduced without showing facets, but in Toy Story 3 the polygon count is REALLY low. On the plus side, there are no frame-rate drops, but given the way the graphics look, if there were it would be inexcusable. Overall it's not horrible but they lose points here.- Granted I've only gotten an hour into the game but it looks like only Disney-specific toys are in. No Potato Head, no Trolls, no Barbie. Not entirely suprised but given the fact that Potato Head is/was a main character, and the trolls make an appearance in the train scene from the movie in the beginning of the game, it's a little disappointing.- Prospector's voice is all wrong. No Fraiser :(- I hear the game is short, although given the way kids are that's not likely to be a major problem.----------------Overall I'd say this game is surprisingly good. After trying it out on PS3 Demo, I'm going to pick it up. As a parent finding a game I can play that is both OK for my kid to see (i.e. no Demon Souls), something he doesn't mind watching AND not boring as hell to play, this is a godsend. While not perfect, this game will definitely appeal to fans of the series and is strong enough to stand in its own right.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

While the system has had some highs, they haven't been able to have the definitive stride when it has came down to video games. While the original Nintendo Wii has been revolutionary at changing the way we play video games. But that also has been the case with Sonic The Hedgehog. There honestly haven't been many striking games with the blue blur of speed that have been as driven as Sonic showed over the years. While there have been some games that have been strong for Sonic, like Sonic Riders & Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing that have came out for the Wii that have been alright, there have been more of the need from blue speed that could have been shown. Well, that is also there for the Wii U, and another chance to see Sonic race his way to glory.Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing: Transformed isn't exactly what Nintendo had brilliantly with Mario Kart 7 for the Nintendo 3DS, but takes that step in the right direction with great gameplay. But the fast & furiousness of seeing Sonic, Tails, Dr. Robotnik & company try to make it to the finish line. The game definitely shows the characters trying to make it to the finish line, in courses rendered with the influence from games like Nights Into Dreams, Samba De Amigo and Dragon Axe. Graphically, the game looks amazing, as you & your friends try to make it to the checkered flag, but the weak spots in the game is really the control. It really is awful with the Wii U gamepad. Thankfully, the control was much more streamlined with the Wii U Pro Controller, and original Nintendo Wii Classic Controller. The online gameplay works well, but lags a bit in the fun with more of the challenge comes from the solo Grand Prix campaign from boost goals, time matches, and lassic boost finishes. But overall, you do still get a classic racer. What I do like overall, is the variety of racers, but I didn't find it at first seeing characters like Wreck-It Ralph, and Danica Patrick involved in the game stood out.All in all, Sonic & Sega All Stars Racing Transformed is not a must buy for hard core racers, as would be if there was going to be another Mario Kart game for the Nintendo Wii U. But overall, you still mostly get a challenging racer. It is a noble racer, but more needed to be added that was exciting to match in the race what could have been definitive for the Wii U. I have loved it as a better game for the Nintendo 3DS, but it did not really have as much added into the Wii U when it came out.Graphics: BSound: B-Control: C for Wii U Gamepad, B- for Wii U Pro Controller, B for Wii Classic ControllerFun & Enjoyment: C+ for solo play; C for MultiplayerOverall: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2013"}

Whereas predecessor Ico was built more around a puzzle elements with the occasional combat(taking down those shadows who have the nerve to try to steal Yorda), Shadow is built more like an action game with puzzle elements mixed in and it very much isn't exaggeration when the game contains some of the more intense and exhilating sequences in gaming.Story: The story's pretty sparse, giving you small details and letting you think up the rest. Essentially, the Wanderer and his faithful horse Argo are bringing a woman's body, Mono, to a shrine. Dead, unconcious, coma or trance, it's never said but apparently, an entity known as Dormin can bring her back to life. Only thing is is that roaming the land are 16 Colossi, massive creatures and upon defeating all 16, he will be granted the ability to revive her. Like Ico, the story isn't focused on specific details and while some might question the game's reluctance to specifically spell out your relationship with Mono, you really start to feel like saving her and she's not just your goal but something you have to actually accomplish for yourself. Sounds like too much but some do get this involved.Graphics: It's very similar to Ico where the light seems overexposed and very bright but it's not a game built for detail but more for an atmosphere. Sun-dried ravines and forests with sunlight filtered through the treetops lend the game a great ambience. The only thing is that there is some noticeable slowdown but it's not that big of a deal unless you focus on it. Then of course there's the colossi themselves and there's nothing like tilting the camera so that you can look up at these massive things and think \"I gotta bring this bugger down?\" The fur and detail in these creatures is quite impressive.Sound/Music: Hands-down one of the better soundtracks of that year. The music is very minimal, if at all, until you fight one of the 16 and the music gets very epic and Hollywood. Hope you got it hooked to a sound system since the music just makes the battles more epic and exciting with a full stereo going rather than cheap monoral TV speakers. Like Ico, the voice acting is a foreign language with subtitles provided (translated for a change). It does give the game a more richer history even if it sounds like gibberish.Gameplay: Each Colossi is a puzzle in and of itself. Some of them are pretty easy to figure out while others are like \"what the hell do you do?!\" then it hits you: \"ohh! THAT's what you do?\"  One required me to swim to its back, climb up all the way to his head and direct him to go to one of 3 towers. Climbing on top of the tower, he then puts his front feet up, exposing the weak spot that was originally inaccessible since it was underwater. There's many more like this so don't get frustrated easily if you have no idea what to do. Of course knowing how and actually doing are 2 separate things and part of the frustration comes with those bad mistakes which send you careening off and hitting the ground hard. There's times where your character isn't as precise control-wise and jumping from here to there might actually send him in the wrong way and you'll plummet.Unlike other games where there was multiple control schemes for everything, controlling the Wanderer is pretty basic. He's got 2 weapons, bow and arrow and his sword. Point the sword in a sun-lit area and move around, eventually the light becomes a line, pointing you towards the next Colossi but it doesn't give you a map on how to get there like passing through cliffsides, paths and forests but just tells you \"he's this way, now go find him\". Climbing has a Grip Meter which you can strengthen by finding lizards with silver tails. It's easy enough to control and I even did a movie-esque save where I grabbed a patch of fur at the last minute but there's times where the colossi will shake so much and the Wanderer is so sensitive that even slight shakes will make him hang on for dear life rather than climbing.While it's the spiritual successor, you can't really say Shadow of the Colossus is better than Ico since ultimately, you play it 2 completely different ways but track down both but Shadow is definately an experience to check out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2005"}

I thought it would be really boring . However , I was wrong . This game is really awesome, and this is a must buy for anyone who owns a ps2.Let's start with the storyline . The game begins when a man named Wander comes into a temple , which is located in an isolated land. He enters , and places a dead girl on the altar. You're not told who she is , just that he really wants to save her . Then , he hears some kind of disembodied voice talking to him . It says that in order to bring this girl back to life, he will have to find and destroy 16 colossi that roam the land. Then , the game starts .now throughout the game , the only enemies you'll encounter are these colossi. I know it sounds boring and repetetive , but hold on . The gameplay is more varied than you know . Each colossus has a different way in which you need to kill him , and the battles are very exciting . the only weapons you will have are a bow and arrow , and a sword (you also dont get to level these up , but again , you shouldn't worry about that). But killing each colossus isn't as simple as walking up to his foot and smacking it with your sword, or just shooting arrows at his body. Each of the colossi is an ENORMOUS monster , and it will have different vital points on it's body that you need to stab with your sword. These vitals are usually located high up on the colossus. You will need to climb up it's body in order to reach these vitals. Believe me , this is A LOT harder than it sounds. You will always need to find a way to climb on the colossus first , and you'll have to do a lot of thinking . This makes this game be a puzzle game in part , which is very fun . Like I mentioned before, these battles are really fun and exciting , and each colossus you beat will be funner than the last . when I was fighting the last colossus , I was thinking, \"man , did I actually think the first colossus was cool compared to this ?\" You will figh the colossi on land , in water , and even in the air , and every time you get on them , they will thrash about and try to throw you off. This adds a lot to the excitement . You also have a stamina bar , which decreases as you cling to the colossus's body , and if it drains completely , you fall off . that's why there are some points on the colossus where you can rest for a second. It's also very fun to use the bow , even if you cant kill the colossi this way , because you mainly just need to provoke them with it .Now, another different issue is getting to the various colossi. The land you travel in is also HUGE , and you will need to use your horse to get to the colossi. Now , in order to find out where they are , you have to hold your sword up to the sun . This creates a long beam of light , and you need to go to the place where the light gathers. The environments are huge and expansive in details , and the graphics are also good. The only problem with the graohics is that the framerate gets a bit slow when the action heats up , but it's not enough to ruin this game .The ending is also great , but I wont spoil it . Let me just say that it's very surprising , and you will be very shocked.Overall this is a wonderful game , and any ps2 owner should definitely buy it . Just let me say a word of warning : I really recommend that you don't look at any guides or walkthroughs in order to beat this game. It just really ruins everything.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2005"}

Soatthiamroong","summary":"This ninja's getting softer, in a good way","reviewText":"I got the game yesterday and I'm up to chapter 4 now. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is the softer and more accessible game than the first Sigma, without losing any elements of fun.You can select the easy mode, 'Acolyte path', right from the start (without an insult from the producer like the first one, which the easy mode 'Ninja Dog' came with an insulting dialogue from a female ninja, Ayane). Also, the difficulty level of the normal mode got pushed down quite a bit. Normal difficulty doesn't really give you a hard time. You may die a few times in one chapter if you're cheap on healing items, but if not, you could pass a chapter without dying. You gain some amount of health back after finishing off each fight. Some boss fights are just downright easy.However, it doesn't mean you can beat enemies with button-mashing and your eyes closed. Considerable amount of tactics and quickness are still required. Combos, weapons, spells are getting a few tweaks here and there and they are fun to use. So, fans of the first Sigma shouldn't feel that the game has sacrificed any good thing. Well...at least I don't.In conclusion:Anyone who was intimidated by the difficulty of the first Sigma, but still interesting in this game, should definitely pick Sigma 2 up. All the fun is there, while a big chunk of frustration was removed. And when you feel up to the challenge, I recommend you get the first Sigma too.As for the old Sigma fans, no need to say much, there's a high possibility that they own this game already :)EDIT:Now I've found one major flaw. Camera sucks!!! Cheap deaths happen from time to time just because the game force you to use low angle camera and don't allow you to rotate at times. I fought two Tengus (the birdmen in Momiji stage). While I fought one of them, the other one can just swoop in from out of frame and attack me with the unblockable move.Also, enemies with big body or wings tend to block the camera often.It's pretty lame to keep dying, not from difficulty of the game, but because of the camera forces me to fight in the angle I'm not comfortable with :PIf I'm not mistaken, I didn't have to fight with camera this much in the first Sigma. So, my overall score of this game has dropped to 4.5 now, due to the serious camera flaw.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

I bought the sly cooper PS3/Vita cross play, and beat the game on my Vita.  After i beat the game i back the file up on my computer and deleted the file from my memory card on my vita to make room for some new games. I now want to use the cross save feature of the sly cooper game from my vita to my PS3 but, because i deleted my game file i need to fully install the 3 gb file onto my vita to simply transfer the saved game file.Also the only way to back up a digital game save file is to one, have a Plus account and simply store it on the cloud or save the entire file on your PS3 or Computer. Personally i find the second option to be annoying because i have to many games and i'm already trying to figure out how to manage games i play, let alone a game i'm simply keeping around to save a damn save file.That said this deal is great, if i didn't already own a vita i'd have brought that, but just be aware that memory card for digital games isn't large enough at all.  I have a 8gb card and i'm bouncing around games all the time trying to fit them all.  I highly recommend using game cards unless your willing to get a 16gb or bigger card.PS if your willing to go digital check out the games on the PSN store you'll be amazed at the amount of games that are on the system that have never been listed on amazon because they've never been released outside of the digital market.  And amazon is now selling some of them if you don't trust the PSN security.I really like my Vita, but i mostly play indie games or japanese games cause the US barely has any new games coming out.  Hopefully this will change with the PS4 now.  We'll see.  Remote play is nice for grinding.  I can run around collecting thing while still watching TV.  But it's still majority under utilized.

PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Charles B Valentino","summary":"An instant classic despite it's flaws.","reviewText":"If you like action games you should shell out the relative pocket change to buy this title. Warning: it is a game that revolves around stealth, just in case that turns you off.My synopsis: Playing as both Solid Snake and also a rookie named Raiden, you infiltrate a terrorist operation to prevent the use of Metal Gear to cause mass destruction. Most of the game is spent using Raiden who is caught up in layer upon layer of intrigue as he fulfills his mission. The plot twists and turns as you discover who truly are your friends and who are your enemies.Graphics 5/5:The environments you play in are very simple metallic military type settings. This isn't pushing the PS2 to new levels or anything, but it's really not necessary considering the subject. The characters are rendered beautifully though. I was extremely impressed with how lifelike and expressive the characters could be. The animation is strong and fluid.Play control 4/5: Why no 5? Let me preface this by saying that overall, the play control on this game is superior to most games in responsiveness, environmental manipulation, variety of movement, and controller layout. I mean this is a game where you can be looking though a first person view to aim, and if you need to you can stand on tippy toes to see over something! If while crossing a catwalk, an enemy is about to spot you, you can quickly flip over the side and cling to the edge while they pass by. You can kneel, crawl, swim, dodge, grapple, strike, and hand-over hand. Evasive controls are easily activated and directed (a major flaw in many games).What the game may lack in environmental detail, it makes up for in personality details. Your radio allows you to maintain communication with multiple characters during play, and depending on an action you are carrying out at that moment, their dialogue will be appropriate. The programmers have hidden lots of potential dialogue within the game depending on what you manage to do in a given situation, adding to the replay value.The environment is destructible within limits. Walls and most furniture  cannot be destroyed making explosive weapons largely useless, noisy, and...well..useless. However, doors can be opened or broken off. Crates and barrels can be destroyed, Seagulls can be shot at, and insects can even be toyed with too.I'd give the play control a 5 but there were some flaws, for example when trying to press up against a wall, you attempt to peer around a corner,  the camera may switch to a disorienting angle just before you reach the corner. Now the direction you were pressing on the controller to set up your look-around gets completely interrupted by the change and you find yourself trying to figure out which way to press. The camera is fixed, so sometimes during abrupt camera changes, you may mess up and find yourself completely exposed by the disorientation which can quickly end your game. (In order to survive, you really don't want to be seen)Sound: 4/5:The music is forgettable, which is good because I hate when music takes your attention away from the game. Ultimately, in a game like this you don't want to notice the music. It does enhance the mood when you are in a tight situation or you've been spotted.The voice-over work is good but not fantastic. Anything that comes off as cheesy is more an issue of scripting though, the voice actors did fine.Plot 4/5: Some players of this game will say \"what?!?!\" at my rating, but hear me out. Though the story has intriguing moments and revelations that cause you to want to see what happens next, there are far too many interruptions by dialogue that just doesn't belong. For example, when you are in the middle of breaking people's necks your @#$%ing girlfriend may radio in and want to reminisce about the day you first met. This is just plain painful to endure. You may sit through 5 minute discussions with a character about how they feel they went wrong with a former pupil while outside, explosives could be going off any minute. In fact, there's way too much emoting in this game considering you're supposed to be a trained killer silently executing vicious terrorists. Am I right or am I wrong? At least you can skip just about every conversation. The problem is that you may miss a key plot point if you do that. Also, it really gets old when a character says something to you and then your character's response is either \"What?\" or \"(I will now repeat exactly what you just said in the form of a question)\". It's like he's some half deaf moron. Hopefully in the sequels to this game the writing will be tighter.Ultimately, I consider this game a must-buy. But considering how popular it is, you probably already know that. Heck you probably already have it and are just reading this review because you're at work and are just as bored as I am. Well, if not, buy the game. It's really awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2006"}

It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

No.  A great game? Yes.","reviewText":"Those who are familiar with Metal Gear Solid series have come to expect games that challenge your mind and kick your adrenaline into overdrive.  And the sequel \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" is no acception to the rule.This high intensity espionage thriller puts you in the familiar shoes of Solid Snake and later on a newer agent, Raiden.  The learning curve isn't a chore, but don't expect to pick up and play right away.  Such moves as robbing an enemy guard of his tags or breaking his neck take time and practice.  The storyline itself is compelling and will actually have you incredibly interested.  I'll keep this short.  The United States Marines are now harnessing the Metal Gear technology to build their own super weapon.  While transporting the new Metal Gear on a ship through New York harbor the Marines fall under attack from Russian terrorists.  Soon they overrun the ship, all while you as Snake witness it happen.  Anyways, for the sake of those who haven't played this game as of yet I wont reveal any more.The gameplay itself is like I said, pretty easy to learn but alot harder to master.  The arsenal you are able to harness ranges from 9mm pistols all the way M4 Carbine machine guns.  As you stealthily sneak around attempting to complete your mission objectives you'll notice the lush graphics.  What I found most impressive presentation wise was how the designers paid attention to even the littlest details.  Case and point is when you shoot a bucket of ice cubes, not only do they all fall out in different shapes, but melt at different times instead of simultaneously.  I never experienced any slowdown from start to finish, this was very impressive.Fans of the series will not be let down by the second installation, it has all the great features of the orignal and then some.  A great storyline, intensity, good graphics, fun to play and addictive, what more could you ask from a console game?  If you own a Playstation 2 console I highly recommend adding \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" to your library of games, you wont regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"ahoffoss","summary":"Very impressive! (Updated for DLC)","reviewText":"I am a HUGE fan of the Dead Rising series and when I found out this was a launch title for the Xbox One,...well I just had to have it!  It only runs 30 fps at 720p, but that's okay, because with EVERYTHING going on during any given time you'll likely not notice anyways.  Upon first seeing the game, you'd think it could have been released on last gens hardware.  However, once you get to playing you'll notice why it wasn't!  The Xbox One can provide an astounding amount of characters on screen at any given time and this really helps you to feel like you're actually in the middle of a huge zombie outbreak!  Love the game!Now let's talk about the DLC.  I've broken them down individually below, but it's just a shame that they swindled me into purchasing the \"Season Pass\"  before I really knew how short each of the included stories would each be.  For $30 I've played some ridiculously awesome budget titles, but these DLC's are so short and so non-replayable that, knowing what I know now, would never have convinced me to pay upfront.  In all honestly, all four of these \"untold stories\" should have simply been combined as the first of the DLC's.  I've played DLC's that added anywhere from 5-20 hours of new gameplay, but never less than 1.  At least, not for the price these are.  As cool as this game is on it's own, they should have had TONS of new things to add to the game.  Granted, I'm not saying these aren't at all fun to play.  They're ok (compared to the actual game itself) and provide a little insight to some other previously NPC characters.  However, they shouldn't have been priced at $10 each.Definitely purchase the game, but for the time being, hold off on any and all DLC until there is a price decrease or simply a \"Game of the Year\" edition.*******Updated******* (Feb 17, 2014)Operation Broken Eagle (DLC)This is the first (1) of 4 DLC's included in the Season Pass.  Honestly, if you haven't already purchased the Season Pass, I'm not sure that I'd do so again.  This first DLC can be 100% completed in less than 2 hours.  There really isn't a whole lot to do.  It's very linear and offers no real look into the story of the playable character, Kane.  Basically, this would have been ok for a $3 download, but not the $10 they're asking.FINAL SCORE 2/5*******Updated******* (Feb 22, 2014)Fallen Angel (DLC)This is the second (2) of the 4 DLC's included in the Season Pass.  Again, it is VERY short and can be fully completed in only a few hours time.  It took about twice the time to achieve 100% gamerscore on this than it did the previous, but only because the amount of \"collectables\".  The story alone can be finished in under 15 minutes.  Basically an hour if you are on your first run.  The extra stuff takes some time, however.  There are 40 posters you can burn.  I think 25 med kits to collect.  24 ZDC cameras to destroy (8 in each part of the city).  And 8 groups of \"survivors\" to save.  The playable character, Angel is a bit more developed than the previous DLC.  Bottom line, if you haven't already paid for the season pass,..then pass this one up, or wait for the \"game of the year\" edition.  As with the previous DLC, $10 is FAR too much for the little time you get out.FINAL SCORE 2/5*******Updated******* (Feb 27, 2014)Chaos Rising (DLC)This is the third (3) of the 4 DLC's included in the Season Pass.  So far this has been my least favorite.  Unfortunately, this DLC falls short on many levels.  The story is pretty bad for starters.  You're Hunter, and you're mission is to remove your buddy, Spider from the leadership of your motorcycle gang.  Honestly, this is just more collectibles and a main mission that can honestly be beaten in 10-15 minutes TOPS!  I completed it 100% on my first time through in just under 2 hours.  It also includes one of the most annoying side missions EVER!  Collecting Special Choppers.  These are scattered throughout the city and must be driven back to a specific location without being destroyed.  It's not hard, just time consuming.  This DLC should have been packed with others, or maybe $3 as a quick add-on.FINAL SCORE 1/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2013"}

You will have full, ultra-responsive 3-D control of Dante as you combat with fist, sword, gun, and a stunning variety of martial arts moves that recall Hong Kong action films. You will have at your disposal many inventive moves: use your sword to pop your enemy into the air, for example, then juggle him with blasts from your gun. You will have unprecedented control of the direction and force of your sword and other weapons.

Very challenging....","reviewText":"This is a Capcom game about guns, swords, walking around and generally kicking some [toshie].  Easy to play, fun to play... here's a general idea...Genre: 3D action game, one person.  You walk around and kill things.Puzzles: Easy; The level puzzles are simple: find key, use key.  The bosses pose some challenge in finding tactics that work against them.  Other than that... the puzzles pose no challenge what so ever.Violence: High... that's all this game is about: killing things.  None of these things are human, the closest human resemblance are puppets, marionettes.  Others include insects, shadow dogs, lizard warriors, wraiths.  There is blood, but not excessive.Highs:  Variety of armament, point bought skills, varying levels of difficulty, fun.Lows: Simple, really simple.  Story basically [is no good], the spoken dialect is embarrassing to listen to, some real problems with regard to realism.Alright, so it's Capcom, makers of Resident Evil and Mega Man... so what do we have?  A slight combination.  Remember Onimusha?  Well these are the same guys.  Resident Evil meet Mega Man...  introducing Devil May Cry.  It's got the look of Resident Evil in a 3D world but the action style of Mega Man.  Very very similar to Onimusha.  Alright... if you have played any of the previously mentioned games you'll also note the horrible story line and dialogue.  Well that's to be expected from Capcom... great fun, really difficult, horrible lines.  The premise is simple, Dante, the main character, is trying to rid the world of the Dark Lord, Mundus.  He comes across new powers and weapons to help him eliminate his many enemies and 5 bosses, including Mundus.Alright I must first say that this game is very easy to play through, just once.  You'll start to play and then if you have trouble it'll give you the option of going to the Easy mode, which also features automatic gun firing.  There are four difficulty settings: Easy, Normal, Hard and Dante Must Die.  This is the greatest part of the game, the difficulty settings.  Normal is pretty easy, bosses are hit hard, you are hit less and items cost less.  In Dante Must Die mode you must gather all your gaming ability together to survive, let alone conquer.  You do have the option of carrying all your gear and skills from one difficulty to the next, so don't worry.  Starting off in Dante Must Die mode would be impossible if you didn't have all your stuff.  The bosses are also pretty darn hard.  You'll have fun fighting Angelo, a sword wielding warrior like yourself, and you'll absolutely hate the battles with Nightmare, who lives up to his name completely.The game play is simple enough, moves around like Zelda Ocarina of Time, but you can't control your camera, it just moves for you.  Aiming is done perfectly with the press of a button.  You have melee weapons and combos that you can pull off with your melee weapon, and your guns too.  Another great part of this game is the fighting style.  You can juggle enemies with your sword and guns, bomb them from a distance, turn and break another enemy next to you apart, and then slip into Devil Mode and cause the ground to explode.  Devil Mode is like magic which allows you to access great skills and abilities, for the price of you Devil Letters (Magic Points).Your skills are bought between missions or from an Ox with an hourglass statue.  The cash are Red Orbs.  Yellow orbs are basically lives, blue orbs add to your life, and often come in 1/4 fragments, and purple orbs add another letter to your Devil Bar (MP).  You can use red orbs for buying for your two magic melee weapons or other orbs.  Your weapons are swords (3 types), a pair of gauntlets, dual pistols, shotgun, grenade launcher, needlegun (underwater only) and a magic gun, Nightmare Beta.  No ammo count or reloading, in fact if you can shoot fast enough you can keep Dante suspended in air while firing off your dual pistols.There are many secret missions that reward your with Blue Orbs (life) and two hidden characters, after beating Hard and Dante Must Die difficulties.  There is also a ranking system, D, C, B, A, S... sound familiar?  They rank your missions based on Time, Health, Red Orb count and Items used.  They also rank your ability to keep the pain flowing via combos.Who should get this?  Well fans of Onimusha would like it, Resident Evil fans may find the puzzles boring and the action very repetitive.  It is not a great game in the sense of Final Fantasy 7, nor is it as fun as Grand Theft Auto... in fact you'll play it, beat it and then put in away.  But I get it out every now and then just to kick some [toshie], and play around with Super Dante.  The reason it has 4 stars is because it's a game that will keep you playing until it's over.  Then you can play through the extra modes and find the hidden stuff, go for all S ranks on missions, put it away.  It's short compared to other games, took me 3 hours (shortest time).Happy Hunting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2003"}

Though SSX3 steals the ''open'' concept from Tony Hawk 4, it works even better with its ''open mountain'' concept.And So It Starts...You begin on Peak 1, the lowest of the 3 unlockable peaks. You have a choice between Racing, Freestyle, and Freeride goals. To progress to the next mountain, you must either complete one set of goals or you have to earn a certain amount of money (typically by performing tricks and winning races).CharactersThe characters in this game are great, though be warned that some of your favorites don't appear (e.g. Eddie, JP). The ''snazzy'' voice-acting from SSX Tricky is gone -- no more Lucy Liu! However, the acting replacements are great, and their vocals are much less hammy, IMHO.StoryIt's a sports game; there isn't too much story. The rivalries are still present, and new characters (like covergirl Allegra) bring newfound sayings and moves!The only negative is that, unlike THPS4, you have to complete the SAME GOALS over and over with each individual boarder. If you thought this was tedious with THPS, try dozens of goals and challenges with the 8+ characters in this game! It becomes really boring!You Look Maahhh-velous!Wow, wow, wow. The graphics are fantastic. Yes, sometimes you see the ''inside'' of a mountain or the underside of a level, but that's a small price to pay for the camera keeping pace with you the rest of the way.In terms of scope, even the smallest of them all, Peak 1, takes 12 minutes to rush down. You can spend well over an hour just travelling from Peak 3 to 1, slowly completing goals and collecting ''collectibles'' (aka snowflakes).The skins that you can download for your characters (e.g. hats, heads, clothes, boards) allow you to customize your look every time you go down the mountain. I try to dress Elise differently every time I play -- it feels like a whole new character!Will This Gather Dust?No, I can honestly say that I'm still playing SSX Tricky, let alone SSX3. I haven't explored the online racing, but the game is strong enough without it!Overall Recommendation:If you like Tony Hawk, you'll like this.If you like SSX, you'll like this.If you like snow, you'll like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2004"}

While not a button masher like some fighting game or a shoot-em-up like Halo, this is a cinematic experience that is unlike anything else I've ever seen. Every single decision you make has some effect on another part of the game. The split-second decisions you make will lead your storyline down a path that you cannot undo. While there may be moments in a discussion when you can take your time to plan out your next question, some situations require literally a two-second choice and the wrong one changes everything.The soundtrack to this game was like something you'd hear in a movie somewhere. The plot twists were incredible, and when the Origami Killer's true identity was revealed...I was speechless. The move was so clever it made me question everything I'd seen up until that point. You'll be fighting for your life one moment and if you lose, your character will die. If that character dies, you continue on without them, but they might have had some pivotal purpose later and you desperately needed them.The replay value on this is unprecedented. You can immediately replay the game and instantly change your story completely. While the identity of the killer will remain the same, you'll still find so many places to change the story and it'll be like watching an entirely new movie.Fair warning, this game earns its \"M\" rating. The language here is not for children, and there is the potential for a few racy scenes (it's all in the decisions you make). Still, for an overall experience that will change the way you perceive a video game, this is unbeatable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

The 360 controller has been the best controller on the market for about 7 years despite having some issues (terrible dpad, big analog stick dead zone, and some analog stick drift). When I heard about the changes they made to the One controller, I was nervous. Looser sticks? Ewww that's one of many reasons why the dual shock 2 controller was so abysmal. But I'm pleasantly surprised. The sticks are in fact looser than the 360's, but it's for the better. It offers more precise controls and the dead zone is gone. GONE GONE GONE. Thank goodness. The grip on the outside of the sticks is wonderful. Especially compared to how bad the PS4 controller's sticks are (my first one essentially fell apart from normal use).The other huge advantage the One controller has over the new PS4 controller is battery life. My DS4 lasts 6-8 hours on a full charge. Xbox One controller goes a full week or more. The placement of the analog sticks is also superior on the One controllers. I also love that if I'm watching Netflix and put the controller down, Kinect will see that and turn off my controller, but if I pick it back up, it turns the controller back on. Amazing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2014"}

I loved the games so much that I beat them at least 5 times a piece.  However, my 360 wasn't online and as such, I missed out on the DLC.  Now my 360 is online, but I wanted to show my support for ME2 yet again.  So I purchased this on the day it came out and sat down to play it.  After going through it twice (once Renegade and once Paragon and a little over 80% trophy completion), here's my 2 cents......The first thing I want to address is the \"bugs\" and \"glitches\".  While I have had some bugs here and there as well as some poor syncing in the sounds and voices, I would not say it overly detracted from the game itself.  I have had to restart 3 times do to freezing and never lost more than 30 minutes of gameplay.  Maybe I lucked out.  However, the fact remains that, for all the isues I have read about, my experience yielded no more issues or bugs than any other game I have played.....in fact, it yielded much less.ME2 still remains one of the most beautifully made games ever.  This pertains to the story, the gameplay, the characterization, the graphics.....everything.  The added DLC was a treat for me as I didn't get to play with it on 360.  In my opinion, this game is a bargain at full price.  Even if you take in to account the fact that the game is older and cheaper for 360, the simple fact is I would pay full price again and again for a game that is made well and has multiple ways to play through it........no matter how old.Now since Microsoft still retains the rights to ME1, PS3 owners will not get the full opening story for this franchise.  Instead, they are given an interactive comic book overview that allows the players to make the big choices from ME1.  While this was a brilliant work-around, the end result is far less engaging and emotionally taxing than playing through the first game.  While this makes the tough calls easier to make.....they SHOULDN'T be easier.  The amazing aspect of ME1 was how hard it was to make those choices.  It was also amazing to have some of the side quests that came from my smaller choices from ME1.  However, if you do not have the means to play it on 360, take what you can get.  ME2 is a great game in its own right and even though I missed getting the opportunity to play ME1 on PS3, ME2 delivers in spades even with me having already experienced the game in depth.Simply put, if you have the means to play this on PC or 360, do so.  The ability to buy the games cheaper AND get to really experience the first game is an opportunity no gamer should overlook.  However, I realize that this is not a conceivable route for some.  If a PS3 is all you have, then ignore the naysayers.  This game is a MUST OWN and shouldn't be passed up.  With the hefty amount of DLC added in, it's a powerhouse of gaming that can keep you entertained for a LONG time.  Play it however you want on whatever you want.......just make sure you play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Despite qualifying as a \"CoD fanboy,\" I am not impressed.","reviewText":"Video game reviews are extremely subjective.  For that reason, I will list some caveats and you can continue reading or move on based on those.1.  My first multiplayer CoD experience was with CoD4 (Modern Warfare 1), which I consider to be an extremely good game.2.  I loved MW2, both multiplayer and spec ops.3.  I was apprehensive of Black Ops at first, but ended up playing it extensively, more than any prior CoD, both by myself and with parties of friends.  It has many flaws such as terrible sound effects, but overall it was well supported and a lot of fun.4.  I really enjoy Zombies, but am fully aware that the MW series does not contain this mode.5.  I play the CoD campaigns, before doing anything else with the game, and eventually redo them on veteran and collect the intel for the achievements.6.  I don't mind the game being nearly identical in appearance to MW2, because [see note 2]7.  I don't own any Battlefield game and when I tried BF3 at a friend's house, I did not care for it...without teamwork, it was just a lot of running around the map. (I'm sure it is better with a cooperating team).If this sounds similar to you, then read on.  If not, then my review probably won't suit you.  Please don't downvote a review because you disagree with the opinions in it.As seen in my list of caveats, I enjoy Call of Duty in general and the Modern Warfare series in particular, so it was only natural that I pre-ordered MW3 and got the Hardened edition because 1) I could and 2) I thought the idea of getting the DLC maps early with the Elite Premium subscription was a nice bonus.Upon receiving the game, I popped it in and quickly played through the campaign on \"Regular\" difficulty, my usual method for a new CoD.  I generally return to the campaign a couple of years down the road on a rainy day and play it on Veteran, cheaply using the online Call of Duty wiki to quickly find the intel items (I prefer not to poke about the map excessively while on Veteran mode).  I was fairly happy with the campaign; people have been saying it was short, but it was no shorter than any prior CoD.  I completed it in 5 hours on Regular.  The campaign, as usual, featured a nice variety of actions ranging from standard run-and-gun to the typical stealth mission and a couple of neat additions such as a remote-control miniature tank.  The feel, graphics, and handling of the game were nearly identical to MW2, which I both expected and enjoyed.  MW2 was a well-made game.Upon starting up multiplayer, however, my feelings about the game plummeted to an all-time low, and have unfortunately stayed there.  In the past, I could not get enough of CoD games.  I would play for hours, then end up on a losing streak and finally quit.  Within another hour or so, I would be refreshed and eager to play some more.  I racked up nearly 40,000 kills in Black Ops in about 10 months, which is far fewer than many people, but still a significant amount for someone with a full-time job.  With MW3, on the other hand, I am not even halfway to my first prestige, and would honestly not care if the disc caught on fire and was destroyed.Why this sudden change of heart?  I have several reasons for really, really, really disliking MW3 online.1. LAG.  I have a good internet connection and experience no lag (or minor) on all other games.  Borderlands, Black Ops zombies, 75% of Black Ops multiplayer, Forza Motorsport, you name it.  Smooth and clean.  Then I play MW3, and EVERY SINGLE MATCH features significant and sometimes intolerable lag.  This is not OK and leaves me nothing short of infuriated.2. Maps.  In prior CoD games, the maps were unique, distinct from each other, well-made with good hiding spots, cover, and open areas to watch out for, and in the case of Black Ops, interactive features such as doors.  Areas of the map could be quickly identified to teammates with simple words.  In MW3, however, all the maps seem remarkably similar.  Many of them feature recycled buildings from MW2, which seems slightly cheap since the game developers had 2 years to work on it.  Finally, most of the maps are so cluttered with debris, narrow alleys, and multiple windows, that employing any sort of strategy is nearly impossible.  My \"strategy\" has been to run around haphazardly, shoot at people, and hope I have a better connection than them.  Keep in mind that I was a fairly solid Black Ops player who could move systematically around the maps and nearly always achieve a kill/death ratio greater than 1.  Not the case with MW3.3. Spawns.  Due to the cramped nature of the maps, enemies will frequently spawn behind you and quickly get a cheap kill.  The spawn mechanics are nothing short of terrible.4. Killstreaks.  The developers may have thought they were doing people a great favor by making the killstreak rewards chain together (i.e., kills given by a killstreak reward count toward the next reward, as was NOT the case in Black Ops), but what this ended up doing was causing what I like to call a \"killstreak fest.\"  The entire game consists of announcements about the next incoming helicopter/stealth bomber/spy plane/recon drone/etc. as aerial attacks bombard the playing area.  Normally I would say kudos to those people doing well enough to achieve those rewards, but when their bomber granted them a helicopter, it's not so impressive anymore...just annoying.I will say right now that I cannot give a complete and objective view of the multiplayer modes in MW3.  I simply haven't played enough to do that.  And the reason I haven't played enough is that I don't even want to.  If a game is not fun at all, I am not going to force myself to play it.  Sadly, this is the case with MW3 online.  Some people might quickly throw out the \"you're just bitter because you suck\" line.  I will not deny the fact that I \"suck\" at MW3, but once again I have been a moderately successful CoD player in the past.  Not being familiar with the game's nuances is certainly part of my trouble, but the above mentioned problems are also a big part and a great deal of the reason why I don't want to play and therefore WON'T get better.  I was terrible at Black Ops and MW2 when I first started, but found those games fun enough to keep trying and eventually overcome this.Finally, the game contains the spec ops/survival mode feature, which can be played solo or co-op.  This is a fun part of the game; spec ops is basically the same as MW2 with new missions (I enjoyed this in MW2) and survival mode is new but is a wave-based mode like zombies, except that the enemies shoot back.  I find it rather enjoyable, if not very difficult when multiple Juggernauts spawn and begin closing in.The game is not all bad.  The graphics are about the same as MW2, but it is hard to expect great improvements on the same generation of console.  The 360's graphics card and processor can only do so much.  The sound effects are awesome and a huge step up from Black Ops, whose guns sounded like airsoft replicas or worse yet, someone spitting into a tin can.  The new create-a-class features which include Weapons Proficiencies and more customizable options are a nice progression from the previous titles.And now, a word about Elite.  Unless you are really desperate to acquire the DLC maps one at a time each month instead of in packs, there is little reason to purchase the costly Elite Premium subscription.  I have a year free due to buying the game's Hardened edition, and therefore won't have to pay for the map packs because they are included.  However, even if I finally get into the game and start enjoying the multiplayer, I won't be renewing that subscription.  The free version of Elite is quite sufficient, in my opinion, and actually a step backward from Black Ops, which contained many of those features (Combat Record) right there in the multiplayer instead of in a separate and standalone application.  The loss of player cards and the associated info seems like a serious downgrade from Black Ops, but I guess Sledgehammer/IW had to do things differently from Treyarch.Overall, I am not particularly happy with MW3.  It has its good points, and the co-op modes are quite fun, but the multiplayer is riddled with problems and lacks the compelling addictiveness of the prior games.  Again, much of this is my opinion, but I feel that I am not alone in thinking this way.  Unlike other reviewers, I will not claim \"If you liked MW2, you will love MW3,\" because for me this is completely false.  Judge carefully and buy at your own risk...or rent.  I should have done it that way.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}

The game still plays like a medieval Metroid, similar to the classic Symphony of the night, but where as the 3D Castlevanias feel stale, and tired somehow the GBA (and now graduating to the NDS) games have managed to remain fresh, and wonderful for more than 5 games in a row even though the core game play has remained unchanged.Dawn of Sorrow may have a bit of an odd name, lie its predecessor it's not really an emotional story, but one thing that it does have over Castlevanias of yore, your character, Soma, IS Dracula (reincarnated), and I thought playing Dracula's son was neat. The story isn't very deep, or involved, but the characters therein are still quite cool, and there is just enough story to keep you playing for the 8-12 hours it'll take to complete the main quest. Additionally, one advantage CVDS has over Aria of Sorrow, is that this one is quite challenging, where as AoS was a little on the easy side. Best of all the game features a new weapon synthesis system, which enables you to combine weapons with the souls Soma has stolen to create a new and more powerful weapon. I ended up getting the Grim Reaper's scythe, which, while slow, is insanely powerful. It's quite cool.Additionally the level designs are quite intuitive, and beautiful. The game incorporates a number of tricks to give the appearance of a depth that I haven't noticed in a side scroller before. It makes me wonder what a 2D side-scroller could do on a next gen system. On top on that, the game also has some of the finest graphics I have seen in a side scroller with very little aliasing, and no grain to the DS picture.Another innovation I appreciated was the ability to see the castle map on the top screen, which helped keep the action more consistent rather than breaking it up the way past installments did any time you needed to look at the map.This game also features the best alternative play mode, which allows you to play as Julius Belmont, Yoko, and Alucard, regretfully, however, this mode does not permit for the player to collect or purchase healing items, which would be tremendously helpful when up against some of the game's tuff bosses.In all, however, this game is the 2nd best 2D Castlevania to date, and the 1st game that has made me pick up my DS again (after both my DS and my PSP have been collecting dust for a while) and thankfully this game seems to have ushered in a flood of must have games for the system, as it was the first of a huge handful of new titles for the handheld that I've picked up over the last few weeks.If you had previously dismissed the DS as a viable handheld, this is the game that will change your mind!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

It's a relaxing, easy to play and often challenging game. You get 3 vehicles with 1 variation each and they all have their own use. E.g. If you're searching for the 120 balloons on Free Flight, use the Jet Plane to fly around faster and spot them.I'm at 6 hours into it and I've completed all the balloons/flight rings/trophies and I'm only missing 1 golden ring for the hanglider and finishing the last Platinum Medal course. So let me just say that I've had more fun playing Pilotwings Resort than MW2's single player campaign... lol... and even though it's a totally opposite game, all 6 hours in Pilotwings were relaxing and stress relieving. Is the $40 price tag (currently) worth it? I'd say yes.

{"product_name":"B002I08VDI","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"A Great Way to Kick Off the Nintendo 3DS","reviewText":"As the only 3DS launch title that I bought, I had decent hopes for Pilotwings Resort. It seemed as an excellent way to showcase the Nintendo 3DS and what it can do, and while it certainly does that, it falls flat with presentation and lasting appeal.Pilotwings Resort is the third entry in the highly beloved Pilotwings series, with the first two games being on the SNES and N64, respectively. The basic premise of Pilotwings Resort is that it's a flight simulation game in which you fly around Wuhu Island (same one from Wii Sports/Fit) in a variety of vehicles. The game is split into two huge modes: Mission Mode and Free Flight Mode.Mission Mode is self-explanatory, and has you fly around the island completely missions of various difficulties. These can range from anything to flying through hoops, landing on pads, or even putting out fires. The missions start out easy, but difficulty ramps up from gold on, and there are some brutal missions at the end. The game encourages you to get 3 stars in each mission, so as to unlock collectibles such as more vehicles or a super secret unlockable at the end.Free Flight Mode is also what you'd expect, but there is enough to keep you satisfied with its many unlockables. You can choose what vehicle to fly: plane, hover pack, or hanglider, and also what time of day. You start out with only 2 minutes in free flight mode, but that number is increased by the amount of unlockables you collect around the island. These range from I Points, which give you information about places around the island, to trophies with your Mii on them.Speaking of Miis, they are the star of the show here, and show up in a multitude of places around the island. Collecting all these unlocks dioramas (NO WAY!) in the menu, which are fun to look at, especially in 3-D. But, after collecting almost all that's humanly possible, I found myself putting Pilotwings back on the shelf, and putting in Pokemon Black, which is a shame. I'm a bit surprised that multiplayer wasn't considered for Pilotwings, and the game would be a great fit.The graphics in Pilotwings Resort are breathtaking, and soaring around the island in a hanglider is a sight to behold. The 3-D isn't a dealbreaker, but it adds an extra sense of depth to missions, such as judging the distance between objectives or figuring when to turn, and this adds some strategy to the game. The music is simple elevator tunes, with some notable remixes from the previous two titles.Pilotwings Resort is an excellent launch title, and shouldn't be missed by anyone who owns a 3DS. It isn't a masterpiece by any means, but it's enough to keep you satisfied until the next batch of 3DS games are released.Pros:Excellent GameplayBeautiful GraphicsCons:Low Replay ValueNot Enough Variety","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2011"}

I had played my ps2 more than my xbox or my gamecube.  But I changed my mind and went for a wii.  I saw someone one amazon saying you could pre order it from f.y.e.  So I did and they called me to come get it a week before Christmas.  I had also pre ordered zelda.  When I first started playing zelda I didn't really get into it.  But now I'm stuck.  The way you have to play games on the wii is great.  It takes something old (video games) and adds something totally new in it's controls.  Also the online aspect is very easy to use and set up.  I think it took me all of 10 minutes to get online with it.  The store is set up very well.  Even if you normally have a hard time figuring things like it out, you will have no trouble here.  The colors of the menus are very nice.  Everything has a relaxed feeling.  You get to set up your own mii.  A mii is a little person you can create on the wii.  You can create as many as you'd like.  This may seem stupid but I assure you that is is not.  The size and weight of the system are all great.  When your moving it around you can do it with ease.  It has a very easy to open door on top that allows you to connect your gamecube controllers as well as your game cube memory cards.  It is so easy to get everything up and ready to play that you just feel perky when your through.  The only thing I would say annoys me is the wired controler bar.  Go on amazon or to ebgames and get the wireless sensor bar.  It is only 19.99 and it works great.  So in closing the wii may not have the highest graphics, HD support or online games but if you get one and play once you will find yourself saying. \"who cares?\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2007"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Man this is fun","reviewText":"I'll admit I was skeptical at first, but I have to say that Nintendo's wonderous Wii is a sight to behold.  The motion sensored remote controls may seem gimmicky at first, and even hard to get a hold of for some, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be immersed in some of the most intuitive gaming unlike anything else you've experienced.  And unlike the PS3, the Wii features a bevy of excellent launch titles, and many of them are exclusive to the system.  The Wii includes Wii Sports, which is a great showcase for just what this system is capable of.  The game itself is a nice distraction and a taste of things to come for the system.  Yeah, the graphics aren't mouthwatering like what you see on the XBox 360 or Playstation 3, and it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the other systems have either, but it's the games that make the system worth owning.  The Wii is compatiable with Gamecube games and controlers, plus it also features the ability to go online to the Wii's \"Virtual Console\" and download classic NES, Super NES, and Nintendo 64 games, as well as Genesis and Turbo-Grafx 16 titles; which in itself is an awesome extra that may rival that of XBox Live Arcade, maybe.  The list of first party games are great, including Excite Truck and of course Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and third party titles like Rayman Raving Rabbids, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, Call of Duty 3, Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz, and Madden '07 all fit in quite well on the Wii.  Upcoming titles like Super Mario Galaxy and the next installment in the Metroid Prime series, make purchasing the Wii all the sweeter, and the ultra affordable price should help seal the deal.  Yes, some people won't get the controls, and many may be turned off by the lack of mature games, but for what it's worth, the Wii is the best thing Nintendo has crafted in a while.  All in all, if you're looking for a next-gen system with a ton of potential, the Wii is a glimpse at what the future of gaming could be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}

Fulkerson","summary":"Two steps forward, one step back","reviewText":"The Madden football series is still the best football experience you can have in a video game.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with Madden 2011, and in fact, there are several aspects that are better than ever.  I don't look for huge evolutionary leaps forward each year in the Madden franchise as I simply like to play with the updated rosters.  If you don't mind shelling out your hard-earned cash for a few simple improvements and all the glory of a fresh new roster, then you'll be pleased.  If you're looking for huge innovations in the Madden franchise, you may want to stay away.First of all, the improvements that have been made this year are pretty damn good, and almost every improvement lies in the gameplay which is exactly where they should be.  One of the most annoying parts of the Madden franchise in the past has been sloppy player movements and somewhat sluggish controls on offense.  For instance, in past Maddens when a player is catching a pass in the backfield, your player would run backwards, sprint out of bounds, or just stall for a second until he got gang tackled.  It was highly annoying when you were 4th and 2, you'd throw a screen pass to a wide open running back, he would catch it, and then start running backwards for a step or two, or just head straight out of bounds.  This sort of thing would never happen in a real game, and Madden 2011 has thankfully addressed this problem.  The flow of the game is very smooth, and when you throw a pass to someone on the run, they will catch it and not lose stride.  Also, there is just a general smoothness in the player movements that hasn't existed before.  Running, blocking, catching, throwing, and jumping are all very fluid and intuitive, and your player only goes in the direction you tell him to.  This sounds elementary, I know, but anyone who has played Madden in the past knows that sometimes your players would not run in the direction you told them to!Another great aspect of Madden 2011 is virtually everything is an option.  Everything to injuries, to commentary, to whether or not you want to fight for a fumble, to coaching options, etc.  You can customize your game anyway you want to, and it makes it far more enjoyable.  Additionally, the graphics are simply superb.  I thought last year's graphics were great, but there were definitely some animations that needed some major polishing.  For instance, in Madden 2010, one of the funniest animations was the quarterbacks on the phone talking to their coaches in the booth, and for the most part, the guys looked just like they do in real life.  However, if you ever played as Carson Palmer you will know that his animation looked like a bulldog with a 60 pound head who just chewed on a bumblebee.  It was NOT flattering.  For the most part, all of the players look like themselves in fine detail.Something else that I'm extremely glad EA got rid of from the 2010 edition are the referee conferences.  They were SO inane and SO boring, and they have completely removed them this year.  There is nothing more annoying than when you're playing defense, and you have the offense at 4th and 23, they throw a 6 yard pass, and the referee's bunch together to discuss whether the receiver kept both feet in bounds.  Err, does it matter??  It really slowed the 2010 edition down, and we are spared that nonsense this year.  Another great addition are the receivers dragging their feet to try and stay inbounds.  In the past, the receivers would just blindly run their routes, and if that meant they had to run 20 yards out of bounds they would do it.  It was silly, and 2011 has corrected that problem.The things that annoy me about this game are, thankfully, options as well, but they do detract just enough from the gameplay to merit a mention.One of the worst gimmicks that the Madden franchise has ever thought up is the new \"Gameflow\" option.  And make no mistake about it, \"Gameflow\" is an OPTION.  Lest anyone think you HAVE to play with \"Gameflow\", you absolutely do not.  Basically, \"Gameflow\" lets you pre-choose your plays, and the computer will select a few plays that will supposedly work on any given situation in a game.  It's a poor man's gimmick, and any self-respecting football fan who knows anything about the game will simply scoff at using it.  It's a clear attempt from EA to reach out to those who are basically clueless about the game of football, and \"Gameflow\" is one step away from just letting the computer play for you.  You have an extremely limited amount of control with \"Gameflow\" which takes away from what makes the game of football great: complete and total unpredictability.  I suppose people who know nothing about football might appreciate it, but why would someone who knows nothing about football play Madden?  Considering that \"Gameflow\" is pretty much the only major new addition to the series this year, I would say it's an epic fail.Another weird gimmick on EA's part is the option to speed up your games.  On the back of the game case it says \"experience all of the drama of full games in as little as 30 minutes\".  And, why is that something we'd want to do?  The entire reason football fans play Madden is for its realism.  Cutting the game in half wouldn't enhance the drama, it would simply cut the game in half, no more no less.  I'm not sure why this would be a selling point.  I guess EA is pandering to the ADD-addled masses by making the game scream by faster than ever.Another annoying aspect of Madden this year is something that has always been a problem with the series, and it's a bummer that they chose not to correct it along with the other old annoyances that HAVE been corrected.  For some reason, in the game of Madden, if you get a big point lead on the opposing team they will move hell and high water in the third quarter to come back and destroy you.  It only happens in the third quarter, but it's so obvious I feel like it warrants a mention.  For instance, when I play the computer, and I enter halftime with a 28-7 lead, the computer will jump 10 feet in the air to intercept passes, moonwalk sideways 30 yards at a time to make an interception, and skillfully build brick walls with its defensive line in order to give my running back a 4 yard loss on every play.  It's very unrealistic, and the computer's defense can get very ghost-like with its players simply moving the earth to bury your offense.  The AI level has always been a tricky thing in Madden, and it still seems kind of off.The most irritating thing, by FAR, about Madden 2011 is the absolutely DREADFUL commentary from Gus Johnson.  There has been some bad commentary with Madden in the past, but this is simply the worst ever.  For those of your who don't recognize the name, he's the dope who screeched into the microphone last year during that terrible Bengals/Broncos game when Brandon Stokely scored on that total luck pass at the end of the game.  It was the most boring game of all time, and he made it extra bad with his wailing and yelling.  He does the same thing here in Madden 2011, and all I can say is thank GOD the commentary is optional.  I like Chris Collingworth's commentary, so it's a bummer that he is drowned out by Johnson's foolishness.In the end, Madden 2011 is nothing remarkably special, but it's still the best option out there.  People buy these games to play with the updated rosters and stay updated with the NFL, and in that respect this series never disappoints.  Any true fan of Madden knows that they aren't going to get a game that is vastly different from the last incarnation, and that's just fine for us.  I've bought every edition of Madden for ten years now, and just like the last ten games I give Madden 2011 four stars.  Each year EA comes at you with a gimmick, and if that kind of thing is important to you, you'll probably be disappointed.  If you're smart enough to ignore these gimmicks, and have made yourself acquainted with the Madden franchise over the years, you already know you'll be playing it each and every day until the next installment is released.  That's called consistency, my friends, and knowing that, I am happy to be a repeat customer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}

Play it, however, and it is an extremely fun shooter that stands out from the crowd due to it's unique teamwork-based gameplay, it's deep level cap, and it's epic scale (256 players... HOLY $@#%!!!!). And yet, among it's strong points, are a few flaws that often hinder your enjoyment. However, as long as you can look past these problems, you have a shooter like no other.MAG is unlike any shooter you've played before. It is a multiplayer only title, with an intense focus on teamwork. Play MAG like MW2, and the game is an utter failure, with moments of infuriating frustration. But if you ditch the lone-wolf philosophy and cooperate with your squad-mates, the game becomes an utterly fantastic FPS.You start out MAG with character customization. You choose between three factions, S.V.E.R, Valor, or Raven. Each faction has different weapons and equipment, but they aren't drastically different from one another. So, regardless of your faction choice, the gameplay is the same for each. Anyways, after choosing a faction, you go on to creating your character. Character creation isn't very deep, but this is a minor complaint. While character customization is limited, weapon customization is fairly deep. You can attach a wide variety of suppressors and bipods to your weapon, and there is also a wide variety of sniper rifles, assualt rifles, shotguns, and SMG's available for purchase.Step onto the battlefield, and you are presented with a very steep learning curve. Initially, it's rather hard to grasp the concept of teamwork, especially players who have been playing CoD all these years. However, you eventually master the learning curve, and you'll be coordinating with your squad-mates in no time.There are four game modes: Suppression, Sabotage, Acquisition, and Domination. Suppression is the only game type to accept lone-wolf play, as it's basically MAG's version of Team Deathmatch. Sabotage is a game mode where you either protect or destroy two command posts. If the attackers holds both command posts at the same time, then a third post opens up. If the attackers destroy this post, the defenders lose. In Acquisition, the attackers must capture and escape with two transport vehicles. The defenders must prevent them from escaping with them. This is actually the most confusing game type, as I often don't know a transport has been stolen until the battle commander informs me so. Despite that, this is still a fun game type. Finally, Domination is the biggest game mode of the four; it supports 256 players. In Domination, the attackers must capture and hold eight command posts. The longer they hold these positions, the more damage is done to the defenders facility. After the damage meter at the top of the screen has been filled up, the defenders lose.As I stated earlier, MAG is based around teamwork. Well, this is my first complaint: the players themselves. I'm guessing around 60% of the people who play MAG are running-and-gunning Rambo style idiots who think that they can wipe out an entire room of S.V.E.R. operatives with a few shots from their assualt rifle.If MAG had come out before CoD, then this problem would be absent.However, 40% of the population are intelligent soldiers who know that without teamwork, the battle will be lost. Bigtime. Their squad sticks together, breach the enemy lines, and take control of a command post. MAG would be even better if all of the population was like this.Also, while the impressive player count is one of the strongest points of MAG, it's also one of the weakest. It's good because it makes you feel like you're a part of a war. A big one. However, it's bad because you die more than ever. Even when sticking together, you'll die at least a good 10 times in a match. Be a lone wolf, and you'll die twice, maybe even thrice that amount.There is also a minor complaint about sniping. Due to the immense maps, there are a lot of sniping spots, but the immense maps also make sniping a bit hard. Even after I bought a high magnification scope, I still couldn't see my enemies as close up as I would have expected. This definitely brings challenge to the art of long-range combat, but it isn't as easy as you would expect. Also, sniping is really only supported in two of the four game types. The Suppression and Sabotage maps are perfect for sniping, but the Acquisition and Domination maps aren't that sniper friendly. You're gonna be forced to switch between sniper to assualt trooper when playing these two game modes. This is an extremely minor complaint, though, and sniping is still pulled off extremely well in MAG.However, all these problems aren't big enough to derail the experience. MAG still remains a fun experience throughout, even with the ocassional frustrating match and difficult sniping.But what about the visuals accommodating the action? The graphics stay competent throughout the entire experience. Textures and animation are impressive, and so does the framerate and lighting effects. And yet the game isn't as visually striking as CoD. The game runs at a good 30 fps, but it's not quite as good as the 60 fps that CoD has. Same can be said for the environments. They definitely aren't bad, but they don't look quite as good as CoD. The visuals are still strong, but they aren't anything eye-poppingly good.However, the audio in MAG is almost unmatched. Crisp THX sound effects sound awesome, the music fits the game suprisingly well, and the cries of agony that the soldiers shout out while injured really make you feel like you're in a war. The audio in MAG is unmatched, even by CoD standards.I must also state that you will be hooked on MAG for quite some time. The level cap is suprisingly deep, with multiple levels of equipment, weapons, and uniforms. Even after the level cap has been conquered, you can start the game over with a different faction. There are always reasons to come back to MAG, even with the CoD games also sitting on your shelf.I love MAG. This unique, teamwork based FPS is easily one of the best war games out there. Sure, the game can be easily frustrating at times when your team refuses to cooperate, and there are other problems that can hinder your enjoyment from time to time, but these flaws are easily forgiven when your team finally embraces the game's teamwork gameplay.

{"product_name":"B000TUZCQI","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"enjoy the best game ever","reviewText":"This is where it all began, folks.  Many of us who grew up in the 80's remember this game fondly, because back then, we didn't have as big of a gaming selection as we do today.  We only had a few games, and Super Mario Bros. was one of them.You know what though?  People seem to think we must have had it rough back then, only having a few games available for the NES in the mid 80's.  Not much in the way of variety.  But the truth (the HONEST truth) is this- the smaller choices we had, the more we appreciated the few games we had, unlike today where games seem to be designed with the intention of sucking out as much storyline elements as possible and quickly moving on to the next game to find out about the conclusion of said storyline.Back in the day we didn't play games like that.  We'd wait patiently for a new groundbreaking gaming experience to take us by surprise.  Oh and trust me- the new innovations back then *were* incredible.  Unlike anything we'd seen previously.  It seemed like a few new amazing things happened every year.  This really helped the replay value shoot through the roof.Really, do people even care as much about video games today?  It's not like new, groundbreaking features are coming along anymore (except for the Wii and that amazing Nintendo controller, but nothing revolutionary concerning the GAMES themselves are being made anymore).No, back in the mid 80's, small platform games laid the foundation for what was soon to come.  Every single year sparked a new innovation.  The first Super Mario Bros. was popular, fun, and playable for just about anyone, and THAT is what matters most of all.  It mattered back then, and it matters now.The object is to just blow through the short levels collecting mushrooms and coins, jumping across platforms, and finding the best way to deal with the amazing enemies throughout the levels.  That's it.  Simple genius I like to call it.The fact that the game features water and castle levels shows that Nintendo was really onto something huge back then, and they would continue to make one quality Mario game after another while building and expanding on the water and castle levels for future games.  Not just Mario games either- how many games these days have water and castle themes?  That's right- literally *thousands*.Sometimes the first is extremely important, and this game is a perfect example of that.  Experience brilliance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HCNI","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Fun, immersive, 3D, and sore shoulder","reviewText":"I bought this game for my kids, who played through Lego Star Wars, followed Clone War series, and loved to battle with other kids using the light saber toys. Like any \"teen\" rated games and movies, I do the screening since my kids are pre-teen. This review is based on me playing almost 3 hours finishing the story mode (campaign mode), and about 1 hour on other features. And I swear I nearly popped my shoulder twice swinging too hard!The story mode is branched off from the prequel trilogy, sometime within the Clone Wars. It starts with basic training and then gets on with the action. You can start as a \"Padiwan\" or \"Jedi\". In Padiwan mode, if you die in a battle you get re-spawned immediately and continue battle without restarting from a checkpoint. This is obviously designed to minimize frustration and keep the momentum of the story. The battle with enemies can be on a spaceship or on planet surface. There are no shortage of space and land vehicle battles as well. The actions are almost non-stop. The most resting time I had are during longer cut-scenes and loading next chapter.This story mode reminds me of Time Crisis series on PlayStation consoles. When finished battling one section, the story automatically \"fast forward\" and take you to the next area, even though that next area is few foot steps away. There is no full directional movement options with your body or use of a physical controller. The story mode is good to go through once or twice. But after that, I think most people will just go to battle in the Duels of Fate mode, race and bump in the Podracing mode, or go be a Rancor to level buildings and throw things around. The Rancor Rampage is really fun if you are in a destructive mood, and you can actually do a full 360-degree directional movement which couldn't be done in story mode. As for the Galactic Dance Off mode in front of Jabba? Well, it's a mini dance game with Star Wars characters in front of Jabba (first location). It's definitely intriguing! If I have a party and use one of the Kinect Dance off games, I would love to see the expressions of the party guests when I pop this in unexpectedly!Generally, the graphics (cartoon'ish) is pretty much same of the Clone Wars cartoon series. Music is Star Wars derived. As far as controls go, it's Kinect! The good is the ability to perform like a Jedi during battle to get that in-the-action experience. The bad? Well, typical Kinect recognition issue. With an optimal light and well calibrated sensor, I think I got 90%+ accuracy. Of course, the time Kinect doesn't recognize seem to always be making that final strike to kill an enemy!The game is fun for me at first, but 3 hours into the story mode I wasn't quite as enthusiastic battling the same way over and over again... Maybe after my sore shoulder recovers! I've seen enough of the action and the language to deem it acceptable for my pre-teen kids. I actually think the game is enjoyed most by kids, especially mine who like to participate in light saber battle.In terms of soreness/calorie burning index (if there is one), this game is up there... Not only lots of swinging, but a lot of jumping (to strike from behind). It's not far from fitness games since player tends to over exert in battle!*UPDATE 1: Kids Play*---------------------My two grade level kids played 1/3 of the Dark Side rising story mode so far, and they loved it. One tends to use force to defeat enemies, and the other prefers to charge, swinging lightsaber, jump, and flip. Both are difficult to pry away from the game. This game will be the favorite with their friends for sure.*UPDATE 2: 3D Play*--------------------I got to setup Xbox/Kinect with my 3D Sharp XV-Z17000 1080p Projector on 125-inch screen. For comparison purposes, I use a PS3 for 3D blu-ray movies as well as games in 1080p mode. The main menu of this game goes into 1080p mode, but each game feature changed the display mode to 720p. For true assessment, I put my projector in native mode, which means 720p is shown at around 70\" instead of 125\". I've also set to the highest 3D depth option (there are low, medium, and high 3D).* Story and Duel modes: The character you are playing is clearly separated from the rest. Others moving objects have a little bit of depth (consistent with most games supporting 3D). All cut scenes/movies are in 2D, which are also normal for other 3D games. However, for this game there are a lot of short video clips (2-5 seconds) that are mixed with game play, makeing it hard to really appreciate any subtle 3D effects. Overall I don't think 3D adds much to these games.* Rancor Rampage: in this game also everything are pretty much in-screen, but 3D depth is more pronounced. Probably because Rancor is such a big object.* Dance Off: The three characters dancing on the floor in front of Jabba are separated from the rest. The final hold produce a flash that has a little bit of out-of-screen (OOS) effect.* Pod Racing: Now this one has the most pronounced 3D. To the best of my estimation, the player's vehicle has about 3/4 of the chasis out-of-screen! There appear good delineation between vehicles on the side and immediate front. There are also times I can see the debris ahead as clear 3D objects as well. The final winners' podium is nicely presented 3D for the first, second, and third place drivers. Heck, the entire podium seems to be lifted.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme. Stick with it and you may find real time fast-forwarding by.--Porter B.

It takes a while to figure out all the ins and outs (first time trying to move out of mom's house I died 3 times before getting the hang of it). But once you get going there is no end of fun.

Unfortunatley with the expanding war between Longardia (rosa is under their control) and Draxil his dreams are fading further away. One day Jaster is returning to the city from a hunting trip when a beast suddenly attacks the city.  Knowing that he is one of the few who might have a chance against the beast Jaster rushes toward the center of the city where he bumps into a mysterious stranger who helps him fight off some of the attacking beasts. After the battle the stranger gives him a strange sword, wishes him luck and disappears. Not long afterward he finds the rune beast attacking the city and also two men who claim to be space pirates and are looking for someone named Desert Claw and Desert Claw had a sword that looked a lot like the one that Jaster is holding....  so begins the story on how a case of mistaken identity sets Jaster and his crew of misfits on a journey to find the lost planet of Eden, which legend tells was the the richest planet in the galaxy before it disappeared 10,000 years earlier. Soon though a simple treasure hunt turns into a race to beat the evil Daytron corporation from using Eden for its own evil (though profitable) ends. Will Jaster find Eden before Daytron? Will getting to Eden save the galaxy from Daytron or did Eden disappear for a more sinister reason?--------- (some minor spoilers)To start off I did like this game. It is a bit straight forward, all the pieces fall into place like your standard RPG. In some parts of the game it did look like the developers were trying to go a bit deeper with the story and character backgrounds but that just kinda falls flat for some reason, Final Fantasty, Mass Effect or Suikoden it it is not. Also around the middle of the game the reason for Eden disappearing involves the messing around with of time. Which to me is where the story starts to unravel a little, the characters talk about 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000 time periods like they were nothing and one of the characters apparently spent about 9980 yrs floating around in space with her robot body guard until she was found by the space pirates. I know its a video game rpg and a fantasy/scifi one at that but still it would have been nice if the last half of the story made a little more sense. The only other complaints I had was the dungeons and the leveling combining process. Mostly the dungeons are the same with different wall paint or backgrounds slapped on, which I didn't really mind because the combat system is great in this game (though it can get repetive because the enimes don't change much either, they just change colors)and I could happily wack away for a couple of hours and come back the next day and do it again. But the problem is that there is only x amount of weapons to combine before combining any more starts to actually weaken your weapon. Which means (at least to me) there is no point to keep wacking away at the monsters. It just gets boring diving to the bottom of the dungeons to find items either you don't need or weaker weapons that can't be leveled and combined because they actually make the weapon you have worse. Like another reviewer said completionists will love this game since there is a ton of treasure chests to find, quarrys to track down, and secrets to find. But if your like me once most your characters have weapon that is in the 300 to 400 dmg range, you'll proably just start running through the dungeons because your levels are high enough that a few whacks will kill anything and if it doesn't you have proably unlocked most of the skills so that will polish the rest off. Which makes the end dungeons very annoying because monsters tend to pop up a lot and the dungeons are loooong. Other than those minor issues this is a very enjoyable RPG that will keep most players entertained and playing to find out how the game ends.Summary:Graphics: Bright, clear, and vibrant. Dungeon backgrounds can be a bit repetive.  The CG sequences in this game are definetly worth looking at. Somtimes it suprising they look that good on the PS2.Contorl/Camera: Works, mostly. Somtimes there is so much activity on the screen its hard to figure out where your character is, also unless you can get the hang of the targeting system its usually better just to hit whatever is close so the character locks on without having to to cycle through all the enemies. This can cause some issues during boss battles.Gameplay/story: Gameplay is entertaing until the weapon combining and skill discovery limit is hit and then it can become boring repetive. In my case this did not happen till the end so it wasn't a big deal. The story is a no brainer with indications that it could have gone higher and further. Around the middle of the game the scifi aspect kicks in a little and the story gets a little garbled.Conclusion: I would recommend this game to any one who likes Action RPG's and those who like thier games to have a lot of stuff and secrets to find.m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2008"}

What makes it really great is the ease of use. Even if you've never played a guitar or ever had an itching to try it some strumming, then this is your ticket. You build on your skill level whether your completely to guitar play or an expert. And you'll have a lot of fun doing so. I actually put off using this as a tool to help my guitar play and I'm sorry I did. What are you waiting for it?! Give it a try!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

Helm \"THROW?\"","summary":"Unfortunately, the title and cover were the best part of the game","reviewText":"This game fell very short of the mark in almost all aspectsPros:Storyline:It was neat, but it was pretty obvious. This is especially true about halfway through.Blackbird mission:This mission was pretty neat and could have been the coolest part of the game. However they seemed to rush it out and it felt very unfinished and of course very linear. It was actually the most linear of the game. I still put it as a pro b/c of the idea of it.I hope in the future more games look into this planned strategy and execute missions.Cons:Graphics:They were ok at best. I also want to mention, that graphics are not near as important to me as game play and I understand that there is a trade off. As far as the people that say the graphics and or sound are great, or it is a TV problem, I play on just over an 11 foot 1080p TV with an equally awesome sound setup. Looks great on games with great graphics. Looks average on games with average graphics. This looked average.AI:It was awful, awful, awful! This was true of both your team who would let people run right by them to shoot you and the enemy that would run right by 10 of your guys to shoot you. The AI is no different than AI of 10 years ago. It is absolutely unacceptable.Sound:All the guns sound the same, a grenade sounds like a little firecracker, and it doesn't matter if the sound is a half mile away, or right next to you, it all sounds the same. In a lot of games now, I can feel the concussion of the grenade b/c it hits my sub so hard.Gameplay:It was VERY linear and VERY mundane and monotonous.The mechanics were way too fast and movements were very jerky.I found myself frequently in missions just wanting to get to the end so they would be over. I ended up feeling that way about the game around halfway through.A grenade also has a kill radius half the time of about a foot or two.The \"Stealth\" mission:This game actually got some hype about the stealth mission which was absolutely AWFUL. I would even say it was the worst part of the game. It was strictly a timed mission in that you need to be at this point at this time or you were spotted. You could literally lie down in pitch black dark and then they would just start shooting at you from 50 yards away if your imaginary time ran out. You are also told to stay out of the light although you and your partner must run through it a couple times. To top it all off, the only way to pass it is to run under a bright spotlight and kill a guy.Cover system:Ever since Gears came out with the cover system, why can others not use it? This is especially true in games like this where you can crouch behind a boulder and bullets seem to curve around to get you. My only guess is that they would have to put a small amount of thought into their AI for this, and since they didn't do it anywhere else, they didn't want more work to not do.Fit and Finish:I had to RESTART 3 levels b/c it glitched on me. One example was when you search the crate at the plane crash. I stood by the crate and everyone else just stood about 20 feet back and stared at me. I sat there trying to figure out what I did numerous times and restarting at the checkpoint with no luck. After restarting the level, I went to the crate and my team followed and inspected immediately and everything worked fine.I just rented this game and had no desire to even try multiplayer. I took it back early and don't regret it one bit. I recommend others do the same. If you like it for some reason, good for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Noname","summary":"UPDATE: What My Children Think","reviewText":"My nine year-old daughter bought this game just this Saturday. She stopped playing because she didn't want to beat the game. Her brother has X and he finished in two days. This is what she's telling me.THE GOOD:+ players can pick what they look like and their clothes+ players can have a megastone that evolves the pokemon during battle multiple times and it makes the pokemon stronger+ there's a new fairy type pokemon (it's cool to have a new type of pokemon)+ Team Flare, a team that tries to take over the universe, are interesting because they love to look good during battle+ there's a new awesome legendary, because its moves look cool and it's strong+ they bring back old pokemonTHE BAD:- it's too easy to level up the pokemon- it's too easy to get to the region- only the psychic gym leader is hard- if they're making it that easy, they should have an extra region- they should have more fun stuff (last time, they had your very own avenue)- Team Flare is not hard to beat- it's mostly about people trying to destroy pokemon (more of a tragedy)- it usually takes a week to beat Elite 4, but it was really fast- too expensive for something we can beat in two daysHOW'S THIS DIFFERENT FROM POKEMON X?Legendary pokemon is different and when Charizard evolves from megastone, he's orange (not black, like in X). The game is overall essentially the same.OVERALL IMPRESSIONIt's fun but they could have made it a lot harder to beat. It's way too easy.______________________ADDENDUM 10/27/13: I tried to do a review for Pok&eacute;mon X, but Amazon apparently thinks the two are the same and won't let me write one for X because I wrote one for Y. I will amend this review with my son's appraisal of the game.The initial ending was battling the Elite 4, but he discovered there's another story with many chapters where he solves mysteries and makes friends with other characters and fights crime. There is only one short story and he beat in less than a day. Now, he's sad and doesn't know what to do in the game because he's finished. He says he still likes it, but he just wanders around in the game.My daughter got grounded and wasn't allowed to play video games for a week. Now, she says she lost her place. She has yet to complete the game and says she's bored, but she's still playing it.My son rates this game four stars: easy but he likes the story. Between the two kids, the average rating is 3 1/2 stars. In keeping with my personal policy of rounding up, I will revise the rating to 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}
