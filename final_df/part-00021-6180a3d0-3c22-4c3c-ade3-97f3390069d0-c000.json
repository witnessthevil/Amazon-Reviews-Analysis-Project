{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"Kevin Meade","summary":"Worthy of its Best Game award","reviewText":"What makes a good game?  Well, for me it is:  A good story.  Believable characters.  Something new.  Quality production.  Depth of Play.  Witcher delivers on all these.  As a bonus, graphics are good, sound is good, voice acting is good.No game is perfect.  I have three beefs with the witcher:  1) my biggest beef is transition time between scenes.  You will spend 25% of your time just waiting for game saves and scene transitions while you play.  It is a pain.  2) controls are somtimes not smooth.  On more than one occassion my character has died becuase he got stuck somewhere and I could not move him.  Stuck between trees and up against walls when it happens.  When I try to get him to run away I want him to run away.  3) copy protection.  There has already been a lot said about it so I won't beat a dead horse.  But I think this game may have actually told me first so I accepted it.In spite of these detractors I give the game five stars.  I find the main character believable, I find the fight strategy better than simple hack and slash but not complex, and I especially like the ingame mini games, particularly the COLLECTABLE CHICK CARDS.  Yes this game was made for guys.As an example of some of the new things this game offers (at least new for me), you can get drunk in the local pubs.  If you can out drink someone else, you usually get a prize.  Best of all, your character will act drunk.  He will walk sideways, his vision will blurr, etc.  There are nice visual affects for it.  Another new thing is the collectable chick cards.  Yes, many of the wenches are bed-able ... if you can figure out the right thing to say, or the right gift to give.  Pay attention to her, give her what she wants, and she just  might give you what you want.This game has plenty of slicing, dicing, and bludgening going on, but that is not what is is really about.  The game is much more like the old days where the focus was the story.  I am glad to see gaming grow up enough that it can have good graphics etc. without worrying about that, and thus get back to gaming roots by producing a game that is story oriented.  After all, the book is always better than the movie right?  That is because the book is about the story and the movie is about special effects.  Games that work the story are always better than those that work the special effects.  Sometimes you get a real winner like The Witcher where you get both.Lastly, the combat strategy of the game is pretty good, because you can continue to grow you character, not just by altering his skills and traits, but also by learning how to use potions, bombs, and signs (minimal magic).  Indeed, best gameplay in combat is achieved by learning how to affectively employ these.  You will find an impossible battle becomes simple when you have the right potions embibed, weapons sharpened and treated correctly, and know your enemy's weakness (signs often help here).  It is not just about you being the six million dollar man (better, faster, stronger), but just as much about knowing what kind of monster you are fighting and what it is susceptible to and thus using the right tactic.  You won't be on the lookout for bigger and better weapons and armor, instead you will be on the lookout for books with the knowledge you need.  Read the books, build up your knowledge base to consult later.  Use that knowledge when the going gets tough.If you are like me, you find only about one game in ten you buy is actually worth the money you paid, and more importantly worth your time spent playing it.  The Witcher is a \"one in ten\".  Well worth the time you will spend playing it.UPDATESo I fininshed it.  I had computer problems for a while and did without one for six months or so.  I finally caved (in part because of work issues) and bought a much higher end system from EWIZ.  It is great and this game is great on it.  I started over from the begining and this time I paid much more attention to the other aspects of the game besides the sword play.  In particular I learned to use the signs and I played the game on a higher difficulty level.  Even with high difficulty, knowing the signs and using potions properly made the game much easier to play and much more enjoyable.  The signs get rediculously powerful in their top tiers so it pays to max them out even at the expense of some of the other skill trees.  So you really can play a brute force character, or a sign bent character and the play is different.  Either way, use your potions.  Like Gerault says, a witcher without his potions is only half a witcher.Hail Flavius!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"High Killing on the High Seas:  How Ubisoft Develops a Great Concept while Beating a Dead Horse of a Franchise","reviewText":"To me Assassin's Creed 3 was mostly boring as the franchise kept getting revived by the defibrillator that is corporate financing and the overly repetitive gameplay just kept coming back with minor upgrades.  It was more of the same every time only, in AC3, you get to buy and sell furniture... and the naval battles.  I loved the naval sequences as it was new and gave you a real sense of adventure.  It got to the point where I would only come back to port if I had to advance the plot and would trudge through that portion just so I could sink more ships at sea when it became available again.  My only other joy from AC3 was the natural conclusion of the Desmond Miles story arc that began with the original AC game in 2007, hoping the franchise would either end or take a radical redirection.As if Ubisoft caught wind (ha) of this, but wanted to keep the franchise alive, they poured more money into developing a fourth AC game but with more prominent nautical gameplay and upgraded graphics.  The characters now utilize that facial capture technology that looked really awkward in LA Noire but looks considerably more streamlined and against a backdrop that looks historically authentic and somewhat beautiful.  However, I do not purchase games for the graphics and, after playing AC4 for a month I can say that, while it is tremendously better than AC3, it is still a beating of the dead horse of a franchise for a few extra $$ from a demographic of gamers that go bonkers every time something sporting the names of their favorite franchises gets released.  AC4 is still just another AC game but I think Ubisoft might be onto something with the whole naval aspect but it lost me when it started with the story.Won't give away the spoilers but the ending of AC3 was the Phoenix for another story arc as you now play a game developer trying to extract memories from Desmond Mile's brain in order to make interactive games.  While the story takes on a more sinister twist it isn't exactly Sixth Sense plot twist surprising and the path leading up to it only made me shake my head as it seemed to parallel Ubisoft staff meetings on &#34;how to milk a franchise more&#34; than &#34;maybe we should make a new franchise.&#34;On top of that, the timeline now backtracks 50 years to the early 18th century in the Spanish Caribbean Isles to romanticize the really unhygienic occupation that is pirating, privateering, and swashbuckling with all the cliches that follow.  Granted it was nice to see a more historically realistic portrayal of Edward Teach (AKA &#34;Blackbeard&#34;), who favored intimidation and theatrics over brute force, but the rest seemed rather archetypal or cliche with the only thing missing to complete the image would be a cameo by Douglass Fairbanks.  The overall story seemed weak if not formulaic with the &#34;templars trying to find artifact A and are stopped by hero B&#34; theme that persists in... all AC titles and Indiana Jones films.  Oh, and where the warm place did the hero, Kenway, learn to fight like that before joining the Order of Assassins?  Seems a little too convenient as it allows the game to bring in an outsider and not disrupt the gameplay.The gameplay, while fun at times, is very repetitive and, often times, annoying sans the naval element.  One seems to spend more time conducting tailing/stealth missions than anything else and, after blowing up a lot of stuff at sea, seems rather counter-balance.  Not to mention such stealth missions should be reserved for Ubisoft's other franchise, Splinter Cell.  It also does not help that the controls for controlling Kenway feel clunky and cumbersome at times particularly when trying to parkour across complex obstacles and overshoot your intended target resulting in a rather nasty steep plunge.  This was something that plagued other AC games and one would think Ubisoft would've figured out how to streamline it by now.  It almost ruins the game.Don't get me wrong, I loved the sea element and it made the game bearable.  Even the simple aspect of just sailing around was relaxing.  It felt like Windwaker and that's not a bad thing.  Not to mention you can now use your currency to purchase ship upgrades to blow more ships up and that's awesome.  If anything, the naval element could be enough to make a different franchise like Pirate's Creed or Loot and Booty.  Just saying.And then there's the multiplayer.  After spending an hour trying to figure out the co-op only to discover that it only exists in an even more repetitive kill-to-extend-your-time-checkpoint kind of gameplay like a more personal version of Carmageddon.  You choose from several cookie-cutter characters in a menu that is anything but user-friendly, and do repetitive missions.  That's about it.  Never tried the competitive multiplayer as I still do not play well with strangers, but unless you have armada vs armada naval battles, I'll just whistle cheery-o and be on my way.  Seriously, why can't anyone make a decent story co-op mode?Now, I'm not saying that AC4 is a bad game, far from it.  It's solid in some areas, super awesome in others, but painstakingly lackluster in the bulk of it.  It's derivative, formulaic, and evolutionary but not evolutionary save for the boating sequence that I cannot get enough of.  It was the only saving real grace of the game as I loved sailing around doing stupid maneuvers and practicing my impression of the thrill pig from that one Geico commercial.  (Weeeeeeeeee!)All in all, fans of the franchise will drool at the mouth while the general audience will shrug and say, &#34;it's not bad.&#34;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"JOHN SPANGLER \"Johnny Spang\"","summary":"It's do or die for Sony in 2008, time to make your move...","reviewText":"I've had this system a year now. Honestly, I've been a bit disappointed with it. Bad system?  Of course not, but I have to admit, I expected more. I've seen slow starts before, but here in early 08, I'm still getting impatient and want some killer titles.My problem is the lack of games. For 6 months I think I saw the same games sticking around at WalMart shelves, mind you, this has nothing to do with the system, oh wait, yes it does, because you need games to play on a system, right?  I don't care how much power this baby has, and I know it does, but where are my games? Hot Shots Golf has been delayed 6 times since launch day, and still nowhere in site. Metal Gear Solid, Gran Turismo, give me my games!!!  But under me being so impatient and wanting mroe, I still find an awesome system under that shiny black hood.One of my big attractions personally was the backwards compatablity. I an comfotably assume, most will want to be able to play their PS1 and Ps2 games on their ps3. I played Rayman from the PS1 for the first time and looks better than ever. The PS3 gives you the option to \"smooth\" or the guru term is \"anti-aliasing\"  all the old games. It's good for older games because on the old systems games suffered from ragged and broken textures, but the PS3 marvelously smooths games out and makes them look more polished. YOu can also choose \"Full screen\" for old games too, which makes the games look great on owners with widescreen TVs.Now I heard they are discontinuing backwards compatibility which is a huge blow for many, so if you can, stick with te 60 or find a 20gig one which I have which still will play all the old games out of the box. I still play my Hot Shots Golf games and they look awesome. I can only assume they are cutting it out to cut costs and make the system cheaper, but I think many will still agree, it's still a mistake...I finally played a must have game, Uncharted - Drakes Fortune. This is what the PS3 needs. It lacks so many genres at the moment it's not even funny. I've heard of games being glitchy and even sometimes unplayable. Fear was mentioned on that list and Madden and College football couldn't even play at a smooth 60 frames per second. Other ported games have also been hammered by critics. But, it's time to move on. Glitches aside, I think the system is finally coming around as I see a bright future as ther are some awesome games coming, Devil May Cry, Metal Gear, Gran Turismo,  Burnout, HOt Shots Golf 5 (finally) and many others.Since I've had it, (over a year now)  one thing holds true, it's reliable. I've used my powerful PS3 to play DVD, Blu Ray DVD, music CD's, etc, you name it, it's used contantly and did not broke down like my 360 did. Sony's system's always seemed to be made well, the PS3 is no exception.The controllers are classic feel, but they feel cheap, and there is no \"vibration\" like we had in the dual shock controllers for the PS2. I heard one is in the making, as that will be nice. The 'no cables\" is still a massive plus, I lvoe wireless controllers and for the most part, they seem to work, but like I said, they feel flimsy and cheap, too bad the sticker price on them doesn't agree.Blu Ray fans will love the PS3. Mind you, I think they are bit pricey, i Mean, lets face it, the prices of blu-ray movies are off the charts, anywhere from 24.99- 40 bucks. The picture, audio, quality is awesome, but is it worth buying a movie that you may already own? I've done the latter, I buy movies I don't own or new releases. The Harry Potter collection is awesome, movies like that are must haves. Spider Man 3 and Ice Age are 2 of the best movies to see in Blu Ray in my opinion.So should you buy a PS3? Well, if you want game selection, lets face it, Wii and 360 have the Ps3 beat right now in early 08. But 08 looks like a watermark year for the system. However,  they are removing \"backwards compatibility\" which I believe that is huge mistake, I mean, do people want to buy a system without being able to play their collection of PS2 and PS1 games? Me personally, I bought my system just for that reason, I have 40 pS2 and 25 PS1 games and they play great. If you lose that ability, it's a big knock. Sure, the system price drops in the process, but what to do with those games we can't play? If you can find one (the 60 gig) or classic 20 gig, you can play them out of the box, if you go for the 80, remember that will not have the BC ability. However, if you're just wanting to play PS3 games, then go for the 80 gig, the more the merrier. 08 looks to be agood year, lets face it, 07 was horirble for Sony, the games were weak at best with only a few exceptions. I say go for it if you have the dough, just expect a while for games to finally get released but expect some good games this summer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2008"}

Possibly the best Castlevania yet!","reviewText":"I say that with a little hesitation because Symphony of the Night (referred to from here on as SOTN) is such an amazing game.  But having recently played Dawn of Sorrow (referred to from here on as DOS) and Portrait of Ruin (referred to from here on as POR), I can safely say this is the best Castlevania on the DS, and safely say it's the best 2-d Castlevania since SOTN, possibly the best ever... possibly.  But that depends on what you are looking for.  I've played nearly every Castlevania since being hooked on the very first release on the NES when I was 10 or so.  Castlevania 2 was one of my favorite games as a kid and I still enjoy playing the first 4 games on an emulator.Ecclesia is an amazing Castlevania title that really ramps up the difficulty from the previous two DS installments.  The music and sound effects are definitely the best of any Castlevania on a portable system, the tunes are much catchier than DOS and POR.  The other big plus is the story, which is pretty fantastic.  It's full of the usual twists and drama, but done in a very tasteful way without too much melodrama.  With lots of fun side quests and optional dungeons towards the end of the game, replay is pretty high.  Plus there are tons of hidden items and chests, which makes this a real treat for completion freaks.  And it does track everything so that you know when you have completed the side quests, monster appendix, glyph list, and item lists.  YES!The single most amazing part of this game is the glyph system.  It's virtually flawless.  You can steal demon attacks by stealing their glyphs.  This can be done in one of two ways: either taking the glyph that sometimes appears when you beat a certain type of demon, or stealing a glyph that a demon or boss is currently charging to attack.  For example, one particular glyph can only be taken from a VERY tough boss later in the game, and you can't get it after you beat him.  He doesn't always use it, and when he does it charges very quickly.  So he's already tough to beat, but trying to get in close and take the glyph in time adds an extra level of difficulty.  Now once you get various glyphs, you set them into particular slots.  And every attack you use takes some MP (which charges up at a stately pace).  So even your normal attacks are glyphs.  Want to use a knife?  We have a glyph for that.  Want to use an axe?  Hey, we gotta glyph for that!  Shoot lightning bolts?  We got an app... I mean glyph for that!You can eventually pull stronger glyphs later on.  So you can have a more powerful version of the axe glyph, or the rapier glyph.  And then there are some glyphs with do other things, such as flying or turning into smoke.  Fun!  There are a ton of glyphs, and they allow the player to tweak their character to their style.  Later you can have up to three glyph settings that you can change to on the fly.  Useful.The other feature that I love is that you have a pretty open ended exploration of the countryside.  As you advance the story, new areas open up, and you can select an area to go to once you leave the area you are in.  There is a village which you will come to be familiar with, and you 'free' the townspeople as you travel and they offer quests or shops in exchange.  Some of the quests might be 'take a picture of this monster or demon' or 'return my cat' or 'find x number of this material'.  As you advance further in these quests, more armor, items, accessories, and other special things come available.  I love that you can 'find' the original Castlevania soundtrack and play it while playing the game.There are also a couple of optional dungeons that you won't be able to complete until near the end of the game.  They are tough, but they have some good rewards.Speaking of rewards, there are a lot of hidden items in this game.  More than any previous Castlevania I think.  Many are found by pressing down on the cursor in suspicious areas.  Others are found by breaking away blocks or walls.  Then there are the other items which are in the open, just hard to reach.Overall this game has more replay value than any other Castlevania title I have played.  It's classic 2-D Castlevania, and Konami has definitely done justice to the series and given the long time fans something wonderful.  New fans might be turned off by the difficulty, especially at first, but there are plenty of save points, usually near a boss, so it's never too frustrating.Pros:+ Music is among the best of any game on the DS.  Period.  Blows away POR and DOS.+ Gameplay and control is exceptional, character moves fluidly; buttons can be customized.+ Lots of replay, side quests galore, optional dungeons later on.+ Massive amount of area to explore, various countryside locations in addition to the castle later on.+ Overall pretty decent difficulty with some truly challenging boss battles... I mean PUNISHING boss battles.+ Very nice game over screen.  You will be seeing a fair amount of it.+ Glyph system is one of the most creative, fun, and customizable features in a Castlevania games.+ Great story that doesn't really eat up a lot of screen time, lets you get back to the action.+ The classic Castlevania soundtrack can be unlocked in game, and one of the optional dungeons has a tune from Castlevania III remastered wonderfully.Cons:- Some of the areas are pretty straight through and small (like the swamp).- Difficulty might turn off some players, especially near the beginning (Prison and Lighthouse bosses can be tough).Overall this is one of the best 2-d games on the DS, if not the best 2-D side scrolling adventure game on the platform.  It's one of the better Castlevania games ever made.  It stretches the hardware of the DS to its limit and delivers an amazing game for such a small cartridge!  Just an amazing and truly enjoyable gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

It was a lot of fun to play single-player campaign, and I played and re-played each campaign it at least 4 times, before even considering going online. The AI-controlled players are impressively capable, which makes single-player very enjoyable; settings in the game change constantly, which makes each playthrough very unique. The graphics look a bit dated, considering some of the modern games, but this is very much a non-issue.The most serious problem with this game, however, is versus mode, which all things considered, is a lot of fun - two teams play, one team is the survivors, the other team is infected. The problem is that this mode is nothing short of an idiot/imbecile magnet, made much worse by the game's \"vote to kick\" feature. On any particular day, attempting to join a versus game results in getting kicked out about 75% of the time. Note that you don't have to actually do anything to get kicked out - joining the game is enough. In my experience, almost every call to vote results in a 'yes' vote, as most players do not care about the validity of the vote. Combined with the loading times between kicks, this is the most infuriating experience I've come across, since I started playing on Xbox Live.If you usually join games by yourself, the kick-vote feature will be your worst enemy. If you have two idiots on your team (as you often do), you will not be able to kick out either one of them (majority is needed to kick someone out). And if you're playing alone (i.e. without friends) and someone calls a 'kick vote' usually no one will vote 'no', and you will get kicked out almost instantly.Versus mode isn't the only mode that suffers from this - so does campaign. However, versus is especially worse, because you can only play it online. I planned to buy this game - instead, I just returned the rental, as its online replayability is ridiculously low.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2009"}

No way around that.  If you like giant superficial world you can run around and do almost nothing in buy this game.  If you like following arrows from one end of town to another, play this. Personally I actually want engaging levels to explore and want more than mediocre gameplay mechanics. The brawling mechanics are probably the most fun aspect of the game, but nothing outstanding.The story is ok and probably the only reason to play it. In full disclosure I am not close to finishing it so it could go either way. If I ever complete the story I will update this with my final thoughts.GOOD: Graphics are decent. The world is large and runs well while populated with plenty of npcs (this is probably the biggest technical achievement of the game). OK brawler. Story has promise and became the reason I kept going for as long as I did.BAD:  The world looks dense due to a thousand npcs and a big map but actually has very little to explore and do. Most gameplay is only so-so. Feels generic if you have played similar games. Collision with npcs can get a little crazy as they leap out of your way or you shove them aside. I thought it was kind of cool at first but after awhile it's just annoying to be floping around every time you want to run down the street.Overall, not a broken piece of trash but nothing special either. A solid take on a tired genre. Based on pure opinion I'd give it one or two stars but it probably wouldn't be a fair assessment so I gave it 3.Negativity aside I think if you are a fan of the Rockstar style open world game you will almost definitely enjoy this to some degree.  Do not let my bad review dissuade you from playing the game. I only wanted to warn other people who think they are getting more than that. Personally I'd recommend the Yakuza series over this one any day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00004S9AF","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"A great game, but not perfect.","reviewText":"&quot;Legend of Dragoon&quot; is similar to Final Fantasy games in that the battles are turn-based; involve weapons, items, and spells; and players get the option to levil up their characters for stronger attacks and more HP. On  it's own, it is a fun, satisfying, and worthwile game. But it definitely doesn't hold a candle to the FF games.Though the battle system is familiar to any RPG fan, it is the graphics that really give this game the edge. Boasting &quot;3 years in the making, with a design team of over 100&quot;, their efforts were well spent. The battles are challenging enough, while the enemies are challenging and diverse. In terms of control, it is similar to most of the FF games, so it doesn't take long to master battles and manouvering. As the game progresses, the characters get stronger, allowing them to inflict even more damage. Overall, this is a challenging and rewarding game.But sadly, this game is tainted by a few minor flaws. The cliched &quot;Unlock the mysteries of the past&quot; plot is nothing we haven't seen before, add to this the paper thin characters that we couldn't care less about.  There are some technical flaws that need addressing. First, the number is items that can be carried. Why is it that you can carry 256 &quot;Armed&quot; items (weapons and armor) but you can only cary 32 standard items (like healing potions and cure potions, which is what you most often need)? Another flaw is that, unlike the free roaming of FF games, you are confined to the dotted lines on the world map. So there is little room for exploration. One thing that particularly bugged me about this game is that the plot is so linear, meaning that the side quests that we enjoyed with Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 3 are not prevelant here.But these are minor flaws, considering that the point of the game is to fight until the end to save innocent people from bloodshed.  This is not a deeply involved RPG, but rather more like an action  game with RPG undertones. Not bad at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2001"}

Next to Wolverine, Batman is my favorite super-hero. This game is one of the main reasons I bought a PS3. Let me say I'm glad I did (let's face it, some other games I bought my PS3 to play, like assassins creed ended up being a disappointment).Playing as Batman is just plain fun. The game-play ideas in this game seem sound enough, if not a little ambitious, and let's face it, this is not the first time someone has tried to make a stealth game or a Batman game. Many have tried before and failed, but this time, it just works. It's lots of fun to sit on top of these statues and swoop down and take out bad guys or string them up. You have to use stealth in this game to succeed. While sometimes this makes the game a bit of a challenge, it is surprisingly a lot of fun as well.It's not just bad guys that Batman has to deal with, he has puzzles, things to collect, riddles to solve, people to rescue, clues to find, mysteries to solve, super villains to lock up and much more.The graphics in this game are pretty darn good. While lots of blacks and a very dark overtone is very prominent, you notice soon into the game that it just looks good. Everything is done well and the details are incredible, even when you find yourself lost or going down the same hallway for the eighth time.The sound in this game is amazing. The sounds of small computers, to the Joker's antics over the intercom, to the sounds Batman's equipment makes makes this game believable. The music is good and everything just helps to immerse you in the whole experience.While all these factors are good, it's the game-play that really sucks you into this game. There is a lot of great thought put into this game in regards to puzzles, platforming, secrets to find, riddles to solve, the list is almost endless. Almost anything and everything you could ever want in a Batman game is here from the riddles to the stealth take-downs of Joker's henchmen. It all proves to be a lot of fun even if it at times gets tedious or repetitive. The great attention to detail of all things from the Batman universe is what helps keep this game from getting old, boring or from frustrate you too much.In conclusion, Batman Arkham Asylum is an absolute must play game that will go down in history as one of the best games of this generation of consoles for all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

Bethesda Softworks (Fallout 3, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion) and Splash Damage (Enemy Territory: QUAKE Wars) hope its the next big franchise to hit consoles.  The impressive art direction in the advertising campaign originally drew me to this game, but does it translate to tengaging gameplay?  Now that it has dropped in price almost universally, is it something you should pick up now?  Is it even worthy of it's all CAPS moniker?The premise in BRINK is not anything we really haven't seen before, but it centers around a man-made, eco-friendly, floating city, designated The Ark, that is on the brink (get it) of Civil War.  Since the oceans of the world have begun to rise to unsafe levels, The Ark has become a sort of haven for people affiliated with its original inhabitants, as well as other displaced people looking for a better life, who have to live on the outskirts.  It's basically a bunch of Haves versus Have Nots.  One group wants to break free of the overpopulation and desecrating conditions for the outcasts on The Ark (called The Resistance) and leave the floating city to see what the world is like beyond its walls, while the other group wants to keep the refugees in control and living in continued squalor, while they continue to benefit in The Ark (called The Security).Upon starting the game, you have to first select and customize a character.  While the customization options are ample, they aren't exactly endless.  The character design is similar to Gears of War, with overexaggerated features and bulging muscles.  There are four different classes of characters: Soldier, Engineer, Medic, and Operative.  Obviously each has their own strengths and weaknesses and in this game you will be switching classes a lot during each level or mission, to complete objectives.To move around, BRINK also uses whats been classified as SMART (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain).  In this, a button can be assigned to to quickly traverse across different environmental obstacles.  Think of it as parkour influenced climbing, jumping, and sliding, reminiscent of Mirror's Edge.  Unfortunately, much of the time, I kind of forgot about SMART and did the regular old climbing and jumping, except for the occasional slide.I've spent quite a bit of time with this game, beating both campaigns (a total of 16 missions, but they are long missions, which turns out to be a blessing and a curse), and utilizing both solo play, as well as completing levels online with human counterparts.  I get that the online component was designed to be a major selling point for BRINK, but the online community is pretty stagnant at the moment.  When starting a level online, I would say that only about 25% of the time did I have another human joining me.GameplayThis game is quite frenetic when you first jump in.  There is a lot of action going on around you and quite a bit of chatter from your teammates (which I liked initially, but then grew to hate).  Initially, only one or two classes will have an objective that are pretty basic (hack this, defend this, escort this person, etc.), but the objectives increase (both primary and secondary), as you progress through the game.  Just find a (or take over an opponent controlled one) command post, and you can switch classes.  There is an objective wheel that is easily accessed at any time, that highlights the objectives and classes needed, so it's not too confusing.  Select an objective and it'll point you in the right direction to complete it.That's not to say that BRINK isn't fun because at times it really is.  Shooting people and is almost always fun... for a while.  Having the missions broken up by each side seemed like a really interesting idea, but they basically turn out to be the same levels, but just opposite objectives of each other.  If the Resistance was trying to destroy something, when you play the mission as the Security, you're trying to defend the same thing you were previously asked to destroy.  This doesn't flesh out the story as much as I would have hoped for, and really didn't make me pick a side I was rooting for, as if they had added totally different levels for each side.There is a major problem with your teammates AI in the game.  They are basically worthless (but every now and then surprise you with a well-placed turret), and you constantly feel like you are the only one that is able to do anything.  For instance if you have to repair something and are playing solo, without human teammates, it seems like you are the only one of the class you selected that can get anything done.  You have usually around 10 minutes to complete the objective, but it usually takes all 10 minutes because your teammates don't help at all.  When they do decide to help, it's like a mad rush in the final minute or two.  The opponents know where to congregate to protect what's needed, but it seems as if your team gets bored rather easily and leaves their mark.Which leads me to my next problem with the game.  If you die, or I should say when you die, because your opponent's ammo tends to be much more powerful than your own, you have to respawnThere are a few \"what if\" missions tacked on at the end, but they seem as more of an afterthought, than a critical part of the story, and are some of the shorter missions of the whole game.  I recommend playing through some of the Challenge levels early on, as by completing them, you earn some upgrades for your weapons.  There are 3 different types of challenges: fulfilling objectives, moving around with SMART to certain areas in a time limit, and defending, each with three levels of progressively harder levels.GraphicsThere are two distinct setting for the missions in BRINK.  One is the futuristic Ark, which kind of reminded me of something out of Mass Effect.  Lot's of plexiglass, neon, etc.  Once the action moved away from The Ark, to Container City, I became re-interested in the game again.  It's a totally different kind of look that really made me push through to finish my first half of the Campaign.  There are lots of little crevices and creative shortcuts to find.I didn't really experience any lag, when playing online, but only really connected with one other person at a time when playing the campaign.  The multiplayer was solid and much more fun than playing with bots, but by the time I tried multiplayer, I was kind of burned out by the game.  Sometimes when enemies died, parts of their body would be underground, or if they were standing on something and killed, seemed to be floating in mid-air.SoundThroughout the game you have a Commander basically talking in your ear the whole time.  He gets very frustrated when things aren't going the planned way.  Considering that you feel like you are a one man show on many of the levels, it get very annoying quickly.I did find the chatter between teammates amusing.  When you give supplies to another teammate, they always respond with some form of thanks.  Additionally, when you have some supplies and they are needed by someone nearby, they will let you know.Replay ValueThere is a planned DLC coming soon (free for the first two weeks), which may increase the number of people playing online.  Currently, there are 8 maps available for multiplayer skirmishes.  I fear, however, that most players originally interested in the game have either moved on to something else or sold/traded in their copy.Once the campaigns are completed, there is not much incentive to return to those missions.  Especially the ones where your teammates seem clueless.  There are some audio logs to collect, which supposedly add more to the story (or unlock a trophy/achievement when all are collected) but I didn't have an interest to find more.There is a cap at level 20.  When I finished both campaigns, I was at level 16, so I played multiplayer and replayed missions to reach the cap.  There are bonuses for completing missions online (which I didn't know until about halfway through the game)Honestly, I really wanted to like BRINK.  Blending solo, co-op, and multiplayer into one somewhat seamless experience seemed innovative and intriguing.  However, in the end, it wasn't done well enough to grab my interest for extended periods.  Each mission is quite long, and if you don't succeed, feels arduous instead of energizing at the challenge, that you have to relive 15-20 minutes all over again.Rating6.5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"An improvement over the already awesome first God of War","reviewText":"That's right, God of War II takes what was so great about the first game and improves upon it further, so it's a good thing I didn't wait and got this game pretty much a day or two after it was released. We'll go through these improvements step by step. Right from the start menu we see Kratos's familiar (and angry) face, and with a press of the start button the camera pans back and we see Kratos as the new God of War sitting on his throne in Mt. Olympus with two of his love servants keeping him company. The elderly narrator from the first game is back as well, and she once again works her storytelling magic that draws the player into the life of everyone's favorite pissed off Spartan-turned-god. Kratos is angry (still) at the gods for not removing the memories that continue to plague him; memories of the countless people he slaughtered, including his beloved wife and daughter. Becoming the new God of War did nothing to appease Kratos, and he ended up becoming a more ruthless God of War than Ares before him, conquering city after city with his Spartan army. Ignoring the warnings from fellow goddess Athena that his actions are incurring the wrath of Olympus, Kratos joins the Spartans in attacking the city of Rhodes, using his godly might and gigantic size to stomp on several buildings before much of his godly powers are mysteriously taken away from him. His power is transferred to the statue of Apollo known as the Colossus of Rhodes (the opening boss), bringing it to life with its sights set on Kratos, who is now back to regular size. As he fights his way past many Rhodes soldiers and has several encounters with the Colossus, Kratos is offered the Blade of Olympus by Zeus, which ended the Great Wars between the gods and titans back in the day. Kratos is then tricked into draining the rest of his godly might into the blade (his magic is gone and his health is the lowest it could possibly be). After more battling, the weakened Kratos is killed (again) by the one who took his powers and betrayed him... Zeus. The cutscene that follows is one of my all time favorites. To avoid spoilers, I'll simply state that it involves the elderly narrator becoming an integral part of the story and Kratos finds himself revived from death and ready to fight once more. Armed with Athena's Blades, which he received at the end of the first game, Kratos must travel to the Island of the Fates so he could use the power of the Sisters of Fate to go back in time and kill Zeus when he is most vulnerable.Kratos will of course gain more upgradeable weapons and powers from the titans and defeated enemies to destroy those who stand in his way: releasing lightning orbs (Cronos's Rage), a magic bow that fires powerful gusts of wind (Typhon's Bane), create smashing earthquakes (Atlas Quake), turn enemies to stone again (Head of Euryale), a large spiked hammer that can summon souls (Barbarian Hammer), and a spear that fires crystal shards (Spear of Destiny). He'll also gain the ability to burst into flames with the Rage of the Titans, which mostly works the same as Rage of the Gods, granting him greatly increased attack power and durability. This may sound like a lot of the same stuff as the original God of War, and while that is mostly true, the game's many subtle and more noticeable improvements keep things fresh and fun. Kratos can now move around when using ranged abilities like Typhon's Bane and Head of Euryale, use Athena's Blades to climb underneath ledges as well as on vertical walls like before with improved \"wall combat\", use Icarus Wings to glide greater distances, use the Golden Fleece to deflect enemy attacks, and use the Amulet of the Fates to temporarily slow down time (with Kratos slowing down much less than everything else). The enemies in this game are also very similar, but there are several knew ones such as annoying scribes who can summon other creatures, huge cyclops berserkers that carry large tree trunks as clubs, armored juggernauts, and cursed remains (walking skeletons). There are also two flying sections where Kratos rides atop Pegasus thousands of feet in the air and does aerial combat with creatures riding griffins. These play sessions are fast paced and visually impressive, with Kratos using the familiar quick time events to jump onto the griffins, kill their riders, slice off the griffins' wings, and jump back onto Pegasus.The QTEs also return of course when Kratos dismembers regular enemies as creatively as ever and during more specific sequences like opening large gates, taking part in sex mini-games (yes, nudity and other sexual themes make a return as well), or battling boss enemies. This game has twice the number of bosses and sub-bosses of the original game, and while most of them aren't gigantic like the Colossus, they're still fun and challenging to battle, with the final boss once again proving to be the most difficult. Puzzles make a return as well, most offering decent to rather frustrating challenges. One where you have to slow down time, pull a lever, and get through a closing gate before spikes shoot up from the ground and impale you definitely counts as a frustrating puzzle. The game's graphics have also improved. The many environments such as a snowy mountain amidst a blizzard, the murky swamps and shiny marble of the temples in the Island of the Fates, and the fiery glow of a volcanic interior of a titan all look as colorful and eye catching as ever, but the character designs are boasting the most improvements in terms of texture and smoothness, especially Kratos. Perhaps due to the demands these improved graphics place on the PS2, there is some noticeable screen tearing in certain areas that offer a great view of the rest of the island's landscape with forests, mountains, and gigantic statues in the distance. While slightly irritating, the screen tearing is still a very miniscule problem. Plus, wait until you see the CGI cutscenes... your jaw will drop at the rich color and extreme detail of the characters. Even the classic orchestral scores in this game have improved, they're more catchy and really give you that feeling of taking part in a very epic quest of \"titanic\" proportions. Get it? \"Titanic\"... titans... gods? You'd have to be crazy to miss out on this game, especially if you have the first one. Besides, the ending really sets you up into wanting to get the third game... as if it really needed to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Additionally, the campaigns are always short, nonsensical, and so over-the-top ludicrous, it's just hard to take them seriously.  Until people start actually requiring these games to actually put time into them, they will continue putting out poorly made games with the same multiplayer.

We had fun but we still think the Lego Star Wars Complete Saga is the best Lego game to date.Lego Harry Potter can be a little creepy at times.  My 7 year old did not like this one cut scene where Voldermolt is going to kill the unicorn.  He still talks about \"that guy that was going to be mean to that pony\".  Not a huge issue but this is Harry Potter so expect a few creepy cut scenes.Co-op works great.  Split screen works great.  Graphics are great.  My biggest gripe is what Lego Indiana Jones and this game suffer from and that is that the game is gear towards kids but the menu system to get things like Free Play working is not as obvious.  The older games were the best for kids since the levels were broken down into different doors and when you started a level you could do story mode or free play.  I am not saying the newer games do not have these modes, I am saying it is not as easy to navigate to them when you are younger.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2011"}

RPG is the perfect platform for them. That said, the game itself is far from perfect. The biggest problem is the camera. It hangs over head and you really can't see where you're going. If there's an enemy ahead you can't see them until you're close to them. That doesn't get much time for planning. You can control the camera, spin it around, even move it down closer to you, but this is very limited. The developers should have given the gamers full control of the camera. We should be able to position it the way we want.Which leads me to the controls. You're stuck with what you got. I'm not comfortable with the jump button being triangle. I'd rather it be x. But the controls are not customizable so I had to learn to live with it.The graphics are, for the most part, beautiful. The environments are extremely well thought out. They even thought to put wheel chair ramps all over the X-Mansion. It's subtleties like this that I love. The stages are also extremely interactive. You can destroy almost everything in rooms. You can even knock down walls and surprise your enemy.The battles do get repetitive. You fight the same guys over and over. Nothing too hard. Anybody who has played this type of game before will have no problem with X-Men.As a fan of the X-Men, I've very happy with the game though it could have been much better. Hopefully, Activision will make another X-Men RPG and improve on their flaws in this game.Graphics: 4.5Controls: 4.0Sound: 4.5Fun Factor: 4.0","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Bonnie Dreeke","summary":"One of my favs","reviewText":"This was the first Gameboy Zelda game that I played on my sp and that alone gives it special memories.

Assassin's Creed 2 completely sucked me in and made me absolutely love the game.  Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood brought a big smile to my face that completely satisfied every impulse, knee jerk reaction to what I wanted from the second one.It starts with a combination of two events.  1) Right after you defeat the Borgia pope you return to your Villa.  This, of course, is where you are lead to your training sequences for the new maneuvers of the game (which incidentally is much easier to use.  instead of going to your Villa to train you can simply hit Start and choose training).  2) You are taking part of the 2012 world of Desmond and your exploration of the Italy of that time, with its typical 21st century erosion on the old world.  Both are fantastic.  I couldn't help but love returning to the world of Ezio and exploring around.  Even more so was the absolutely huge world of Rome, noticed straight away as you pan around to the distances.  This is an absolutely different and way more majestic world than the world of Assassin's Creed 2.  You know that although you will not travel to as many cities you will certainly explore more just by the huge size of Rome.The graphics are amazing, touched up and refined from the last one.  The controls are almost identical, allowing you to jump in to the game with ease.  The added addition of the Brotherhood adds a lot despite the tendency to overuse your assassins and leave yourself vulnerable, when you would certainly want to use them.  Regardless, the overall game play has improved, despite the fighting mechanisms still feeling a bit droll and not to unique.Finally, after trying for awhile with little success I was able to get in and log on to the multiplayer server.  This seems like a problem straight away because it shouldn't take 5-10 minutes to log in to a server, and then the next time you log in a matter of seconds.  I found that after I waited for 5 minutes I had to cancel out and go back in in order to play.  The play itself is a joy.  You play anywhere from 6-10 people mixed in amidst a ton of \"civilians\" for about 10 minutes, stalking and hunting your prey or just straight up chasing them.  This multiplayer has a much different feel than the typical slugfest and bullet ridden multiplayers of other games, simply because you literally have to get up close and personal before you can make your kill.The campaign play is long and worth it, definitely not feeling like an add on and more so like a real stand alone game with its own merits.  The multiplayer is well worth it as well, although not sure if the replay ability will get old or die down, something of which only time will tell.  Add the two together and you have an absolute winner in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.  A definite recommend.5 stars.Update: A direct comparison would show the following.  AC2 has considerably more collectibles than ACB, but ACB's collectibles are much easier to find since maps are made available for any and all of them.  That being said, there are a lot more side quests/missions that you can go on in ACB.  When all is said and done I spent about 32 hours in AC2 and it took about 24 hours for ACB, athough there are still a lot of side quests to be completed (and clusters) and so it will take a bit more time.  With game complete and all feathers, flags and treasures found, I am only at 51% sync, which shows that there are a good amount of hours left to be played.  That being said I still haven't found all the feathers in AC2, and thus could still spend a lot more time there, so it is a wash.  AC2 had 5 cities, plus a visit to the Vatican at the very end.  ACB has just one large city, although you visit several other places on your missions.I found that there was only one aspect that I wish were done differently which would have made the game that much better.  You visit several villas when completing the quests to destroy DaVinci's war machines, as well as Firenze (sp?) and Viana Castle.  It would have been so simple to make these places that you could visit and explore after you completed your mission.  Viana Castle and its surrounding countryside, for example, would have been fantastic to explore and just run around.  Instead you only visit it briefly and you are running and fighting the whole time you don't get to see it.  Additionally, you don't get to climb up or explore around San Pietro.  You see it always in the distance, then at the end you get to go up to its gates and then nothing.  There is the Lair of Romulus that puts you in San Pietro but you are chasing a Cardinal at such a frantic pace you barely get to notice the huge and majestic building that would have been absolutely fantastic to just stop and hop from ledge to ledge.  A simple touch to allow us to explore it after the game is compelte would have made this game that much better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2010"}

A lot of games claim to live up to this grand title. Few deliver. Condemned definitely frickin' delivers. You will be worried about your chances of survival. You'll be on your toes. Scared? Probably not. Tense? Definitely. Supplies are few enough and foes strong enough to really up the ante on you. There is no sense that \"Oh, this is just another generic bad guy coming at me.\" No, you see everyone as a real threat--and they could be. A couple of badly-timed moves or a poor decision can lead you to a quick reload, no matter how many similar baddies you've downed. They can all kill you if you're not careful--hence, the anxiety I mentioned.This is one of those games where you're torn between two ways of looking at it. Half of you is playing a video game. The other half is watching a creepy supernatural crime thriller. What some other reviewers--doubtlessly motivated by a sense of instant gratification--have described as \"dull\" or \"repetitive\" is--in reality--atmosphere and pacing. Your character moves slowly--you're always aware of your surroundings. There's no rushing through halls to engage the next enemy. Instead, you move cautiously about, checking dark corners with your flashlight, and listening intently for the sound of any footsteps that might alert you to the presence of a foe.Really, this is an incredibly cinematic experience. If you're a quick enough cat to follow the story (reading reviews, it seems like not all are), you'll get sucked right in. There's a crime spree going on, and you're an FBI agent assigned to a serial killings division. The game picks up on your most recent case--a murdered woman posed with a mannequin in a rotting building. Get used to the decrepit surroundings. The entire game takes place in creepy urban (and one rural) locales.You will periodically make use of your forensic tools to discover evidence and advance the story. Since it wouldn't be too exciting to spend time in a lab just to process it, you're equipped with a neat set of tools. Half of them work to identify evidence, and the other half collect said evidence. Once you've collected it, it's sent via cellphone to a lab and processed in mere moments (okay, so you have to stretch your suspension of disbelief for that). You're then briefed by your Bureau forensic nerd on what you've discovered.But you're not just any FBI agent, as you find out. You have certain talents. You have visions. Sometimes, you'll see the past, other times, the future--and sometimes you'll see things you didn't think existed. These vision sequences are the best moments in the game. You'll hear whispers muttering your name and the lights will seem to shine out brighter (think The Green Mile). Sometimes the visions are even quite useful. They'll show you where you need to look for evidence--if you pay attention--and give you clues about the story.This is the first game since Resident Evil that managed weapons properly. I could never abide games that bill themselves as \"Survival Horror\" and then give you a machine gun with 300 rounds five times per level, or let you carry one of every offensive weapon you encounter.In this game, you have one weapon. That's all you can carry with you. What you take is up to you--you'll find various implements laying around. Each has strengths and weaknesses. There are firearms, but (and get this) you can't reload them. Whatever ammo is in them is all you get. I LIKE this. It really adds an element of danger when you check your revolver and realize you only have one bullet. The best part is--and this is unlike any other game I've ever played--you will KEEP that revolver with the one bullet over any melee weapon laying around. Trust me. You'll want the power and range. And don't worry--one bullet is useful, if you aim it properly. One bullet in the right spot will take down most enemies in the game. It's realistic like that.The only mechanic that's a chore to master is blocking. It's not like usual--hold down a button and be blocking the whole time, no sir. When you hit the block button, you will block for half a second, then lower your weapon. If the block is poorly timed, you'll take full damage. This really adds to the tension of a fight scene. There's no way to be sure you're protected from an incoming attack. You're always on your toes.I agree that this game is a little short. I finished it the same day I purchased it. Still, that didn't seem to detract too much from my experience. I was just as satisfied at the roll of the credits than if I'd just seen a top-notch thriller in a theater somewhere.Oh, and let me say that the ending is actually worth the time you spend playing. It's a good five-minute-long scene, with a moral choice thrown in the middle (I won't spoil it, but here's a hint: to shoot or not to shoot, that is the question.)Allow me to reiterate one more time the power of the atmosphere in this game. During the next-to-last level, as I was making my way through the home of a serial killer, I kept realizing I was doing two things: holding my breath so I could hear better, and wondering out loud just how messed up this killer was.If you come into this game expecting a first-person shooter, forget it. It's first-person, but it's no shooter. Likewise, don't expect an RPG or anything. This is one of those games that's hard to categorize. The gameplay is different enough from most of its contemporaries that it falls into a category all its own. I made a comparison to Resident Evil before, so let's run with that. Imagine Resident Evil. Now make all the bad guys criminals and crackheads. Next, reduce the inventory space to a single item (don't worry; you don't need more than that). Finally, change the perspective to first-person. Throw in just a splash of futuristic CSI. Bam. Condemned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

So i was more than thrilled when she told me instead of getting Guitar Hero III (which i own on wii) she got Rockband.If you've ever played GH you'll find Rockband (using the guitar) is exactly the same. I actually find Rockband to be easier than Guitar Hero. It may be because with Rockband it's not just about the guitar, but the drums, bass and singer too (if you decide to include all those elements).I've played for a total of maybe 8 hours and have loved every minute of it. The only thing i haven't tried was singing.This is what i know:You can create your person with tons of different styles, size, hair, hair color, eye color and attitude.You can buy clothes from tons of different shops, sometimes so much it's overwhelming!You can play in a solo tour, or you can play multiplayer tour. I have done both.I personally like how much it's like GH but at the same time you get to customize like crazy! Tattoos even, you can use ones they have or create your own.The guitar it's self is awesome, i was unsure at first using it because it felt so light and cheapy but when comparing to the guitar i use on GH it's pretty awesome. It's so quiet! I can hardly hear any clicking i may be doing. Can't say the same things for the drums, those are quite loud so unless you have your TV turned up you can't drowned out the sound of the banging it's a noisey game.All in all i love it, but like i said i don't live with it everyday. Playing every once in awhile though has me hooked. I think it's a perfect game for all ages. Even my girlfriend who doesn't like games has tried Guitar Hero (now to get her to play Rockband). I hope it comes out for Wii. Though we all know it won't look as crisp and clear as it does on the Xbox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2007"}

Years later I decided to try buy a used copy of #1 in the series and I've been hooked since and now I own ALL the games.  The Yakuza franchise is awesome!I would say this is one of the best Yakuza games of the series (#2,#4 being on top of the list..and if they ever bring Kenzan over that would be up there as well)Reason I point this out is I'm tired of shooters getting all the glory and sales when games like this get missed (and IGN kills them with insane ratings)Anyway, on to the game - this is not a simple pick up and play/party game you can just pick up and expect instant gameplay like a shooter.  Think old school RPG menu interaction with Tekken meets GTA without cars.  You play as 4 characters in the game, each with their own story.  It involved walking around, talking much like any RPG but there are MANY mini-games that keep the pace going.  You go at your own pace and there is a TON of content in the game to explore.Hopefully Sega continues with Yakuza and brings over Kenzan in the meantime.  If I had to be critical and writing a review for the average gamer, I would say this is a fun game but not for party/shooter type/I need action gamers, especially if you're not into Japanese culture because this is pretty close to being in Japan as you get in a video game - for Yakuza fans this is a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Like many reviews have stated, it adds enough new goodies and updates to make it well worth the price of the game.  Very first impression of the game were on the graphics.  High definition has skyrocketed since Halo 3 and Bungie updated to make things look more polished.  My two favorite aspects of what's been improved are the guns and the damage from them.  Previous Halo games, it took almost an entire clip of ammo to kill someone.  This one....it still takes a lot but not as much.  The way the aim works benefits people like me who aren't try-hard zit faced teenagers in that it's more stiff and easier.  The damage from every weapon is more realistic.  The grenades are more powerful and it's much easier to register a headshot.The story mode of the game is significantly more difficult than previous Halo games.  You'll need to take cover quicker, find health packs and learn to make headshots all the time.  Going for the legendary fun through on solo will test your patience and your skill.It's obvious that Bungie learned of its mistakes from previous games and saw how successful series like Call of Duty have risen to the top of FPS games.  Although I'm sure this game will still have its fair share of haters (what game doesn't) I recommend any past Halo fans give this the benefit of the doubt and try it.  If they don't like it, at least there are very easy achievements in Firefight!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2010"}

There is no time waster that is more entertaining than killing hoardes of zombies to me.  Needless to say, I loved this game.Picture Quality: 10/10.  The game looks beautiful.  The island is majestic, the zombies are detailed, and the playable area is littered with realistic looking junk.  The only thing I have noticed is that I think they could have added a little bit more detail when you bash a zombie's head in.Sound Quality: 9/10.  Personally, I like listening to ITUNES when I am playing games, and this game adjusts the volume of ITUNES to about the same level as the SFX level is.  It is a cool feature, but it of course isn't perfect. The voice acting is fine, the zombie noises aren't necessarily scary, but you can tell which direction they are coming from which is very helpful.Story: 8/10.  Honestly, I don't remember much of my first playthrough as far as the story goes.  So it wasn't ground breaking, but it makes sense for the most part.  The cutscenes could have been better.CO-OP: 8/10.  This is the whole reason I got this game.  Playing with friends is a blast.  I absolutely loved it when 4 of us would beat up on a couple of hapless thugs.  Gang violence FTW.Game Quality: 6/10.  This is the most frustrating part of the game.  It has crashed a couple times on me, and sometimes it is really hard to find a friend's game to join.  Of course it is quite possible this is a steam issue and not a dead Island issue, but it is annoying nonetheless.Customization: 9/10.  There are hundreds of weapons and a few dozen skills to use to your liking, as well as four different main characters each with a significant and unique strength.  There are dozens of mods to use on your weapons as well.  I've been impressed with the stuff you can do with weapons.Overall: 8/10.  This game is great in every way, the only problem I have is the crashing and connecting situations.  Otherwise it is a near perfect game, especially if you get it with a friend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006W41W82","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Fantastic all-in-one for all your gaming needs","reviewText":"I was super excited to receive my XP300 because it seemed to be the headset that would finally fix the wireless headset dilemma on the Xbox 360. That in itself is worthy of a purchase, but thankfully the XP300 has so much more to offer. I have purchased headsets that claim to be wireless in the past but somehow they always manage to involve wires. Doesn't really make sense to me. I had all but given up on a wireless Xbox 360 headset when this brilliant piece of technology came around. It is TRULY wireless, involving plugging a small adapter into the top of your 360 controller (where a traditional wired headset would plug in) and the adapter communicates wirelessly with the headset. It's beautiful perfection. If you happy to be 360 AND a PS3 fan, you're in for a treat. I don't even have to get up to switch from 360 to PS3. Turn the PS3 on, the bluetooth detects the XP300 (after initial setup) and I'm golden. I can even use the XP300 with my PC, although it is a wired connection. Not sure why they couldn't offer a wireless option for the PC as well and even though I don't really NEED wireless for my PC, it would have been a nice touch. I'm not going to knock a star off for this minor gripe because it outperforms all my expectations in every other capacity.Sound is full and crisp and completely engrossing. Paired with the noise isolation, the XP300 REALLY puts you in the game. A high quality headset might not be on the top of most gamers peripheral list, but it's amazing how sound like this can completely transform your experience. I was immediately hearing things in my games I had never detected before. I had been using the cheap standard 360 headset which only conveys voice chat so this is the first time I played my 360 and PS3 games with a headset and it's just as amazing as the first time I used myLogitech G35 7.1-Channel Surround Sound Headsetwith my PC games. I had purchased a few headsets for the 360 trying to find a high quality wireless set, and there just simply aren't any other options out there. If you want TRUE wireless with your 360, you need the XP300. As for voice, my friends claimed that they could hear me more clearly with the XP300 over the standard headset and I would expect no less considering the price difference between this and the cheap headset. Incoming voices were much clearer and louder and I don't miss having to lower the volume on the TV to hear voice chat with the standard headset. The XP300 automatically turns up chat volume to compensate a higher game volume.Comfort is also high on my list as after long gaming sessions, a heavy or uncomfortable headset will make you miserable. I once had a simple behind the ear style headset for my PC and my ears would ache after an hour and I had to take it off. The XP300 is lightweight for it's size and supremely comfortable. The padding around the ears successfully blocks out most surrounding noise while being very comfortable. Some headsets tend to put too much pressure on the ears and sides of the head but that is not an issue here at all. I wore the headset for over 2 hours and I was still just as comfortable as the moment I put them on. The padding on the band that goes on top of the head is amply padded as well and has plenty of room for adjustment so that it will fit absolutely anyone.The rechargeable battery is invaluable as well. Since my son's obsession with Skylanders, I'm really done with battery powered devices that have to be replaced at least once a week with moderate use. There's no reason high end devices like this can't include a rechargeable battery and I'm glad Turtle Beach recognizes this. I can recharge the headset right from the console while I'm playing and I can't imagine a better setup. It ensures no interruption to gameplay, which isn't something most wireless headsets can brag about. This paired with the ability to talk on my iPhone while I'm playing makes this purchase a no brainer for any gamer. It's even replaced my bluetooth headset that I use for my iPhone because now I can listen to music through my 360 with the XP300. If you want a wireless headset that works with your 360, PS3, PC and bluetooth enabled phone, there is no better solution and it's well worth the premium price given how many uses it had.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

First, let me say that I didn't like Morrowind, but this game has made me one of the converted. This is definitely one of the best games to have on the X-Box 360. From the music, to the graphics to the game play, this game is very addictive and FUN.First, lets get to the graphics. The graphics are simply beautiful, the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen in any video game. There is nothing like riding your horse to the top of a snow-covered mountain to look over and see the entire landscape. It's as beautiful as it sounds, simply breath taking. This game looks great in third and first person views. I usually prefer the third person view, especially when I have a horse just so I can admire the scenery. From the cities to the countryside, it truly is a feast for the eyes.The story is great as you help a man who just found out he is the next King. The interaction with all of the characters is great as well. Everyone talks, no more reading the dialogue on this game which is an improvement over the third game when you had to read and read. It just makes the game easier on the eyes and more realistic when you don't have to read anything.The gameplay is fantastic as well. It's the same as the others, but the graphics of this game really help out the gameplay. The controls are pretty easy to learn and remember, but you should catch on fast since you will be doing similar things a lot. The game isn't that difficult, I've learned to save a lot incase I make a wrong turn and go the wrong way or lose someone during a mission.Which brings me to the small problems with the game. The game is nearly perfection, but it does have small problems. Mainly being that occasionally the game will pause for a second every now and then. There is nothing wrong, it's just so much memory goes into this game it freezes for like a microsecond, but it happens so little it's not a big deal. The only annoying thing is that when someone is supposed to follow you, they sometimes don't because they can't get past certain rocks that you were able to. Sometimes I turn around and can't find the people who are supposed to follow me. The cure for that is to always keep an eye on the people and make sure they follow you and to save often. In case something happens, you can always load that game and try again. The load times are sometimes short and sometimes a little long, but nothing unbearable.With all of this said, I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this game. Like others have said, it is worth every penny. If you are like me, and didn't like Morrowind, get this!!! I'm one of the converted and I truly believe that if you play this game, you will be as well. The graphics, the gameplay, the story; the best I have seen on a video game. period.

Aside from my gaming, we use it for Netflix, Amazon Video, and HBO Go. Very quickly we realized the controllers were a little awkward to use for remotes day-in and day-out, so we looked into getting this. Just to be clear, we don't care about the Media Center like other reviewers, nor do we hook it up to work directly with our TV (though this remote can do that). We just wanted a simple remote for the Xbox.I have to say, after five months this piece delivers consistently well. We haven't seen loss in signal strength. The buttons have held up without getting janky. We are still on the same AAA batteries we originally put in. This thing is a breeze to use, especially since it has the Xbox home-button along with the four, colored buttons you'd see on a controller.While you may see $17-18 as a bit pricey for just an Xbox remote, this will prove to be a great investment if you use your Xbox for most of your TV-watching needs.

I now have a much better understanding of why other game makers hasn't tackled the Pacific theater in other FPS games...it's boring.  No matter how great they texture the trees, when you get hundreds of them, it don't make them anything else then an obstacle.  Hours upon hours of running around in similar looking locale, and your fighting spirit is sapped away.  In the original Medal of Honor, there was dramatic scenary.  From the ruins of Omaha beach, to the green and luscious forest estates, to crumbling villages.  And because the trees are so tightly grouped, there isn't much room for movement.  You try and dodge a little bit to the side, and you're now stuck on something (a tree, most of the time)Close spaces seems to be a theme in this game.  From the tight corridors of a burning battleship, to the trench system of Tarawa, and *shudder* the tree infested jungles of everywhere else.  Add to this the tendency of the enemy to charge you with their bayonets (and when they charge, they put a sidestep move on you that'll inspire the greatest of the NFL players), and your weapons needing time in between shots = you get stabbed by a bayonet doing hella lots of damage.  But the good thing is that your teammates are invincible to death it seems.The controls in the game isn't too responsive.  this might be due to my graphic card being outdated (Geforce ti-4600) however.Wasn't a bad game, but I expected more from MOH line.  It's just too bad there isn't any other (to my knowledge) Pacific theater FPS game out.  So if you're hung up on needing to play in this part of the war, then you're stuck with this game.

Christianson \"ABC\"","summary":"Good But Not Great","reviewText":"Most of the Final Fantasies up to this point have been really good, though I haven't played XI being that it forced you to get on the internet and buy their yearly membership.  This game is good: has great graphics, music, special skills, etc., but what it lacks is personality.  There's more action than storyline.  They do have some storyline and nice cut scenes, but the interaction with the other people of the game was something left desired.  In the beginning you help some people and have some extra people on your team which was pretty cool, but after that you don't really have any other non-played characters that add much to the story.  Not only that, but you don't buy items, weapons, armor, etc. from people or towns anymore.  It's all done with some computerized mechanism.  I found that unpersonal.  Sure, maybe buying from a robot like being would be cool here and there, but I prefer to buy from shops and people and also hear their story.  I think the developers didn't want to spend too much time on non-played characters' storylines.  It's a good game but hardly any replay value in my opinion.  I tried selling my copy, but there are too many people selling theirs, and I can see why.  I did sale the collector's edition strategy guide though.  Maybe I should've kept it, but I move around too much, and it would get ruined.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"B. Mills","summary":"Not your father's Final Fantasy","reviewText":"-NO SPOILERS-First things first, before you play this game at all you have to do one thing: go to settings and change the default from \"auto-battle\" to \"abilities\".  This is really necessary if you want to feel like your playing the game, not that the game is playing you.  You still have the ability to choose auto-battle, which can be a decent option if you want to save yourself the annoyance of pushing x needlessly in easier battles, and unfortunately your battle options are limited enough in the beginning, when your learning the battle system, that you will get bad habits and won't enjoy the game later on, because, when do right the battle system is IMMENSELY FUN!Sometimes auto-battle and picking your actions will result in the same choices, but the key to battles is TIMING, and after some experience you will get a feel for the how quickly the action bar will refill, and once you learn that you  can click through the selections of, which action, which target, etc, in a rhythmic pattern to get the exact right timing.  The feeling of attacking your enemy exactly when he's about to strike and and interrupting him, or using an area affect RIGHT when the enemy pulls back into the crowd, never fails to satisfy.  But if you just click though your options as quickly as possible, you will miss of waste your attacks and take allot more damage.  There's allot more going on in these battles then pretty animations (though they are gorgeous)Now, I am no where near the end of this massive game, but I waited until I was far enough into the game until I had decided weather I was sold on the games unique aspects, or not.  As it says in  the title of this review this is NOT your fathers (or mother's, lets be fair) final fantasy.  There's no towns, though there is shopping, this I didn't think would bother me because the part I always hate about jrpg's is wondering around aimlessly in town x... and the game is linear especially in the beginning.  I'll be honest with you, at first this feels, weird, and it certainly took me a while to get comfortable with it.  But something happened around hour three for me; I started to get immersed in the story.They did a great job not giving you any idea what the heck is going on, which for me causes an insatiable desire to play further, and then suddenly you completely engrossed in tis story, you've nailed down the combat and suddenly you no longer even notice how different it is, until you realize, that actually the way in which they allowed the game to unfold was a perfect way to introduce the characters to you.  This isn't the main character driven story of games like FF7, and as a result it would be hard to create a player attachment to this motley crew in any other way.  I'm not saying that you'll love this though, if you want the main character focuses story and traditional game-play with no exceptions, don't bother. But if your main draw to these games is story, and really feeling like your guiding an epic tale towards its ending while mastering a new and unique battle system (which has always been my thing) then you will like this game.Great story or not, it can take it a little bit out of your hands with the CG, and I wish i had a little bit more control over EVERY character in my party, so I give it a fun factor of 4, but it must be recognized that visually this game is ridiculous, CG AND in game will blow you away, and the audio is absolutely top notch, one of the best IMO, so I bumped it up to 5... however if you don't have a HD TV or surround sound, this won't have mcuh effect on you will it?So, great game, not traditional, but I have been much more sold on this new approach then some other's out there, so if you anything like me, I would definitely give it a try or you'll be missing out on a great story (one of the better FF stories IMO, much better than 10) and addictive game.EDIT:My score still stands, but as I am close to 20 hours in to this game (you get your money's worth) I want to note a couple of things I have noticed.  First, I have encountered one instance (although only one) where the linearity of the game felt broken.  Without giving away spoiler's I will just say that one might get into trouble if they specialize their character's too much because the game insists on switching up you battle-group, and even changing its numbers, and so one day you will NEED to use Lightning as a MEDIC.  It doesn't seem logical when she can be such a better, anything else basically. Since the game is linear it means there isn't the same opurtunity for grinding, so if you get stuck, what you have to do is go backwards and use old enemies instead, but this gets highly repetitive.However this incident made me realize two things that I felt people should know before getting, or starting this game: you will basically max out everything eventually, there IS NOT like the materia system in FF 7 where the player decides what to focus on. On the PLUS side, all the none combat moves of each class work ALL the time, so +10 hp for MEDIC and +10 to Commando will work for that character no matter what class he/she is.  This is a very positive thing, which for some reason didn't occur to me right away, I don't know why.The result is that you best advice, and really only advice, is to pursue everything in a fairly balanced manner, with a little bit of room for personal choice about what you acquire first, but at the end of the day it will be a wash, you will get everything.  On one hand this means, you don't get to craft your characters to your will like in other FF games, but it also allows for a lot of satisfaction for every single thing you unlock.  Also if you know this before hand, unlike me, it means that the player will always be ready for what comes next.At the end of the day this is all part of the more linear approach to the game that I mentioned before but didn't initially realize this aspect to it.  The dev's designed it so they could be relatively assured that they new your capabilities at every point in the game as design it accordingly.  As i mentioned above this only broke once for me and it was slightly my own fault for trying to force specialization on a system which doesn't really allow for it.The conclusion is the same as before though, this is part of makes the gmae hgighly addictive, whcih isn't unusual for FF games, but at the same time allows for the story (which continues to impress) to unfold rather quickly, which is a bit unusual.  The result is addictive and rewarding, provided you accept that you aren't in control of certain aspects of the game, although I still insist that in the actual battles, their is great room for skill and technique, and the dev's added a score system to rate you each time which is a nice little recognition of your continued efforts to master the game.HOWEVER, as a contrast to the more restrictive aspects mentioned above, the ability to actually level up your equipment and weapons is a very nice, and player centered aspect of this game which I am quite happy they added.  It really adds something to the whole, leveling-up aspect of the game, and provides a further reward to each battle.  BTW, Cedit Chips ARE NOT for upgrades they are for SELLING, be careful of that!  Sometimes the yforget to explain certain things, but its much preferred to the mountains of text regarding EVERYTHING that one had to read in previous iterations of Final Fantasy (cough 10 cough)Well, not much else to say than I am about to play some more!  Which really says more about the game then any review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt32 \"LIGHT WEIGHT\"","summary":"Very great return to the original with extra flare","reviewText":"First of all, Donkey Kong Returns' basic gameplay sticks very well to the original, which is what everyone was wanting.  However, it does make good use of the Wii capabilities (the shaking the remote, the 3D aspects of the game) Graphics are spot on, that classic DK look but tuned up.  The levels are all very interesting and there are a lot more items and tasks to collect and complete. The multiplayer is set up so that each player can have a chance at playing solo, or working as a team, which is something the first 3 SNES DKs were missing.  It was pretty much a follow-the-leader setup.In the same breath I will say this:  While I personally loved the game, some of the new features aren't for everyone.  I have heard people say they do not like the multiplayer style.  And I can see why, it does make the game harder to complete but at the same time, it helps you build a partnership with your friend.  I really don't care if I EVER see another rocket barrel which was an area of the game that I felt was not done very well in the control area.  Also, I have NEVER complained about a game being challenging, that is why I play video games, but certain levels of this game are out-right annoying they are so hard.  I always like to feel that I have to work to complete a level, but never that trying is just a lost cause.  I would have liked a Easy, Medium, Hard mode personally.All in all, this is a great game.  If Donkey Kong was a big part of your younger life, you will love this.  If you are buying this for a child, I think you should at least let them play through the original first just to make sure it is something that will keep their attention and to make sure they have the skills to take on a game of this magnitude.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Good Balance Between Action and RPG","reviewText":"Darksiders 2 expands on the original game by adding a massive character upgrade system, open ended environments, and a longer campaign with side quests.Story: 9/10Death comes to War's rescue after the events of Darksiders 1.  In order to save his brother, Death must undergo a series of challenges in a massive world heavily inspired by Celtic Lore.  The story is told through graphic novel style cut scenes and in game character dialogue.  The world has been influenced by corruption and Death must destroy this corruption and save the land.  There are traps, angels, demons, guardians, monsters, giants, and armies of minions that stand in his way.Graphics: 7/10The art style is similar to the first Darksiders.  It is exaggerated and somewhat cartoony, akin to World of Warcraft.  It's not bad, but in a game that rivals God of War in its scope, the cartoon style graphics clash with the epic setting.  A game this epic should be a bit more gritty.  The character designs are well thought out and the enemies and bosses are very well done.  There is a wide range of massive environments full of foreboding ruins and ancient temples.  The size and scope of the world really pushes the limit on Epic Fantasy.Gameplay: 7/10There are 4 basic components to Gameplay:CombatDeath is armed with a pair of scythes activated by the X button.  Death carries secondary weapons (Massive Hammers, short blades, etc.) that are activated by the Y button.  By mixing attacks with the X and Y buttons, Death performs fluid combos by attacking with both weapons.  Death can finish off weakened enemies by pressing the B button to perform an Execution kill.  Death also has a phantom grab attack where he can pull small enemies to him or pull himself to larger enemies.  Death's only defensive ability is a teleport.  There is no block, so avoiding the enemies' attacks and counterattacking where there is an opening is the best way to survive.There are also a handful of boosts and special attacks that are unlocked and upgraded on a skill tree.  You can map these attacks to LB+X, LB+Y, LB+A, LB+B.  Using these require energy called Wrath.  In order to fill up your Wrath, you can use a potion or perform normal X, Y, B, attacks on enemies, then unleash Death's fury with his special attacks.As Death progresses through the environments, he encounters waves of enemies.  There are minions who constantly attack death with basic attacks and more powerful Lieutenants that have a special attack or do a great deal of damage.  If you just try to button mash, you'll get killed.ExplorationThis is the weakest part of the game.  The levels are fairly linear, but there are lots of passages that loop back to other areas.  Some areas become reachable when Death gains new abilities.  The camera is not your friend all of the time.  You also have a raven with you named 'Dust.'  If you hold down the L Stick, Dust will fly to where you need to go.  But sometimes, Dust gets confused.  He may fly to a doorway and when you enter that door and activate Dust again, he flies to the doorway that you just entered.  At times, this will drive you crazy.  There are basic hand holds that you can jump to and crawl on to traverse the environments and find chests full of gold, items, and potions.PuzzlesThe Puzzles use switches, platforms, Portals, and even time Travel.  They aren't too complicated, but you feel pretty good when you figure them out.  They're a nice break in the action.Boss FightsThe Boss Fights feel epic.  This game features some really powerful enemies and some colossal bosses.  They all involve some sort of pattern recognition or open window to defeat them.  They're fun, challenging, cinematic, and memorable.RPG Elements:  8/10Darksiders 2 features a surprisingly deep RPG Gear System, where you can equip all of the pieces of Death's armor and weapons separately.  Each item has bonuses or special boosts associated with them.  So a Scythe may have a high damage rating, bonus elemental damage, bonus critical chance, bonus health on executions, etc...  And the armor pieces work the same way.  You can tailor your character to high damage resistance, bonus wrath or health, bonus damage, etc...  And when you find pieces that work well together, you can become really powerful.Sound:  7/10The voice acting is well done and the music is hit or miss.  The action tracks are exciting, but some of the exploration music is so serene, I found myself struggling to stay awake.Replay Value:  5/10The game is 25-40 hours long, depending on how many side quests you finish.  It features a New Game+ Mode, where you can replay a harder difficulty and keep the gear that you have.Maturity: TeenThe Packaging says, M Rated with \"Violence, Suggestive Themes, and Blood and Gore.\"This game is loaded with Fantasy Violence.  Watch Death rip apart and decapitate demons with his scythes and superhuman strength!  But the art style is cartoony and the attacks are so over the top, it's more exciting, than disturbing.  You'll want to say, \"Wow, cool!\" rather than throw up.  Death swings a weapon, and blue sparks or fire fly out of the cartoony demon.  That's pretty much it.  It's surprising how this is Rated M, and Soul Calibur is Teen.  I'd say Soul Calibur is worse because the fighters are humans, the graphics are more realistic, and the attacks are less over the top.Overall:  7/10 (Not quite an 8)The game is fun and really long.  It's a good deal for the price!  You'll like the combat system, the RPG elements, and the epic scope of the game.  You probably won't like the camera at times and it is fairly easy to get lost - especially if you are doing side quests.Buy it if you like God of War style action, Epic Quests, and RPG Loot Systems.The game is really long, so buying it might be a better deal than renting it, unless you have 25-30 hours to spare in a week.Avoid this game if you want to rush from fight to fight because the exploration and level designs may frustrate you.Avoid this game if you prefer realistic graphics like Assassin's Creed over World of Warcraft Graphics.If you played this and want more:If you liked the Loot Systems, play Borderlands!If you like Epic RPG's check out Skyrim or Witcher 2.If you like great melee combat, check out Bayonetta, Castlevania, Ninja Gaiden 2, or Devil May Cry.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}

I first heard of Final Fantasy in one of those books. Upon being pursuaded I decided to try my hand at a new side of video gaming--RPG's. Unlike the Zelda games, the graphics were SHARP and BRIGHT. Not the stupid pastel-colors in earlier NES games. When you first pop the game in, the blue narrative screen comes up and the Final Fantasy Prelude plays. But where's the title, you ask? I'll explain later. Then you name your four characters, and the best part is that you can choose which TYPES of characters you want EVERY time you start again! Do you want muscle, or magic? Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage and Black Mage. After this, the fantasy begins . . . .The princess has been kidnapped by the evil knight Garland, who lives far to the north on this tiny island continent. The four warriors beef up and face Garland, whereupon he says, \"You impertinent fools! I, Garland, shall knock you all down!\" Then the first major battle in the FF series takes place. But the title screen STILL hasn't appeared yet. Back at your home castle, the king and queen are so happy that you saved the princess that they agree to build a bridge spanning over to the other continent. You step onto the bridge . . . and THAT'S when the title screen appears, when the Final Fantasy (anthem, I guess you'd call it) plays. In short, the first hour of the game was just a PROLOGUE--like they have in books. I've played all the way up to FF9, but that title screen still impresses me. I hope you know that I'm writing all this from memory--that's how good this game is. Even now, USED copies of Final Fantasy cost ...

I don't play multiplayer/online, and I'm not into the whole \"zombie apocalypse\" thing, but this game is straight up exciting! Zombies EVERYWHERE and plenty of weapons to kill them with. I've only played around 8 hours, and I'm just starting Chapter 3. There are 16 chapters in this game, so that makes me on pace to play for 60+ hours to complete the main missions!I consider myself an above average gamer, but my play style is very careful, and I do take advantage of everything to help me through any game. For instance, when a pack of zombies rushes me, I will turn, run, and hop onto a car or overturned boat to fend them off. Once on a car/boat, they cannot get me for some reason, but I can get them. Then I just kick them until they die or there's only one or two of them left where I can kill them with a weapon. This does take longer to take care of them, but my weapons last longer as does my health. There is an abundance of health to find in the form of \"energy drinks\", you just have to find them sitting on tables and whatnot. There's no real consequence for dying, and you start right back close to where you died - which is cool. Kind of like BioShock in a way.Everything on this GOTY is ON THE DISK. There is no downloading involved. So that's nice. Even though I'm about 8 hours into it, the only negative I can say so far, is that the zombie spawn rate is pretty quick. Once you've gone through an area and killed off the zombies, the next time through that area, they are there again. Not a big deal breaker to me, but I can see it being annoying to some. The voice acting is kind of cheesy, but again, not a deal breaker for me. It is a huge, sandbox, open world to explore and very nice graphics.I do like the RPG element for this game as it helps you define the type of play style and character you are. As I leveled up, so did the weapons I found, and they are EVERYWHERE, so I just use them until they either break, or I find one that's better. Making weapons is cool, but it costs money, and you will have to pay to keep them repaired or they break. I have made a couple of sweet weapons, but as I leveled up, they became my weaker weapons and I just discarded them, so I don't make weapons anymore. The zombies also level up with you, so you cannot just overrun them as your level increases. Kind of like Borderlands.I have been on the fence about this game since it came out. I heard/read about all the glitches and problems, but I have yet to experience anything to ruin my game play. I bought it new at a game store for $20 and I see it's even less now on Amazon. I think it's absolutely worth $20 so far. I have played Borderlands GOTY, God Of War Saga, BioShock 1&2, inFAMOUS Collection, Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Mas Effect 1&2, GTA IV, and UnCharted, and enjoyed them all. So if you played all or any of these games and enjoyed them, then I think you should consider this game as well. I mean $16 for 50-60 hours of zombie killing fun.....that's a no brain'er anyways!!

Get a life!Let me cut to the quick -Brothers in Arms tries to be Call Of Duty with squad based action. IT FAILS MISERABLY!!!!!!This game tries to offer a really solid, SQUAD based game. No more typical First Person shooter. In other words, you don't go running full speed shooting everything in site! And your squad mates actually do help you defeat the enemy.SADLY, this sounds better than it actually is.Game graphics -This game runs on the Unreal Engine so I expected top of the line graphics. You get far less than that! Even the soldiers have NO facial expressions. Their lips move but the face does not change or offer any emotion or expression. Stick lips on a 2\"x6\" pine plank and you will get the same experience!!!Vocals/Dialog -OHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhh soooo painful! Cliche' after cliche', tons of curse words thrown in as a desperate attempt to give you the \"grit\" of war. Bad monologues that run on forever, bad cutscenes, nothing interesting at all.Weapons -Nice selection...but highly inaccurate!!! To get any accurate shooting done, you MUST aim down the barrel. With all the fast action going on, you have no time to aim and line up a shot. If you shoot with out aiming, you better be 2 feet away from the guy...and even then they will kill you quick!!!You will not get the chance to use many of the weapons either...unless you hunt on the ground for the dead soldiers dropped weapons.Gameplay -Squad based activity is decent but repetitive. The missions are almost pointless and definitely are redundant! It winds up turning into the same thing everytime.

The fact that you can't skip the poorly-done game cinematics doesn't help the poor presentation, and while the series is supposed to be grand, this ends up 'walk forward and kill things'. The fact that the Fellowship will follow and help sometimes but not others feels untrue to the movies and book.Story: 3/10I'm not the kind of person to demand photo-realism or exact replication - I still enjoy playingChrono Cross- but this game was truly unimpressive. It's not 'gasp, it's Dong Zhuo!' ugly, but it's disappointing.Graphics: 5/10At least the sound effects do all the right stealing. The movies sound pretty good, and the game sounds fair. Music and in-game sound-effect volume can be altered independently, but the ambiance lacks a certain polish that I expected from the movies the game is based off.Sound: 6/10While the music is indeed stolen from the movies, what shows in the game is toned down background material. WhileThe Lord of the Rings The Third Agemay not have been the most innovative RPG, at least it sounded and looked nice throughout.Music: 5.8/10This is repetitive action requiring complex combos for unimpressive-looking moves, along a narrow path that offers none of the free exploration of the wide, impressive lands of the movies. Your ability to upgrade your character is based on how skilled (lucky) you are in the level, because you can't replay and this means that if you have a bad run, your only option is to reset the game and load all over again. None of the skills really seem to change gameplay that much, as an RPG this game falls flat on its face and as a hack-and-slash it makesDynasty Warriors 4look great (it's not). The local co-op consists of the middle six levels where a friend can follow you along the narrow, short levels, but isn't nearly as easy to get into as good co-op games where you can generally have a friend help from the start.Gameplay: 4/10You don't even get the option to play co-op until after you've already spent at least a half-hour beating the first two levels, and then you have to save and quit to the main menu to discover that levels can't be repeated. What? You didn't have a lucky run with Gimli and you're too short for that one minimally helpful upgrade? Start all over. The fact that the first two levels can only be played with one fixed character and all but one of the rest are locked to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli don't help. There are extras you automatically unlock by progressing through the missions, but unlike The Third Age there's little good organization or sense of true satisfaction.Replayability: 1/10With the large number of five-star reviews, I had high expectations, and perhaps that was part of the problem. Everything it tries to do has already been done better elsewhere, and while I'm not going to say this game was horrible, it was short and lackluster - barring getting stuck on a level, you can finish in one sitting of just a few hours (though boring load times and unskippable cutscenes don't help). If you want a good Lord of the Rings RPG,The Lord of the Rings The Third Ageis superb compared to this. If you want hack-and-slash, look for a different franchise. I wouldn't even suggest a rental, but do that before you consider buying, even for bargain-bin prices.Overall: 3.7/10","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"A good addition to the RE family","reviewText":"I haven't tried the online part, but I look forward to it. This is a review of the single-player gameplay.The concept of playing with three A.I. characters is unique in this type of game. Although, it is not done as well as it could have been. The characters are not exactly geniuses, and you can't coordinate with them very well. But, they are a help, and this game is a change from the usual RE games. The combat is the same as the games preceding Resident Evil 4.  You cannot move very fast, or dodge, or aim. It is somewhat difficult to fight. But, many of us are used to it, and the learning curve isn't too bad for those new to the challenging (some say crappy, but I won't take sides) controls. I liked the music, especially on the title screen. Most of it just blends into the background, or it just wasn't there, I didn't really notice. The voice-acting is somewhat weak, and the characters can get annoying. They say things like \"Dear God!\" and \"I don't wanna die!\" repeatedly. The graphics are pretty good. The opening scene got my attention, showed how the crisis came to be, and looked good. The cutscenes are well done, while the graphics during the rest of the game are decent for the Playstation 2. There is little variety in the enemies; they are mostly zombies. Some are difficult, like the parasite-mutant boss, but there are different levels of difficulty, so you can play on easy if you have trouble. You cannot save permanently. If you save, you return to the title screen, and when you load, your save is deleted. I guess that is supposed to add to the whole multiplayer feel. The major problem I have is the long load time. It takes about ten seconds to load in between rooms, and about 15 seconds or more to load after a cutscene. Overall, this is an interesting new concept for survival-horror, and I recommend trying it. Most likely, the multiplayer part of the game adds to the value of this game, so take that into consideration if you have the proper equipment to go online.Several months later...I finally got a network adapter, so I've tried going online. It has added new life to this game. The people I worked with were quite a bit smarter than those AI characters. But, it can be difficult to communicate with them. You can chat before the game starts, and you have a few set things you can say like \"Go!\" or \"Help me!\" or people's names, but you can't actually type. So it's hard to strategize during the scenario. Working as a team was still worthwhile, though. We helped each other when we were under attack, we shared, we solved puzzles together. In one level, friendly fire was on, and my partner suddenly went nuts and turned on me and the other players. He came after us with a shotgun. We stood no chance with our handguns and knives... So I died, turned into a zombie, and went after him. But zombies are really slow, so my teammates died as well. It was a little sad, but it was also an interesting twist. The zombie experience is pretty fun, but short. You succumb to the virus or your injuries within minutes. The multiplayer feature adds a star to the score of this game.I recently discovered costumes and characters in the Collection section of the game. You get points when you play, and you can spend those points to buy various costumes and NPCs to play in. They each come with an extra item, which range from an antidote pill to some extra handgun ammo. Also in the Collection are movies, music, and pictures to buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2005"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Great Story, Great Controls, Beautiful Graphics","reviewText":"This is an example why Stephen King needs to jump into developing stories for horror based games. This is a close representation of what could come from the mind of Stephen King. It nails the mysterious atmosphere, with strange characters, and an unknown force that is against you. Alan Wake is a great character and someone different to play as. He is someone that writes novels and his wife wants him to write another while they are on vacation. Alan completely disagrees with this and then events unfold from there.Now the force that took your wife is the darkness and your trying to save her from it. The darkness is a evil force that can only be defeated by shining light on it to make it vunerable. Its amazing how they utilized it from the vehicles that you use, to spotlights, and even driving segiments. The darkness can consume anything so you have to be on your toes. I didn't consider it that scary but I was surprised a few times. They way you avoid the enemies is pretty amazing by the use of the dodge to avoid enemy attacks. Its done very fluidly which shines how well the controls are for the game. Aiming at enemies has never been a problem and even when your run out of bullets for a gun, it will switch to your other gun. If you don't have a gun then just run into the light. The game has a check point system that is always around each corner. You will make steady progress through this game.Now a special thing about this game is how its presented like a tv show. They are each done in a episode and each episode is really lengthy. After you beat a episode it will end and recap pass episode events before you start your next episode. It could have been pushed with credits after each episode to make it seem more authentic but its nice otherwise.The last few things I will mention is the graphics, the length, and replay value. The game is extremely beautiful. Its one of the best 360 games I have seen and the use of lighting is better than any game I have ever played. If there was a category for it for video game awards, this game would win it. Its amazing how realistic the lighting looks how it is displayed. The length I have to say is very short. You can beat it in about 12 hours. There is free content that comes with the game that is downloaded on a later date. One thing that could make you go back through it is getting everything such as coffee mugs, watch all tv channels, pick up all memos, and such. There is a lot of collecting and a lot of them tie into achievements.I recommend this game for its great story, interesting character (voice work is top notch), and how great it looks. The gameplay is the most important and its a blast to play. It is a mystery in the world you are and it really evolves and becomes more interesting as you progress through the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2010"}

I didn't like the first assassins creed.  It was incredibly repetitive and boring to me.  After repeating the same play cycle twice I got frustrated with sitting on benches and listening to boring conversations.  So much so that I returned the game to get whatever I could out of it.How surprised I was then to find out how fun the sequel was.  Assassins creed 2 is a great example of how a company fixes their mistakes from their first attempt.This game is exciting and the missions are varied.  Yeah, you kill and kill and kill but the ways the game sets you up to do it is awesome.  I love that there are different mission varieties as well to keep the game fresh.The story is great as well.  I really enjoyed the combined story of Ezio and Desmond.  I was always wanting to know what happened next.Another big complaint I had about the first game was the stupidity of the enemies.  I would just get a huge bounty then wait for a crowd of soldiers to crowd around me.  One at a time they would strike at me.  I would just counter and immediatley kill them.  They just continued to do that until I had killed them all.  I didn't find it fun.In this one however there are many enemy types.  Some have heavy armor.  Some have spears. Some have knives and are incredibly quick.  They still arent all that intelligent but they definitely mix things up a bit and make it a challenge.  The combat is also improved and much more fun to utilize in this game.I did like the visuals in the first game and this one is no different.  The massive city you navigate is very detailed and fun to look over from a high perch.The only small complaint I have is that the game did start to get a little repetitive with some of the missions be a bit too similar but overall it is a very fun game.If you liked the first game then you will love this sequal.

Take your basic action/adventure platform game, throw in a stealth kill element, set it in a reasonable accurate semblance of the Middle East during the Crusades and you have a game that surprised me enough to merit two playthrus.  Keep in mind that this is not a favorite ganre of mine.  I thinks the tidbits of fairly accurate eleventh Century history and the lavish illustration and animation are what drew me in, and the glorious fun of slaughtering Knights Templar and punching out irritating beggars kept me going.You are actually two players.  One is Desmond Miles, and escapee from the modern Assassin Cult, who falls into the hands of the Abstergo Corporation.  Tis huge drug company wants one thing - Desmond's DNA memories of one of his ancestors.  And this is your second character - Altair, a true assassin who fumbles a treasure hunt for an ancient artifact hidden under Solomon's Temple so badly that he is stripped of all rank by his master and given a string of assassination assignments so that he might prove himself again.  There is a common thread running through the men he is sent to kill, and thereby hangs a tale.The Desmond episodes are really pretty lifeless.  Considering that he is being subjected to a machine that forces him to relive his genetic memories, and will certainly be killed once the secret is pried out of his cells, Desmond is almost passive in his acceptance of his fate.  Fortunately, you will spend little time in the present.  Altair may be a cold and calculating protagonist, but he makes up for it in his potential proficiency as a killer and a thief.  You will leap about cities, ride wildly through the desert, and, incidentally, experience some breathtaking scenery.  The assassinations require as much skill in planning and approach as they do bladework and brute force.Be warned though, the complaints about the missions being repetitive are not unmerited.  Each quest means a run through the desert, and a set of mapping and information gathering activities that vary only because the three main settings (Damascus, Acre, and Jerusalem) are different.  The only real variations are the assassinations.  But all the activity, in which you can set the pace instead of the evil game designer is fun, assuming you like slaughter.  And if you don't, this isn't really the game for you.  The assassinations are all different though and there are moments of great satisfaction when a villain impales himself on your hidden dagger.Another plus for the game is it's historical context.  Most of us Westerners have a vision of the Crusades as a collection of heroic deeds by white Anglo-Saxon Catholics in hard shells.  The truth is much more complex than that, and Assassin's Creed makes it clear that there was a good deal more corruption and cruelty (by all the participants) than there was heroism.  I found this eye opening, and this may be the first game to awaken my normally dormant interest in history.The game plays well on the Sony PS3.  I experienced only a few hang-ups and action is quite fluid, although load times can be atrocious.  I did discover one feature that exists in the XBOX 360 version that isn't in the PS3 game -- one the XBOX the game keeps track of your achievements, major and minor, and assigns you a score.  It's a minor lack, but one I would have enjoyed having.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2008"}

EA has added some serious \"Next Gen\" features to this version of Burnout Revenge, including \"Live Revenge\" and \"Save and Share.\" The former keeps track of all of the players that take you out online. When you meet up with one of these rivals again, they'll be highlighted just before you begin a race with them. Likewise, if you've taken out someone who is in the current race, you'll see that they're \"gunning for you.\" This significantly ups the ante for playing online and creates an incredible adrenaline rush as you must either dodge an attempt for payback or seek out your arch enemies for revenge. Likewise, the Save and Share feature allows you to record up to 30 seconds of your single-player races and forward them to the people on your Xbox Live friends list. These friends can download and watch the clips while they have the Burnout Revenge disc in their 360.But when it comes right down to it, Burnout Revenge is all about destruction. EA has improved all of the facets of what makes the \"Burnout\" series so exciting, and pumped it into a great title for the Xbox 360. This isn't just a \"better\" version of Burnout Revenge for the original Xbox, this is a title designed for the best gaming platform currently available. If you already own the original Xbox title, you might buy this version if you really enjoy playing online (because of the new \"Live Revenge\" feature), or want to send clips of your biggest and baddest crashes to other 360 users.The average racer will spend about 25 hours just completing all of the races. But to earn all of the achievements, you'll be playing much longer. You must earn a 5-star rating on each and every race to obtain 100% completion, and a number of achievements require that you perfect each category of race. Also, there are almost a dozen achievements (245 of the 1000 gamerscore) that can only be earned online.Finally, there are 79 cars to unlock, which can be earned by obtaining a medal in certain races, performing \"signature\" takedowns in different parts of each map, and completing the challenge sheet of each level.In short, this game will keep you busy! The variety of racing, crashes and traffic attack modes provide much more entertainment value than a normal racing title and the incredible work put into the 360-exclusive features make Burnout Revenge an excellent game to add to your \"Next Gen\" collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2006"}

Environmental damage could be improved because some things that should be destructible to your car just aren't and its really annoying for your car to get stuck on an object that should break easily.The story is decent, and the world looks good.

Sorornejad","summary":"Product Doesn't Match Hype","reviewText":"I purchased my PS3 a few years back in anticipation of this game's release.  I understood that the game wouldn't be out for a while, and I also understood there would be delays, but because I also own an Xbox, I relied on the Forza series to hold me over.  With the game now released, I am quite disappointed with it, considering the hype, and the time taken to develop.Audio : Game audio is a mixed bag of awesome and common here.  The menu's are filled with tacky elevator music, which is quite normal for racing games.  Luckily the quality of the music is nice, and fits the package.  In game audio is quite incredible.  Compared to the Forza series, GT5's car audio sounds much more realistic.  Car's actually sound like their real life counterparts, and modifications actually change the note of the cars sound output.  In game music is filled with random songs with nice \"racing\" guitar riffs and such.  Overall I would say the audio is an awesome part of this game.Display : Here is where things get a bit confusing.  When playing the game you will notice that there are cars labeled \"Standard\" and cars labeled \"Premium\".  Currently, only about 20% of the cars in the game are \"Premium\" cars.  Although this doesn't effect the actual driving of the car, it is a pretty good indication of the display quality of the car model itself.  Generally, \"Standard\" cars are ported from various versions of GTx and upscaled to PS3 quality. This means that there is no damage, and no interior to the vehicle.  This is quite misleading considering that the commercials and the pre release media never made mention of this caveat.  That aside, \"Premium\" cars have full damage and full interiors.  As you increase in your driver level, the damage to the cars gets more impeding to your ability to drive the car normally during a race.  The game is scaled up to 1080p with an optional 3D mode.  Although I cannot comment on the 3D mode, the standard game display is very appealing.  The tracks are beautifully detailed and the \"Premium\" cars look spectacular.Gameplay:  This is where things get a bit dissapointing.  The gameplay is nothing short of any other GT5 game.  The cars \"feel right\" and the driving experience is great.  That being said, car modifications really fall short.  There are a lot of things missing here which is somewhat questionable.  One thing, albeit minor, can be quite important depending on your vehicle and application, which is brake upgrades.  Unfortunately Brakes are one thing missing from the tuning shop.  Granted you can change brake bias on any vehicle, its unfortunate that you cannot upgrade your standard brake package.  Another thing missing is the chassis reinforcement with added weight.  There is a \"Chassis Reinforcement\" option, however, it doesn't explain exactly what it does for the vehicle.  In past GT games, you had the ability to not only do weight reduction modifications (which are there), but also reinforcement of the chassis through addition of weight.  Although this doesn't hinder normal driving, it does leave the tuning experience a bit short ended.Online: This is the hardest part to comment on.  I have had this game for about a week, and cannot establish a good online connection.  Sometimes when loading the game, you will see a notice that the network connection cannot be established.  I assume this is due to the massive amounts of people playing the game and overloading the servers.  However, this hinders your ability to play the game since it tries to connect to the server multiple times, thus freezing your cursor until a message comes back.  Once connected online, you will be presented with the lounge which is quite nice, but the racing experience has yet to be tamed due to lag.  Unfortunately I cannot comment further on the online experience since I gave up on it until the initial hype dies out.  Hopefully there are other reviews here that can comment.Other:  There are some other con's that really become cumbersome.  One of the most important ones are replay controls....there are none!  Like Forza, the user has the ability to watch replays and take photos during said replay.  The unfortunate part here is that you cannot rewind or fast forward your replay!  So you need to wait until lap 14 of a 15 lap race to catch that spectacular drift that you did,  and need to be sure to not miss the photo op or else you need to start all over with the replay.  I don't understand why this was missed, it seems an integral part of any replay system.  Another killer is the separation between \"Standard\" and \"Premium\" cars.  Standard cars as mentioned before do not get damaged...which in turn creates a \"cheap\" racing environment where the AI will try to gain the lead by shoving you out of the way without repercussion.  Standard cars cannot take updates to their rims, which again is something minor but also something that makes you say \"why?!?!\".  Lastly, the paint shop is such a convoluted ordeal.  You must obtain paints by purchasing cars and getting their \"paint item\".  Once acquired, you can go into the paint shop with another car, and use that paint item on that car.  Unfortunately you cannot see a preview of the paint color on the car until you purchase the paint job.Overall: All the cons that I have mentioned can be easily fixed (I assume) through patches.  I hope the case here was that the game was released in time for the holiday season \"unfinished\" and that patches will be coming out in full force to fix all of these issues.  It is quite unfortunate to see a game as hyped up like this be such a let down.  I am a huge racing fan, and although I am quite un-biased with the whole xbox vs ps3 debate, I find that Forza 3 is currently the better choice if you have that option.  At this point, I suggest at least renting the game before you jump on this purchase to see if it is really for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2010"}

As a gaming community we sometimes must rely on one another's opinions because sometimes we can't trust professional reviews.With that said this game was truly amazing. I haven't loved an Assassins Creed game this much since the 2nd of the franchise.Positives:+The gameplay remains for the most part the same, so if you enjoy the good old Assassins Creed gameplay you feelright at home in AC4.+Stealth is great as usual, it's funny creeping around the cornering stalking your target.+Naval battles are a complete joy and upgrading your ship is very addicting, you also control other ships but you only see them on a map and you use these ships to earn you extra money.+If you enjoyed collecting items in prior games, this one definitely has plenty of things for you to collect.+Story is one thing the Assassins a Creed series usually does a good job at.+Blackbeard, the Pirates singing is also quite a joy to listen to.+Graphically it looks good, and their is a good variety of locations to explore throughout the game.+Main character is really compelling much better than Conor.Negatives:-Stealth missions can feel derivative and get annoying after you fail them 3-5 times.-The story outside of Edward Kenway's is just plain bland and unnecessary.Multiplayer-Standard AC multiplayer it's good fun, but it won't hold your interest for very long. Still it's a worthy addition to the series of multiplayer.For the most part I highly recommend AC4 if you loved AC2 and enjoyed AC Brotherhood you will love this one.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Your choices from the two prior do not impact any major parts of the game(just like in 2), it was like hey thanks for saving me see you later. !!!!!spoiler!!!!! The mission on Tuchanka where you face the rachni queen. In the original you had the choice of killing the queen or sparing her but no matter what decision you made a rachni queen still appears.At the end of me2 you have the choice of 'destroying' the human reaper or handing it over to cerberus but not matter what you do it still appears in ME3 on the level with kei leng. The option of rewriting or destroying the geth in 2 is pointless because you have to rewrite them again in 3. The game is full of events and missions where your choices become obsolete. The whole concept of overhearing pedestrians in order to bring up a mission to scan a planet for 'war assets'. Bioware couldn't make some of those be actual missions. The day one dlc is probably the biggest rip off in the history of gaming considering the hype that this game had before release. Bioware knew they could made a few more million off of gamers by not adding it in to begin with since it did get delayed an extra 2 and a half months. The extra character doesn't really add anything to the story other than when you go to the asari homeworld and find out the gods they worshipped were just the protheans. Somehow the collectors, who were the main enemy from 2, were big during the prothean era but werent even mentioned during me1. The melee attack is half assed. Vega is useless and what happened to all the characters from 2. All of a sudden they cant join with you for some bs reason. Joker falls in love with EDI the AI. Half assed story that I wouldnt believe if my life depended on it. Somehow people can still be petty when faced with extinction. Reapers are all of a sudden weaker unlike in me1 when Sovereign easily took out half the fleet fighting it. It was said that 1 reaper could take out an entire planet yet somehow humanity is putting up a great fight against hundreds if not thousands of them. Why do reapers need ground forces? Why is humanity such a major threat to the reapers? is shepard that much of a bamf that they have to take out all humans first? the scanning of a system get annoying when you have to constantly run from reapers after 2 scans. Bioware makes you feel left out if you didnt romance Liara in 1 by making ashley/kaiden romance subpar and me2 romance obsolete. Apparently everyone overlooked a person still living on eden prime that wasnt human(the dlc character). this is the smallest complaint i have but i hate it when you refer to marines as soldier and completely jack up the rank structure. soldier, sailor, airman, marine. each branch has is on rank structure do some research Bioware, activision did it with Call of duty 4. The sole purpose of me2 was to introduce the illusive man because Cerberus plays such a huge role in 3 which is another thing that every gamer overlooks. why the hell is Cerberus going gainst everything cmdr shepard does like trying to prevent the fertile female krogan from going back to the krogan. why did bioware have to add multiplayer to an already working franchise. if it isnt broke dont fix it. All multiplayer really is is a cheap knockoff of gears of war horde mode with horrible controls. once you complete a mission on a planet you can not revisit it. the glitches are annoying but arent too bad but when compared to me2 its bad. now the ending, how in any way is this a good ending. you screw over the entire galaxy. regardless of what bioware says and i have the guide to prove what they claim there is only 1 ending with 3 different color: red green blue. There are not 16 endings just one. same cut scenes after you 'make your final choice' just very very slightly adjusted depending on if you merge control or destroy the reapers. not the epic ending we were promised.Worst ending in gaming history. Major plot holes. Limited party members. Completely ubsurb story (all you have to do is think about it a little people). do not but this game it will ruin the first 2. it did for me. i traded in all 3 for 360 all of which were collectors editions and 2 for ps3, me3 was a collectors edition. i even gave away all the comic book tie ins because the last 1k hours of gameplay was just a waste of timei have a feeling some people are going to get all butt hurt bc they arent unbiased to see all the fault with this game and will take this personally.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2012"}

The earth below and the vast oceans it once harbored are mere legend.Act as conscience and spirit guide for young Kalas and his companion Xelha. Guide them in battle and watch their friendship bloom. Join them as they struggle to reveal the mystery of the lost sea and destroy the corruption that threatens their world.I played this game for 70 hours, doing the three main sub quests (Constellation Magnus, Animals side quest, and family sub quest) and completing the game.Also set some time aside for a great ending, this game had a great story, good characters, and some secret stuff that rocked! I highly recommend this RPG.

{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"SB","summary":"For $5 you can have some fun, but it's not going to change your life.","reviewText":"This is a decent game, that gets some points in my book for being so cheap--at this price, I'm happy with the purchase and had some fun.  The graphics are nothing new, but they are certainly effective.  In fact, the Russian setting in a variety of cold war bases, gulags, cemeteries, and other creepy Soviet-style locations are all very well done, varied, richly detailed and evocative.  The combat is a little clunky, but the variety of weapons, powers, and whatnot make up for that.  The various guns, the Glaive, and the extra powers are very fun to use.  I never got tired of the different methods of using the Glaive & guns combination.The most annoying elements of the game are:1) As the game goes on, there's a nice progression of various enemy types, but as the combat gets harder, the imprecision of the controls, especially the melee moves, starts to become a bit frustrating.  Also frustrating is the Gears of War syndrome: since one or two buttons perform so many different functions depending on the context, movement can be really problematic-- you roll when you are trying to take cover, you take cover when you want to roll, you run when you are trying to roll.2) The fact that it is not always clear how to proceed to the next area, as the puzzles are pretty hard to figure out.3) The boss fights always rely on some trick sequence or puzzle or series of steps that are just very difficult to determine.  Another reviewer has noted that you can't even tell if you are hurting the bosses, as they don't register increasing damage, they just keel over after you've finally figured out the right move!  Open combat with soldiers and zombie/infected enemies is much more fun.  The enemies are stupid, but numerous, so that balances out.If you can deal with those negatives, this makes a nice little actioner.  The elements ripped off from other games is more than made up for by the unique setting and interesting mix of powers and weapons.  Like I said, this game won't change your life, and don't bother with it if you haven't yet played the big action games for the 360.  But after you've played those out, you might want to give this a go, especially at $5!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Basically gearbox software about two years ago started showing some demos of this game that they were working on. And those demos looked amazing I mean fans of the Alien series were blown away. I will link below a YouTube video where you can see a comparison of the demo and the game that was released and it's a sad thing to see what this game became.Search this video on YouTube: 6lGXDM3LGnkNow as a game it's kind of a mess the graphics are not that great on console or PC and is really just an average first-person shooter. But if your Aliens fan and you long to go back to LV-426 that it might be worth your hard-earned cash to do so. It's nice to hold the M40-1A pulse rifle and gun down Xenomorphs like a complete bad ass. And it does build on the alien mythos and is an extension of Aliens and acknowledges some of the events of Alien 3 (which if you're an Aliens fan could be good or bad in your opinion -  if you are an Aliens fan you should watch Alien 3 special edition it is a lot better than the theatrical cut). I would personally wait until this game pits about $20 maybe even $10 (and trust me by the way it was reviewed and the scores and got it won't take long to reach that price point) then I think it might be worth jumping in if you're just sort of a fan of the series.I would like to note that the multiplayer is kind of cool and it's better than it's ever been in any previous games. But the problem you'll have is that since everybody hates the game multiplayer isn't that have a really large population for very long. I will update this review in the future letting you know about how the multiplayer matchmaking is working.All in all I would only recommend this game if you're a hard-core fan of the series/movies and one a little bit more of the story arc. But be warned if you're just a so-so fan of the series there are a lot better purchases for games out there.I just hope someday in the future gearbox releases the aliens demo that they showed because that's the game we all deserved and the game that would've put right all the countless alien games that have totally sucked.

As I said i just started playing the game today and i spent about 3 hours on it, I just had to stop because I have to work tomorrow, if not I'd still be playing it.So if you grew up with these films you'll love this game.Hope this helps.CHEERS","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2009"}

Even though the game is a side scroller, the backgrounds, characters, and action is all composed with nicely detailed polygons and some great lighting effects.  You go through seven insanely tough levels (all of which will bring back fond memories of Contra 3 and Contra: Hard Corps) and you have three different weapons at your disposal.  The controls are pretty responsive (thankfully) and you will need precision movement to survive the never ending onslaught of enemies.  The hard rocking soundtrack is also worth noting as well, the headbanging music really suits the game well and fits the tone of the game like a glove.  The only complaint, and this will be from younger gamers who were deprived from a Contra experience, is that sometimes the game is way too hard and can get very, very frustrating, but for Contra vets this isn't a problem.  All in all, fans of the Contra games of old should definitely pick this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"Jeremy M Boney","summary":"I love how all the moves are the same no matter ...","reviewText":"I play this ALL the time with my friends.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"A leap forward","reviewText":"From the opening scene, L.A. Noire has a level of story telling rarely found in games. I was immediately sucked in by an immersive atmosphere, compelling narrative, and interesting characters. It's a new twist on several genres with a solid presentation and setting. Definitely a must buy for gamers of all stripes.(+) A perfect blend of mechanics and gameplay from various genres - adventure, interactive gaming (ala Heavy Rain), and open world - it feels like L.A. Noire is a step forward for gaming. As iD did for first person shooters with Castle Wolfenstein, Mario 64 for platforming, and GTA3 for sandboxes, Rock Star has moved gaming into new territory - one in which character interactions and development feel something closer to authentic - without the \"gamey\" feeling that has plagued previous attempts. They accomplished this a few ways. The first is the pioneering facial capture technology - it eliminates \"dead eyed\" and robotic video game characters, allowing the player to observe true reaction and emotion. The second is a combination of characters and environments that have nearly realistic locomotion and life. It feels like the next generation of animation and AI in gaming has arrived(+) You guide the lead character through his life as a police officer in 1940's Los Angeles. As you progress through the story you're given glimpses, via flashbacks, into the character's past and how he came to be the man he is. A supplemental side story can be followed by finding and reading news papers within the open world. Cases and transitions within cases are handled via superbly acted and directed cinematics. Although not all cases are related, there is a main plot line that ramps up and becomes as tangled as any good noire thriller. The game does drag a bit towards the end, in my opinion, but the conclusion is ultimately very satisfying(+) The bulk of the gameplay revolves around traveling throughout the city, locating and manipulating clues, speaking with and/or interrogating persons of interest, and piecing everything together to uncover as much as you can about a case and resolve it without any loose ends. In some ways it's relaxing, while interrogations can be both entertaining and thought provoking. It's a style of gameplay that I am sure will be emulated by a hundred derivatives in the coming years(+) You earn experience by finding clues and successfully getting persons of interest to answer questions truthfully, ranking up and earning \"intuition points\" based on how well you did. Intuition points can be used to make interrogations easier or uncover clues at a scene. You can also look at statistical data of how the community at large approached a problem. Action sequences that you have failed several times can be skipped, allowing the story to proceed. All together it's an interesting system that can help to alleviate difficulty for more casual players and keep them engaged - rather than frustrated(-) The controls are mostly flawless, however, positioning your character to interact with a clue can sometimes be awkward and clumsy. This doesn't occur often, but when it does it can really take you out of the immersion(+) Movement during combat and action sequences is similar to other recent Rock Star games, such as Red Dead Redemption. However, they've refined the controls a bit and character movement and interaction with the environment is much more cohesive and natural. The character grabs and swings around railings while chasing a perp up a flight stairs, adjusts stride and position to avoid pedestrians, or vaults over an obstruction - all in very realistic-looking animations. Little touches like this add to the immersion that I've already gushed about(+/-) Although the game appears to be an open world/sandbox like GTA or Red Dead Redemption, be aware that looks are a bit deceiving. The narrative is much more guided, and you're prevented from drawing your weapon outside of dedicated segments - which doesn't give much leeway for mayhem. You are free to explore the city to your heart's content, however, discovering landmarks and responding to short action-oriented dispatches (there are 40 of these side missions in all, each with a bite sized story involved).But aside from those things, no, L.A. Noire is not an open world game in the same vein as Rockstar's previous titles. If you can enjoy each individual game for what it is, rather than how it compares in functionality to some other game the same developer has made, then you should be fine. But I could see this being a problem for some players","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"potato_salad \"Marqus\"","summary":"Resident Evil 4","reviewText":"I have to admit, I hate horror games.

You are right in the action. People are coming at you right and left but you feel kind of helpless(especially with low ammo). It does not hurt that the graphics are gorgeous either. Another plus for the game is that the buttons could be mapped any better. This is one of the few games that I'm completely happy with the way the buttons are mapped. I also like how you can upgrade your weapons. Last but not least, I enjoy how the background music changes once someone start walking towards you.My only complaint with the game is that the hit detection is kinda off.

Following up on footsteps of such giants is never easy. And yet the 5th installment of the series, SKYRIM, still managed to impress and ensnare me.INFINITE. INFINITE IN ALL DIRECTIONS.For SKYRIM, Bethesda will only take up 6GB on your HDD and with that the game designers created a literally endless world, with extremely long drawing distances, high mountains, passing clouds, dark forests, foliage moving to the wind and water trickling in streams. Everything you see in the horizon is actually accessible. Now, compare that to the ...21GBRAGEtakes up for a much, much more small and visually limited world to realize what was accomplished with SKYRIM. The world is absolutely huge - and it feels real.The graphics are gorgeous, almost realistic. Sure, I could do with somewhat more detailed textures when it comes to clothing (they look much better in the inventory than when worn) as well as a more bold color palette (besides grasses, there are also colorful wildflowers, Bethesda); however, the imaginative design of the items and equipment, the natural movements of the characters and the way light and shadows play with each other all the time more than make up for these shortcomings. The game is as beautiful as it is deep and endless.ALL SCHOOLS OF FIGHTING ARE WELCOMEEach hand has its own menu. You can go with sword and shield or spell and weapon, dual weapons or dual spells (yes, spells can be combined - and the spell effects are very impressive, especially the frost and thermal ones!). Ana always keep in mind: some Words have power beyond any comprehension.The camera is very accommodating and both First-Person and Third-Person views are available. It will take some time before you settle into your own fighting style but once that is done the game mechanics will feel like second nature to you. Yes, the finishing moves reminded me ofFallout 3however, it would not be fair to claim that SKYRIM is the mere cross between FALLOUT 3 and OBLIVION.SKYRIM was much anticipated and its gameplay does not disappoint in any way.USE OR LOSE ITThis is true to all living things and it also true in SKYRIM. In the beginning of the game you only get to choose what your hero looks like. How you then play the game will determine what class and what abilities your hero will acquire.The skills you use the most are the ones you are actually getting better at. You can also increase your skills by skill training and reading a skill book. Leveling up heals your hero (health and magicka) and you can unlock a skill perk and increase one attribute reserve (health, stamina or magicka) by 10 points. Both the enemies you encounter and the loot you find level up with you, however there are areas designed to be almost impossible to lower level heroes. A word of advice: until you are powerful enough, avoid going up into the mountains. I had to learn this the hard way!There are Achievement you earn but this is what I found beautiful: as you progress the game creates constellations corresponding to your skills and perks and, so, you can see your character make its mark, well, in the sky of SKYRIM.KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN. IT PAYSI usually do not pay attention to the sounds of a game. The less I notice them, the more natural they usually are. In SKYRIM both the ambient and action sounds are so well made that they stand out at first. After a while you take them form granted and blend into the background - yet they keep adding greatly to the total immersion. Draw a sword, deflect an arrow with your shield or walk in a narrow corridor and you will see what I mean.Moreover, the background music, whenever cued, is also epic and majestic, like a medieval liturgy choir chanting about your deeds. One name should describe its impact: Jeremy Soule.The towns are alive with people going about their daily chores - however, I have to admit that I foundThe Witcher IIto be much better in this aspect.  Nevertheless, paying attention to what NPCs have to say has its own rewards. Not only can you get lore and valuable information and even quests but you can even gain skill improvements out of this. Care has been taken to create a great number of NPC phrases in order to avoid having to endure the same phrase repeated over and over. Well, although not very pronounced, after some hours of gameplay this has not been avoided entirely. A minor annoyance. I can understand how town talk is much harder to run through the Creation Engine than items and quests.THERE IS STEAM COMING OUT OF YOUR ARMORRecently we have all seen how bad a Digital Distribution system can be ([coughs!] ORIGIN!) so STEAM may seem pretty benign to some by now. Nevertheless, let's not lose perspective. This is still an OnLine DRM scheme. I usually deduct a full star from any game that withholds ownership of our games by tying it to a unique online account. So far I had made a single exception, withShogun II. I decided SKYRIM to be the second.I still have to warn the gamers who are careful with what DRM schemes they will allow to their computers since the game does require STEAM to run (yes, even the retail version). An informed decision can now be made. However, I could not bring myself to give this masterpiece anything less than a perfect score.SKYRIM is a game that will draw you in its world, enchant you with its beauty, mesmerize you with its endless horizons, offer you a huge number of ever branching quests and, yet, leave you wanting for more. Each time you play it is unique and the paths not taken will keep bringing you back again and again. Even if they are uphill and narrow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________(*) Ended relationships not included.

And I must say my wait was justified and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience on the PS3 Move with Sports Champion as the launch title which used the precision features of the Move to its fullest.I await the additional releases of games, which would go with the Move, in the future as I can see these titles pushing the edge of the excitement and utilising the Move technology to their advantage to bring excitement back to the PS3. This will definitely move the PS3 sales to an all new high and even put it past its competitors (wishful thinking? NAAAHHHH).Can't really see how Kinetic (MS XBOX 360) would better this experience by leaving controllers out of the reach of gamers to enjoy games? Not to say that it isn't an all new level of technology (hats off to MS) but I think that it needs to be refined a little bit more to address additional issues that surround it instead of pushing for a holiday release this year. Probably since it is a MS product users would see service packs of fixes to bugs and issues raised on a steady basis until they \"get it right\"....by then Sony would raise their technology standard as they Move to PS4. ;-)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"K.

This game pulls on the heartstrings of Nostalgia (which for me, means the Nightmare Before Christmas segment,) and strums a delightful tune with them about a special young boy who journeys across the multiverse in an attempt to save worlds from &quot;The Heartless,&quot; one of the best bad-guy concepts I have ever encountered.Although even a child would understand the basic good-vs-evil premise, when looked at by an adult, one can see there's so much of a deeper meaning to it.

It's not up to the level of, for example, Chrono Trigger, but good enough to merit the five-star rating...Yet... there is much unsolved... many things undone...When I play the game, there is a tiny nagging sensation of something not quite finished.  I feel almost as though the game didn't quite do everything there was to be done.  Some of these flaws I can define pretty well.  The game would have been more fun if the different worlds hadn't been so segmented, Sora obviously hasn't finished his quest yet, etc...  Still, they're making a second one, and hopefully, that will clear up a lot of these issues.  If it doesn't, however, this game will not be any less spectacular by itself.  I truly enjoyed it, and if you've ever been a kid, I suspect you will too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2004"}

Over 50 stuntmen and actors were used for the game, to create the most realistic, high-caliber, Hollywood-style action sequences","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Cinematic Gaming At Its Best","reviewText":"So many games have attempted to bring a cinematic experience to the video game medium.  This game actually is a movie (the main menu says \"Play Movie\"), but the interactivity that \"Indigo Prophecy\" features is truly awesome.Lucas Kane, just another New York citizen, enters in a hypnotic trance, and murders another man in the restroom.  When he snaps out it, he realizes what a brutal murder he's just committed.  After escaping the diner, police inspectors Carla and Tyler investigate the crime.  I refuse to reveal any more than that for two reasons.  One, I'm a purist who hates spoilers.But more importatnly than that, what happens in this game is, mostly, up to you.  What questions do you want to ask?  How successful do want to be in combat?  Writer-director David Cage claims that you control the story.  Well, you do and you don't, but more on that later.So how does one play a game that's a movie?  The best way to sum it up is that one-half is third-person gaming, while the other one-half is actually a collection of mini-games with a story beings used to drive the experience.  To comment on the latter, you will participate in timing-based exercises.  For example, when Tyler and another cop play a basketball game, you won't play as if it's a traditional NBA game.  Instead, two compasses will appear in the middle of the screen, and you will have to push on the analog sticks in the direction(s) that light up.  Do it right, you score in very cool fashion.  Do it wrong, and you get schooled by the nerd.  You will always be using the controller, and very rarely just watching.  The whole game is a collection of cutscenes that have slight variations depending on how attentive you are.  I don't want to give away much more than that, but this game will always throw something new at you.The other half of the game is played in a traditional third-person perspective.  You will interact with a lot of your surroundings, and with it comes more choices.  Want to turn on your radio while solving the mystery...suit yourself!  Feeling like playing a guitar instead of gettings some sleep...go for it!  Don't feel like saving that drowning kid in the lake and risking being noticed by the cops...don't!  To be fair, these portions of the game are very clunky in controls, but they work well enough.The voice-acting is superb, and Angelo Badalamenti's music score is very memorable.  Also, some licensed tracks made their way into the game.  Most of them are actually cool beats and hip-hop songs, instead of modern rock (though there are a few of those).So what's not good about this revolutionary experience?I have a few problems, and one huge one!  My little quibbles are that the third-person controls could've been smoother, the few stealth-portions in the game aren't much fun, and the the graphics' framerate gets choppy (especially in the PS2 version).  Because the tale is so captivating, you won't care too much, but these problems are there.Here's the big complaint: This game's goal was to allow the player to control the story.  As I said, for the most part you do, but the plot is painfully obvious about what it wants you to do.  In the game \"Deus Ex\", when you made certain unwise choices, your experience wasn't ruined, but instead forced you to find alternatives.  There are some sequences in \"Indigo Prophecy\", mainly the ones where you ask questions, where you get the feeling that you're not 'controlling' the story, but instead putting little variations on it.  For example, you getting caught by the police doesn't change the story, it downright ends it with an inner-monologue saying \"I'll never know...\"  Well, who wants that ending?  I respect that David Cage had a vision, and wanted gamers to complete a game, but what about more branching paths?  Because it's not as free-forming as the creators have claimed, I kind of felt a little disappointed.Don't get me wrong, this is a top-notch character-driven tale that I won't forget; \"Indigo Prophecy\" is a great story that I would gladly revisit because it has redefined rrelationship between the gamer and the story.  As a rookie-critic, I'm giving the game an overall 4 stars because of its technical merits.  But I had so much fun with this game before it was all over. Once in a while, a game comes along and redefines genres.  This is one of them, and I eagerly await to see what kind of impact this game has...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2005"}

Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"The harbinger of my demise.","reviewText":"It was early 1998--I think--and I was hanging out with some so-called friends. We were in my school's gym when our discussion turned to the topic of video games. Up `til then my experiences with the gaming industry had been with the NES and Game Gear, with the occasional Game Boy, SNES, and N64 when I visited my cousins. One of my uncles owned almost every major console in the `90s, but he never let us younger nephews touch any of his equipment.Anywho, I was talking with my \"friends\" and they asked me what game system I owned. I replied, \"None. I don't have one,\" rather sheepishly. \"None?\" one questioned, confused. \"Wow; I thought everyone had one.\" He promptly shrugged it off though, and continued conversing with the others.But I didn't shrug it off so easily.That night (or some time that week, since my memory fails me), I approached my mother and told her I wanted a video game system. The next day I came home to a PlayStation sitting on the living room entertainment center.Yeah, right.She told me if I wanted one I can buy it myself. I had been saving for a go-kart for a while, but as the years dragged on my interest in one dwindled. I decided to use that saved currency for a system instead. I thought I had the money, so that wasn't the issue; the real problem was deciding what to buy.For a while I debated getting a Saturn over the PlayStation. Sega had built itself quite the name at the time, and Sony was new to the market. I knew more Sega titles, like Sonic, since I had a Game Gear, but then one day at a friend's house I played a demo disc and there was a sole winter level starring this strange orange creature as the protagonist. I fell in love with it instantly, and when I discovered it was a PlayStation exclusive it was then that I declared which console to purchase.My mother and I paid a visit to our local Toys `R' Us, which was where I bought most of my Game Gear miscellany. We went to the games department and I saw the gray-silver box in all its glory. But its price wasn't so glorious to me, a child of elementary education. I was devastated when I learned I'd have to save a little more if I wanted to get the console, a game, and an extra controller in one fell sweep.That following summer, when my schooling was done and I had saved enough money, we returned to the giraffe's domain, but to my dismay the consoles no longer were available. I was defeated once again. A TRU rep informed us that the reason was because they were ridding their current stock and weren't getting more in until next week, when a fresh wave of a boxed console with an updated controller would arrive. We could come back then and check.My mother was tired of going back and forth and not finding what I wanted--I was quite the persistent whiner, after all--and goaded me into waiting till Christmas; if I did, she'd buy me an additional game.But I didn't want to wait. Santa's day was an eternity away.Next week we returned and sure enough to the TRU employee's word the new console was there. \"DUALSHOCK\" was imprinted boldly on the box in strong red colors. That meant little to me as I had no idea what that meant.I took the slip of paper that informed the cashier I was meaningful with my purchase, and went to find that game with the strange orange creature, and there it was: Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back.Most of the games I played at my cousins' were co-ops, thus I thought I'd need a second controller. But the first-party Sonys were out of my price range, forcing me to settle on a 3rd-party clear controller without analog sticks. Clear stuff was all the range in the `90s, but to this day I have to get a clear controller for every system because of that initial purchase.When I got home and opened the box I realized what DualShock meant. The controller was much different than my friend's, and I quickly preferred it over other pads.This faux-review has gone on long enough, so I'll try and speed things up.I played my new console non-stop for some time, spending hours upon hours with Crash and the included demo disc in the console's box, but couldn't get very far as I didn't buy a memory card. I didn't know I'd need one, even though the TRU rep said I would. My NES didn't need one; my cousin's SNES didn't need one. But the PS did and I had to save up for that.I bought every Crash title for the PS, and spent many dollars at Blockbuster renting various titles. I grew to love Final Fantasy, Bloody Roar, Tomb Raider, Tomba, Croc, Ape Escape, Spyro, and many other fantastic series because of Sony's initial console, and have gotten every one of their consoles since.When the PS2 was released, I of course bought it and gave my old gray buddy to my kid sister, never caring to look back.Last summer that same sister bought herself a used PS2 to use as a relaxer during college, and it was then that I started developing a sharp interest in old consoles and games. I asked her about our old PS1 and she said the reason she bought a PS2 was because the PS1 had been failing but that she couldn't remember where she stored it.A month ago she texted me a picture of a sticker-covered gray machine. I picked it up the following weekend, cleaned it, and tested some titles. Unfortunately some games don't read at all, like Croc, while others, like Crash 2, work flawlessly. There's definitely some lengthier loading time than if I played the same disc in my PS3, but there's something about the lower graphical output and using the original DualShock that trumps playing the same game on the PS3.Perhaps it's nostalgia, perhaps it's empirical proof. I don't know, but all I know is that I love my PlayStation and am glad to be opening its disc tray once again. It turned me from a casual gamer into a video game connoisseur.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2014"}

I have no freaking idea what any of the menus say, and I wonder if other people can read it because it is so small... but the english dub will make you want to stab your own eye.  It was the same in SO3, but luckily this time we can change to japanese with subs, however if you are like me and have a crummy TV, then this will not be much help.The ideas, story line, and flow are much the same now.  our ship was attacked by some strange thing, now we are on a planet that looks like the middle ages, yadda yadda... The characters lack depth and do not make me like them.  There is the always optimistic and unconflicted male lead, the shy sex object female lead who always screams and makes suggestive noises in between her self deprecating comments like \"Maybe I can be of some use now\", and then the snobby polite fellow, and the token little kid character.  This has always been a problem I had with SO... the characters do not let you into their world as they do in Final Fantasy, or other RPGs.  (I'm a FF fan ^^) The graphics are nice, but a lot does look like SO3.  Including the beginning of fight sequences.I feel that the boss fights are unproportionatelly hard to the standard mob fights, forcing one to grind considerably (because the mobs are much lower in level then you and it takes a long time to level up) before each boss fight.  This is rather annoying.There is much that could have been incorporated to make this better... in game Battle Trophies could have been linked to your PSN, but they are not.  The only trophy I won so far was one for defeating a boss... even though I've won a large amount of battle trophies.  The item creation could have been linked online, though this is also separate  from what I gather... things are much more convoluted then SO3... and I have heard that it lacks the end game awesomeness and extra dungeons that where in SO3.  It seems ultimately like a step down.That being said... its not AWFUL... I am playing it until FFXIII gets out.  If my view changes of it before then, I will revise my edit, but for now, this is my experience with the game.  It had so much potential, I'm let down for sure.UPDATE:I played the game to 50+ hours... and it just got worse and worse.  The story is so insanely god awful, its not even funny... and it doesn't get better.  The voice acting is atrocious, and the characters border on offensive, and never change.  annoying cliche characters and no one having any emotions, not to mention writing that would make you gag on the dry blandness... its like they didn't even try.  The game isn't worth the plastic it is packaged in.  I enjoyed SO3 and SO2... but this is just... horrific.  Its obscenely awful, and even the fun battle system is destroyed by the ridiculous boss scaling makes it so that you have to grind for hours and hours to defeat a boss.  Its horrific.  I suggest you play ANYTHING but this... but if you want a better RPG, try Dragon Age, or Final Fantasy XIII now that it is out... its about a gajillion times better.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00149PCAO","description":"In a city where information is heavily monitored, agile couriers called Runners transport sensitive data away from prying eyes.  In this seemingly utopian paradise, a crime has been committed and now you are being hunted. You are a Runner called Faith - and this innovative first-person action-adventure is your story.    Mirror&#x2019;s Edge delivers you straight into the shoes of this unique heroine as she traverses the vertigo-inducing cityscape, engaging in intense combat and fast paced chases. With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Free Running on a Mirror's Edge","reviewText":"As the first game of its kind, Mirror's Edge takes a huge deviation from the norm in today's videogame world. The world of \"Free Runners\" is the setting for the game. For those who don't know, Free Runners are people that can do things such as run along walls, jump from building to building and they use any part of their environment to help them do these things. One part acrobat, one part cross country runner and one part thrill seeker, Free Runners personify a modern counter culture.Story 6 of 10The game takes place in a large fictional metropolis. Your main character - Faith has come back to running from some sort of hiatus. Runners in this game have a higher calling though. They solve crimes while jumping from roof to roof. Faith came into this occupation because her parents were killed in an activist rally - doesn't say what for. The primary storyline involves Faith, her sister, a detective and a new mayor. The new mayor is trying to make everyone forget the old city and the activists. It's a drab story to say the least (in my opinion). There is a twist which everyone could see coming and is almost superfluous to the game.Gameplay 7 of 10In Mirror's Edge, you'll be running, constantly - which is obvious. But you'll be doing it with style. You begin the game in an optional tutorial on how to run and jump. It's hard to describe what you'll be doing unless you've seen Free Runners in action. If you have, that's what you'll be doing, but on a grand scale. Note: this is a first person game. So you see through the eyes of Faith. About 80% of the time you'll be jumping and running, but 20% of the time you'll have to fight, well armed policemen and SWAT teams. Many have automatic weapons. You can steal the weapons or just beat the guys into the ground. I'd recommend both - beat them into the ground, steal the weapon and then shoot the other guys with his weapon. I know; they still managed to fit a FPS into a game about free running. Meh. Without this in the game I would have given the gameplay a 9 out of 10. Luckily these parts are few and far between until near the end of the game.So in all the gameplay is on the good side. Controls are tight, puzzles are varied and there is a relatively short learning curve. On the negative side of the gameplay, the combat parts are almost annoying to no end. In one run-in I had with SWAT. There were like six of them and I believe I played through 20 times before I was able to even make progress. Unfortunately, even when you do get past the first few guys, you might encounter another physical problem with your surroundings. Other than that, once you've mastered the basics of running, jumping, timing and grabbing on at the right spot the non-combat parts can be fun especially the second time through. The main issue you'll wind up having is just where to go and how you want to go about getting there; because there are multiple ways to arrive at your final destination.Graphics / Animation 8 of 10This is probably the easiest part of the game to quantify. Buildings look very accurate and are detailed to the \"t.\" In fact if you get really close to many materials, you can see the grains. For example, the pipes on the sides of building have etching on the metal and reflect differently than it would otherwise. Light and shadow are brilliantly executed. Since you are outside the majority of the time, this is very noticeable. Faces are better than average and give a definite human quality. They have age marks or show youth and bodies also look very human.Animation is of the utmost importance in a game like this and really looks impressive. You move with the fluidity that a real person would. The animation mapping is superior to most games. Arms and legs are clearly linked with the rest of the body. In the tutorial, you're supposed to keep up with one of your friends. The key here is that everything looks so natural.Sound / Music 6 of 10Faith's breathing is normally the only thing you notice while playing. This is because there is essentially no music. Sound effects are good for the physical parts such as hitting the ground hard or the fall of footsteps on concrete. But aside from that, the game is lacking greatly in music. It has some minimal synthesizer effects, but that's all. Clearly, no money was available here to purchase the rights to any music.Features and Replay Value 4 of 10Maybe lack of features is a better description, because Mirror's Edge has little to none. There is a story mode, with three difficulties, time trial mode and speed run mode. That's it. The story mode has nine chapters which will take about 8-10 hours to complete. Time trial mode involves short little parts (normally less than 2:00 min.) of the game in which you race to see how fast you can complete them - they are very difficult. You have three times in which you have to beat to get a one, two or three star rating. I only achieved a three star rating on one time trial and there are about 20-25.Then there is speed run, which is also a race where you race through the whole level to beat the allotted time. Even if you were to spend maybe a week on the story and a few weeks on the other two modes, you'll want to sell the game eventually. You won't say in a few months \"I think I'll go get completely annoyed by Mirror's Edge today.\" Because yeah, the game is annoying in many aspects. I believe I spent 2-3 hours trying to get a two star rating on one of the time trialsConclusionA really imaginative and risky idea for a game which turned out pretty well. But ends up getting bogged down in the obligatory shooting parts and lack of overall gameplay. This is a must rent, because it's really a cool game but you just won't want to keep it for very long. In terms of an overall rating, probably a 6+ would be accurate. I really like the fact that this developer rolled the dice on a game like this, but it could use improvement.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"An Android Fan","summary":"Rockstar's Not So Grand Opus","reviewText":"There's no need to discuss the hype behind this game or its commercial success. We all know it was well received by the public, got great reviews and made Rockstar even richer.So how does it play? Was it worth the wait? Should it have waited even longer? Maybe and absolutely.The game does an admirable job of representing what is basically New York and having a sympathetic lead who kills, steals and double-crosses to survive. He doesn't like what he does, wishes he didn't have to do it, but in order to fulfill his objective, he has to do these things. (Note that the vast majority of people he kills, steals from and double-crosses aren't even worthy of being called scum.) The game also forces the player to make some hard choices which have long-lasting consequences. And of course, true to form for a GTA game, there's weapons, explosions, sex, car chases, gun fights and profanities aplenty.Which leads me to the first of many letdowns for this game. The missions are so repetitive, so tedious, so monotonous, and so boring that it is literally impossible to truly differentiate one mission from the next. A good 50% of the game, probably more involves shooting endless waves of enemies, many of whom pop up in completely illogical places. It is very easy for one enemy to kill you in a matter of seconds after having done so well up to that point.Which brings me to my next point: Mission failures. The system Rockstar put in place is by far the worst system in any AAA video game, and budget titles would do well to stay far from this as well. If you fail a mission, you must restart the mission entirely. From the beginning. Every single time. It doesn't matter if the mission is a single chase, a single shootout or if there is more than one part to it. (The final mission has five parts to it.) If something goes wrong, you start back at the beginning and you have to redo the entire thing all over again. There are no mid-mission checkpoints. This is completely inexcusable.  Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, so video games have had checkpoints in them for at least seven years now and probably longer than that. Please don't put in a comment about how I forgot about how X game had them in 199X. I am not interested, I am only using that particular game as an example. That's it. End of discussion.And yet, when you do restart, you still lose EVERYTHING you used in the mission. Why is that? Why should I have to replenish everything I lost on something that didn't actually happen? I can't think of any game that does this, and I probably wouldn't want to play such a game, mainly because I prefer games that are fun. Is having to restock ammo and armor on a mission that didn't actually just happen fun? No. That's downtime, and downtime isn't fun, especially when it's needless downtime. And Rockstar isn't based in someone's garage. This is a very large company with a huge budget, so these amateurish design decisions are even more inexcusable.Speaking of inexcusable design decisions that were antiquated long, long ago, let's discuss another aspect of gun fights. For some reason, when Niko is being shot at, his default speed, running or walking is the exact same speed as when nothing is going on. SWAT 3 came out almost NINE YEARS AGO, and that game had a dynamic speed change. In other words, if shots were fired, everyone sped up. Not Niko. No, he'll just wander around unless you actually hit the run button. Which also makes him run just as fast as though nothing is going on. Wouldn't someone who is trying to find cover so they don't get shot move faster than if they aren't in danger? If you'd like a more recent example of what Rockstar should have done, take a look at Mass Effect.The driving mechanics also have a much higher learning curve than what it needs to be, especially with motorcycles and helicopters. Why Rockstar didn't take more time honing the controls and making them easier to pick up is anyone's guess. Same with ladders. I have a friend who will tap the Y button until his thumb is ready to break and even still Niko will not climb the ladder that is right in front of him. This is usually after swimming a ridiculous distance to it since the game doesn't allow the player to just suicide and spawn at the nearest hospital. No instead we have to swim ridiculously long distances. Talk about fun huh?Which is about the same as can be said for multiplayer. You just walk or drive around the city. There is nothing to do. Nothing. No activities, no places to go, nothing. There are some missions that can be done but if you just want to free roam with a friend in multiplayer, that's ALL you get to do. A drop-in, drop-out co-op in the story mode would've been much, much better.Oh, yeah, the story. Well what little there is isn't too bad, when the game actually allows you to see it. Most of the time it's too busy bogging you down with those same repetitive missions I talked about earlier where it always goes the exact same way - a deal that shouldn't have any problems where Niko is just there \"as insurance\" turns into a battle ground with lots and lots of enemies, then just they're all dead, more spawn in the area that was just cleared, then the fight leads to a car/motorcycle chase which leads to a police chase, lather, rinse, repeat. Almost all of the missions have this exact same format. The only things that change are the goons' clothing and the SET of lines Niko yells out as he kills them (not the actual lines themselves.) So don't worry kids, if you heard him say something in a mission, he will say it again! And again....and again....and again.And lastly, for some reason even though games have been doing this for years, GTA IV still allows objects that obstruct your view of the player to remain opaque. Every other high quality title I have ever seen that operates in 3rd person forces such obstructions to go transparent.The characters Niko takes missions from and/or befriends are your stock cardboard cutouts but let's face it, no one plays a GTA game for the character study. That's why we have those....um....what're those things called, libraries have them....oh well. Anyway, the dialogue is at times rather humorous, especially when Niko is hanging around Brucie. I think we've all known a Brucie at some point in our lives, so to see Niko indirectly poke fun at these guys is a treat. And as usual, GTA IV satirizes many aspects of society and pop-culture that are just begging for it. Celebrities, radio-talk show hosts, gossip magazines, plenty of entertainment venues and the masses that support them all get the healthy shot of parody that has been coming to them for years.With a whole lot more polish, mid-mission checkpoints and far less repetition, GTA IV would deserve the accolades and commercial success it has enjoyed as of late. As it stands, however, it is yet another proof that hype, a big name label and commercial success do not always mean a great game. It is a good game, but nothing more.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2008"}

Let me break it down in 3 categories: Storyline, Co-Op and Multiplayer.Main Storyline - This game is like Red Dead Redemption and Sleeping Dogs on steroids! The storyline is really good. You're on vacation with friends and brothers until things go wrong (Typical of any movie or game). I have never liked FPS campaigns, I have all Call of Duty games but never ever played the storyline. There are soo many mini games and things to do and explore in this game. It took me 4-5 days to beat the game and an additional 2 to get all achievements. I'm also a hardcore gamer playing 3-6 hour a day (kinda sad). I like how you can get all achievements playing it only once. The story is so unique full of interesting characters and funny dialogue.Co-Op - EWW... Co-Op. I'm not a fan of Co-Op anything but this one is different. They throw in mini-games in each of the 5 Co-Op missions. Also, each mission is pretty short and give you an an achievement.Multiplayer - How would you like to Punish or Spare the MVP of the other team after you beat them? You can in this game and you can unlock more with progression. The online is fun and shots feel like they count unlike in Black Ops 2. You unlock hard drives, USB, etc. to decode too. It sounds weird but every game you play, you get things to decode to give you either XP or better weapon modifications. You'll also get speed boost to speed up the tie it takes to decode or unlock those items. Some things take up to 10hrs so a speed boost will cut that in half. You'll have to get those from friends however. My biggest complaint will be the inability to get your friends in a party to play. You'll have to wait until someone joins a lobby in order to join your buddies.If you like Red Dead Redemption or Sleeping Dogs, this game will top those!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA29M","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Old-school platformer, new-school technology","reviewText":"Way back in February of this year, millions of viewers around the world witnessed the reveal of Sony&#8217;s next generation console in New York City, the PlayStation 4. With lead architect Mark Cerny on stage to underline the advancements of the swish piece of hardware, the Marble Madness creator unveiled the system&#8217;s very first title, Knack. Developed by Japan Studio &#8211; one of the platform holder&#8217;s internal development outfits &#8211; the game was touted as a return to the simple, fun, and engaging platformers of old. But does it soar to the heights of Spyro the Dragon or sink to the depths of Bubsy 3D?The game&#8217;s narrative thrusts you into the plot immediately, taking little time to beat around the bush. You&#8217;re introduced to an action sequence showcasing an army of goblins attacking a human base. It quickly becomes clear that these foreign creatures have evolved their weaponry in such a way that the mortals can&#8217;t fight back, and in a desperate meeting between the Earth&#8217;s top researchers, the bespectacled Doctor Vargas insists that a small creature known as, er, Knack represents the solution to mankind&#8217;s problems.It&#8217;s explained that the titular hero has the ability to harness kinetic energy through relics, and this will become pivotal in the battle against the abovementioned enemies. Throughout the plot, it&#8217;s revealed that the protagonist is capable of many more skills than merely explosive growth, and this plays a pivotal role in the way that the story plays out. It&#8217;s a fun yarn that will keep you engaged &#8211; but you&#8217;re never going to get particularly attached to the characters.At its core, Knack is an old-school platformer. There are few mechanics or gameplay elements on offer here that couldn&#8217;t be done on a current generation console, so this may not be the showcase piece of software that you&#8217;ve been looking for. Nevertheless, its fusion of Crash Bandicoot-inspired platforming and God of War-esque combat is enjoyable in short bursts, and it makes the game a great option for both families and those with a penchant for the PSone adventures of old.Indeed, the controls are accessible enough that anyone can play. You&#8217;ll control the titular hero with the left analogue stick, while the right analogue stick will allow you to quickly dodge any incoming attacks. You&#8217;ll also have access to jump and double-jump capabilities &#8211; it&#8217;s a platformer, after all &#8211; along with a more traditional attack option and Super Moves, which are initiated by tapping the Circle button followed by a second input.Knack is able to dish out three-hit combos with ease, with each hit deploying more damage than the one preceding it. The character also has access to a dash-attack and mid-air homing attack, giving you a fair few options in combat despite the simplistic controls. When your back&#8217;s against the wall, Super Moves such as the ability to spin around like a tornado, smash the ground heavily, and blast enemies with a concentrated round of energy augment you with the opportunity to take the upper-hand. The title also frequently throws a variety of foes at you, with multiple strategies requiring memorisation if you intend to avoid taking damage. It&#8217;s simple system, then, but the developer does just enough to keep it varied, which helps to keep the adventure interesting across its meaty running time.The game boasts 13 chapters in total, each of which is laden with hidden areas that contain even more items for Knack to absorb. You&#8217;ll need to collect multiple parts to unlock gadgets, which boast a variety of boosts. One example includes the ability to earn more Sunstone crystals from each foe that you dispose of, while another highlights secret areas as you approach them. Finding all of the hidden items may take more than one playthrough, but this does increase replay value &#8211; especially seeing as there&#8217;s a New Game Plus option which allows you to experience the game again with all of your gear intact. Cleverly, you can swap items with friends via the PlayStation Network, and even unlock more goods in the game&#8217;s iOS and Android spin-off Knack&#8217;s Quest.Throughout parts of the adventure, Knack will be able to transform into elemental alter-egos. For example, there&#8217;s a point where the character can be made entirely out of transparent crystals, preventing him from tripping any alarm lasers. There&#8217;s also another segment where wooden logs will attach to the hero, which can then be set alight and employed to burn down wooden doors and gates.If that&#8217;s not enough, you can play the game with two-players, employing either a second DualShock 4 controller or a PlayStation Vita. Here, the additional player takes charge of Robo-Knack, a mirror of the main hero who boasts the ability to heal the protagonist. While this extra doesn&#8217;t culminate in any particularly groundbreaking co-op action, it&#8217;s a very welcome feature if you want to play with friends or family.In addition to the main campaign, there&#8217;s also a Time Attack mode, which consists of 13 stages from certain areas of the core adventure. As the name may indicate, your objective here is to get through the level as fast and efficiently as possible, and upon completion you&#8217;ll obtain a rank and a position on the game&#8217;s leaderboards. Meanwhile, Coliseum Battles sees you facing waves of increasingly potent enemies, each of which will test your combat finesse to the finest. As already alluded, this is far from an easy game, and while the inconsistent checkpointing will frustrate at times, you&#8217;ll at least feel rewarded for your skills throughout. This is especially true during the boss battles, which are infrequent but require skill to successfully navigate.While the majority of your attention will be fixated on keeping Knack alive, you certainly won&#8217;t miss the whimsical visuals. This isn&#8217;t a showpiece for the next generation console by any stretch, but the environments are well detailed, with sharp texture work, lush colours, and some nice lighting effects. The protagonist is arguably the star of the show, though, as he is comprised of hundreds, if not thousands, of relic particles that float around his core. If he takes damage, you&#8217;ll see these resources fall off and scatter across the ground, while collecting the goodies will see the character grow. Unfortunately, there are some framerate drops that occur when things get crazy, which is a particular problem during the aforementioned boss battles. It&#8217;s not game-breaking, but it&#8217;s certainly noticeable &#8211; and it&#8217;s not really acceptable for a game of this simplicity.In terms of audio, the launch title has a very good soundtrack that provides some atmospheric tunes, while making things much more cinematic when the action picks up. The sound effects are particularly great, with attacks from both the protagonist and enemies sounding punchy and effective. A nice extra touch from the development team employs the DualShock 4&#8217;s audio speaker during gameplay, allowing you to hear when you collect relics and crystals. The voice acting is also solid, with the tone of the hero lowering as he grows.ConclusionKnack offers a refreshing return to the PSone platformers of old. The title may not be particularly ambitious, but it has a nostalgic quality that can make it difficult to put down. Checkpoint hiccups, framerate issues, and difficulty spikes prevent it from reaching its maximum potential &#8211; but much like the titular hero himself, the title will definitely grow on you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Bioshock Infinite - Not Lando Calrissian's Cloud City!","reviewText":"**Note: these are my 1st impressions of the game and not a full on review**Bioshock Infinite is the 3rd diesel punk entry from Irrational/2K games that takes on the themes of a dystopian landscape and thrusts your character into world where moral issues are abound.While not exactly a prequel of the other 2 Bioshock games many of the other themes from the last 2 games are very present here. You take on the role of ex Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt who starts the game dropped off at a mysterious lighthouse (always those darned lighthouses!!) and transported, instead of underwater to the city of Rapture, to the cloud city of Columbia to rescue a mysterious girl with powers beyond belief. Booker and Elizabeth find themselves caught up in a battle between Zachey Comstock who is the ultra religious face of Columbia and the Vox Populi who seek to get away from Comstock.Bioshock Infinite is not the faint at heart when it comes to idealism as the themes of racial segregation, theocracy, eugenics and xenophobia are all prevalent throughout the game and similar to the other Bioshock games these themes play a role in your characters make upGraphicsThis game is running on my PC which is an AMD Phenom II X6 1065T, 2.6 GHz  8gb with an Nvidia GTX 460 SE card under high settings and the visuals are jaw dropping.  Unlike the first 2 games that took place in the underwater city of Rapture where it was dark and devoid of life, Columbia is rendered as a bright, colorful and cheerful place, with its own brand of crazy. The visuals are just stunning and as long as you aren't being chased you could spend time wandering the landscape admiring the small touches that the creators made for this game. The architecture, the lighting and the mood all come together even the clothing that the people wear are highly detailed even in moderate settings.  You really get a perception that you are in a city in the clouds and maybe a bit of vertigo too!. There are many marvels to admire from the airships to the engines and even the way the birds are rendered are really nice. To me, this game scratches some of the itch that I wanted from Dishonored that it missed for a game of this alternate history genre. I don't think Irrational set out to make a game that was taxing to video cards as there isn't a lot to toggle on and off unlike Tomb Raider.  As a matter of fact, playing around with some settings didn't seem to make that much of a difference and you still have a great looking game even if you are running it on a moderate system.GameplayIf you played other Bioshocks, then you are simply at home here. I have my X-box controller installed and running and after some fine tuning, it's no problem. Occasionally I have noticed a few hang ups in looting and really wished the Irrational would make it easier to loot an area instead of having to pick each item up individually. The game is still familiar enough as there are always things to check out be it religious crazies about to make sacrifices, voice recordings giving you differing point of views about Columbia and of course the Vigors (precursors of the plasmids) which are your powers in the game. To some degree, in this game you get good powers that take a little less time to upgrade and are really fun to use  in this game provided of course you have enough Salts to use them  There is another aspect to this game as also certain items you may find not only grant you health and salts but some can simultaneously take from one and give to another so you really have to pick and choose if you want to take a bite from a health power up. And gone are the hacking games which depending on how you play is either an annoyance or a riddance.AudioThe audio is very atmospheric and immersive and the musical score is on point for the time period. The sound effects neither overwhelm nor underwhelm but fit nicely at the middle and it's very impressive at how it all fits.CriticismsSo far they are few but they are noticeable.  My first big one is like the other 2 games, there is no place to save randomly and that you have to play to a certain point before you can pull yourself out and not always can you be assured that the point you are in is a good `stopping point' for your session.  The next is that while yes, this game goes in the opposite direction of its predecessors and gives us a fully populated world, there is a `sameness' sometimes to the residents; most look too much alike and most feel almost like puppets as some go about their life.  At one point early on, I am watching a couple flirting with each other by a flight of stairs and their movements just seems to repeat themselves a lot and honestly when you look at a lot of games like Skyrim and RDR many of the AI routines are a bit more complex than just standing around waving your arms and many of the facial models are different. Also while not the FPS shooter that Call of Duty is, there are times when you may want to fine tune your controller as your shots may get displaces because your control is either too slow or too fast for what you want to do and you really have to conserve ammo in this game. Plus aiming down the sights is not as intuitive as most FPS games.Bottom line is so far I am enjoying this game and can't wait to see more from it.  I am reading other gamer reviews where people have finished in 12 hrs. My advice is to take your time. Don't rush to beat the game because you can. Play this as if you were a detective.  Explore all there is to explore and if you see a dark corner, and empty room  or neglected door, try it and see what happens as you may never know what you will find. Rare are the games that we get like this where the created worlds are beyond belief and Columbia is one more immersible world to get wrapped up in, so enjoy the trip.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000067O0Q","description":"InBattlefield 1942, you're a WWII soldier on a true-to-life battlefield, equipped with weapons that look and sound authentic, able to storm the beaches on foot or seamlessly jump into and out of any of 35 vehicles of war. The depth is incredible. While on foot, you play as one of five specialized classes (assault, medic, scout, antitank, or engineer) with varying equipment and abilities. The choice of vehicles ranges from a selection of tanks, jeeps, and other fairly standard mechanized land vehicles to exotic craft like battleships, submarines, and dive bombers. Best of all, you can pit yourself against your fellow man in objective-based online battles in four distinct WWII theaters of war: North Africa, South Asia Pacific, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe. This is everything thatWorld War II Onlineshould have been. This isTribes 2with better code, graphics, control--everything, and without the cheesy sci-fi trappings. This out-WWIIsMedal of HonorandReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. This game is like the ultimate sandbox, with all the best toys.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"You May Want to Skip the Expansions and Deluxe Edition","reviewText":"Battlefield 1942 has seen extroardinary growth in its short time on the PC. Already, it's online numbers have passed up other popular WWII first-person shooters such as Medal of Honor. While it's nowhere close to Half-Life's online population yet, it probably resembles Half-Life's early life more so than other shooters. The game is quickly building a large custom mod community just like Half-Life did and popular themes such as modern desert combat that were never part of the original WWII theme have already built a life of their own. Before you get too excited, there is one important thing to know about this game - it's really only meant for online multiplayer. You can play the game offline by yourself but it's boring with a capital B. And if you truly want to experience the best maps and servers in BF1942, you'll need a high-speed connection such as DSL or cable. If you don't have this connection, don't even bother buying the game because it's not worth it. It doesn't have a typical single player campaign like most shooters, it's basically a platform for large maps and epic WWII shoot 'em outs. Epic as in 64+ player maps, all-out vehicle combat including fighter planes, battleships, submarines, infantry, tanks and jeeps ALL in the SAME battle! The game has never flowed as smooth as other online shooters for me, and I found more lag issues with BF1942 than other recent games, but I hear EA has been busy patching up most of the frequent problems. One unfortunate selling practice with EA though is that they tend to release plenty of expansions for any popular title. Honestly though, I don't know if you really miss that much sticking with the original BF1942.  As I stated earlier, there is already a huge custom mod community for this game so even those with only the game itself can experience new maps and game formats.  There are already plans for official Vietnam and Star Wars themed games that use the BF1942 engine. This game will be around for a while and if you enjoy the system of play, you'll definitely get your money's worth.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Only one word: WOW (Keep out of reach of Children)","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is THE PS2 game to get this holiday season.  Anyone who thinks this is simply a rehash of Vice City is wrong.  This game goes above and beyond any GTA game before it and is arguably the best in the series!This particular Grand Theft Auto takes place in not just one but FOUR different cities. It also takes place in 1992. You play as Carl Johnson (better known as \"CJ\") who has returned to his hood in Los Santos.  You're soon caught in the middle of a gang war and in all essence have to leave Los Santos.  Where as GTA3 had a tendency to remind us of movies like \"The Godfather\" and \"The Untouchables\" this game is more of a reminder of \"Menace II Society\" and \"Boyz N the Hood\".The game plays out very nicely.  As in the previous GTA games you go around performing missions for various people.  Each mission gives you a reward of some sort.  The more missions you complete the more of the game you'll get to explore.  There are set missions you must do to complete the story (and win the gang war) but several are optional.Alongside the gameplay it more takes a spin on the GTA games.  For example, in this one, rather than collecting 100 hidden packages you have to \"tag\" certain graffiti marks that mark your territory.As with other GTA games you've got several different weapons and vehicles of your choice.  Your arsenal is nearly endless. Almost any weapon you can think of is here.  You can also steal cars (go figure) and cruise the city if you want.  The nice thing about the GTA series is there's really no \"end\".  You can \"beat\" the game but there's always something more you can do.  It's also open-ended.  Do you really want to continue missions or do you just want to run around on a killing spree?  Your choice.This particular GTA also lets you fly planes.  In Vice City you could fly planes but not like in this.  You can actually go to the airport and steal one (and on some missions you have to use one).  Also, unlike in other GTA games, your character can actually swim.Another twist San Andreas adds to GTA is how much more character building goes into it.  You COULD have a buffed up character if you work out your muscles enough.  You can control what Carl looks like.  Do you want him to have an afro? Are you willing to pay to cut that afro?  What kind of clothes do you want him to wear?  That's not all, you can actually date in this one and the game lets you know how you're progressing in the relationship. San Andreas really is bigger.The game also keeps track of your criminal record as did past GTA games.  Each time you commit a felony you'll get a \"star\" that adds to your \"wanted level\".  Your wanted level goes up to six but you've got to be a real major bad ass to do that.  Usually by four it stops for a while.  The higher your wanted level the more umm... wanted you are. However, the police actually DO bust other criminals besides you.  It isn't uncommon to see them chasing around another crook.Graphically it isn't that far ahead of Vice City.  It runs smoothly and looks less clunky (not quite as many square faces) and runs fast.  There are still a couple of problems with the loading times but they're not quite as long as the past GTA games.Music wise the game has spectacular voice overs.  No game EVER has had this good of voice acting.  It's more convincing than most other games out there.  The music can either be good or bad, depending on what you're into.  You'll hear a lot of early 90's classics.  A lot of the music is Hip-Hop and R&B; but there's a little bit of something for everybody.  The talk shows are hilarious as well.Now for the cons.  Are there cons for this game? Sadly yes there are.  Its great that the gameplay has remained unchanged but the problem isn't there.  The problem is some missions are downright frustrating.  The piloting controls for flying a plane also feel a bit clunky at times.Then of course there's what parents fear: The violence and explicit language.  If you're a smart parent you'll keep this game far away from your kids who probably don't understand the difference between reality and fantasy yet.  The game rightly deserves the \"M\" rating.  As for the language, while it is bad keep in mind the game is rated \"M\" so once again, keep it away from your children who may be too young.Overall, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas is a grand game.  By far one of the best games the PS2 and probably even the best game in the GTA series so far.  It's much bigger and out-going than any other GTA game yet.  If you're in the mature audience this game is probably going to hold you over for a while.  It'll take well over 70 hours to complete but every hour spent on this game I guarantee you is worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2004"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIOYG","description":"Blending first-person shooting and third-person action, Quantum of Solace puts you in control of Bond's greatest weapon - his mind. Based on both the Quantum of Solace and Casino Royale films, Quantum of Solace puts you in the ruthless world of international espionage and intrigue.","reviewerName":"N. P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"More than a quantum of bullets","reviewText":"This is the first 007 game from Activision, who took over the franchise from Electronic Arts.  I have no idea why EA would sell those rights, especially when they made some very fine games, the best being Everything or Nothing from 2004.  Quantum of Solace is actually an amalgamation of the plots to Casino Royal and QoS, the first 'new' Bond films with Daniel Craig, whose voice and likeness are used here.  There isn't much to solve in the missions, you just have to shoot a lot of goons.  It's actually far less complicated than the previous Bond game plots, less produced (EoN had a large cast, its own theme song, etc), and more linear.It's a strange game, though...it's really a step backward from the EA games, though it still retains the general feel of the earlier entries like Agent Under Fire and Nightfire.  The innovations that EA brought to Everything or Nothing are completely absent.  That game's engine, which had you control a third-person Pierce Brosnan (more reminiscent of the GTA games, and an engine that EA would further develop with the excellent The Godfather), had things like 'Bond Vision', Q-gadgets, and a far, far better hand-to-hand combat element.  QoS returns us to the first-person mode, so you just see the gun barrel.  Granted, there is a cover mode, which has Daniel Craig suddenly slide behind a wall or a box, but it's hardly anything new (it does work well in firefights, though).There isn't a gadget in sight, and though the new Bond films are moving toward grittier action and less gimmicky tech-toys, for a video game it'd have been nice to incorporate something whacky like the Q-Laser/Claw/Spider/whatever.  Also, the hand-to-hand action on QoS is very strange...there are a few 'boss' moments where you have to fight someone, but the screen tells you the button to press...you just have to time it.  Very easy, and not necessary.  The guns are pretty good, but no upgrades in 1P mode, and there is less variety--will they ever match the video-controlled rocket launcher from Nightfire?  The villain AI is similar to Nightfire...even their speech (\"Target acquired!\"  \"I'm moving in!\", etc).Furthermore, QoS has no driving missions at all--how can a Bond game not have his Aston Martin or BMW?  There are no 'Bond Moment's...at least none that give you bonuses, a fun part of the EA games, and there are no upgrades like special weapons (more power, a Golden Gun, etc) drastically cutting the replay value on this game (there is a weapons upgrade on the online multiplayer mode).  QoS is also a very short game...far too short.  You can finish this with no problem on the third difficulty in a few hours.  Even the fourth/hardest difficult level is pretty easy...the enemies are quicker and more accurate, but you just replay and replay.  The game is very linear with only one way to attack a board, and not enough interaction with the backgrounds.Despite these drawbacks...I still liked the game, maybe because I've enjoyed all of the previous Bond games on the PS2 and before.  There is still some classic Bond-esque action---cartoonish shooting with no blood or gore.  Funny enough, this is actually more reminiscent of the 2002 game Nightfire (for the PS2), which also had the third-person mode.  But it's definitely a step backwards in terms of features and overall game play.  Mystifying as to why EA would surrender this lucrative franchise--and don't believe any hype that it's the best Bond game since Goldeneye (every Bond game has been called the best game since Goldeneye by someone).Recommended if you can find it at reduced price.  This review is biased because I've waited for a new-gen system Bond game, so I'll take what I can get.  It's far too short, there is only an online multiplayer mode (once again, the makers cheap out on local multiplayer in order to push the XBox Live business), and it's way too easy.  I would still recommend Everything or Nothing as perhaps the best-ever Bond video game, and far more innovative than this effort.  Let's hope Activision steps up next time, or perhaps tries something before the next Craig Bond film, ala EA's From Russia With Love retro-effort.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2009"}

Fnally in 2000 the created a franchise mode and that was awesome. In 2005 EA created the best madden so far, even with previous generation console the game play and franchise were great...but the ability to create your own plays and train your players to improve is what really made madden 2005 the best.The downfall of EA's madden started in 2006 when they created perhaps the worst madden ever, then they tried in 2007 to fix it and added some features that frankly were useless. 2008 and 2009 were as bad as 2007, and what made them even worse is that you could no longer create your own plays, and you had no ability to choose your own playbook.I decided in 2009 to stop buying this game until they added the same features as in 2005. Why am I reviwing this year? Well, I am lucky my cousin bought it and told me he didnt like it, so this morning I borrowed it from him, and decided to check and see if the hype about this year's release was justified. well, to be honest this year's Madden is equally bad as the preious year. Only with a little better graphics but same everything.Madden 10 is similar to 2009, and nothing has changed. The gameplay is horrible, and there is no improvement over the previous years: You still CANNOT create your own plays anymore, and CANNOT train your players to improve their abilities. The menu changed so it looks different, but I dont see that as an improvement. They added a few useless tings like refs discussing a touchdown, and chain measurement, but the gameplay remains bad. The opposing team's players are always faster than you, and their front four can always get to you in no time if you take longer than three seconds to throw a pass, and this is not ocassional...this is during the whole game even when you have ran the ball a lot. If you blitz it does not have any effect on getting to the other's team QB, your blitzes are easy picked up by 5 OL, even when you blitz with 7 players.The game is slower, and the funny thing is that the opposing team's players can change directions as if momentum does not exist for them. A linebacker is always faster than my running back, and the speed of my passes are slow...funny no? My Qb arm's strenght is 95, but the passes are slow compared to te other teams QB arm strenht which is 86...So many things in the game play that makes it have no realism. I mean, it is a video game and will never be the same as in real life, but comeon at least try to balance the gae a little bit.Looks like people are losing interest in Madden. Yesterday, the gamestore had a lot of copies available unlike the previous years when I had to reserve mine in order to have it the same day of release. I am glad I was not tempted to buy it, and I am lucky I could play it for free and evulated it to confirm that this is another horrible Madden year.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Saikron","summary":"In a Word: Ambitious","reviewText":"If you loved Demon's/Dark Souls and Monster Hunter Tri as much as I did, you are going to want to go ahead and buy this game. I've only played to level 21 on a fighter, and I'm already hooked on the action oriented combat.-General-This is the most ambitious game to be released in recent memory. Dynamic enemy grabbing and enemy mutilation has historically been viewed as \"technically infeasible\" or \"not worth the effort,\" but Capcom has given it a shot. In the prologue to the game, the first big monster you run across is a chimera which is part magical goat, poisonous snake, and part lion. You can actually climb on and grab the monster to get into position, and sever the goat head to eliminate his magical attacks, sever the snake to eliminate poison attacks and long range strikes, or just hammer it in the face until it stops moving. It's reminiscent of Shadow of the Colossus (another great game), but completely unscripted and dynamic.While the game is mostly hack-n-slash, there is a bit of nuance related to knowing your limits. Parts of the game are actually intended to be more stealth-based or avoidance-based rather than head on combat, and knowing when to retreat is something I am still working on :)-Online Mode-The online aspect of the game is intriguing, but not earth shattering. Your 4 person party consists of yourself, your main pawn, and two other players' main pawns downloaded over the network. If you don't have your playstation hooked up to the internet, there are some offline pawns provided so you can have a 4 person party. Your \"main pawn\" is the only one that is customizable, so searching for two other players who have the type of pawns you want is a bit of a time sink. One cool gimmick is that when you are running about town sometimes you will see other players' pawns looking for work without even having to visit the rift. Sadly, this is the extent of multiplayer.-Cons-Unfortunately, the execution of the dynamic battles is not 100% bug free. If you have OCD related to minor graphical bugs like shadow flickering and model clipping, this game is going to drive you nuts. The animations for getting on/off monsters and even running and jumping are also kind of jerky and don't line up very well. I don't want to knock on this too much however, because honestly, who else is even attempting to have climbing on enemies and cutting their body parts off in their games? Years from now when there are games doing it better we can look back and remember how buggy the first games to have these features were, but right now I think we should not judge too harshly.If you can respect somebody for going for the gold and getting silver, then you can excuse the technical problems with this game and love it.(My last minor gripe is that the pop and rock music used at the title screens is horrendous :P This music is not used in game, thankfully.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2012"}

Nintendo 2DS is only capable of 2D display.","reviewerName":"Arch Stanton","summary":"A Very Nice Handheld Console","reviewText":"Pros:Quality gaming engine is able to improve noticeably over DS gamesHigh-quality upper screenAn ever increasing and high quality game libraryBackwards compatible with DS gamesCons:No second analog stickRegion lockedPortability a bit limited without the clamshell lidThe 3DS was released two years ago and is only just recently reaching its potential. I've had mine for a year at this point and I can definitely say that I've noticed the number of people I encountered through StreetPass skyrocket in the past few months. I used to be able to walk down the street without picking up anyone at all. In fact, I went through the London Underground in rush hour and only had five hits. But now I walk down through my fairly small town and I pick up ten new people every time. It's made it almost too easy.The reason for this surge in popularity is obvious. The 3DS was marred by a rather dismal set of release games that was dominated by ports from the N64 and PS2, such asThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Star Fox 64, andTales of the Abyss. It was the same way for the first year and a half as everyone tried to figure out what to do with it, with the strange 3D features and motion controls putting some developers off. Fortunately, the system got over that and now has its own unique games likeFire Emblem: Awakening,A Link Between Worlds, andPok&eacute;mon X.As to the 2DS in general, the system is basically the same as the DS with improved graphics. Why improve on perfection I suppose? That machine was a near-perfect gaming platform with many classic games. The graphics however, were often quite blocky and sometimes ugly. The 3DS improves on that although most games keep the unrealistic style of DS games. They just do it better, with cartoony graphics that actually look like cartoons. Some of the visuals on the 2DS can be pretty amazing, but there are few games that show them off to the full. I think that the graphics level is somewhere around that of the PS2, as can be seen in a number of direct PS2 ports. This is good enough for a handheld system and means we can finally get rid of the blocky little shrunken men that dominated DS games. It's not as good as theVita, but since 3DS games are rarely about superior graphics that doesn't matter. Most of the best 3DS games would have worked just fine on the DS, they simply look nicer with better graphics. And that sums up Nintendo's strategy to a T: If it ain't broke don't fix it. And since the 3DS can do DS games better than the DS as well as play higher end games (Ace Combat looked pretty good on its screen) this system offers a lot more chance for expansion while allowing Nintendo to take few risks.One aspect of the hardware that gets people a bit upset is the battery life. The 2DS can't really play a 3DS game for longer than 3-4 hours, putting it well below the operating time of the original DS and even the Vita. However, that's only for 3DS games. The system can run on battery for eight or more hours when playing DS games, which isn't really any worse than the DS itself. The reduced battery life is just the tradeoff you get for superior graphics. There is no way around it. The one battery-related thing that does bother me though is that the sleep mode isn't very good at conserving energy. If you leave the 2DS sleeping for two days without a charge it will run out of battery. I assume this is related to Streetpass and could be resolved by simply turning the wifi off so I'm giving it a break on that score.The 3DS comes with with a number of programs preinstalled including System Settings, the eShop, Activity Log, Nintendo Zone, 3D Camera, and Mii Maker. These programs are fairly self-explanitory and cannot be deleted as they are essential to the functioning of the system. I'm not particularly happy with the eStore. It seems rather clunky to use, and crashes frequently. It's nice that it can background download, but it makes everything up to that point far too difficult. The 2DS can play downloaded games rather than using cartridges, and the fact that it uses standard memory cards means that this isn't that difficult or expensive to do. A major plus over the Vita and its Vita-exclusive memory cards.Also preinstalled are Face Raiders and Augmented Reality. These are both short games designed to be used with the 3DS's camera. They add digitally created figures to what appears behind your 2DS and allow you to, for example, shoot men with your face on them who fly about your room in little balls. It's pretty cool, and a real shame that no games have been made to take advantage of these features since. The other game on there is StreetPass. This is a collection of two games (though they can be upped to six if you pay for them) that depend on you collecting other players' characters via wifi. As you pass another 3DS in the street you will automatically sync with it and their character will show up on your Mii Plaza from which you can play games. I don't know of any other system that has social gaming features that make you feel as involved as this. I understand that Japan has something similar with cell phone games and I believe there was something like it for the PSP, but over here the only competition is Vita's Near, and StreetPass leaves Near in the dust. There's just no benefit to using Near whereas with StreetPass you get to play games with people you run into, even if they're not involved any more than that. Rewards include hats and uniforms for your Mii character.A major problem with the 2DS when compared to its predecessor is that games are now region-locked. European games cannot be played on American systems, nor can Japanese games. This is a real problem for me as I have a European 3DS. So at the moment I can't play games likeShin Megami Tensei IV, though I suspect that they'll release it in Europe eventually. Fortunately, the DS cartridges are still region-free and can be played in any system.The 3DS comes in three versions: thebase model 3DS, the3DS-XL, and the 2DS (this one). Now, the 3DS is fine as a system, but its screen is just as tiny as the DS's. The 3DS-XL however has a screen that's almost twice as big while still fitting comfortably in your hand or your pocket. It also has a longer battery life, giving you perhaps an extra hour's usage. Even if you only want to use it to play DS games it's worth the upgrade. It is of course, the most expensive of the three options. The 3DS is somewhat cheaper and fits in pockets easier, but I personally don't like how boxy it is. The 3DS-XL is all smooth lines and is only slightly bigger when you consider the increased size of the screen. But if small size really is important for you I'd go with the 3DS. The 2DS is really only for people who don't expect to carry it around in their pockets. The one-piece construction makes it stronger, but it does mean that it is less protected and you need a jacket or sweater to carry it in. The fact that it doesn't have 3D isn't much of a loss, but the low price can be a real gain. I have friends who swear by the 2DS, and I can see its advantages, but if you expect to bring it everywhere I'd go for one of the other two options. Given the option I'd go for the 3DS-XL, but there are advantages to all three models.To sum up: the 2DS is an excellent gaming system that improves on what didn't work on the DS while keeping all of the features that worked. The lack of a clamshell lid is a bit of a nuisance, but the system itself is sturdy and not as easy to damage as might be thought. Anyone wanting a portable gaming system has no reason not to turn to the 2DS. I was never a fan of portable games since I came to them back in the days of Gameboy and Game Gear when 2D sprites were the way to go and difficulty settings often unforgiving. But the 3DS has made a convert out of me and consumes far too much of my free time. Definitely recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

The world is divided into three zones based on Tiberium infestation: Blue Zones controlled entirely by the GDI where life is good, Yellow Zones where Tiberium infestation has almost destroyed the local ecosystems and where Nod gets most of its recruits, and Red Zones which are completely uninhabitable.Maybe because it was the first one listed, or I just wanted to save the more fun faction (Nod) for last, I started with the GDI.  And right away I was disillusioned.Michael Ironside, or \"That Cranky Old Jerkass with the Metal Arm from Starship Troopers\", seems like such a lazy actor here that he could easily be replaced by some other cantankerous old man actor like Stacey Keach or Kurtwood Smith and it wouldn't even make a difference.  The entire GDI setup, acting, and color scheme just screams \"Sci-Fi Original Movie\" D-quality production.  Be it Captain Generica as played by Ironside, or even the smooth and cool President Lando Calrissian (since he's played by Billy Dee Williams.  I forgot his name) who seems to be the only saving grace here.The worst of the actors is the Intelligence officer, some woman whose name I never even learned.  She looks like a woman, yes, but she is so stiff and jagged, with such a grating tone of voice, blank and dead eyes, and heavy cheekbones, that she seems like she used to be a man.  And nothing she ever says is ever important.  Anything she says in the beginning, she ends up repeating in-mission, while the mission text tells me this during the loading screen, and with EVA transmissions, and with the Objectives bar in-game.  She's completely useless, only there to add some tranny sex appeal, somehow.  And the few times where she does show emotion, it's so forced and awkward that you can barely stand to look at her any more.The environments are far more realistic and graphically advanced than Red Alert 3, but it gets to a point where nearly ALL the environments have the exact same shade of gray, brown, and tan, and it starts to become a tired hassle to play through them.  Even worse is that the GDI forces are some of the most generic and lamest military forces in any RTS game I've played.  They have almost nothing special beyond bombs and machine guns and tanks, with some \"futuristic\" style weapons like the Zone Troopers and.... zone troopers.  Their arsenal looks like that of a \"Sci-Fi Original Movie\" D-quality mixed with Starship Troopers.Every mission feels like the exact same dreck of \"build a base, kill Nod, be good guys, feel happy and play patriotic music\".  There's no influencing manner beyond just a lazy sense of duty which is only further escalated by the \"dramatic\" acting of Captain Generica.At the end of the campaign, you are faced with a \"dilemma\" of choosing to use a Liquid Tiberium bomb, which would be the 2047 equivalent of the 1945 Atomic Bomb.  Amazingly, Captain Generica drops his Generican title and puts on the most solid, credible, and heartfelt acting without breaking character in explaining to you every reason why you shouldn't ignite the Tiberium Bomb, whereas President Calrissian's entire justification why you should boils down to \"NOOOOD BAAAAADD DROP BOMB KILL INNOCENTS BUT END WAR ROFL!\"Then comes the Brotherhood of Nod and Kane.  And here is where I realize the C&C; games got their shining moments of greatness and where this whole worship of the game character Kane came from.The game developers are completely and totally in favor of the Brotherhood of Nod.  They love them.  They put all their effort into them.  Nod is their bread and butter.  Without Kane and Nod, C&C3; would be the most boring and generic dreck this side of \"Sci-Fi Presents: Captain Generica's Starfleet of D-Movie Quality\".Kane is beyond words phenomenal.  His tone of voice, his message, his rhetoric, his body language, everything about him oozes such charisma and righteous belief in his own cause, that the disillusionment I suffered with the GDI instantly converted me to his side.  And unlike the GDI, who just seemed to be \"we're the good guys because we are\", Nod actually made a very convincing argument as to why their side is right: the GDI takes control of the precious Blue Zones for themselves, where they rule completely, and in an isolationist fashion which ignores the plight of the downtrodden in the Yellow Zones.  While they call themselves the \"Global Defense Initiative\", they only bother to protect 20% of the globe that they control.  Nod makes this very clear, and even though from the outsider's view (and my view until I started the Nod campaign) they are a deranged, evil cult dedicated to a world where Kane is god and no one but Kane matters to the world, once you are inside Nod, you fully realize just how beautifully right and just Nod is.This doesn't just extend to the FMV's or Kane, but the main lieutenant is a great deal more charismatic, calm, and at ease in his role than the GDI counterpart.  He's the average Southern man who cracks dry and wry jokes, and even if the information he gives isn't so stellar that you can't learn it from the repetition in-game, he gives it with such style and flair that you want to listen to him because of his delivery, rather than necessity (of which there is none).On the battlefield as well, Nod is superior in their variety of weapons from the much more enthusiastic riflemen the Militants, to the heartbreaking sacrifice of the Fanatics, to the variety of vehicles and weapons that come down even to jeeps and motorcycles instead of the same dreary tanks and APC's.Then there's the Scrin.  I won't say anything about them because I haven't reached their campaign yet, though I did manage to test them out in the GDI campaign.This causes me to come to my complaints on gameplay.- The three sides are in almost no way different.  Unlike the Red Alert series where different buildings were faction-specific and different strategies had to be employed to account for different units and tactics and things, virtually all three sides in this game are identical save for different unit appearances.  The best comparison would likely be Age of Empires, where all sides are fundamentally identical save for some minor unique differences.  All sides have the exact same basic buildings with the exact same spots in the building queues and the exact same functions and purposes.  This is no \"Starcraft\" when it comes to variety.  Even the Scrin have the same generic riflemen/rocket trooper infantry to start out with; though with much more alien functions, they are fundamentally the same thing as riflemen and rocket troopers.- SEVERE PATHFINDING ISSUES.  I'm using version 1.0 so maybe this is addressed in patches, but thus far the in-game units have had severe pathfinding issues.  I've had far too many instances where ordering a group of tanks and infantry has caused some of them to go where I say, and half of them will end up trying to find a way around something in their way, only to not find a way around, but end up going off in other directions.  Other instances have seen vehicles completely ignore the \"Guard\" stance, and go chasing after enemy units until they run into an enemy defensive structure and get killed.  On more than one occasion, I've had to click an area for a unit to go, only for them to completely ignore my order and go some other way.  On many of these occasions, they've decided to dash straight into the enemy, so that I've angrily rightclicked where I want them to go maybe 30 times as they finally listen and obey.  Other instances include trying to attack units within their line of sight around obstacles.  While other units are clearly capable of hitting enemies from the edge of certain obstacles, some units not only can't, but see fit to wander out INTO THE LINE OF FIRE and get within arm's reach of the enemy before bothering to shoot.  This leads to some serious issues with gameplay and strategy.- The AI is ridiculously overbearing and gratingly annoying even when it isn't difficult.  Hard mode has proven too hard for me sometimes, so I've gone down to Easy mode, only to see the AI continue their exact same tactics as in Hard mode, just with a slight decrease in frequency.  And their tactics almost ALWAYS amount to \"Junkyard Dog\" tactics, in which they muster up as many light or light/heavy mix units as they can into a small pack of 6-12, and attack me with no intent of causing any damage except to fully stall my war effort again and again without any final invasion to put the crush on me.  In this way, I've never lost (on Hard mode) because the enemy never bothered to finish me off, but just keep harassing me over and over until I have virtually nothing and just give up in anger and frustration and restart or quit the mission.Despite, or perhaps because of, the heavy emphasis on the greatness of Kane and Nod, the game is only half-good and half-fun, while the bland environments and mostly bland units have me feeling more and more desiring to play Red Alert 3 again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2008"}

I found it to be pretty accurate.  It's not too sensitive but it reacts to your turns quite well.  I found that if you try to over-correct on a turn or swerve, you might bring the remote over 180 degrees and make it turn you the oposite direction.  You just have to learn how to handle it and not exagerat your movements.  The only thing that really bothers me is using the 2 button for the acceleration.  I would rather use the B button for that and the 2 button for throwing or dropping banana peels and koopa shells.  The ergonomics of that make more sense to me but even all that doesn't bother me enough to NOT use it.  Have fun, you should enjoy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2008"}

This game will give fans a multitude of action,drama,brutality,tragedy and Max Payne a$$ kicking of course with the longtime signature bullet time of course I mean where would Max Payne be without that?  The graphics and background are incredible nicely detailed and clear and the game engine effects in the game work great,especially the slow motion shots as you see them take down the scumbags coming after you.  The game gives you decent free roaming in most areas so you don't feel to confined during gunfights and the like and the A.I. for the enemies is pretty decent not the best but at least they won't be statues as you cut them down with a weapons.So for fans of hardcore brutal but entertaining games or just looking for a good game in general here's one to check out for your game collection.Update 03-09-2013After playing the game for the first two levels I really had to lower my enjoyment and expectation of the game,not due to the controls or overall story but just some of the game situations you keep finding yourself in. Case in point most of the time you have to protect someone from getting killed I do understand that but it didn't help when they were running away and you lost sight of them, then you get the message mission failed because the person was killed.Seriously??! It got to the point where I just put the game in the closet because it annoyed me to much, i did want to enjoy the game and for what little I played I did but overall replaying the level over and over because the idiot person you're trying to protect runs off and gets killed takes away any enjoyment you made from playing the game.Also an annoyance would be the Max Payne health packs(AKA Pain killers)I know most games nowadays have spoiled us somewhat where you could runaway from a fight or enemy and regain your health but still it became so annoying trying to find health packs.  The major problem was trying to find them in the room sometimes and you might spend five minutes checking every crevice to be sure you didn't miss it. Next Max Payne game hopefully gets rid of this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"R. J. Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"Dead Space 2 = Scary, Fantastic Fun!","reviewText":"Just finished this game. What a ride! This is one heck of a game. I had a lot of fun with this game, even though I purchased it a year ago. I wanted to wait until the time was right to play it. I played the first game and loved it, as well. DS1 was one of my first shooter games on the PS3, and Number Two is just as good if not better.Graphically, Dead Space 2 is outstanding. Like its predescessor, the graphics are top-notch, with great detail. The videos are seemlessly integrated into the game. When a video kicks in, the graphical detail is the same as the game, which means the game itself is high-quality graphics.The game is gory, make no mistake about it. Grotesque, even. The monsters spew forth guts and blood and, er, stuff, when they are defeated. Very cool!I found screen brightness to be a minor issue in my game. At first, I did as directed and the screen setting was way too dark. After I maximized the brightness setting I had perfect resolution.The sound is amazing. This game should be played with headphones on, so you can hear every bit of sound clearly. The music sets the atmosphere just right for a Horror title, and the sounds of the creepies crawling near you help set the tone as well. The voice acting is excellent. The actors played their parts extremely well, and that is a good thing as it helps the story only so much better.The story itself evolves nicely as you progress through the battles and tasks. Unlike the first game, Dead Space 2 does not have all that many chapter-ending bosses. This was done very well in the first game. Instead, Dead Space 2 has story evolvement and tasks that must be accomplished. There are also no arcade sequences as found in the first game. I really did get involved in the story. This time around, Isaac Clarke, the main character, has a voice and a face. The story is very involving, as characters grow and go through a journey as they say. I kept asking myself, \"Who is going to make it? And, who is going to die?\" The story is good all the way to the end.Furthermore, I recommend playing Dead Space 1 before Dead Space 2. Although the second game has slightly improved graphical detail, the first game is very solid. There are flashback moments in the second game that will ruin your playthrough of the first game if you skip Dead Space 1. Both games have almost the same combat smoothness in a game, making both of these games awesome shooters.The Dead Space games have a sort of RPG element in that equipment can be upgraded. Power nodes are dispersed throughout the levels and allow equipment upgrades. Guns, tools and suits can all be upgraded nicely to get that 'extra edge' over the monsters. There is also an inventory. As you play, you will find items that can be used or sold. By the way, ALWAYS keep one power node in your inventory! This will allow you to open Node Locked doors and find secret rooms where cool items are found. These items may by ammo or healing kits, but you will also find schematics for new items (redeemable at the store), as well as items that have a higher value. (The store, workbench, and save points are placed throughout the game at various points.) Anyway, this upgrade feature really makes Dead Space fun!My first playthrough was on Normal mode. I have slow reflexes, however, and I died often. I died in every decent battle, as a matter of fact. I was always low on credits, healing, and ammunition. Although I like a challenge now and then, I was not having much fun. So, I changed the difficulty to Casual mode and ... still died! A few times, anyway. I had a LOT of fun after that.The game has all sorts of difficulty settings. For example, there is newgame+, which allows the player to take their upgraded items into the next game. I had fun on the setting I played on.Although I usually detest Healing Kits in a game, and greatly prefer Auto-Healing in a shooter, the game design for Dead Space makes healing kits work. Most of the enemies will try to close the range and melee the main character. Meanwhile, the main character has more than enough tools to keep the baddies away. It works well.As far as guns go, I used the Plasma Cutter and the Pulse Rifle within the game. I like the Plasma Cutter because, once upgraded, it hits really hard and is excellent for limb dismemberment. The Pulse Rifle, on the other hand, is an assault rifle and has a very high rate of fire. Necromorphs will get knocked back a little when hit with most any gun/tool, and I love assault rifles!I played for 1-2 hours at a time, then I would recharge my wireless equipment. Dead Space 1 and 2 are both games that has a player on the edge of their seat, wondering what will happen next. My nerves would be shaken. As I rested, I would reflect on what had happened and the story progression. When I was ready for more I'd dive back in. Dead Space 2 takes around 15 hours or so to play for the most part, so it took me about a week to get through.The only bad thing about this game? It ends!This is an excellent game. Graphics, sound and story, combined with excellent gameplay, make for one heck of an experiance. Dead Space 2 has some of the best entertainment found in video games today.Hope this helps.Good Luck, and Good Hunting!PS. Watch your back!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2012"}

It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

Whether it was the initial struggles to beat such wimps as Glass Joe and King Hippo, the battles with Magic Tiger, Piston Honda II, and Bald Bull, or the epic confrontations with Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, and Tyson/Dream, that game provided (and still provides) me with hours of entertainment.Strangely, though, after the \"knockout\" (pun very much intended!) success of that original title, the franchise quickly stagnated and came crashing to a halt.  Sure, a sequel was released on the Super Nintendo system, but it wasn't able to capture the charm of the original.  Then, throughout the life of the '64 and Gamecube Nintendo systems, rumors would always pop up from time to time about a new Punch-Out game, but would quickly fall into the void.  So, when a new installment was finally released on the remarkably popular Wii console, old-school gamers rejoiced at the notion of being able to dust off Little Mac's gloves and pink jogging suit to take on the animated bad guys once again.The game itself, judging by the nostalgia factor, does not disappoint.  As Little Mac, you must fight your way through roughly the same gauntlet of cartoon pugilists as you did in the NES version, with a few SNES baddies speckled in between.  In keeping with the kid-friendly style of the Wii, the opponents are even more over the top than ever, although they keep (with a few changes) to their original styles of fighting from the NES.  Going through them one by one was a blast, as much reliving the \"good old days\" of the NES as anything, and the only \"complaint\" I had was in the difficulty arc.  The first time through (although keep in mind that I can routinely beat Tyson/Dream in the original version), I only struggled with a few fighters.  However, in the amped-up difficulty mode, I lost my first title defense to the headgear-sporting Glass Joe.  Call me a wimp, but suffice it to say that I won't be completing that last mode.Thus, I really have to call the new \"Punch-Out!\" game a hit in terms of bringing back the audience from two decades ago.  Yet, for so-called \"Punch-Out experts\" like myself, it left me just a little bit wanting in terms of another sequel.  The walk down memory lane was terrific, but now I would love something new.  Perhaps in this day and age of political correctness video games can't portray a drunk Russian (Soda Popinski) or a wimpy Frenchman (Glass Joe), but I would go over the moon for a new lineup of \"lovable\" (until you're on the mat, of course) enemies to figure out.  This game was a good start, so let's hope Nintendo gives us something fresh the next time around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2009"}

I may have played some Batman games when I was in high school. Now I am working with many responsibilities, videogames are not as fun as they used to.The map is pretty big and lot of buildings. To be honest, I was quite lost. I was aimlessly gliding and jumping, and then punching some thugs. I got so bored and I didn't even care about the story. The graphic looks good and the sound is pretty good too. The gliding and jumping mechanics are a little bit buggy.

{"product_name":"B0045U4U52","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"Short But Sweet","reviewText":"Story: The story in the 3rd Birthday begins with a opening scene showing Manhattan being destroyed in the near future by mysterious creatures called Twisted and all efforts to try and stop this invasion has been unsuccessful. One year later new technology has been developed that allows users to go back in the past and change certain events, this technology is called Overdive and Aya Brea is the only person capable of harnessing this power. This is the basic premise of the 3rd Birthday, overall the story was great and was well told with the CG cut scenes Square is so great at making. If I had one complaint about the story it would be that it is a bit confusing to follow with all the past and present time lines, although this is minor.Gameplay: Gameplay in the 3rd Birthday is fast paced and overall really fun. The 3rd Birthday is a 3rd person shooter with RPG elements added on. A really neat feature is the ability to use your overdive, this is essential to survival in the game. Basically with overdive you can transfer Aya's soul into another person's body and when they die, or an enemy is pushing you against a wall you simply hold triangle and select another person to \"jump\" into. You can also do what's called an overdive kill, you jump into an enemy and implode them, this works well for dealing with bosses with tons of HP has it really takes a chunk out of them. You are also able to customize Aya's weapons and take up to 3 with you in battle, you can also change Aya's attire (she wears the new attire in battle) to increase her defense, and you also gain levels. The control's in the game are surprisingly easy to grasp and I found that within 10 minutes I was playing the game like a pro, and with no cramped hands! (Resistance Retribution had a hand cramping control scheme)Graphics/Sound: As always, Square Enix impresses me with what they can do with the PSP, the graphics in the 3rd Birthday are simply amazing. Aya, as well as other characters are detailed very nicely and I found that with a data install there was no noticeable slowdown and very little load times with my PSP1000. The voice acting in the game is done really well and I found that no character over acted or sounded odd at all, it was actually pleasant to listen to. The music in the game was also very well done, some of the more suspenseful songs actually sent chills up my spine, while the action music was perfect for battles. Overall the music used in the game fit whatever situation it was meant for very well.Although short (I beat it in one sitting, taking me 5 hours and 15 minutes) the game is meant to be played through multiple  times for you to unlock all the items/cheat codes in the game, this is a must buy for fans of Parasite Eve and newcomers alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000K8YAKI","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Halo's back","reviewText":"After the success that Halo and Halo 2 have received on the original XBOX,the epic Halo saga finally came to the XBOX 360 on September 25th 2007.The launch date has been marked on the calendar of every gamers even those who didn't plan to buy it or don't even have an XBOX 360,whatever would happen it would still be Halo 3 and sell millions of copies.The launch did happen as planned by Bungie and Microsoft,unlike many games who have been delayed,it is no surprise that Halo 3 sold millions of copies and the game ultimately received mixed but mostly positive review and attracted many gamers to XBOX Live.Those are all facts but continue reading for my personal review.As someone who has actually PLAYED THE GAME,Halo 3 in my opinion is true to the Halo serie and brings much of the same insane fun that millions had playing the first two Halo games.It is similiar to Halo 2 but with a few improvements in the game itself,new weapons,vehicles and a better online play with some new things added such as grades for your character(ranked as General for exemple) and the ability to now record,take screenshots,or just watch your entire matchs as much as you want by saving them on you XBOX 360 hard drive and put them on XBOX Live.If you have XBOX Live then you should stronlgy consider buying this game.The ending of Halo 2 was pretty bad as many gamers will agree,I am one of them.Now with Halo 3 at least its wrapping the Halo story properly and you feel like you really did something,only for that Halo 3 is great.The storyline is alright.The story stays true to Halo and concludes what is said to be the final chapter of Halo greatly as you will see after you completed the game really good and you discover why there won't be Halo 4,on that point its great.The controls are easy if you played Halo before,Halo 3 is much of the same on that point.Don't worry it is still a FPS.The controls can be resumed as easy,quick to learn,fun,well designed and they feel great great unlike some games where the controls feel all bad.They made some changes but for the better as it takes advantage of the XBOX 360 controller's triggers(you use them to shoot)it feels great.Those are some of the best controls I have experienced on my XBOX 360 so far.The single play is pretty solid on the story mode,its pretty fun and the game did a good job of getting you into it early on.Having played the first two Halos I had the experience necessary to get trough the game,if you haven't played it before you will get into it rather quickly.I liked the missions so I can say story mode is definitely worth playing and fun.Some missions are longer than others while others are shorter,some are better,some are bad.Its mixed in many areas but its worth playing.I had lots of fun discovering the new weapons and try to make the best dual-up combination(i came up with some pretty good ones).I had even more fun discovering the new vehicles I don't want to give too much details and ruin the experience for you so i will stay quiet about the new weapons and vehicles.Multiplayer is neat if you have some of your friends to play it,if you don't you can't play multiplayer as the game simply doesn't have bots for multiplayer.That's right DOES NOT HAVE BOTS,Halo after all those years still doesn't have any bots.For those who have XBOX Live,no need to care but for those won't don't and can't get it,its bad as you can't play alone multiplayer or online,which is where the true fun of the game was in the first two Halos and remains in Halo 3.That point right there will make potential buyers not buy it,because at this point of age in the video game industry if you can't even have bots in the game...And also those who play online but don't like the experience for various reasons(hackers,bad connection...) might have preferred playing with bots instead.Yes bots might be things of the past for many and online is the future but still its nice to have them in the game.That is deceiving for some but that's how it is.I think Microsoft did that on purpose to get more people on XBOX Live,that's a smart strategy but had they put put bots available in multiplayer they would have got bigger sales....Alright enough bot talk.Now lets talk Online,there might be some problems and it can be frustrating but if you are looking for a great game online and online experience Halo 3 is your buy.Online is wicked fun,I can't really say a lot for it except online for Halo 3 is great(depending who you're playing with).This is where the real fun of the game is.Im conclusion to this long review,Halo 3 is a must for the XBOX 360 gamer especially if you have online,if you don't have it you should.I am satisfied with what Bungie offered with Halo 3,a great XBOX 360 experience for all gamers.I think it lives up to the hype.I recommend this edition for those who wants to save cash and don't care for extras.For those who like Halo a lot then consider the special edition and if you are a Halo freak then by all means buy the Legendary edition that has the master chief helmet.This game is essential to your XBOX 360 games collection.Your friends will tell you to get it until you actually do,that's how it was for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2008"}

It's more of the same basic formula of key fetching to unlock doors and some minor puzzle solving. It's still fun, mind you, but if you're looking for innovation in the gameplay, you won't find it here. If you're looking for a mindless good time and a great way to kill some hours, RE5 definitely delivers.First off, the graphics are simply gorgeous. It's simply a fantastic looking game, and Capcom really did push the envelope here. Environments and characters are detailed and a joy to look at. Boss enemies are HUGE and fluid. Great lighting effects.Pros:------ Good replay value. Once beaten, you can go back and replay any chapter with your current inventory and stats. You can try to lower your total completion time for a bonus reward.- Good number of unlockable weapons and bonus features. 8 new characters/costumes for Mercenaries mode (Timed mode where you try to kill as many zombies as you can for points).- ability to restart a chapter at checkpoints. This way, you can unload inventory you don't need and have room to carry more stuff.- a lot of fun weapons. Even more fun when you unlock unlimited ammo mode! They are all a lot of fun to shoot, especially the Magnum, which takes out non-boss enemies with one shot.Cons:------ timed button pressing can be frustrating. You need to push certain buttons when the onscreen prompt appears. In co-op mode, this can lead to great annoyance if the other guy misses- horrible item selection system can often get you killed while trying to equip the right item. Can't cycle between inventory quickly. You can assign 4 items (one for each D-pad direction), but others are not assignable.RE5 is a fun game if you're a fan of the series. There's no much new in relation to previous RE games, but still fun and worth owning. I didn't mind that it felt like playing RE4 all over again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2009"}

There are many, older reviews that give a lengthy synopsis. There is a serious departure from RE1 to RE5. Your foes, much like RE4, are fast moving monster men, not slow moving zombies. They can drive cars and motorcycles, operate heavy machinery and unlike Chris Redfield, they can shoot their guns while they're doing it - yes, you read that correct, shoot their zombie guns. RE4 started the trend and RE5 completes the transition from survival horror, the term RE coined, and has become a straight forward action game.The graphics and presentation are dynamite. The visuals top to bottom are incredible. The creatures look awesome and the bosses can be very intimidating (although the end boss was dissapointing, to say the least). RE5 is probably one of the top 5 best looking games ever, it's that good.Here's where it all comes apart for me. I just completed Uncharted 2. The controls are amazing, as well as the visuals. Much like Metal Gear Solid, there is a control scheme in place, that at this point in videogames is unacceptable. I can't walk and shoot? I can't walk and swing a knife? I can't run away from enemies and reload? Chris Redfield and Sheva (his counterpart) move like they have a piano on their back. Perhaps Capcom was unable to create a graphics engine that could provide the visuals and keep up with a run and gun gameplay. Maybe they were trying to make it \"scary\" becuase you can't escape (or aim. Maybe they are holding on to tradition. One thing is for sure, they have a weapons and inventory system that is lame and the combat cannot keep up with games like Killzone, Gears of War or Uncharted when it comes to gameplay AND great grapchics combined.I actually grabbed two copies at a local video retailer so that my teenage son and I could play together. It worked very well and made several areas relatively simple to clear becuase both of us were competent players. Neither of us joined anyone else online, but I imagine the quality of play would have a lot to do with the person on the other end.RE5 is worth a rental, but I just can't understand why they chose a control scheme that takes so much away from the game. With Dead Space nicely filling the survival horror void, I don't mind the direction of the storyline, but its quality isn't much better than the movies at this point. RE5 can be knocked out in a weekend and I can't reccomend a purchase unless you are a huge fan of the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"gimli1357","summary":"Absolutely worth it","reviewText":"I got my Xbox One on Day One but wanted to wait about a month to write a review so I could really use it. That month turned into five months because any time I thought about writing a review, it just made me want to play it instead. So I'm finally putting an end to my procrastination and writing this. I'll start with the fact that I have thoroughly enjoyed my Xbox One and would absolutely choose it again if I got a time machine and went back. From here I'll break things down (as seems to be the norm with reviews on consoles and things).\"The User Interface\"It's really quite similar to the way that the Xbox 360 is, but with fewer \"tabs\" right on the home screen. You also have your pins right to the left on the home screen so I actually use them occasionally now. I never really used the pins on the Xbox 360 because I didn't want to open up another menu to get to them, problem solved. Though I can't think of the last time that I actually clicked the pins because it is SOOOOO convenient to just say \"Xbox go to Kinect Sports Rivals\" or \"Xbox go to Amazon Instant Video\" because that works no matter what else you are doing. I have never used the Kinect for the Xbox 360 (though I will probably get one soon as the Xbox 360 isn't dead yet) so I can't really compare this feature, but I can say that it works amazingly on the Xbox One. Snapping things is also really nice, though I rarely snap anything to a game because I like to game in full screen. If I had better internet, I would probably use Skype more often because it works really good when my internet allows it.\"Graphics\"Since some people do not seem to understand this- *cough*... THE XBOX ONE DOES FRIGGIN' RUN IN FRIGGIN' 1080 FRIGGIN' P!!! I know you would know that listening to the fanboys and trolls (don't hate the PlayStation or the people that play it, just the people who fight with their lives over something that is preference). There are only a couple games that don't run 1080p because the game developers have said that they aren't used to this hardware yet, and I wasn't even able to tell the difference sitting 3 feet away from my 1080p TV. Anyway, enough ranting. If you have an HD TV (which you'll need to even hook up the Xbox One) you'll see an upgrade from the Xbox 360, especially if your TV is 1080p. I haven't been disappointed, graphicly, by any of the games I've played so far. I was even impressed by Halo Spartan Assault for a little arcade game (or whatever they're called now).\"Load Times\"Load times have been great on most games, like Halo Spartan Assault, Trials Fusion, and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. But I am somewhat disappointed in the load times for Kinect Sports Rivals, but that is the only game so I think it's something to do with the game itself (and I've probably been spoiled by the rest of the games as it's really about the same as an Xbox 360 game). This is honestly something I was looking forward to more than graphics for this generation. A graphics upgrade is always nice, but I'm still impressed by some of the later Xbox 360 titles. I was never really impressed with the load times though, so I've been a pretty happy camper this generation (with one little rainy day).\"Controller\"The controller is VERY similar to the Xbox 360 controller. It's still the ergonomic wonder that we all love and hold dear, with some little changes. The thumbsticks are slightly smaller, they said it was for higher precision, but if they had never mentioned it, I probably wouldn't have even noticed, they're still comfy. The D-Pad is a REAL D-Pad (have we beaten this one into ground enough yet?), it's much better than any of the Xbox 360 D-Pads. The guide button is higher up on the controller which I wasn't sure about at first glace, but I definitely think it was a good choice. It's still within comfortable reach, and I won't accidently hit it any more trying to check my score in Halo or have the game pause in a room of four people because someone bumped the guide button. The triggers and bumpers are something you'll probably need a little getting used to, but I think that they're more comfortable on the fingers once you do. The battery pack is inside making the back flat, halleluiah. And you can charge it, or just play with it plugged in, with any ol' micro-USB cable. And of course if you have the Day One edition, you get a little printed \"DAY ONE 2013\" in the middle.\"The Kinect\"Like I said earlier, I never used the Xbox 360 Kinect, but now I want to. I find my self many times doing something on the Xbox One with out ever turning my controller on. My day usually begins with me saying \"Xbox On\" while turning my computer one (I wish it would turn on when I talk to it), while I go and make breakfast so I can watch something and check email while I eat before work. But it is just so convenient to use voice commands for everything. I rarely open \"My Game & Apps\" and rarely click any of my Pins because I launch EVERYTHING with Kinect. It's also very responsive and I haven't had any trouble with the motion controls even in the dark which is so cool. The only gaming I've done is the little bit of punching zombies off of me in Dead Rising 3 and of course Kinect Sports Rivals (which plays really well and is really fun, I just wish that it didn't take as long as it does to load).\"The Console\"Not really any big deal here as it is the one part that you will interact with the least. But it's there. I kinda like the design, modern and fitting in with your entertainment setup (even though mine is just a TV in the bed room). It's got a Blu-ray player which is nice so that I don't need a separate player. The vent on top puts out the heat and it's normal for it to feel a little toasty on top, that just means that the inside isn't melting. I'll mention too that the power brick has it's own little fan now (as does the Kinect) so I think Microsoft learned their lesson about overheating last generation. But all of the fans are as silent as can be, which is quite the treat for me as I still use an old, loud, Xbox 360 Pro (I know, I know, I'm probably going to upgrade soon).Overall, I haven't regretted my purchase once. I feel that it is absolutely worth it. And I can't wait to see how it will improve even more like the 360 did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2014"}

It's actually pretty fun!  I hestitated on buying it because I am into racing and GTA style games.  This one only resembles GTA with the open-world theme.  Like one person said, from what I have seen so far, no one dies.  You get to take on tasks and confronting bullies and playing pranks and skipping class, etc.  You also get to go a town fair and ride the rides and play the games at the fair and see shows.  At the fair, I competed in a go-kart event which was pretty cool.  You unlock something if you win the race.  You start out in Chapter 1 only being able to do missions in the school grounds, but once you finish Ch 1, you unlock a new area of the map for Ch 2..the town and the fairground..may be more but I haven't ventured elsewhere yet.  I bought a bicycle, I have a skateboard, and I think you might be able to get a skooter at the fair..not sure yet though on that one.  But the game looks to be huge and gonna take a while to complete...lots of things to do.  Even though this game IMO is not as fun as GTA, it is still a good purchase.  I recommend this game for teens on up.  I think for anyone wanting a GTA style game (meaning open-world with lots to do and explore) but something less violent and less graphic and less profanity, then this one seems to be worth a shot from what I have seen so far in my 7 hrs or so of play time up to now.

This one looked like fun. I've never tried any of the hunting games on PC or console, and the fact that this one promised DINOSAURS was enough to get me to try it.Right off the bat, I found the controls to be marginal at best. The combination of stylus and buttons just didn't flow. I tried the alternate setup and it was worse. The game started off with \"shoot X deer in Y minutes\" and moved onto \"don't shoot any doe\". I found it a challenge to discern doe from bucks on the 3ds screen. There is a variety of weapons and power-ups, but it still wasn't enough to engage me for any extended gameplayI did like the addition of predators like the moose and wolf to change things up a bit, but the wonky control scheme just kept throwing me off.

Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"A fitting sequel to Assassin's Creed II","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood starts right where AC II left off.  From the very start you are thrust into battle in this non stop action game.  This is one of the very few series that actually has dramatically improved after each sequel.  This game is well worth the investment for people who played the last game.  It's not necessarily worth it for people who haven't played any AC games.Ezio Auditore is the main character of this well thought out game.  In Assassin's Creed II he started off as a fun loving teenager who seemed to have everything going for him until tragedy struck his family.  Ezio end up turning the tragedy into revenge and found out he was an elite assassin.  Their to take out this mysterious group that has control over religion and the government.  Like the first game the quest is to actually finding this object called the Apple of Eden.  The Apple is basically what holds all mysteries of life.  Needless to say the Assassin's aren't the only ones looking for this Apple.  The Templars are also trying to find this.  AC II takes you through most of Ezio's young adulthood.  Watching the transformation from teenager to a man with a mission makes the story compelling.In Assassin's Creed Brotherhood we now have Ezio continuing his mission.  The Apple that was shortly on his property has once again been taken by the Templars.  The story takes place in the turn of the 16th century Italy.  To be more precise Roma or Rome as it's known to us.  Although the back story which was generally pretty limited with Desmond Miles is actually advancing quite a bit.  What new players to the series may not understand is that this game does not just take place in the past, it also takes place two years in the future.  Ezio Auditore is the ancestor of Desmond Miles.  Desmond is now realizing that he is also part of a long line of Assassin's that are also in a present day fight against the Templars.  The Templars have all the money to invest in this fight to secure the Apple the Assassin's are limited.What makes this game remarkable is everything they added to it.  Sometimes it can get a little overwhelming.  Whereas the previous games had cities that were decent size as a player you had the option to complete certain parts of the game before you worked on the rest.  Now with Brotherhood you have the huge city of Rome.  Which is overwhelming but also beautiful.  If you are like me you may spend much of your time just exploring.  There are so many side missions it can literally add many hours unto your game play.  Although I would say for a big fan of the series they are almost a necessity.  Brotherhood takes everything from the previous games and one up's it.  It is easy to get overwhelmed by the amount of content.  Even building up the city can become quite a task.Multiplayer is the completely new element to this game and it is well worth it.  Unlike games like the Call of Duty series that is based on using guns to kill your enemy this game relies on close combat weapons.  The whole objective of multiplayer is to be stealth like and not get detected.  You are assigned as assassination target which can be one of several playable characters.  Which makes it more complicated it that there can be several characters that look the same which makes detection sometimes impossible.  If you can find your target without the target noticing you, you are awarded many points.  If you still manage to assassinate your target while being seen you will be awarded with a limited amount of points.  In my plays I found this addition to the game well worth it.  Although I did notice several players that generally play the online portion like they would the single player it only makes it more exciting.AC Brotherhood is an exciting sequel to AC II.  This game may have new players wondering what is going on and that is why I wouldn't generally advise this game to people just getting in the series.  AC II should be a pre-requisite.  Brotherhood has it's spots at times where you may be wondering what to do next.  The large city can be overwhelming and make travel tiring if you haven't invested in the underground tunnels.  This game is a must have for fans of the series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}

With real time lighting, fog effects, and highly detailed textures, you'll wonder if this really is a PSP game. SH improves upon the previous installments by giving us a brand new story, a new fighting system, and ways of exploring. You are Travis Grady who is a trucker and gets stuck in the deadly town of Silent Hill. While you're there you save a girl from a fire and confront a mysterious girl named Alissa. While the story isn't that great and has a pointless ending you'll be playing for the thrills.Origins is extremely scary especially when played with headphones and in the dark. Instead of switching between worlds at certain points you can do it on the whim by using mirrors. I found this makes puzzle solving a lot easier and you can be more organized and keep track of things easier. Origins is a lot easier on the puzzle solving and navigating, unlike other SH games, and I completed the whole thing without a FAQ.The combat system is decent with context sensitive button presses and tons of weapons to find. You can use firearms and melee weapons. While the melee weapons do break after a while you can still use your fists. The thing is the combat system is very sluggish and can make fighting so hard. It takes forever for Travis to recover from a hit and by the time you're ready to swing you get hit again. While the system is neat it needs improvement.

In the beginning I thought that GameCube could play DVDs so I thought I would buy that because Nintendo has been in the gaming business for a long time. The clerk of the store let me look at a floor model. It was so small and after I saw the outside I knew immediatly that this wouldn't play DVDs. I asked the clerk if there were any other good consoles out and he showed me to the PlayStation 2. He told me that this can play DVDs without any software unlike the Microsoft Xbox. He also said it comes with the most games and it is a bargain. I bought PlayStation 2 with like 10 games and I went home to play it. After I started playing it I knew I made the correct decision.

The problem games like this normally has is if a game requires a special controller, the game normally fails to catch on(\"Dance Dance Revolution\" is a rare exception).  Thankfully, \"Buzz Junior: Jungle Party\" takes care of this problem by not only including the special Buzz Remote (or Buzz Buzzers), but by including four of them (no batteries required).  This means that one purchase will fulfill all the requires to get a party together and play \"Buzz Junior: Jungle Party.\"  But is it any fun?Well, being 22 years old, I can't say this is something me and my friends got into.  However, a party with a much younger crowd wielded better results.  A Sunday school class I help out with once in awhile had a blast with this game.  They were laughing at the monkeys antics, buzzing the buzzers to match up with the actions on screen, and squealing with delight whenever they got more points.  A particular mini-game, one that involved entering and exiting the mouths of lions, is especially worthy of mention, as this is the mini-game that got the most play time as well as the most laughs.  Though the game is rated E10+ (Everyone 10 and up), I found very little to complain about with the game.It was mildly crude, yes, but also inoffensive.  Now, keep in mind, this isn't a game \"I\" would play in my free time.  Most older gamers will find this game to try their patience a bit too much.  But little kids are different.  Kids love bright colors, funny animals, and cute music.  They love playing games that are competitive, but they also like games that don't leave the losers feeling bad about themselves.  In this sense, \"Buzz Junior: Jungle Party\" is a huge success, and an easy recommendation for parents with kids.  And who knows, maybe the parents will get into the game too?  Because I have to admit, given the right environment, even I found a certain charm to the Buzzers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2008"}

If you can look past the fact that everyone expected this game to be all things and enjoy it for what it is you will find an amazing game. That said the word 'game' seem not quite good enough to describe this adventure. Maybe interactive crime series or something would do better. The story is amazing and when I say interactive I mean it, its not just a choice here and there, but you have the power to the point where any of the main characters will live or die depending on how you decide their actions. This isn't a preset button pushing adventure, this is a fully interactive one. You have the power to decide what the character you control is going to do, to what length he or she is will to go, and it is pulled of with such style and intuitiveness that you don't even think about something you do until later. The ability for the makers to total immerse you in the story is amazing.The graphics and voice acting are top notch and the story is great. The game carries a certain Film Noir style that is well done but not over done. The story is in the vein of Along Came a Spider, The Bone Collector or similar crime adventure style movies, except you are playing all the important parts. There are twists and turns in the story but they are not over done and it doesn't take you out of the story. The ability for the makers to achive this balance is really telling. Funny as it sounds, with all the modern graphics and games play the type of story reminds me most of the start of gaming on the computer, of Zork and Myth, but with the advances in techology making it more than those games could ever be at the time.This isn't a shooter, there is not platforming and it isn't an action game.

Some are really good, others... not so much.Concept: 8/10The conclusion of the Ezio and Altair storylines with new Multiplayer features.  If you've been following the Assassin's Creed Series, this is a must play.  If you're new to the series, you'll need to play Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to get the full benefit of Revelations.Story: 8/10A more mature Ezio heads to Constantinople to find the hidden tomb of his predecessor Altair.  Once he arrives, he gets drawn into a conflict between rival princes who both want the throne.  As the story progresses, Ezio finds memory disks that unlock memories (missions) from Altair's past.  The story is full of action, suspense, intrigue, a hint of romance, and a satisfying conclusion to the Assassin's Creed II Storyline.Gameplay: 8/10Assassin's Creed Revelations features six different types of gameplay:  Combat, Navigation, Den Defense, Assassin Management, Puzzles, and Multiplayer.Combat:  8.5/10Similar to the previous games, when Ezio arouses too much suspicion he gets chased by guards.  When they catch him, they surround him and take turns attacking.  Different enemy types require you to use different tactics on each of them.  Regular Guards are easy to kill.  Armored Guards require you to kick them to break their stance, then finish them off with quick strikes.  Fast enemies will block and evade most of your attacks, but you can grab them.  Elite enemies are really tough.  They are really hard to counter, take quite a beating, you can't grab them, and they do quite a bit of damage.  Eventually, you can wear them down, or use a weapon:  bomb, poison dart, pistol, crossbow, call on your allies.Ezio also has bombs this time around and they're a nice addition to his arsenal.  The bombs can be broken down into three categories.  Lethal, Tactical, and Diversion.  The bombs have 3 main components.  A shell, gunpowder, and fillings.  There are 4 basic shells for bombs:  Impact (blows up on contact), Fuse (bounces off of walls and blows up in 3 seconds), Tripwire (this is like a mine), and Sticky (throw it at a guard and it sticks to them, blowing up shortly after).  Once you pick a shell, you pick the type of powder.  There are 3 types, the better the powder, the greater the explosion.  The bombs can be filled with shrapnel for damage, toxins to create poison gas, coal dust for a concussive blast, skunk oil or smoke to incapacitate enemies, or phosphorus and sulfur to cause a distraction.  Bombs are simple to use.  Use a Diversionary bomb to lure enemies into a trap or away from something that they are guarding.  Use a tactical bomb to stun them for a few seconds so you can get away or kill them.  Use a lethal bomb to take out 4 guys at a time.Navigation:  9/10Ezio now has a hook blade which allows him to climb much faster and use zip lines.  There are also \"fast travel\" sewers that basically allow you to teleport to different parts of the city.  Ezio can also use parachutes to glide to objectives.  (horses are gone from this game)  The good news is that there are enemies and vendors all over the city, so you never really have to go out of your way to restock your supplies.  Almost every guard you kill has bomb ingredients, medicine, poison darts, bullets, etc...Den Defense:  4/10This is a simple RTS style game where you accrue morale points, then use them to place NPC assassins in an area while squads of Templars attack.  It's got a steep learning curve and the camera and controls are clunky.  Thankfully, you can skip this part of the game.Assassin Management:  8/10This is similar to AC Brotherhood.  You can recruit and assassins and promote them by giving them text base missions.  You can assign one to five assassins for each mission and they will split the XP.  As they get promoted, you can increase their armor or weapons.  This is a simple game that operates like a facebook game.  The real benefit is that the assassins that you upgrade are more powerful when you call them for assistance during missions.Puzzles:  6/10Desmond has 5 special levels that you can unlock by finding collectibles.  It's basically a 3D platforming game that allows you to navigate through it by placing blocks.  You can summon rectangles (walkways) or triangles (ramps).  Desmond navigates through levels as he tells his own story.  It feels a bit like the original Portal.Multiplayer:  9/10The Multiplayer in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood was great.  It relied on stealth and trickery, to insta kill your enemies.  You are always hunting someone and someone is always hunting you in crowds of NPC's.  You are awarded a score on how well you killed your opponent.  Did you stalk them for while?  Did you stand next to them for 6 seconds before you killed them?  Did you jump down from a rooftop?  Did you poison them?  All of these things add to your score.  You can also stun enemy assassins who are trying to take you out.  If you press B before they attack, you stun them, get points, and escape.  At times, multiple assassins are after the same target.  In ACB, it was frustrating to tail an enemy only to have some yahoo jump down from a roof right in front of your eyes.  In ACR, you can stomp on them for 50 points as a constellation prize if you get to their body fast enough.  It takes some of the pain away from kill steals.  Another addition to ACR is the Contested Kill.  If the attacker attacks and the defender attempts to stun at the same time, the defender gets in a punch before they get killed.  The attacker's score is halved and the defender gets 100 points.ACR features new multiplayer modes.  In Deathmatch, you hunt down and kill your enemies in a small arena.  Their portrait glows when they are nearby.  In Assassination, you get a compass that points you in the direction of your enemies and you can choose who you target.  Once you target them, you hunt them down and kill them.  Corruption is a zombie tag - sort of assassination game where you infect other players and they join your side.  There's also an objective based game called steal the relic... and a few team based games.  These games are rarely populated and it's really difficult to find a match.  Unfortunately, the UbiSoft servers have been down quite a bit lately... which has been frustrating.  When the servers are working fine you'll notice that matchmaking is much better this time around and it's easy to get into a game.When you kill enemies or escape from enemies, you gain XP.  When you gain enough points, you go up in level.  This unlocks a few new abilities, weapons, perks, character customization, etc...  But it's a little more complicated than that.  Unlocking something doesn't mean you get it.  Instead, you have to play the game to earn Abstergo points to buy the item after it is unlocked.  You can never buy everything that you just unlocked, so you need to choose.  This feels a bit tedious.  It would have been better to let the players equip what they unlock and skip the Abstergo currency altogether.  But this does add to the replay value of the game because even after you hit level 50, you can keep playing to unlock extra costume parts, other perks and abilities.Graphics: 8.5/10The graphics of the Assassin's Creed Series have been excellent.  However, Constantinople doesn't look as good as Italy in the previous games.Sound: 7/10The soundtrack isn't as good as the other games either.  It's just sorta there to provide some atmosphere.  There are plenty of sound effects to spice up the action and lots of funny or immersive dialogue from the townspeople as you play.Maturity: Teens - Don't worry about the M rating on the box.Yeah, you kill guys with medieval weapons.  Yeah, there is blood that you can turn off in the options menu.  There is some swearing in Greek, but none in English.  There's no nudity or sex.Replay Value: 8/10There really isn't any reason to play the 30 hour campaign over again, but you can get hooked on the multiplayer and all of the different games.Overall: 8.5/10Assassin's Creed is a really good conclusion to the Ezio story.  Unfortunately, this game was made by 5 or 6 different Ubisoft Studios and it shows.  While the core of the game is excellent, the Den Defense, Secret Island Level, Puzzle Levels, etc...  aren't up to par and it hurts the game a bit.  But these are all optional things and they are minor.  If you've been following this series, this is a very good game.  (and it's cheap now, too!)Buy it if you like the Assassin's Creed Series!Rent it if you have 20-30 hours to get through the campaign.  Mutliplayer does require a separate Ubi-Passport and if you get the game used, you'll have to buy one to play online.Avoid it if the Assassin's Creed series just doesn't do anything for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0006BK58U","description":"In Forza Motorsport, it's all about you and your car. With over 250 of the baddest racing machines imaginable, an infinite number of ways to customize them, and all the tools you need to tune them to perfection, you'll find yourself behind the wheel of the slickest vehicles on the planet.With Forza Motorsport, you'll be able to own cars from the world's most recognized manufacturers. Get behind the wheel of the Enzo Ferrari, Porsche 911, Ford GT, or the Audi R8, to name a few. The physics model of each car is based upon actual car data, so your driving feels like the real deal. Plus, Forza has taken meticulous steps to design each car's visuals according to exact specifications. Teams of artists have worked to reproduce the surface properties of materials in an ultra-realistic fashion -- the painted metal is shiny with gloss, the glass reflects light, and the car's rubber is rich with texture.You can trick out every car with real-world body parts, such as rims, wings, side skirts, bumpers, and hoods. At the advanced paint shop you can pimp your ride with phatty decals and classy custom paint schemes. But don't stop with looks alone -- Forza also lets you upgrade your car with suspension kits, turbochargers, superchargers, intercoolers, brakes, and racing slicks. It's your car, and Forza gives you the tools to make it your own.And once your ride is ready, you can immerse yourself in 17 different environments that deliver challenging tracks textured with accurate, photo-realistic graphics. Slip on your driving gloves, get behind the wheel, and rev your engine as you ready yourself for the world-famous Nring Nordschleife, the corkscrew turns of Laguna Seca, the urban jungle of New York City, or the lush Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. Each location has been recreated with detail matching the attention given to the vehicles -- the total package of fast cars and exotic locales makes the racing experience of Forza Motorsport totally awesome.Take your powerful, new creation to cyberspace, and challenge the globe's toughest drivers on Xbox Live. Once you've built your vehicle and mastered all the driving nuances, you'll be ready to burn some serious rubber.","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Gran Turis-who?","reviewText":"Forza Motorsport is as much about style as it is about speed. Buy a car, tweak it with numerous upgrades and choose your paint colour for the main body of the car, the hood and the mirrors. Tint the windows, change the rims, apply a million decals to the vehicle and take it to the track. No, you can't fit neons and no, you can't change the colour of your exhaust, but you don't need to. Resizing the decals and vinyls, colouring them, spinning them and moving them to the desired location can result in some incredibly intricate designs - and the chances are that when you take it online, you won't see a modified car like yours.But, that doesn't win races. Upgrading your engine, suspension, turbocharger, intercooler, bodywork and a whole host of other parts is what's required to do that. Along with a bit of tuning to the camber, tyre pressure, suspension stiffness and more. If you obtain a car that allows it, you can even swap out the entire engine for a better one to improve performance.The results of these changes can be viewed instantly, using Forza's \"out of ten\" system. Your car is given a score for acceleration; cornering, braking, top speed and rarity, with these updating instantly should you choose to buy a new part. Installing more custom parts increases the car's rarity, which in turn increases its value when you come to sell it back to the CPU, or if you take it online and flog it to another human player. The whole system is incredibly easy to use, and is as in-depth as you wish to make it. Cars don't have to be tuned, but if you want to squeeze an extra couple of miles an hour out of the engine and a little more grip on the corners from the tyres, then you can tweak all of the settings to get the car feeling just right. Paint and decals don't have to be applied, but having your own personal car when racing online - and knowing that nobody else has one that looks exactly like it - is a very cool feeling.The gameplay - thankfully - matches up. The game does move at a solid 30fps - which many have criticised - but you'll rarely notice it. Had the developers chosen to cram so much graphical flair into a game running at 60fps, we might be mentioning slowdown here, but we aren't. The game whips along at a stunning rate, and you won't notice the framerate at all. You'll be too busy trying to slice an extra split second off your lap time by riding an apex a little more than you should, or blocking off one of the fighting CPU AI drivers to stop them passing you, or brutally knocking you spinning on a corner. Make them mad and they'll begin nudging, pushing and taking more risks - just like you would. If you're bored of racing but still want to proceed through the game's offline structure, train a \"Drivatar\" and make them race for you - a bit like the B-Spec option of GT4. In this mode, you're rated on how well you take different types of corners, and this is then applied to your Drivatar. If you drive badly, he'll drive badly - simple as that.Playing in the game's career mode is also as customisable as you want it to be. If you're having trouble timing your turns, pop the \"Suggested Line\" option on and watch as it tells you where to brake, where to cruise and where to put your foot down - dynamically - meaning that the line changes to reflect your current speed. This, along with the optional traction control, stability control, damage type and opposition difficulty is all changeable. The penalty for setting these all to the easiest option is that you won't earn as much money for winning a race, with the opposite happening if you set them to the most difficult levels.Online, Forza Motorsport uses a modified Chess ranking system to grade players and find the best opposition for your race. The game slides along at breakneck speed and rarely suffers from lag or slowdown. PGR2 has also been unseated here.I know I'm not doing the game justice here, because there are simply so many things to talk about, that its impossible to get it all in without running over thirty thousand words.I haven't touched on many of the game's features, but they are best left for you to find. All you need to know is that if it was a poker hand, Forza would be a royal flush. If a football score, it would be a 7-0 win. As a game, it is the finest straight-up racing game to grace any home console system and as such, is an absolute must buy. I don't often say that a game has no flaws, but I certainly can't see any in Forza Motorsport.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2006"}

There's great varietyin scenery and level design.  Shooting foot soldiers and bugs is great fun, but I did not likebringing down machinery, be it a mech robot, turret or a goliath.  The boss battles are over the top, occassionally havea dramatic impact on gameplay and visual experience, but tend to get drawn out, making you wondor if you'reutilizing effective combat techniques.  The game can abrubtly end due to a team mate's death, as you don't get a cetain # oflives, but rather a battle gauge, which represents T-Energy.  Even though I was strictly single player for a while,I could tell this was a multiplayer-based game, as you rely on teamwork to keep machines running while under attack.Once you learn the game mechanics, the game grows on you.  The level design and graphics are decent.The cutscenes are entertaining if you're into that, but I'm glad you can skip them.  I you're playing online,all players need to desire them to be skipped, so you may get bored between scenes, but it may be a good opportunityto take a break.  I'm somewhat amazed the multiplayer community's still holding on, so play on!Despite it's flaws, Lost Planet 2 has redeeming qualities, being a sporadically fun 3rd person shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2011"}

The gameplay is so solid it could crush a rock, the fighting and the absorbing souls just keeps me so occupied I find myself just going back and killing the enemies again so I can do it all over again.  It has a lot of RPG elements, the more enemies you kill, the more souls you'll obtain, you use these souls to increase your weapons powers and even your armor.  Although I will say, the voice acting could have been much better, I find myself in the middle of a bad translation of a Bruce Lee movie, but other than that, I can ignore it.  It has a very deep story line and picks up right from where the last left off, only ten years later, you plays as Jubei, a new warrior, out to kill Nabunaga a demon lord who destroyed his home, now Jubei seeks revenge.  Controls are just like a Resident Evil title, so get used to it.  The graphics are nothing short of breath-taking, but the backgrounds are pre-rendured, but it doesn't show, Capcom really tried on this one, and they deserve all the credit for this masterpiece.  Good game, fun and you'll want to go through it again, but I'll admit it's a bit short 8-9 hours, but you'll want to go through it again to see other characters and to play as them.

It did not dissapoint, but it didnt blow me away either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2003"}

Of course Rockstar cuts us a break with the taxi cab missons,but THAT \"reward\" is far from \"rewarding\".Lastly,the radio station is there,but again,it's just not unique anymore.Also all the little verbal stabs and insults become annoying;one ad boasts \"become a cop and beat people whether they're getting on your nerves,or you're just drunk!\" Also the stale Lazzlo is back yet again,and one of hisquips is \"I just don't get as good of ratings as self-righteous rednecks\" Ha ha ha hee hee ho hum blah.Ah yes,and the story!You guessed it! It's pretty much the same.In a nutshell,gangster/thug/criminal comes into town and wants to place himself high on the dark underworld ladder.Kill, destroy do whatever to achieve this.That's fine and all,but so very unoriginal by now.Oh,and the hookers are back too and they're just as willing as ever.Yes,you can sleep with them for lack of a better term.-YAWN-I guess I'm just getting too old for this leisure now and it's time to start hanging this hobby up;these games are quickly losing their luster.If anything else,I'll stick with the classics and cherish those fond memories.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"This is an OLD REVIEW.","reviewText":"I made this a few days after release. [...]Here's my review on what is one of, if not the, biggest game and what some say the most overrated game, of all-time. I've only played it for about 6 hours, so I will probably be editing this review. This is my first impression. ( Note: I didn't play the beta. )Graphics: 4.5/5 Look quite good, but don't really blow you away. The character models for the most part look phenomenal, and the environments do as well. Still, it's not the most impressive looking game out there right now. Hell, to all the whiners, I'd rather have an okay looking game that runs smoothly than a fantastic looking game that lags a lot.Sound: 5/5 Top notch. The talking throughout your men in campaign is really well done. The voice acting in the cut scenes are also great. You will likely never hear the same thing twice in battle. The explosions and guns still sound fantastic too. Everything Halo 2 sounded like, but better.Control: 4.5/5 Not quite perfect. In my opinion, Halo 2 had better controls for a 360 controller. Still, Halo 3 doesn't control bad, but it does take some getting used to. Such as you having to learn how to use the RB button to get in vehicles and pick up guns and what-not, as well as reload, instead of using the X button used in Halo 2. Still controls very well though.Fun: 5/5 I must say, this game left a great first impression. I started with Campaign first, and was less than surprised at the start, mainly because the game kept on lagging. But once the game started going, the Campaign got pretty fun. And, in case you don't already know, you can have four person co-op, which makes Legendary quite a bit easier to play through. ( Still not a sinch in any stretch of the imagination though. ) I could review this game all day. The single player, co-op, Forge, multiplayer, all the maps, how the guns hold up, the AI, the ability to record your games, and what not. All I really need to say though, is it's worth it. There aren't many maps currently available to play on Halo 3, but just about all of them are a lot of fun. If you don't think they are at first, go ahead and play them a few times. The game looks good, controls great, and sounds fantastic. Almost everything about this game that I've seen so far is top notch.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2009"}

Great graphics, gameplay, story, and games that REALLY got you into the game.  Well, unfortuantly, every game in the world can't be a classic, as is the case here, but when I bought it, poped it in to my XBOX, and began playing...I couldn't stop!  It was fun, it was creative, and while it may not be the greatest game in the world, it was a game worthy of buying in my book.  Here's what I thought of Star Wars: Obi-Wan for the Microsoft XBOX:1) Gameplay: This game takes you through the life of Obi-Wan.  You start out on a planet of gang members, trying to stop them from killing your friends and co-workers.  You learn all of the sweet moves: Air jump, force grab (takes guns out of enemies hands), force push (knocks enemies on the floor or off cliffs), and force weapon (uses objects in the area like rocks, or crates, and rams them into enemies).  You'll also discover Obi-Wan can do back and front flips, and has one of the coolest toys in the world...a *LIGHT SABER*!  You walk around in a 3rd person view controlling Obi-Wan with the left thumb stick, and control the Light Saber (when you pull it out) with the right thumb stick.  And the control here is FLAWLESS!  Pushing to the right causes you to attack enemies in that direction, pushing up will bring his lightsaber to come crashing down on enemies.  Of course if your fighting someone else with a lightsaber, you have to block his attacks, use the force (literally), and get the hits in before your get killed yourself.  It's all very challenging and fun once u get farthur into the game...the coolest part being when u learn to THROW your lightsaber like a boomerang across the room, knock out a few guards, that have it fly back for more force flying, back-flipping, light clashing battle.Now, with these skills, you must somehow beat 15+ missions and help Obi-Wan save the world...again.  Very fun in the long run!And, once u beat the game, you can unlock new characters, arenas, and such for multiplayer.  I'll go into that later!2) Graphics: This is where the game failed.  There is no excuse for a game to lack graphics on the Microsoft XBOX.  They're better than most N64 games, maybe even most PlayStation games, but any system other than that could have supported this with no trouble at all!  To begin with, the faces of the people are...there.  They're choppy, small dots for eyes, beards are brown blocks, etc...  It's ugly!The worst part here, though, is all the freezing this game has.  It has major glitches.  If your in the middle of a big battle, things will start to slow down, the music and sounds will start to get choppy.  When a lot is going on, the framerate drops, and everything looks like a game that...in a word...stinks!  The graphics, for the most part, are pretty good.  But nothing has any detail.  There are no faces, no animals in the grass, no real living water.  And the framrate gets so choppy at times, you can't even play...really annoying.  Counsidering the power of the XBOX, all the glithces and lack of detail are in-excusable.  This game might have even worked on the N64, and in today's world, ladies and gentlemen, thats sad (especially on the XBOX).3) Multiplayer: Extremely fun.  As you progress through the game, you unlock characters and arenas to fight in.  While it's only for 2 players, it is pretty fun.  You can knock your openants down, fling objects into them, have light-saber battles, hop all over the place, fling your lightsaber like a boomerang, etc..  It's all fun and good, but 4 players would have been, in one word, AWSOME.  And the fact that they didn't include 4 players is just another blown effort.  This, with a little work, could have been a 5-star game.  But it seems like the makers got lazy toward the end, and just didn't add what could have been added.Overall, this is a great game, especially since you can soon find it on the &quot;*Platinum Hits*&quot; lineup (a group of games that, starting soon, you will be able to pick up for less then twenty bucks!).  It's a really fun game, and even the multiplayer is pretty cool.  More options here would have been better.Hopefully they'll make an Obi-Wan 2, and put the work into a good game, that could have made this a *CLASSIC* game.  A good game none the less, reccomended to all action gamers, and of course, *MAJOR* Star Wars fans.  This won't disapoint, as long as your not expecting greatness.Thx!obryanstars*","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2003"}

It&#x92;s your job as the mercenary mammal to find all the spellstones that will rejoin the splintered planet and defeat the evil General Scales. This entails much exploring of ancient temples and completing of subquests to help everything from Yorkshire-accented woolly mammoths to pterodactyls who've lost their babies.The game may lack the epic scale and endless invention ofZeldabut it has plenty of new ideas of its own, including a fully interactive dinosaur sidekick, some cool shoot-'em-up sections in Fox&#x92;s spaceship, and lots of ways to upgrade a magical staff--your weapon of choice when out of your ship. To add some icing to the cake, the graphics are absolutely amazing, particularly the superrealistic fur effects.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"and1homerun","summary":"Good deal, I guess...","reviewText":"Here's a quick synopsis:Graphics: 10/10- Really great graphics and animation, it can stand up against most games right now. Worlds are detailed and awe-inspiring.Sound/Music: 6/10- Decent. The music is okay, but nothing great. It gets old if your in one area for more than three or so minutes. Sound is good, but is the same everywhere. Water, hits, walking...always the same.Gameplay: 7/10- If you like Zelda, you'll probably like the gameplay. Except no tough puzzles or extensive dungeons (for some that's good, for others that's bad). The fighting is really cool the first few times but with only four (?) combos you can pull off (by pressing the control stick left, right, up, or nowhere) it gets boring. The gameplay is trying so hard to be good but falls short. It seems like a rush job. But if you really get into it, this game will immerse you for hours. If not, you'll be bored. I personally really had fun with this game, but the opinions of many of my friends tell me that my case might be an extreme one.Replayability (is that a word?): 5/10- Alright. If you really liked it you'll play it twice. It's very tedious in the beginning hwich may turn you off to playing it over. The secrets are absuloutly retarded. Half of them are weird messages from anonymous whoevers. You pay money for those by the way, they're not hard to get. I would say the best secret would be the ability to play the game in black and white. YES! I've always wanted to do that! I could just change my TV settings, but this is way cooler!Overall: Not fantastic, but still playable. It WAS originaly an N64 game, but was cancelled and Fox got stuck in it and got sent along to the Cube. For RareWare's last hurrah I am dissapointed. Buy it for 20 smackers. Renting is out of the question because you won't get a good sense of this game without beating it. The second half of the game is fantastic, I just wonder where the people who designed those last few levels were during the first ten hours of play...if you are willing to stick with this game until the end you will have a rewarding play experience. If not, you really won't. That's why I think younger players might not enjoy this, they just won't want to stick with it.I say buy it, for the price it's at. Buy it for Zelda fans, also. You won't find many better adventure games these days.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Chris Longhurst","summary":"Brilliant sequel - best played if you're in your 30's.","reviewText":"GTA: Vice City has been a long time coming, and now it's finally here, it's definitely worth the wait. There is only one problem with the whole game, and that is that if you were born after about 1970, you won't appreciate the radio stations. Being someone who was in their teens during the 1980's, I have a total flashback every time I play Vice City. The loud cars, loud clothes and classic 80's music round off an already brilliant game.If you're reading this in America, or playing the game there, you won't fully appreciate the opening sequence to GTA:Vice City. For those of you in England - you'll remember the ZX Spectrum and it's cassette-loaded games? Remember the 'load' command and the flashing neon screen that accompanied them? It's all here in intro to GTA Vice City. I laughed and laughed and laughed when I saw that little touch.The game is the same formula as GTA3. It's over-the-top, driving, violence, beat-em-up gangster territory with some hookers thrown in for good measure. It's every bit as reprehensible as GTA3 and every bit as enjoyable. This time it's set in Miami - or thereabouts. The game might as well be called Miami Vice except I doubt they could get the license for that. Either way, from the pink suits, to the Jan Hammer rift that happens at the end of a mission, this is clearly Miami Vice. Speaking of licenses, Rockstar have obviously used some of that loot from GTA3 here. There's licensed music from a broad spread of types, all from the 80's, including Jan Hammer, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Spandau Ballet and tons more. There's also big-name voice acting from Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Debbie Harry and tons more.The controls are the same as in GTA3 - why mess with something that worked so well? The cars are a lot more controllable. Gone are the boaty, wallowy 70's cars from GTA3. In come Ferraris, Porsches and BMWs. You can drive in any truck or car, as before. But now you can also hijack mopeds, scooters, bulletbikes, high-power powerboats, planes, helicopters  - just about any vehicle can become yours for the taking.The graphics for the scenery are brilliant. They mix the gaudy blue and pink neon of Miami Vice with the slummy suburbs of darkest Miami. Little touches like tyre tracks when burning out, and dust and dirt when off-roading add to the brilliance of the game. You get the same camera angles as before, and as in GTA3, when you hit a jump just right, you get the slow-motion 'action' camera. All too often in Vice City though, this results in you ending your jump in the sea or a canal. Either way it's still awesome fun.The gameplay is enhanced by far more ways to regain health and perform mini missions. You can deliver pizzas if you want. You can buy a burger if you want. Or you can fall back on the old classic - picking up a hooker for a quickie in the back of your car.The audio, as I've alluded to already, is brilliant. All big-name 80's tracks are present and the totally irreverant commentaries and talking heads are all here. From the commercial for Pet Stuffers to the little snippits about not needing talent to make music because we all now have synthesisers, anyone who lived through the 80's will find the audio a complete blast. For those younger players, they'll wonder what the rest of us find so funny about it all.To sum up : GTA Vice City is GTA3 and more. More guns, more violence, more vehicles, more missions, better graphics, better sound and overall more fun. Yes - fun. Remember - videogames don't promote violent behaviour - this just pure, unadulterated fun. Buy it now - go on - now!

The reason being is I didn't think tactical warfare strategy rpgs would interest me all that much. How I came across the game was I was looking for me a new game to play round Christmastime(as I was buyng myself a christmas present,lol). Most of the new games I wanted costed upwards of $40 at certain game shops so I looked for something more affordable. I didn't see anything that interested me except for this new Advance Wars game so I took a chance, like always, and bought the game. Now, I'm hopelessly addicted to the game. For those of you who don't know what Advance Wars is about, let me explain the game to you. Players are given command of an army of soldiers and take turns sending them into battle across maps. There are ground, air, and water units to which you must use strategy to pit them against the right units in battle. Defeat the right units and you move on to the next map and chapter of the story. The story itself is about a guy named Will who works his way out of rubble and finds that his world is in ruins because meteors hit the earth. Will is soon rescued by Captain Brenner and his group in search of other survivors. That's where things get interesting. To my understanding, Intelligent Systems changed things up quite a bit with this game of Advance Wars. Gone is the cutesy anime artistic style of the games of yesterday and in with a new more gritty realistic style. Gone are several of the vehicles from previous games and in are new vehicles like the anti-tank, the duster and the seaplane. Some vehicles can now be used to build units and structures, as well. Players will encounter several new types of terrain as they make their way across the devasted earth. I also hear that the ability to select different Commanding Officers during battle has been removed. While I've never played any of the previous games, this isn't too much of a problem with me. This is a more grownup Advance Wars although not too grownup that the younger set that enjoyed the previous games can't enjoy this one. Personally, I'd love to see Intelligent Systems push this new darker toned AW in their next game as I really love AW: Days of Ruin. So much so, I aim on rounding up their previous games in the meantime.Even if you're like me and not the  tactical warfare strategy rpg type, give this game a shot. You'll definitely love playing it.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking.

This was never meant to be a massive player online game. It was meant to be a phenominal single player FPS, and that it is. If you want a phenominal massive player online game, youll have to wait for Quake 4.2. My measily computer cant run the game? Yes... thats right, may want to consider upgrading. id Software was again up front months ahead of release. id is all about being cutting edge, they insist on pushing the envelope. You want great graphics and a fantastic physics engine that is better than anything else out there? You will need to upgrade the hardware to match the software. The same thing happened when the original DOOM was released. I bought a whole new computer just to play DOOM back then. Technology is that simple.3. This game steals from other games? Quite the contrary. FPS gaming was invented by id. Remember a title years ago called Castle Wolfenstein. Every FPS you play today was influenced by that title. FPS online play.... you can thank Quake for that. id is the father of FPS. All of these other titles borrowed from id to improve on the gaming experience. Now id, has done the same, and throws a few surprises in too. This is how the industry works... this is how it grows to give us better games. Furthermore, the engine id put together for this game is spectacular. This game not only looks better than FAR CRY but plays smoother too. Much better fps. You dont necissarily need a top of the line system to run it either (although you do need a midrange system: P4 1.5, 384 ram, 64mb video card), but you will lose out on some of the dazzling graphics the engine delivers. id is known for their awesome game engine creations.4. It's too dark... and why cant I hold my flashlight while I hold my gun? This was done on purpose. This game is supposed to scare the crap out of you. Its not too dark to see, but just dark enough so you dont know whats around the other corner. This game is supposed to be scary... this is one of the many ways id chooses to scare you. Added to the fear factor is the fact that you cant hold you flashlight and shoot at the same time. Very scary stuff shooting at a pair of red glowing eyes and not knowing what else could be coming to attack you in some of the darker areas of the game.So, take the critics with a grain of salt... and believe the hype. This game may cause you to wet your pants. Add the fact that id made the game and after you change your soiled underwear, youll want to go to church and pray... because this game is much closer to reality than any game has ever brought you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2004"}

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"\"How long do we have?\"","reviewText":"The Darkness isn't perfect. Like any game it has its weaknesses, and its downright flaws (and in one case, a game ending bug). However, I would be remiss if I let this game get away with things that I ding other games for, no matter how much I loved this game. However, the problems with this game are far outweighed by the successes of, and since that is the case, it is much easier to be lenient. Many more people have talked about why this game works (or why they think it doesn't) on a technical level, but this review is dedicated to the emotional one.Unlike virtually every other game being released these days, The Darkness actually has a very, very good story. I won't say it has a good plot, because it's really nothing we haven't seen before (Darkness powers aside). When you break it down, it really is a simple betrayal and revenge story.One of the things I've noticed I really hate is when the plot is sort of an afterthought. And the prime example of this kind of game is the Bioshock franchise. Now, both Bioshock games are fantastic shooters, two of my favorites, actually. But there really is no plot to either one of them. The plot is much more \"Find the audio recordings and find out why Rapture failed,\" as opposed to whatever half-brained plot they came up with so they could have awesome gun and plasmid battles.So that is the main reason why I love The Darkness. Because the action is built around the story, and not the other way around. You know exactly why you are doing the things you are doing, and there is no wasted motion. There are side missions you can do for certain NPC's, but you don't have to, meaning that you aren't forced to do pointless filler missions to extend the gameplay length. Every story arc in this game is deliberate.One of the other positive things about this game is the scale. The game doesn't try to overextend itself. It exists in its own self-contained universe. Even though you know it takes place in a small corner of New York City, the game feels big enough that you don't feel stifled, but large and varied enough that you can do some exploring if you want to.Now, like I said before, the story is really nothing new aside from the Darkness powers you gain. But it the characters in that story are rich and well-defined, if at time a bit stereotypical. The characters in the story aren't manic and insane like in the Grand Theft Auto games, or boring and one-dimensional like in Mass Effect (even though there is a lot of inter-character dialog, the NPC's don't ever do anything unexpected). The characters feel (and look!) real. The Darkness also has what is possibly the greatest conveyance of real romance in any video game ever made.All of these things, the gritty New York streets and subway system, the characters that seem to come alive, and emotionally gripping backstory really engage you in the story, and make you care about what is going to happen to all of these characters. The game rips your heart out, and leaves you to put your character back together, if there is a together to go back to.One last thing: The cover art for the game, while obviously keeping in line with the look and style of the comics by Top Cow, are an unfortunate side effect. Maybe people who read the comics appreciate it, but it is the one single thing that almost kept me from buying this game. It looked too cheesy, that coupled with the description (Darklings? That doesn't sound fun at all!) made it seem to me to be a light and simple game where you just use your darkness powers for anything you want. The game is anything but simple, so don't let the cover art fool you. Search the web for in-game stills and videos to see what a visually stunning game this is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004WLRQMI","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Twilight Princess is Awesome","reviewText":"I loved this game.  It is a lot of fun, and it is huge, with 9 dungeons and a huge area to explore.  The dungeons are pretty challenging, too, which I enjoyed.  This game has similar locations to \"Ocarina of Time\", but they felt a lot more real in this game.  For example, Hyrule Field is no longer one big, pretty much empty, boring area.  Now it is huge and has a better layout, with more things to check out.  The game also has much better graphics than previous games.  It also has a fairly interesting story, and the character that gives you advice in this game, Midna, is one of my favorite \"Zelda\" characters ever.  She has a fun personality and plays an important role in the story.  Unfortunately, I don't think she is very helpful.  It doesn't seem like she even tells you about enemies.One thing different about this game is that Link can turn into a wolf.  As a wolf, you can dig, smell things, and use your senses to see things you can't see as a human, which I think is fun.  This game also has some new items, but I'll let you find out what they are on your own.  (But, my favorite item ever is in dungeon number 7....)  There are also new sword skills Link can learn, which makes fighting more fun, plus you can fight while riding on your horse.I have to admit, though, that I don't think the game is quite as fun at first.  (And I wasn't a big fan of the parts of the story with the kids.)  But, once you get a few dungeons into the game, it gets better.  So if you buy it and don't like it at first, give it a chance.I've played it on both consoles, and in case you're wondering which console to buy it for, it depends on if you like motion controls or regular button controls.  And if you mind the whole Wii version being flipped to make Link right-handed.  Either way, though, I think it's a pretty good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","summary":"PS3 160GB vs. 320GB vs. the Move Bundle","reviewText":"PS3 VS. OTHERS :)Ever since the launch of Slim, the PS3 has been undertaking a quiet revolution or... could it be the console's midlife rebound? :) Here's what happened recently - and I will only note the more important developments going 12 months back (writing this in Oct., 2010):- NetFLIX streaming, now disc-less, 1080p, 5.1 surround sound- Much larger disk- Move- 3D gaming- Blu-ray 3DThis is a lot of new 'stuff' for a 4 year old console. I am not going to go into bean-counting mode and compare the PS3 improvements with what we see at the other guys but, clearly there is a lot of life in the PS3 and, with the 320GB models, the PS3 continues to maintain the largest disk advantage over the competition, is the only Blu-ray console and, when you consider the services and the array of Sony-made and third party peripherals built around it, the PS3 is a well built, well rounded entertainment hub.THE 320GB MODELOver the past year or so, Sony added to the original 120GB 'Slim' model, itself a greatly optimized and streamlined PS3, several submodels sporting larger disks: 160GB, 250GB and, with the Move launch, the 360GB version. You can view this model as the original Slim with a three times larger disk or, if you want to take a more recent point of reference, the PS3 Move bundle without the Move.DECIDING WHICH MODEL TO BUYI happen to own thePlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundlemodel myself in addition to an upgraded 60GB 'classic' model - our current Blu-ray/DVD player and overall media center - and the Move bundle. We also owned the original 120GB Slim at one time and, before each purchase the main decision wasn't whether to buy a PS3 but rather which model was best suited to our needs.At the time I'm writing this (November 2010) there are 4 basic models to choose from but, since the 250GB sells for the same price as the 320GB, it's safe not to discuss it so the 3 basic options are:A - 160GB model: the original Slim with a slightly larger disk, lowest price, same as the original launch SlimB - 320GB model: sells for $50 more than the 160GB, offers double the storage (this model)C - 320GB Move bundle: for an extra $50 it adds the basic Move peripherals, plus a Move game, same large diskDepending on what your needs are, one of the 3 should make more sense than the other.OPTION AIf 'price' is an issue go for this one. The good thing about the PS3 is that it's possible to upgrade the initial disk to a larger one later. I'm not going to go into detailed accounting but, if you can reuse or maybe sell the original 160GB disk, upgrading this model to 500GB can be done at very little cost. Some basic technical skills will be needed.This is the choice for anyone who absolutely NEEDS 500GB (rather than 320GB).OPTION BThose who can use the extra storage - intense gamers or anyone planning to keep thousands of songs and photos on their PS3, are okay with 320GB and therefore don't want to go through the disk upgrade process should go with THIS MODEL. $50 for double the disk capacity is a fair deal in my view.This model makes a lot of sense if you don't care about the Move.OPTION CThis is the model I picked because we wanted to have the Move option. It's the best way to enter the Move world at this time. The extra $50 will buy you:* Move motion controller, of course* PlayStation Eye camera (must have one for the Move to work)* Sports Champions (Ping Pong is simply awesome, some of the games play much better with a second controller)* A demo disc so you can see what Move can do for you (most of the demos can be downloaded from the PSN)Given that the price difference over the 'plain vanilla' 320GB model is the price you pay for the Move controller, you basically get the PS3 Eye camera and the Sports Champions game for free - and you can sell the camera if you already have one and the shrink-wrapped game if you have no use for it.In fairness and based on my own experience, you will almost certainly end up buying a second Move motion controller. You may also want a separate charger so keep these in mind when budgeting. But, regardless, this is still the best Move starter.DOES DISK SIZE STILL MATTER?Probably not as much as it used to. In my view, 320GB is probably enough storage to last till the PS4 comes around - and I'm one who did upgrade his original PS3 to 500GB.You can store an enormous amount of photos, songs, demo games, home videos and game installations on 320GB. Two years ago I thought that 500GB were making a lot of sense because movies needed so much space but, since then, the pressure to having huge disks installed on a PS3 lessened a little due to the advent of technologies such as NAS (network attached storage) and Home Servers that allow you to have thousands of GB worth of 'media' stored safely off your PS3 and streamed in when needed. And, of course, Netflix streaming eliminates the need to save many thousands of movies if the somewhat lesser quality is not a big issue. Not everyone may agree but I have no plans to replace the 320GB disk with a larger one at this time.WHAT ELSE YOU MAY WANT/NEEDDepending on how you are planning to use the PS3, this is what you don't get but may end up buying eventually:- HDMI cable for HD output (a component cable should work too but you can get a decent HDMI for $3-5 or so)- One or more extra USB wires same as above, don't pay more than $2-3 for one- One more Move Controller if you buy the Move bundle (some games will either require two controllers or will play better with two)- One or two Navigation Controllers (no big pressure because you can use the DualShock in your left hand but it feels weird)- Dedicated charger, especially if you have more than one Move controller or you also have a Navigation controller- PS3 TV remote controller to use when watching moviesMY RATINGI just love the PS3. I've been a PS3 owner ever since the 60GB classic became available and I've been impressed with the PS3's reliability, versatility and its sheer power - and I've owned both 'classic' and 'slim' models, upgraded most, gave away a couple. In the end it's a matter of personal taste but the PS3 is increasingly the most popular 'gaming' or 'entertainment' implement in our household. And we DO own an Xbox too.I will not go through the long list of PS3's features. It would be an exaggeration to say that it does 'everything' but it does a lot and it's doing it increasingly well. Agreed, features and capabilities do not come for free and sometimes they don't even come cheap (see my list of possible add-ons above) but I can't say that I have the feeling of being constantly nickeled and dimed when I upgrade my PS3 or I buy a Sony-made or a third-party add-on. I have no choice at this time but to order the extra Move and Motion controller from Sony but the charger, the larger disks I used to upgrade my old classic, all of the cables, the headset and so on came or will come from third party vendors and even for the old SixAxis and the remote controller there were alternatives at the time I decided to buy the Sony-made ones. In addition, the 'basic' PS3 console can take you pretty far as it is and you can have a lot of fun without having to spend one extra penny.To conclude, any of the 3 options get 5 stars because the PS3 continues to be being the most feature-rich, well-balanced console you can get these days-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}

After completing you can go back in \"free play\" mode and play the levels as any unlocked character, which you must in order to get all the goodies.  I was a bit worried that after completing a level I would not want to go back, but that's not the case at all.  It's enough fun that you really want to achieve the goals.

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Great !","reviewText":"I really enjoyed this game. Things have moved on a lot since the original game, yet strangely enough the very first Tomb Raider game still got so many things right. What's changed is the very strict rules about what can or can't be climbed or jumped. Remember how so many things were measured in the length of a block and a running jump? Those days are gone. Well they have been for a long time now, but this latest game is the slickest at making it feel like Lara can do anything ...if you just work out what to do and control her the right way.So, yes this is now the definitive \"origins\" game, and it does a great job. Lara's whole backstory has been re-invented, although the basics are pretty much the same, but the adventure she finds herself in is totally new. The plot goes something like this: young Lara (not yet a \"tomb raider\") is on a ship bound for exploration, and the ship ends up wrecked with the survivors flung all over a mysterious island. Lara begins by gradually learning skills and finding weapons, eventually upgrading both to become a leaping, bounding all-action super heroine, but that part is  LONG way off when the game starts. What I really liked was the role played by Lara herself. This is an incredibly good characterization. Lara's appearance, actions and vocal performance are great. Theres no pneumatic supermodel figure here, and she spends a lot of the game bruised and bloody, but this works perfectly as this is survival in a hostile environment. The gradual accumulation of hunting skills and weapons is pitched at the right speed, and not only that, you can feel Lara's personality changing as well. The vocal work is really very good.The locations are all amazingly created. Boundries around the playable area are well disguised. Everything that Lara can walk on or jump on lends itself to the possibility of being a platform...sometimes she can stand on things that provide no benefits for jumping etc...and why not? The world is uneven, so she can walk around anywhere she is able. Amusingly, ledges or steps that can be gripped or grabbed are still \"painted\" a bit whiter than things that cannot be grabbed. But sometimes, well, you do need a bit of help. But apart from that the scenery is extremely natural looking, and quite stunning. There are lots of high up places and perilous drops in this game, with some beautifully scary ruined temples later on that have gale force winds constantly blowing through them, which looks fantastic.Because of the high level of danger and dark spaces, the game actually now resembles Resident Evil somewhat, especially in the viewpoint you play from (behind Lara), and the weapon aiming modes. But the climbing, swinging, dropping and leaping are definitely pure Tomb Raider, and they are all very well implemented. The weapons are great fun, and the combat is pretty good - this part of the game is a good challenge. All the enemies are smart enough to come back at you with aggression and use defensive tactics whenever they need them. Be a clever fighter! You can choose your own fighting style, from sniping to close up assault, and the enemies react accordingly. Most of the enemies are human in this game (plus some local wildlife), so don't expect anything other-wordly to come after you. No Centaurs or Abominations here.  Strangely enough there are no \"bosses\" at all in the game, apart from the odd exceptionally tough big enemy that you encounter from time to time, but I cannot think of more than two times when this happensSo once you get into the game play proper, it really doesn't let up. A mix of exploration, hiding, combat and puzzle solving keep you busy and entertained. At first I thought some of the game was a bit easy, as there is nothing that's incredibly hidden - but that's just the plot progress. What is hidden is that there are mini games that you won't know about until you stumble on them by accident. I'm saying nothing..but exploration and experimenting will reward you  - as it always has in Tomb Raider. There's a percentage completion figure against every location map, and hardcore players can revisit areas to look for missed items throughout the game before finishing it - a  very generous feature on behalf of the designers.There's lots to enjoy here, and the game seems really well thought through. I never got trapped or stuck somewhere that seemed unfair, and a late game feature which allows you to link far apart places up by means of ropes made for lots of exploration possibilities. By the time I had finished it, I had had a thoroughly good time. I would definitely buy a sequel from the same team that made this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2013"}

Yeah, Wii Sports was fun for a couple months, but once you figure out the Wiimote, you realize it's really not very sensitive, and you can manipulate it so that you can bowl a perfect strike every time in bowling, or hit homeruns in baseball almost every time, and then the boxing game is just plain broken the controls are so bad.  When you see all of the PS2 ports getting thrown on Wii, instead of the games going to ps3 and 360, you really start to wonder about the Wii.  Then when you play those ports with tacked on motion controls, the gimmick of it all really starts to hit home.  I found waggling the controller from side to side in Zelda to be just plain dumb and annoying.  Oh, and did I mention the pointer functionality with the sensor bar just plain sucks.  It works for absolute garbage.To sum it up, I wish I never bought this thing.  I play my PS3 every day, and this thing hasn't been turned on in three months now.  BTW, the PS3 motion controls seem to actually be more accurate to me, and the shape of the PS3 controller lends itself well to flying and driving games, which is really the only good use of motion control I've seen yet.  The Wiimote does not lend itself to flying and driving games because of its shape.  It feel very awkward driving or flying with the wiimote tilted on its side.My advice, pony up and buy a PS3, it's a much better value, and most importantly the games are a lot better.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2007"}

Herzog","summary":"Good concept, with repetitive execution","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed is a very fun game, but suffers from some very repetitive game play.  The game typically works like this: you get a mission, go to an area, are required to find clues to your ultimate target.  this is the repetitive portion, as they are basically the same mission, pick pokcet, intimidate, or ease drop.  There's a few alternates, but not very many.  Once enough clues are found, the real mission begins.  These are quite similar to the hitman series, with a few choices of how to kill the target.  Each death ends with more story, and then back to get another mission. While I wouldn't call the game great, I would say the game is very good.  Despite doing the same thing over and over, I was entertained the entire time.  I look forward to playing the sequel, and see if they can diversify the game.  In the meantime, this budget priced game is excellent and worth a look.  Give it a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

When I saw the Nintendo 64 controller, I nearly puked.  The joystick in the middle didn't make any sense to me.  I looked at the GameCube controller, and wasn't exactly impressed.  It looked kinda goofy-asymmetric, maybe.Well, when I finally picked one up, I found that it fit my hands much better than the PS models.  This would be my favorite controller if Nintendo changed a few things.1.  The Z button is too hard for me to reach.2.  The C joystick and the D pad are in awkward positions.Fortunately most games don't really force you to use these much, but if you're going to put buttons on a controller, make them all easily accessible.  Due to these flaws, I can't really say it's better than the PlayStation's design.  They're probalby tied.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2005"}

When Gauntlet came out for the Nintendo, I bought it immediately and played it non stop for hours and hours. I came across G:DL when it was first released and without examining the box much at all, it was MINE. Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed!This is the first game we played with more than two people on our Playstation 2 - we bought the MultiTap explicitly for this game. It's a blast! And the improvements are astounding. First off, you get up to eight main characters. I have always loved the archer, but I play the others at times too. As you move them up levels, their appearance changes, they get cool familiars, their spells get more powerful, they learn new abilities, they get to heal, and much more.The levels are both familiar and fascinating. Just wait until you get into the Jester's world! The Escher-like levels are phenomonally fun. Someone really had a good mastery of space to develop those worlds. The other graphics are equally as interesting. The music and monsters all fit well with the worlds.It's not just hack and slash. There are a lot of puzzles, a lot of what-do-you-use-keys-on, a lot of mazes and memory and combinations involved. There are even hidden characters, additional SECRET characters and other hidden things that it's taken a ton of replaying to get a walkthrough written.

The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date.

What a Great Game!","reviewText":"I've been a gamer for a long long time. For decades I was a PC gamer, and I still am to an extent. My wonderful, beautiful, and thoughtful wife gave me a PSP last year for my birthday. Never having used or played any of the consoles, I was unfamiliar with the controls, but I liked the idea of the portability of the PSP. I played the two Tomb Raider games that are available, and enjoyed them enough. I also played Indiana Jones - Staff of Kings, and liked that as well. But after that I found myself starving for something to play, and raided my sons room on a clean up spree. He had Untold Legends, so I played it. I loved that game a lot, it was right up my alley, and nice and long so it took forever to play through. Upon completing that game twice, once as a knight and once as a druid, I again found myself starving for something good to play. So I started some research, and came across God of War with all of its outstanding reviews. As long as the character control was totally analog stick I was good to go.I have just completed my first run through this great game. WOW, the only thing I can say is that all of the positive reviews were dead on. Outstanding graphics, breathtaking panoramas, perfect art work, superb music score, outstanding sound affects, and absolutely perfect character control and camera angles & control. The folks at Edios should take a lesson on the character control and camera angles & control from these developers. I'm not going to go into great detail here as there is already enough of that on the net. I'm just going to say that I've not had more enjoyment out of playing a game before, and it deserves to be said so all can see. I was taken in by all of the sensual goodies built perfectly into this game. The scenes, artwork, sounds, play action, all just fit together so perfectly. Game play was challenging, yet forgiving where it needed to be. The designers didn't decide to play games and make already difficult areas and actions that much harder with bad controls, and camera angles. If your not familiar with these type of console controls, play on Easy mode first and get used to them. I'm still rusty and found myself hitting incorrect buttons during most of the mini-games. I will improve with time. The only real challenge for me was the final boss fight. Naturally its supposed to be tough, but my inability to work the controls well played against me for a while. Eventually, I got it, obviously, and was able to beat the game. One thing that I absolutely LOVED about this game besides the outstanding character control, and camera angles was the fact that if you died during a difficult part, instead of taking you back to the last save point, it took you back to your last checkpoint during that event. So for example, if you were doing the last boss fight and got to the point like I did where your half way through and died, when you restarted, you were at the beginning of that particular part of the boss battle, you didn't have to go back and start from the beginning. An excellent way to design the game. Thank You!Of course the game has more playability as once you beat it on any of the lower difficulty levels, you unlock God mode and that gives you three more levels again to play, plus you start unlocking challenges which are sort of mini-levels. I cannot wait to get back into the fray on the next levels and see how I do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

Dozens of one-star reviews.  No, I thought.  This can't be the same game I just played.  But it is, and I'm here to tell you all these guys that are bashing the game are seriously screwed up in the head.  Quite simply, this game is amazing.  It's better than I dared to hope.  We're talking about the Resident Evil 5 engine being adapted to a small handheld device.  Make the best of a bad situation, right?  Well, Capcom did much more than that.  This game plays beautifully and looks great, either with or without the 3D effect.  In fact, if I may be so bold, I would go so far as to say that the gameplay aspect of it is actually better than the console version of Resident Evil 5.  The gameplay is more balanced, picking up and using items is much less of a pain, it's easier to aim at enemies, and overall the gameplay isn't as frustrating as the console Resident Evil 5.  The menu interface is beautifully done.  There are a bunch of characters to unlock, including costume changes.  This iteration of the RE franchise  features something never before done in a Resident Evil game:  a skill system with which the players can level up characters.  Based on how well you play, you can unlock certain skills which you can apply to your characters.  It's pretty cool.My guess is the main reason people are complaining about it is they expected a fully fleshed-out story mode, which Mercenaries is not (and anyone with any experience in the RE games should know that).  The player runs through a series of combat scenarios against zombies, which get progressively more difficult.  The whole idea is to collect time bonuses and kill as many zombies as you can to score points, get high ranks, and unlock skills and achievements.  It's great fun.The main compliant I have about the game is the trainer guy who constantly talks to you through your headset.  Everything he says is displayed in subtitles at the bottom of the screen, and you cannot turn these subtitles off.  They obscure the players view for the first minute or so of every level, and it's really annoying.  Other than that, I've been having quite a good time with this game.If you're a Resident Evil fan, get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

I played the original Super Smash Bros on Wii Virtual Console, and what a fun time I had. I almost rented Melee on Gamecube... but I skipped it for Sonic Gems Collection (bad idea). Considering that Gamestop stopped selling Gamecube games, I decided to go ahead and get Brawl on Wii. I put the disc in, cut the game on, and got the biggest shock of my life. I was pointing my Wii remote at the TV, but nothing was happening. When I put in a game specifically labeled \"Wii\" I expect to be able to operate the interface by pointing and clicking. It is one of my favorite parts of Wii. I started a battle and found out the shocking fact that you can not play Smash Bros with 2 buttons. I quickly dragged out an old Gamecube controller and plugged it into the Wii. With the control issue solved, I began playing. Story mode was interestig with a lot of laughs, but after a cutscene or two the began a horrible 2D beat-em-up. It was beyond boring and really annoyed me. I tried the other modes... online mode worked well enough and I liked collecting trophies, but quick fights were pretty sad. The Nintendo 64 seemed to have outdone the Wii when it came to fighting. Yeah, Brawl has more characters, areas, and better graphics, but I can still remember those epic fights between me and my cousin. I would use Donkey Kong to pick her sad little Kirby and throw him as far as the game could render. I'm sure Donkey Kong can still do that, but something feels missing from the battles that made the Nintendo 64 version a lot of fun.

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

I'd have to say this is one of the biggest improvements in a annual sports game that I've ever seen. The graphics are amazing and the game-play is smoother, a lot smoother. The game is not perfect by any means. Although the My Player mode is improved it's still needs work as it still feels like I'm running in mud but not nearly as bad as 2K10. Still no My Player contract which doesn't make sense to me but whatever. This is a huge step for 2K Sports and it shows why they are the leader in the NBA games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"theboombody","summary":"Difficult","reviewText":"I had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game.  It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent.There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2005"}

The most robust DDR title ever, this is the definitive version of the game, and has gamers jumping to their feet with more than 65 songs, including licensed tracks and international dance hits. The power of the PlayStation2 enables full-motion music videos and high-resolution graphics. Game modes include an edit mode, which allows players to customize their dance routines, and a workout mode that tracks calories burned during play.","reviewerName":"Dennis Laycock","summary":"This is *not* DDR MAX, but it's still a great game","reviewText":"DDR MAX, in the arcades, was the 6th version of the popular dance game, and contained all new songs. Almost none of those songs from the arcade version are in this version. That is disappointing.However, there's very little to be disappointed about in this game in itself. The first thing I noticed is that the PS2 engine makes the arrows scroll much more smoothly than they do in the PSone versions. Also, the FMV backgrounds are very cool, and the interface is far easier to use.The music selection is much more varied than in the first two home versions of DDR, though I'm not ready to say it's better. Some songs are incredible, including old DDR classics like Rhythm and Police and Gentle Stress, newer classics like Healing Vision Angelic Mix, Exotic Ethnic and Max 300, and new licensed songs like Take It to the Morning Light. Some hideous songs are included too, such as Celebrate, I'm For Real, Gambol, 22 Dunk... songs that could have been replaced by the many, many DDR classics that have never been on a U.S. home release.Many songs have creative little tricks that make them more interesting than the Konamix songs, such as more tempo changes and stops. For example, in the song \"Healing Vision Angelic Mix,\" the arrows, scrolling very quickly, suddenly halt completely for one beat, then keep moving. Once you know where the stops are, they're quite fun to play.The freeze arrows, where you have to hold a certain arrow for a length of time, also make the game interesting, as sometimes they force you to spin around on the pad, face away from the screen or use one leg to tap several buttons in a row.I am slightly annoyed by the inclusion of several songs from Konamix (Matsuri Japan, Healing Vision, Era, Baby Baby Gimme Your Love, Holic, etc.), because most likely anyone who buys this game already has Konamix. Other songs are repeated (Cutie Chaser, Look to the Sky, etc.), but these are new mixes and have new steps, so that's acceptable.If you buy this game, do not, I repeat, do not buy the [...] pads available in stores. Order them online. If you buy soft pads, make sure they are the type that have a zippered compartment for padding on the inside...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2002"}

It pretty much has held the title for the entire 14 years of the series (it's still a little early to judge Madden 2005)and has really improved with the release of each year's title.  However, there are those who have probably wanted a game that plays just about the same as Madden, but don't always have the $50/$60 to pay for it.  Luckily, Sega have found the game that can take care of the little problem and try to knock Madden off the top of the heap:Say hello to NFL 2K5, and who better to team up with for this year's version of the game than the worldwide leader in sports, ESPN.ESPN NFL 2K5 might make some hardcore gamers wary since it was released with a $20 price tag (and be honest, we have all played a really BAD $20 game at least once), but this game really does give you your money's worth.  There are definitely vast differences between ESPN NFL and Madden, but there are things in ESPN NFL 2K5 that EA Sports would say that they wished they had added for Madden 2005.One unique thing is the VIP, which is somewhat similar to the EA Sports Bio file that is created by all EA Sports games.  It gives you credits over the course of time that you spend playing your game or, in case you have the Hard Drive attached to your PS2, takes time to imitate as if you were playing against real-time friends and rivals.  This was cool to me, as was the fact that you get a chance to play against teams created by popular celebs like Jamie Kennedy and Carmen Electra.THe only downsides I found were that ESPN isn't really as graphically or audibly equal to Madden as there are times the sound will somewhat break and cut in at unexpected times, and the graphics are good, but not really something to totally crow about.  Also, it would have blown me away if the game would have made the pre-game, halftime, and post-game shows look like an episode of SportsCenter indtead of NFL Sunday Countdown.All in all, maybe Madden may be top dog in the pound for now, but he had better watch out for ESPN trying to take away the bone for those gamers who want a game that doesn't nearly require an arm and a leg to buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"A Star Wars Game That Meets Expectations, Mostly","reviewText":"Well, this was the first of what I hope will be many rentals from Gamefly. In mentioning that, I will say that \"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed\" is a short game as I beat it over about 3 days, as renting kind of puts you into a fast-paced mode so you can get to your next rental.Pros:1. Interesting storyline occurring between Episodes III and IV, with very well animated cut-scenes, some of the best I have seen in a next-gen game. (Check out the detail on the skin and faces of the characters or the shiny look of Vader's armor.)2. You start out the game in a tutorial mode playing as Darth Vader. He has all force powers and skills and is basically invincible.3. The game does have some leveling up elements to help you create a unique character, but really, it is more of a novelty.4. The graphics are excellent and will have you pausing to look at scenery, backgrounds, characters and the use of the Havok physics engine means that objects are destroyed in epic glory with pieces going everywhere.5. The number of costumes is great for your character and the ability to change lightsaber colors and crystals is nice.6. The number of character types is great and diverse. (You will meet everything from a regular jawa to stormtrooper to Imperial officer to Rancor to Jedi.)7. The AI in the boss battles is very effective.Cons:1. It is a short game and honestly there isn't much replayability. (There's two endings and you can easily restart the last chapter and beat it again in the alternate manner to get the other ending.)2. The camera is basically free roaming and user-controlled, though at times the angles are obscured by objects in the background, which makes platforming (and there is quite a but) difficult.3. The controls are average, but the most frustrating is the gripping control. Sometimes it grips and other times it does not. (One stage you are to rip Tie Fighters out of the sky and avoid their fire at the same time... Well, in order to grip you must be facing forward for it to \"auto-target\" the Tie Fighter--great in theory, but you then take enemy fire and die pretty quickly.4. Jumping can be frustrating as the character often \"slides\" automatically off higher elevations. There were some \"holocrons\" and power ups I just gave up on because I died too many times trying to jump over to their location.5. The music was classic Star Wars but was for some reason way too soft compared to sound effects.6. The AI for some opponents is lacking. (I stood next to a stormtrooper and then walked around him for like 10 seconds and he didn't even shoot. Only time in the game it happened, though.)Overall, if you are a third person fan and a Star Wars fan this is a must buy or must rent. I would rate it up there with the last great Star Wars game: \"Star Wars: Battlefront II.\"4/5 Stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2009"}
