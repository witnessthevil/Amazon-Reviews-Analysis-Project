{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"Average Joe \"Average Joe\"","summary":"Its 2004, but...","reviewText":"...I'm going to review this game anyway.

{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Lots of potential","reviewText":"My biggest problem with this game is that it is so impersonal to the player. The only actual gameplay in this game is the driving and the shooting, and they're both pretty lackluster. The driving engine is exactly the same as Grand Theft Auto, meaning that it is serviceable, but very floaty. The only difference is that no cars explode, and it's much harder to run over any pedestrians. One of the more annoying results of reusing the engine, is that the police siren works exactly the same as the other game, meaning that when it's on only the cars in your lane move just a little bit to the right, even if you're to the right of them. This is fine in GTA when you hardly ever drive Police cars, but in this game you're a cop and I really think they should have adjusted this. Furthermore, with the driving, you are severely punished for any destruction you cause when driving, even when chasing a perp. Multiple times I had one to even three stars taken away from my case rating because of my driving, and I wasn't trying to drive crazy. The shooting is very simplistic and easy, however it does make you feel like a badass cop. You should normally stay behind cover and pick off the stupid AI, though you can run and gun since you have a large amount of health/stamina (although I don't think they have bullet proof vests back then). The rest of the game is really just a vehicle for the story. I generally wouldn't mind if it's done really well, but this game's story has been done many times before. It also generally fails to make the player feel for the characters. You never really learn who your character is (other than a few military flashbacks that I found annoying) you don't even see his family until the wife kicks him out over essentially a rumor. When the game ends, it was just so cheap what happened, and yet I really didn't care about it, which really makes me feel the developer failed. With the amazing graphics, the developer had a chance to make you feel emotions about the character, but I guess the story/dialogue writers didn't have the capabilities to do it.The other gameplay revolves around interrogating people, searching for clues, and a lot of chasing on foot. For the interrogating, it is interesting, but it is just way too simplistic. Your only options are truth, doubt, and lie, and many times the lines between the three are blurred. At times, you're supposed to select truth, when you can tell they aren't telling the whole truth. Other times you have to select doubt when you know they are lying but don't have enough proof. And you have to be careful when you select lie, because sometimes when multiple items seem like they'd work, you're only supposed to use one. What I'd love to see is a more in depth conversation/interrogation system, maybe along the lines of the Mass Effect games. As it stands in this game, I almost felt like I was just the intuition of the character, I wish I had more choices so I could feel like I was taking part in the interrogation. It's also frustrating that you can't go back to questions in some sort of way if you screw one up, being a perfectionist, I repeatedly had to go back to the main menu to retry the whole interrogation. This problem is exacerbated when none of the very long conversations can be skipped, you just have to sit through them. It's also incredibly unrealistic that the maximum amount of questions you ask a one time in the game is four (or maybe five). How can you convict someone with four simple questions that you can never repeat again searching for more depth.Searching for clues is another aspect of the game that fell short, as it really just boils down to running around waiting for your controller to rumble. The most annoying part of this was that it rumbled for certain mundane items the exact same way as items important to your case. I would love for the intuition system to be further expanded, there's a lot of potential there. For example, instead of rumbling when you're right next to the object, you could maybe have some sort of hot/cold hints, where the rumbling occurs when facing towards the object, with the intensity increasing the closer you get.The foot chases are the final really annoying gameplay, and while I know it's said that everyone runs, it's annoying how it works. As an example, near the beginning of the game there is a mission where when you've finally cornered the fat old movie producer, he leads you on a chase where it's impossible to catch him until you're supposed to. A military man in his prime is slower than a fat old guy, just because the developers had a scripted chase set up. These scripted chases on foot and in the car occur throughout the game (especially in the side missions), and even when you can catch up with the perp, it's because it's scripted that way.The final problem with the game I'm going to describe, is that for certain cases, no matter what you do, you still can only get it wrong. In those cases I managed to find all of the clues and get all the correct questions in the interrogations, yet in the end there was still no definitive proof to charge either of the perps. Also, in both cases I felt like one person was more likely to be the guilty party, but the game punished you for charging him and rewarded you for charging the other guy. I assume this is some commentary on the justice system back then (as the people you were supposed to charge were a pedophile and a communist), but for the player it is frustrating and for me absolutely ruined any replayability. I could possibly have accepted it if they drove home the police politics further, for example having more pressure from the higher ups to charge the person they want. I just feel like the game was saying I did something wrong, when in almost all of the missions (especially at the homicide desk) the person you arrested was innocent, I just don't understand it. I've never been punished in a game for doing something perfect, maybe the closes example to this is when there are battles in RPG's that are impossible to win, and I always hated them. :)In the end, I did generally enjoy the game while I was playing it, but it was just very flawed. I'd love to see a sequel to this game that fixes all of my issues with it. I just wish there was more of a game to this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

Raillard","summary":"Madden needs some competition...","reviewText":"I've been playing Madden since the very beginning, and unfortunately, since EA established a virtual monopoly by purchasing the rights to the NFL a few years back, the game has stagnated.  Sure, the graphics get a bit prettier every year (nothing drastic, though), sure the physics engine improves a bit (especially this year), but it seems that the folks at EA feel the need to implement one big gimmick each year.  This year, it's \"Connected Careers\", which combines previously available modes into one (superstar and franchise) online/offline mode.  The very, very bad news?  Franchise mode, the staple of the Madden franchise for many players, is gone.  That's right, if you want to build, develop and run your favorite team year-in year-out, you... can't.  The career mode forces you to choose between player and coach, and in player mode, you ONLY play as your chosen player.  Moreover, this game suffers from bloated, slow menus.  The load times in this game are horrible, and the menu layout, design and responsiveness are terrible.  Overall, this game feels like an experiment, not a finished, sixty dollar game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2012"}

From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Ashern \"Hmmm\"","summary":"Fly Me To The Moon","reviewText":"(NO SPOILERS)Bayonetta, oh, Bayonetta...This game is perfect in every way, it's funny, action-packed,...appealing..., and even sad.I was so happy that I bought this game, and still am.I want to correct things that people have said about this game, although I did patch the game before I played it.People have been saying this game has Framerate issues, screen-tearing, and bad graphics...the sad thing is that this is all in \"Comparison to X-Box 360\"....Haha, here is the thing, I don't have an X-Box 360, nor do I ever plan to even think about wanting one, but I'm not going to pay $300+ just to buy the same game again to compare them. If you have the money to do this, then all the power to you...but...don't do this, buy another game or something useful to your life instead, which excludes the same game.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a \"Fanboy\" and I don't like them on either \"side\"(...well its not that I don't like them, its just that everyone has their well-deserved opinion on things, and they shouldn't criticize others for not agreeing with them.)And if people say the X-Box 360 version is better, then I condone you in getting that version if you have an X-Box, Because its all about getting whats right for you and your wallet.But anyways the PS3 version, with no comparison, is great.I only noticed one screen-tear, the funny thing is when I heard people experiencing \"Screen-tearing\", I was like wow the whole game screen must just rip and tear...That's not the case: It was a little, tiny scrape next to one of the characters in a movie scene, and trust me it didn't matter the least, it ended in 1 second tops.I only noticed one Framerate issue, in a section of a chapter. It didn't make me die, all it did was slow down game-play...Didn't matter the least.And the graphics, well no explanation needed there...They are pefect.It was a long correction but I felt you needed to hear them. Now on to the review: xDPeople say the story is cliche, nothing new, boring, stupid...But no, well sometimes it might not make sense if you go back and think about it, but no. It's great, not even cliche...I think its because it surprised me at how funny and sad-at-times it was...It just made it such a different and unique game, in the greatest way possible.They also say you can skip all the movie scenes and still play the game like nothing happened, well that's partly not true...Now that I think about it the movie scenes were probably the best part.For me, gameplay and the movies are both great, but as I reminisce, it seems like I played the game to get to the next movie scene...Which is great because the movie scenes were so good, but after I beat the game, I watched/skipped the movies to get to the gameplay, which was also great the first time 'round too, it's a win win. I can't see how one would skip the movies.The game is about 10-12 hours long, but its also kind of hard...But that's a good thing. With this kind of game, it would actually BE boring and tedious to be EASY, though its NOT boring and tedious when you play on Very Easy / Easy, I'm just saying.This game has Very Easy, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Non-Stop Infinite Climax difficulty modes. As you choose harder difficulties, bosses that you met later in the game of Normal, will be foes you encounter early-on in Hard/Non-Stop.This game has a variety of weapons including Laser Pistols, Fire/Lightning claws and even Ice Skates (You actually skate around on them)! That's not even half of the weapons you can get (You get weapons by collecting special discs, or enough disc-pieces to become a whole one, then they will unlock weapons at the store.)You can buy Costumes, Accessories, Items and even Techniques. The items, accessories and techniques are actually all useful, instead of just being there for no reason.Bayonetta has hidden Alfheim Portals, which are portals to mini-games, and they consist that you kill a set number of enemies in a certain way, it's a special challenge and has nothing to do with the main story.And last but not least, some people will probably find some scenes a little adult-ish for kids, although I found it extremely funny and cool, it's no nudity besides when she summons her mega-demons after a bossfight,which is partial.But once you beat the game, and unlock costume-buying options, the costumes you wear won't deplete her clothes, meaning no partial nudity either, but other than those few scenes it should be ok depending on your views, also they use the S word and F word kinda-commonly, the S word more.All in all I can't express the love I have for this game at the end of the day, I enjoyed it from press Play, all the way to the end of the credits, and them some, the credits were great by the way!Its just almost my favorite game out of things like Tomb Raider and Final Fantasy! Some of you might look me in the face and just headbutt me, but that's just how much I love Bayonetta.I hope you all enjoy this game, it is definitely worth $40, even $60!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2010"}

There's more plot twists than are reasonable, and frankly, some of them are so ludicrous it's hard to believe the designers aren't insulting my intelligence. It'd be like if the Sixth Sense had three more plot twists, and none of them were plausible, or intesting.However, despite that, MGS2's a really fun game, full of little details that make running around in this world worthwhile. The gameplay is at least identical to the original MGS, plus a good deal of interesting additions, allowing you to hold up your enemies, or knock them out, rather than killing them outright. On top of the original game, there's several hundred VR missions, which while not nearly as interesting sans story elements, provide a reasonable amount of time-wasting fun. There's also a number of extra missions featuring Solid Snake, in case you didn't get your fill of Snake in the story mode.Overall, a neat game, but it could have been worlds better had someone just told Kojima after the first couple plot twists that he was really getting out of control.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2003"}

{"product_name":"B002TDIEEK","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"\"Super\" About Sums It Up","reviewText":"After playing Street Fighter IV, I had some issues.  Sure, it was a fun game, but something seemed to be missing.  I don't mean characters, but something else.  Something less tangible.  To this day I am not really sure what was missing from the SFIV, but whatever it was found it's way on to SSFIV.First off, I want to say that for the price this game is being offered for, it is very reasonable.  I was like a lot of gamers out there when I heard that Super Street Fighter IV was coming out.  My exact thoughts were \"Wow, way to shaft us, Capcom!\"  In fact, I may have even said it out loud......in the store......in front of children.......but I digress.This game is head and shoulders above the SFIV fans grew to love and, in fact, one of the best features is the fact that it seems easier to pull off the Ultra combos without the arcade stick.  While arcade stick owners still seem to have an edge, the advantage is a lot more balanced this time around.  Simply put, it has the arcade feel without NEEDING the arcade.  However, if you are truly serious about this game and haven't splurged yet, pick up an arcade controller.  I am not quite THAT gung ho about Street Fighter, but luckily I have a friend who is and I can say with some certainty, theSony PS3 Street Fighter IV FightStickdoes help with the more difficult maneuvers.PS3 Street Fighter IV Round 2 FightPad - Cammycontrollers are a cheaper way to go, but I can't attest to how helpful they are.Secondly, the new characters are AMAZING.  Juri has got to be, hands down, one of the best additions to the franchise period.  I like how the various characters are balanced out and how everyone has two Ultras.  It would have been nicer had everyone been given the choice to switch between the two on the fly, but I find that to be a nitpick if anything.  Seth is still a pain in the @$$, but hey.....he's the boss.  He wouldn't be much of a villain if he didn't resort to cheap moves and impossible counters.  The new stages are pretty to see, but stages in games like this I tend to care less about.  There is no real interaction with it so it is little more than some new wallpaper.  The reintroduction of bonus stages is nostalgic gold.  KUDOS!Third, this is a NOT A FIGHTING GAME.  This is practically a lifestyle.  With the TREMENDOUS amount of characters to choose....many of which are unique....each requires a learning curve that can only be compared to the arts.  Sure, novices can pick up and play, but to truly dominate in every facet; prepare to put some schoolwork in.  This alone makes this game exceed where so many other fighting games fall flat.....longevity.  If you haven't played Street Fighter in a few years.......or even if you have been playing Street Fighter IV for the last several months.....you will find yourself learning the skills all over again.  This very thing can be seen as a negative, though.  Some of us don't want so steep a learning curve.  If that is the case, you are better off passing this up.  This game requires practice.Lastly, and probably the biggest plus of all:  Everyone is unlocked at the start.  My biggest gripe with Street Fighter IV was having to toil through to try out the new characters.  In this game, they are all available to tinker with from the get-go.  I really enjoy this aspect since, well.....I tend to be impatient.If you are a fan of fighting games, this one should be a no-brainer.  If you are only a pseudo-fan of fighting games (like I am), you will probably want to rent it, but do so with an open mind.  You won't be awesome after a few fights.  This game takes patience to master and yields some of the most satisfying results once you do.  All in all, I still feel like this could have been handled as a cheaper add-on with some patches to SFIV, but when you compare the cost of admission with the massive improvements, even the most cynical of gamers out there should have a softened heart to Capcom.  So long as they continue to produce quality like this, they'll keep on getting my money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2010"}

It has an epic story line that is infinitely better than Call of Duty: Ghosts.

RPG. Ever","reviewText":"I would even go so far as to call this the best video game ever.  Computer, console, you name it.  Shadows of Amn takes the already high standard set by the original Baldur's Gate and brings it up to a level of near-perfection.  Sure, the graphics are dated and probably were when the game came out.  But as entries in the Final Fantasy series have so expertly demonstrated, great graphics do not a great game make.What makes BG, and particularly SoA, so good is the gameplay, which I find to be the most important aspect of a game--followed closely by character and storyline.  All three of which are handled wonderfully in this game and interwoven to a degree that one can't help but be drawn in by all three.Previous experience in any of the D&D; universe I believe to be completely unncessary; before I played BG, all I knew vaguely was that it had been a popular board game at one time.  Sure, I don't understand all the statistics that go into combat and the armor and weapons and the like, but the computer works in figuring all that out.  And I wouldn't consider having played the original BG necessary--anyone with an interest could get into a game like SoA.  However, I find it preferable to have played BG first--not only did it give me greater appreciation for the continutation of the story of your main character, but it also helped me in starting out with the gameplay and the controls and so forth--combat in particular was unlike anything I had previously encountered and took a while for me to get a hang of; plus the magic system in this game expands to one so complex and with such potential, I am more than certain I have yet to fully utilize it.  I think the person who complained that this particular item does not come with a manual has a fair point; I remember being disappointed when I originally opened the package to find only the disks and an advertisement for Dark Alliance.  But all in all, it's not too hard to figure out if it's your first time; and there are multitude of helpful guides, FAQs and walkthroughs that can be found online.One of the many things that makes SoA so great is the way it feels like the creators tried to weed out the dozen or so minor annoyances of the original BG; annoyances I didn't even consider to be real flaws until I played SoA.  For example, while level progression takes forever on account of the experience point distribution system (divided equally among your party members), experience points come more frequently in this game, and in larger portions (you can receive them for doing anything from having you thief successfully disarm a trap or pick or lock, to having your mage successfully learn a new spell).  Plus, BG only allowed no higher than level 7, whereas SoA has a cap off at about level 20 or so.  I also spent frustrating amounts of time in the inns recovering from battle, and appreciated the ability to set my party members to sleep until they've all recovered.  And these are just to name a few.As has been stated by so many, graphics aren't the greatest--but you've got to appreciate what's there.  There are some truly gorgeous backgrounds--the elven city and parts of the Amnish city Athkatla (in which the game is centered) like the Temple District, in particular, contain some real eye candy.  Sure, it's not 3D--but 3D graphics don't guarantee a game as great as this one.Sound and music are top notch--the background noise in particular helping to create the excellent atmosphere.  If there's one thing BG does well, it's creating a genuine atmosphere--including some that were intense and enveloped me in the world like no other game I've ever played.  Whether it's nighttime in the docks district hearing the courtesans or daytime in the bridge district and the call of the merchants--or walking through a forest wondering whether or not something big and scary is going to attack at an inopportune moment.  And music, like most entries in the series, is used sparsely--but the tunes are excellent.  Most are very area specific, probably no more than a minute or so, very appropriately composed to fit that area, and only playing occasionally as you explore a given area.  Some are so good, I would pause the game just to let it finish before I walked into a building or went on to a new area.  And the opening title music for both SoA and Throne of Bhaal are among my absolute favorites.Voice work is the best I've ever heard, wonderfully helping to develop the already strong characters.  It also helps tie into the game's appealing and unexepected and appropriately integrated sense of humor--which comes about with such particular characters like Minsc and Jan.  (One must play the game through at least one time with Minsc in your party.)  The absolute best comes from the villain, Irenicus, who comes across as a genuinely creepy and fascinating character.  And the storyline and gameplay are so wonderfully integrated into the way you develop through the game, learning both more about yourself, but also about Irenicus, and how he came to be so interested in your character as a Child of Bhaal.Also as others have stated, replay is the best I've ever seen; not just with the new class choices, but also in the wide option of characters you can pick from to make up your party--which in turn also determines some of the sub-plots that are presented and how they play out.  I have yet to discover all the different directions--minor or otherwise--in which the game can go according to my decisions.  And while I did enjoy the second chapter--in which, should you choose, you can spend most of it building up experience in the dozen or so sub-plots presented to you--it was actually in the linearity of the later chapters when I really got hooked.  But that can also be attributed to the undeniably fantastic storyline.SoA is the very best that the series gets, in every way.  Sadly, I can't quite say the same for ToB.  I enjoyed it at the start, and was glad to have it to keep going with the story after the end of SoA, but not very long into the game, I felt like it had dissolved into combat combat combat.  It definitely helped me to realize that, while combat is a large aspect of what I enjoy about BG, it's not the *only* thing that makes the game as good as it is.It does introduce some fun and interesting new progressions--like the special abilities you can pick for each party member every time they up a level.  There are also sneaky new things like your enemies sometimes being able to see you before you see them; and the fact that the game no longer automatically pauses when you view your map.  Both of which foul up more than one strategy.  Plus, you have the ability to transport your entire party to a pocket plane reality at almost any point in the game, where you can rest and recover, and also switch around your party members--with the option of bringing in literally every NPC from SoA.  You also have the ability to bring Sarevok (the villain from the original BG) into your party, which is practically a must.The overall impression I get from this game is that the creators read all the complaints regarding the experience point cap with the original BG, and decided to compensate by making a game that was entirely about gaining experience points through combat, and progressing as high as they could make it (your characters can reach all the way up to level 40.)  It really makes me wish they had decided to make ToB as a sequel, rather than an expansion--it would've given it more time to develop as a story as well, rather than just a long series of fights.Despite that, I would still recommend buying this particular product--to just about anyone who has ever considered themselves a fan of video and computer games.  It's worth it alone just for Shadows of Amn, and Throne of Bhaal brings a nice end to it all.  And all of it ultimately demonstrates why nothing could ever be as great as Baldur's Gate in its prime.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2005"}

Vendetta \"alkaline\"","summary":"Maybe a tech demo, but sooo fun.","reviewText":"I got this game when I bought the Sports Champion bundle. I know a lot of people call it a tech demo, as it just shows off what it can do, but even if it is, it's still A LOT of fun. My favorite would have to be table tennis, the accuracy of it all is crazy. I was skeptic at first when I heard about how you can put top spin on the ball and all that, after a couple minutes of playing it, it was true. The fact that you can do that just shows how accurate this tool is. You can also hit it very light or smack it hard and it translates perfect in the game. This game is very fun.Archery was also fun, I bought an extra controller so I would have two for archery and gladiator duel. The archery feels very real with two controllers as you have to reach back to grab an arrow and then put it on the bow, and you actually get an arm work out. Not as fun as table tennis, but it's not bad.Bocce ball is one of favorite games, if you want to slow the pace down and relax, then play some bocce ball. It uses the tech very well as you throw the balls with accuracy. My girlfriend and I had a blast with this, she was getting into it. We never played actual bocce ball, but after playing this game, were interested in it. This one is a lot of fun if you just want to chill and relax and play a game.Gladiator duel is the game that really got me sweating. This game is fun! It's better to have two controller for this one as it really brings you into the action. When you use two controllers, you can control your shield and sword. it's awesome how you can swing your sword normal, high, low, or you can go over the top and chop your opponent. You can also bump with your shield. It was fun bumping your opponent with the shield then slicing him with the sword. The only thing I'll say with this, is you can't just flail your arms, you really have time your shots and don't go crazy. It's better to just defend with shield then take a couple shots at him, don't go crazy with your arms. But this one will have you sweating.Volleyball is OK, I played with my girlfriends nephew the other day and it was fun when you play with another person. It's a fun game, but not as fun as the other games.Disc golf might be up there as one of my favorites. I hear a lot of people hating this game, but it's just because it takes some practice. If you have never thrown a frisbee or you're not good at it, then you'll most likely have trouble with this one. I use to throw frisbees around when I was younger so it came easy to me. The accuracy of it is great, you can throw line drives or if you tilt it when you throw it, you can curve it. This game is a lot of fun if you have a grasp on how to throw a frisbee.The graphics are really good and theres a a good amount of trophies to keep you busy. Plus the tournaments are great, bronze silver and gold. And I finished bronze for table tennis and on sliver now and it's a lot harder. Starting to feel even more like real table tennis. Overall, this game is tons of fun. Only drawback would be that there is no online play, but I'm not too worried about it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"Mr Mister \"Mr mister\"","summary":"One of the best multiplayer FPSs in the market.","reviewText":"Ill start off by saying, I generally base my experience of FPSs (First Person Shooters) on the multi-player aspects. Rarely do I ever the 'campaign'/Single-Player mode.That being said, I will say this is one of the best FPSs I've ever played. Since the game online, like many multi-player games, you will always have someone to play with.The Sound-Sound effects, music, dialog, background noise is all top notch. this game tried is hardest to capture the sound of an actual battle and does a great job at it. The dialog of nearby characters help you determine what is going on in your current surroundings. The background noise in this game is always generated by near-by action. So if you ever hear faint gun sounds in the distance, it is coming from someone somewhere VS the game just creating random background sounds.Visual-The visuals of this game is probably closer to about a B or A-. The character designs can be annoying because there are only 8 models total, 4 models per team. Basically you will find yourself running across the same person over and over again. The map/stage designs are top notch. Each map is very detailed, but not convoluted to the point where it is just ridiculous. The number of different maps, and the size of the maps also factor in. Each map being completely different (almost) from the first. Some maps have tanks, jeeps. Other maps have Helicopters, while some maps have boats and keeps. Minor details, however, are not nearly done as well. The foliage of the jungles, plants, trees, etc, look very plain, and almost 2D at times. Otherwise, the game is done rather well, but could use a minor upgrade.Controls-The movement takes some getting used to, ESPECIALLY in the vehicles. Moving feels rather choppy at first, but you get the feel of it rather quickly since it is made to imitate normal movements. Vehicles, at least to me, do not feel so natural. I personally still have not figured our how to fly a helicopter well (Basically I take it and jump out eventually). Other vehicles seem to have a rather awkward default setting. I do have issue with not being able to hold/time grenades. It is basically a one-shot. The moment you get the grenade button, it is tossed. This makes it easier to avoid.PS- Parachuting is awesomeGameplay- (Remember, this is coming from a multi-player only experience)The feel of this game make the experience so much better. You quickly realize you can play BC2 as a solo-artist, or as a team player. Solo-Artist can get things done, but make it rather difficult to work with when you're on a team. When you play as a team, and every unit (assuming your team has selected a variety of of units) you quickly realize this game was modeled after real battlefields, where you are basically relying on your team to win, winning solo is possible, but not recommended.There are not that many different modes in multi-player (rush, Conquest, Deathmatch), but the modes never feel like they are getting old.From Sniping, to reviving, to flying helicopters, to parachuting into battle. This game will keep you coming back for more.Overall- (Multi-player)Based on the multi-player, this game is definitely a win. The learning curving takes some time, especially getting used to the weapons, how they should be used, and how the different add-on affect this or that. Once you get to level 4, you have basically figured it out and you are ready for war.I will say there on some problems I did not mention. Mainly team-balancing and Matchmaking issues. But I assume these issues will be fixed soon with firmware updates.PS- The unlocks that come with this addition (from Amazon) do help some. You start off this game with basically nothing, while others already have crazy unlocks. My suggestion, when you kill someone, take their weapons (class), they are probably better than yours when you first start.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"M.

Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis.

I own just about every one of his games, yet he often shows me something new. Epic Yarn is the perfect blend of innovation with classic gameplay.It's a traditional 2D platformer with some of the most creative visuals you've ever seen. Close to cute overload but never stepping over that line, Kirby and his world look like some scrapbooking society's masterpiece. You've seriously never seen anything like it -- and that's a good thing.The way it plays may take a step back from the gobble-and-inherit mechanics of older Kirby titles, but it still offers plenty of fun to keep you going. Swimming plays a pretty big role, as do transformations into things like firetrucks and trains.Dying holds little consequence. Instead, you're trying to grab as much loot as possible. However, the fact that I don't have to worry about lives never detracted from my enjoyment, and will probably appeal to younger or less-experienced gamers. Nice choice, Nintendo! Also noteworthy is the ability to have two players going through levels at the same time.

I'm not sure if the release of Legend of Mana (LoM) and Threads of Fate (ToF) makes Chrono Cross (CC) look that much better or what. In either case Chrono Cross is truly what a neo RPG should be. Not the lost causes that LoM and ToF are. Normally I play games through 100% before I think about the review but in this case I have to make the exception. I purchased Chrono Cross the day it was released. In that time I've only managed to play the game for an hour before it disappeared from my house one day.I've managed to discover that one of my friends had decided to &quot;borrow&quot; Chrono Cross. In that time it has exchanged hands at least three times not one of which was mine and not willingly. What does that tell me? That this game rocks. It's very rare that games get stolen from me and even rarer that they would ever get stolen more than once. Only two other games since all the time I've played games was any game &quot;borrowed&quot; from me (MC Kids for NES and Kid Chameleon for Sega Genesis) and returned several years later (Or in the case of MC Kids, never returned).Indeed, SquareSoft certainly pulled a rabbit out of their hat with this one. I certainly hope that games like CC will continue to be the norm for Square and not the lost lunches like the LoM and ToF games Square shoved down our throats.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2000"}

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Impetigo","summary":"Fun but rehash of Diablo 2","reviewText":"*******************UPDATED (6/1/2012)*******************UPDATED (5/20/2012)*******************UPDATED (5/18/2012)*******************I'll keep this review short given that there are 800+ reviews for this game already.(I have the collector's edition which is why I don't show up as a 'verified purchase')THE GOOD:=========1. Fun to playIt's still fun to play, although it is still the same mindless, hack and slash, quasi-RPG game that the previous two are.2. Decent presentationGraphics and sound (music/sound effects/etc) are pretty solid, if uninspired.3. Isometric viewI am really glad that they did not turn this game into a first person view game, like Bethesda did with Fallout 3.THE BAD=======1. Server \"issues\"'Nuff said.  Surprising given that it took Blizzard 12 years to come out with this game.2. Quasi-RPG, with NO CHARACTER BUILDS/CUSTOMIZATION (i.e. LITTLE REPLAY VALUE)Nothing is permanent, including character 'development'.  By choosing to not allow players to increase specific character attributes (dexterity, strenth, etc.), Blizzard really took out the \"quasi\" in \"quasi-RPG\".  It's actually a straight up action game, with skills automatically unlocked automatically based on XP the SAME FOR EVERYONE.  So absolutely ZERO character customizations.  Forget about agonizing over how to develop your character, because Blizzard has decided to dumb it down for you and make everything possible at any time.  Don't like your current skills?  Well, just choose another one, they're all available after all!  Ridiculous decision and quite possibly the worst thing about this game.3. Complete Re-hash of Diablo II (i.e. NOT VERY INTERESTING TO PLAY THE FIRST TIME)This game is basically D2 with updated graphics and worse voice acting and absolutely zero atmostphere.  The maps seem so familiar that you could probably do the entire game from memory even if you have never played it before, as long as you have played D2.  Specifically...4. Lack of Randomized dungeons (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)Everything is in the same location, or so it seems at least.  The continental maps are the same, so everytime you play a game online you join the mad rush of players all running towards destinations like rats who have mastered a maze.  The 'dungeons' (there are actually few dungeons), or locations, all seem to be minimally varied at all game to game.  This makes the game lose a lot of its REPLAY VALUE.  Let's say that this game has very low replay value unless you want to play all the characters through all the difficulty levels and get them all up to level 60 or whatever the highest level is.  No point in ever playing the same class twice, since there is no 'build' anymore for characters.5. Lack of AtmosphereIt really looks like WoW in an isometric view.  Completely gone is the claustrophobic, disturbing, and foreboding atmosphere of D1.  Everything looks cartoonish, which is exacerbated by the veritable fireworks display of all colors everytime you use just about any skill.  Not to mention that many weapons have a neon glow to them even when not in use.  Don't be surprised to see a barbarian running around with bright neon orange and green axes in his hands.  And a coop battle looks like you're at some kind of a rave or Phish concert.6. MiscellaneousBad writing, distracting attempts at humor, very poor voice acting (especially Leah), and tedious intro/cutscenes.OVERALL:========3/5 for mindless fun2/5 for overall quality of the game++********************(UPDATED (5/18/2012)********************So, I finished the game on 'normal' difficulty and got up to level 31 with my Demon Hunter.  Add a few new \"goods\" and \"bads\" for this game...GOOD====1. Better CutscenesThe ones at the end are better than the earlier ones (e.g. it's possible to watch it through without hitting ESC).2. Still Fun (for now...)Yes, it is still fun to play, despite the numerous deficiencies mentioned previously.  Once I finish the game on the hardest difficulty, I cannot imagine playing it again until the inevitable expansion pack(s) comes out.  I will play all the difficulty levels though and the expansion packs, which should say something about the casual playability of this game.  Despite the limitations on and simplification of character development, it is still fun to 'unlock' new skills to use.  Much of the fun does derive from leveling (read: grinding) and item collection (who doesn't still love to collect rare, unique, and now legendary items?).BAD===1. Too SHORT!!! (i.e. LOW REPLAY VALUE)Maybe 15-20 hours and I finished the game in normal difficulty, and I cannot believe how SHORT THIS GAME IS.  It's shocking actually, and it does not help that the acts are so similar to D2.  For some reason I expected this game to be much longer and expansive compared with D2, similar to how D2 was much more immense in scope compared with D1.  But no, there are still just 4 (I think) acts that are fairly short and easy to complete.2. Lame Bosses/Lairs (i.e. Zzzzzz...)Most of the bosses in D3 are pretty lame.  Half of them are just gigantic, bulbous and obese monstrosities that are barely distinguishable from one another.  Only Diablo himself appears significantly unique.  The lairs are similarly boring... most are just gigantic square rooms that you run around endlessly trying to avoid getting injured.  The boss action, of course, is pure 'grinding' at its finest.  In the later acts, the bosses are almost back to back to back, which to be quite honest got tired really fast, especially when they all seemed the same.3. Horrible Skill Interface/System (i.e. FORGET ABOUT SWITCHING THEM IN A BATTLE!)Yes, the way that you switch between skills is very cumbersome and involves opening up a skills window and then clicking on various tabs to select different skills and their runes (which are not physical items either) that was not intuitive at all at the beginning, and even when you get used to it still prevents easy switching of skills.  Fine, let there be a 'cool off' time for switching skills, but requiring the skills window to open up in order to change skills is beyond annoying and really means you're not likely to do it in a battle.  So, that means that essentially you're stuck with a half dozen skills, max, at any given time.  This feels very limited and boring, especially when you have all these skills that you unlocked and would like to use with some variety to keep things fun.4. Linear Gameplay (i.e. GO FROM A > B > C > D...)More so than D1 or even D2, D3 is super linear.  There is very little exploration you can do except for on the world maps, and even then there are blockades that need to be unlocked as part of some quest or another, limited your ability to explore.OVERALL=======It is still a fun game but very disappointing in many ways.  Primarily the lack of character attribute/skill customization (e.g. no 'builds'), the sense of deja vu that you get when you play due to the game being so similar in design to Diablo 2, and the small scope of the game.  I couldn't believe that Diablo came so soon, and when he died I was wondering if there would be another act or something, but alas, it just ended with a whimper and yet another cutscene.3/5 for mindless fun2/5 for overall quality of the game********************(UPDATED (5/20/2012)********************BOTTOM LINE===========So, I got my character up to level 50 and finished D3 on nightmare difficulty and... I just uninstalled it.  The truth is, the more you play, the higher level you achieve, the less you want to continue playing.  This mostly is a result of the lack of character development/customization (and by that, I mean inability to assign attribute points or selectively develop/specialize skills as in D2) and the overall similarity to D2.  The over-simplication (and let's not forget that D2 was a pretty simple game to begin with... hardly real RPG type character development or gameplay) really is the downfall of this otherwise serviceable game.  The bottom line is -- it's just not that fun to play over and over again.  It's also laughable that Blizzard is trying to squeeze even more money out of their fans pockets with the Auction House, which no normal person would (or could) actually use to try to make money off of the game.  I remember selling various items from D2 on ebay (remember the 'grandfather sword' anyone?) but it's hard to imagine that anyone would do the same with this game.In the end, I have to say that while fun for awhile, D3 is ultimately a massive disappointment to fans of the series.  For me, it provided less than a week of gameplay, unlike D2 that I played for months and months.  It is not the kind of Blizzard product that the company built its reputation on during the 1990s and 2000s, and is clearly showing the unfortunate influence of big company marketing in the development of one of its most popular franchises.  Unless the direction that Blizzard takes with their games (e.g. dumbing down and simplifying their games to achieve more widespread appeal) changes, I will NOT be buying another Blizzard product ever.  Thank God for Kickstart, which has brought back the possibility of independent game development back from the dead (Wasteland 2!!!)...Final (downgrade) Rating:2/5 for brief, mindless fun1/5 for overall quality of the game*******************UPDATED (6/1/2012)*******************Yes, I know I said the last update would be the last but I had a few things to add.So, I have the collector's edition (completely worth the $100 given all the goodies it comes with), which includes D2/LOD on a USB flash drive.  After uninstalling D3 (after 6 days of gameplay getting my Demon Hunter up to lvl 50 and finishing on nightmare difficulty), I decided to see how D2 looked and played (haven't played it since 2001, after getting the LOD expansion pack) after all these years.Well, D2/LOD is still great!  I've been playing for about two weeks (more than twice the time I played D3 for), building a Werebear Druid, and I am amazed with the superiority of this game over the follow-up that took 12 years to be released but feels like a cheap imitation of the real deal.MORE BAD THINGS ABOUT DIABLO 3==============================1. HAND-HOLDING AND DUMBED DOWN GAMEPLAY (e.g. D3 NEEDS TO APPEAL TO THE TABLET GAMER CROWD!!)Yes, the geniuses at Blizzard decided that D3 had to be super noob friendly to help ensure the most widespread adoption by casual gamers.  So, LOOT that drops from monsters for each player in a multiplayer game INDIVIDUALLY, which other players cannot see let alone pickup.  I mean, how stupid is that?  It makes no sense for this to happen and is an example of extent of the absurd hand-holding and 'noob-ification' of this game.Another example is the ELIMINATION of the use of TOWN PORTAL or IDENTIFY scrolls.  What a hassle to use those items when Blizzard could just simplify the game to get rid of them, and instead allow players to press a button at any time to magically teleport themselves back to town (complete with a silly animation of the players crouching and white energy balls emanating from their hands), right?  And identify scrolls, a RPG staple from the earliest days, well, why not get rid of that silly hassle too and allow players to identify any item just by right clicking on it?Frustrated by having to explore the square continental MAPS searching for important locations (well, the first time you play through that is, because those locations don't appear to ever change)?  Well, no problem because the good folks at Blizzard have decided that exploration is a waste of time and so they make ARROWS and other indicators appear on the map that SHOW YOU WHERE TO GO, and if you are close to an important place.  Yes D2 act 1 had a road that would lead you to adjacent maps, but nothing even close to this level of hand-holding.  Can anyone really question the noob-ification and extreme linearness of this game?  There's not even an option to turn those map 'hints'/guides off.Yet another example is the noob-ification of the GEAR REPAIR/durability system.  In D3, items have a durability rating (e.g. 24/24) but that never seems to decrease (or at least, very slowly), despite using your weapons and taking damage.  Even if an item does break you can simply get it FIXED by the blacksmith guy, so really what was the point?  In D2 (and other RPGs), you fix your gear so that it doesn't break because typically you can't just weld a broken sword back together again!And of course, don't forget that monsters now drop HEALTH ORBS that raise your life instantly when you walk over them, instead of health potions that needed to be then be consumed in order to get healed.So, yes -- Diablo 3 has been SIMPLIFIED and DUMBED DOWN to the level of an arcade side shooter game.  Hell, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog with gear grinding!2. ABSURD STORYBy now most Diablo fans have heard about the absurd and cringe-inducing story of D3 (I won't 'spoil' it for those of you who haven't played it yet, but it involves a human and a certain demon mating and producing a very annoying NPC).  D2, on the other hand, had a reasonably interesting and fairly well thought out (if not particularly original) story of the 'Dark Wanderer' (your character from D1), which provides the backdrop for D2.  And don't even get me started on the most ridiculous NPC from the Diablo series, Leah...3. 4-PLAYER CO-OP LIMITEight player co-op games in D2 are great -- too bad you're limited to only four players in D3.  Just stupid.4. OTHER BATTLE.NET ISSUESThe game creation system for multiplayer co-op has also been simplified, in a bad way.  You can't name your games or even play in a game with other players unless you are on the same exact quest.  It's very limiting and substantially decreases the online replay value (which is not very high to begin with, unfortunately).5. SILLY D1 'BOSS' CAMEOYes, you've all heard the rumors/spoilers about the return of a Diablo 1 boss (arguably the most famous and well-liked boss from the Diablo series) in D3.  No, it makes no sense why this character, who was killed in D1, would return (complete with memorable catchphrase), but apparently Blizzard thought this would be some sort of a 'treat' for Diablo fans.  It's not.6. DEMON HUNTER WEARS STILETTO HEELSSeriously?  In hindsight, this probably should have tipped me off as to the quality of the game that I was so eagerly awaiting.CONCLUSION==========Don't believe all those 'expert' reviews on the internet, like the mindboggling 100% rating (!!) from Joystiq.  These online blogs are hardly objective to any degree, due to direct advertising revenue they receive from game companies and/or other perks they may receive (e.g. being invited to Blizzard headquarters for exclusive sneak peaks, etc.) that unduly influences their game reviews.  In light of this, it is unsurprising that there are so many highly favorable reviews for D3.This does not obscure the fact that Diablo 3 is simply a mediocre game.  Actually, it's below average.  It gets a 1 star rating from me because of how much worse of a game in many ways (gameplay, battle.net, etc.) it is than its predecessor, the great Diablo 2 despite how long it took (12 years, holy smokes!) to finally come out, and because of Blizzard's thinly veiled primary objective of squeezing as much money out of players with the Real Money Auction House -- a feature that detracts from the item finding fun of the game to a significant degree.Bottom line?  Diablo 3 is fun to play... for a few days.  The problem is that it lacks much of the substance which made Diablo 2, and even Diablo 1, so much more engaging to play... and play again and again.  Perhaps the most accurate description is that D3 is an uninventive and unoriginal reworking of a great game, with deal-breaking noob-ification and over simplifaction of gameplay dynamics and online play.  I would recommend waiting for the inevitable, and likely imminent, price drop before picking this one up.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2012"}

His nose is almost witch-like and while he has some detail for his face, he's lacking the essentials to be considered \"life like\". In fact, HCTP sports a more cartoonish look in the form of smooth polygonal models much like DOR except not as good.With that said, I enjoyed the in game menus and presentation, and HCTP does have some redeeming graphical qualities worthy of praise.One thing I didn't like about HCTP would be some entrances which didn't look that impressive. For example, Scott Steiner's entrance is terrible and his \"muscles\" just look like bags of air with flat textured veins all over them. His face is also very awkward looking as are most wrestlers during the intros.Other than that, HCTP looks good.Sound-One thing I didn't like about HCTP would be that it featured no commentary. While this isn't a big deal, it does feel a little strange if you turn the music down  leaving the sound effects way too loud. Occasionally, the crowd will chant, but it sounds really cheap and will probably last about three chants at best. I found that weird. The background music is actually pretty good and I believe it's also featured in Wrestlemania 19 for the Gamecube, except this game features probably a few more tracks.Gameplay-Easily the best part about Here comes the pain would be it's gameplay, it's roster and the fact it was the first game to introduce the elimination chamber.First, let's talk about the roster-The roster in this game is similar to Wrestlemania 19's for the Gamecube, but features some wrestlers not found in WM19 alongside a good number of legends. The roster features-Rodney Mack, Scott Steiner, Test, The Hurricane, George \"the animal\" Steele, The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Jazz, Big Show, Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin, Kurt Angle amongst others.The roster is extensive, there are plenty of unlockables and it's impressive to say the least. The last game to feature a roster this big before HCTP would be WWF No Mercy for the N64. Also, this is the first Smackdown game to feature full entrances. (even though most are partially clipped)The gameplay of HCTP is strikingly similar to that of Day of Reckoning except faster with better control thanks to PS2's dualshock controller vs. The gamecube controller. (which is better for platformers and racing games)I really didn't find anything revolutionary in HCTP besides the fact that it's a fast and frantic wrestling game with accurate finishing moves. The computer gives you a decent match on normal but is much better on higher difficulties. (Unlike WWE12/13)Royal Rumble mode is equal to that of Day of Reckoning but faster. The elimination chamber match is great.One thing I particularly liked about this game would be that the controls are perfect. You can have a high paced match with lots of things going on at once without mashing buttons or pulling off silly combinations. The control scheme is simple and straight to the point. I wish games could be like this nowadays, but unfortunately, THQ went nuts with analog stick grapple control schemes. Hopefully, the next third party company making the next WWE game will completely tweak or perhaps revamp this control scheme.In addition to the great control, excellent roster and graphics, there's CAW mode which is very deep. You're able to do whatever you want in CAW mode, but in the end, don't expect highly realistic looking wrestlers more than you'd expect cartoonish wrestler models detailed to your liking.HCTP is not a bad wrestling game, but is in no way like I've heard it was supposed to be and or the greatest wrestling game of all time. In fact, Smackdown Vs Raw (the first one) is superior to this game in many ways from the amount of moves, graphics and control. Still, this is not a bad wrestling game at all, but being that I own almost every wrestling game to date, I feel as if most people haven't played games like Day of Reckoning for the Gamecube to understand that this game is eerily similar to it and offers nothing more than the fast paced, arcade style wrestling which is lacking in many games. If you happen to buy HCTP, at least treat yourself to SVR (the first one) and compare. You'll see exactly what I'm talking about. This game still ranks high in my opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

The result is a good game that will keep us hacking and summoning - until the ...3rd coming that is.In fact, the game developers made sure to often pay tribute to the DIABLO Series: from the background music while at the town-camp (you would recognize those Tristam guitar riffs anywhere!), to the draining health and mana fountains and to the voice announcing & warning, you cannot miss the timeless DIABLO influences. Having said that, I found TORCHLIGHT to be something between a DIABLO and a FATE game.If you have experienced any of the FATE games you will be reminded of them often, although the heroes here are not children. The village NPCs will keep giving you straightforward quests (usually a go-and-fetch excuse to dwell deeper into the dungeon). Extra dungeons, however, can be accessed by accepting the extra quests of the male NPC in the south and by purchasing dungeon maps of various levels from the local merchants. Also, sometimes a spectral animal appears while in a dungeon: slaying it will open up a bonus dungeon where better equipment often becomes available. There is no traveling to/from town while in a bonus dungeon, so you better keep an empty inventory before entering it.Yes, you do get a pet (a dog or a cat - but you can interchange them by purchasing and feeding them a special fish) and, yes, you can transform them by feeding them different types of fishes. Fishing is carried out in pretty much the same fashion: you wait for two concentric circles to merge and their color to change from pale blue to purple but it is less important than it was in FATE (so far I brought in nothing else but fish - no equipment or valuable items).Now, when not playing an AD&D; RPG (where I always choose to be a Paladin), I like to play other RPGs as a warlock, a fighting mage. The Alchemist class allows you to both cast powerful spells and exchange blows in the midst of the action (the other available classes is the Destroyer and the Vanquisher). The Destroyer is the up-close-and-personal tank warrior whereas the Vanquisher is the ranger.When leveling up as an Alchemist, make sure to get both the (steampunk!) golems and the Ember Strike spell. Together with some good shielding spells, nothing can stand in your way.Try not to go broke. At first I though, \"finally, an RPG that is not stingy with its money\". But that was only at first. Items are less expensive at the shops but (surprise!) they also sell for a pittance. The good news is that money drops like rain from slain foes. The money-hole is the enchanter: attempting to further enchant your equipment will deplete your funds faster than you would imagine! And you also run a considerable risk of having all of its enchantments removed. No post-dated checks are honored. No credit cards accepted. I tried.You WILL get swarmed so be prepared. Place healing potions, defensive and knockback spells on quick-slots (1-0); equip your pet with self or group healing spells and a powerful summoning spell; and never forget to first stay alive and then keep pounding on your enemies. In the heat of the battle it is best to deactivate (Alt-key) the fallen-items labels (more on this later on) and to always keep an eye on your health and mana levels. Respawning is not free: it will cost you either time, money or experience.The inventory seems small but, in fact, it is more than adequate. Potions and scrolls are stackable up to 20 and (more importantly) every item takes up only one inventory square (no, you do not have to carry your fishing pole, it is just there).You can send your pet to town to sell off its inventory and the time it needs to return is much less that what it did in FATE.And there are treasure rooms you can only access by finding and pulling levers (sometimes in specific sequence) to open doors or turn bridges.Now, some negative points:(1) the game is only a dungeon crawler, there are no outdoors locations.(2) the graphics of the the spells are very impressive but they can become really confusing as well. Even at maximum settings, unless the fallen-items labels are deactivated you will not be able to actually see much of the battle. That means alternating between fighting and looting - but it also means missing some important interactive objects (levers or ballistas). Also, when electric, fire, ice and poison spells get mixed the result is not something one can discern friend from foe in. It makes no tactical difference (you cannot harm yourself or your company) but it sure would be more enjoyable if you could aim more than...80% of the time.(3) the environments are beautifully designed but your path is often blocked by obstacles that visually you could easily bypass. Sometimes you find your hero running in place, stopped by a ...pebble.Finally, some closing suggestions to the developers for a future patch: (a) add the possibility to order our pet to bring back potions and identification scrolls when sent into town, and (b) make it possible to change class in mid-game (keeping the level and redistributing the skill points).All in all, TORCHLIGHT is a very enjoyable experience. It is easy to master, it is beautiful and it is fun for the whole family.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2010"}

Each of the games has improved over the original, and this one is no different. With new gameplay mechanics like the Cross-Com, a much improved cover system, and breathtaking graphics, Advanced Warfighter is a worthy sequel and a true next generation game.The story takes place in modern day Mexico City. In the game you play as a man by the name of Scott Mitchell who is the captain of an elite light infantry unit called the Ghosts. You are there to provide security during a meeting between the leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It is during this time that some Mexican insurgents decide to attack the meeting in an attempt to come to power. They kill the Canadian prime minister and the US and Mexican presidents disappear. Your job, among other things, is to locate and rescue the US and Mexican presidents.You won't be fighting alone for most of the campaign. You will have three teammates which you can order around for the majority of the missions. You can order them to attack, fall back to you, and move into certain positions. While the way you command them is not exactly deep or provides a lot of control, you can still be pretty effective with your squad. Your Cross-Com allows you to see what one of your teammates sees, allowing you to get multiple perspectives of the battlefield. Unfortunately, the squad AI can give you a bit of a headache sometimes. While they are usually pretty good at shooting enemies, it's not too uncommon to find your teammates exposing themselves too much instead of properly using cover. For the most part they do try to use cover whenever possible though.Besides your three teammates, some missions give you other assets to control. One of which is a UAV which you can order around the level. The UAV can detect enemy troops and mark them on your HUD. Since you can die pretty fast in this game, knowing where the enemies are and planning your next move is essential, and having a working UAV helps greatly. Occasionally you will also have a tank or helicopter gunship. The tank can not only be used to attack enemies but it can also be used as cover while it moves. The helicopter is also pretty good and moving and striking targets on the ground quickly. During a few sequences in the game, you will actually get to fly around in the helicopter and use the machine gun on the side to take out huge groups of enemies. While these sequences are not too challenging, they are a lot of fun.Because a single good shot can kill you in Advanced Warfighter, the game has a slower pace and more tactical feel then other action games. That is not to say that the game is dull; it is filled with fierce fire fights and big explosions, but it does require more thinking then some other games. You always want to lean around corners before going walking out in the open, and always fight from behind cover. Since the levels are pretty large (many city blocks for each level), there are usually multiple ways to get to each objective. Most of the time just taking a different route will end up in a totally different experience. Enemies roam the map, also making sure the game never plays exactly the same way twice.The amazing graphics are probably the first thing you will notice when you load up this game. The amount of detail in objects and the size of the city are staggering. During the game's many helicopter rides, the city buildings and streets stretch out for mines in every direction. Sometimes you can see areas filled with fire or smoke from all of the fighting that has been going on. These sequences do a great job of making you feel that you are in a real city fighting in a real conflict. Mexico City just looks absolutely beautiful. Advanced Warfighter is easily the best looking game on the Xbox 360 console. The HDR lighting is used to great effect in all of the games missions, which range from early morning, afternoon, and dusk. During some of the afternoon missions, the sunlight can get so bright that it actually makes it hard to see. The character models are some of the best that I have seen. They are all extremely detailed and look very realistic. They also animate in a very believable way. The only negative thing you can say about the graphics is that things will sometimes \"pop\" into view when leaning around the corners. This does not happen often, but can take you out of the game for a moment when it does happen.The audio in the game is also great. All of the guns sound different and extremely clear. Explosions and tank and rocket fire sound great as well. The game also muffles the sound when explosions go off around you. The music in the game is also pretty good and comes in at the right moments. The voice acting, while not amazing, is convincing.While the single player game is great, the multiplayer is what's going to keep people playing. The game features three ways to play multiplayer: local play, system link, and over Xbox live. There is a large selection of game types to choose from. First, there are the excellent co-op missions which are a blast to play with your friends. Then there are the more standard game types you are used to like capture the flag and deathmatch. Besides those default settings, the game allows you to customize your game to play the way you want to. The multiplayer experience is extremely addictive and plays very well. I definitely expect people to be hooked on this game for a very long time.Overall, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter is a great game. Offering an intense single player campaign and multiplayer matches which will remain fun for hours at time, Advanced Warfighter is a great complete package and sets the bar pretty high for the inevitable sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2006"}

I think the best part of Advanced Warfighter is the strategy, command options, and realistic fighting sequences (sound effects, explosions, etc).  You get to direct your squad throughout the city of Mexico over the course of a few days.  If you're looking for a Call of Duty type go in shooting ask questions later approach that doesn't work in this type of game which I do enjoy a change of pace because Recon makes you map out your approach and there are too many corners within the city to ignore possible enemy locations.  I think that the Recon game could have a few more boots on the ground in the game.  I know the original games for the PC allowed for three teams of two, but may be the next Recon games could return to that and expand to a platoon...The graphics aren't the best and the online play does not compare to campaign mode.  I was hoping the online play would be a little more fun.  The good thing about online mode is that you can play with a lot of people in various modes, and you can play multiplayer against AI.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

No choppy movements, but there was a small glitch then I expirienced while playing. I would crouch then move, then his legs stayed still but moved like he was gliding. But that only happened in one small spot, nothing to worry about. Besides that no glitches. The graphics were really good though and they meet 360 potential quite well.The controls, I didnt have a problem with them, the crosshair moved around freely, the bursts moved good, I was satisfied with the controls and didnt get frustrated over them at all. The controls are pretty easy to learn also, there is stuff like \"Commands\" where you can tell your teammates to move to different positions, tell them to follow you etc. Good stuff. Controls are easy to learn.The sound of the game was good, good sound effects with the shooting, the enemy AI also shouted, talked etc. One feature I liked about the game was where the people on your side talk to you threw your headset to communicate with you and tell you your objectives. Good add on. The music fit PERFECTLY with the game!I thought the game was a BIT short, but its Ghost Recon, and it doesnt have to be THAT long to be entertaining so it was pretty good length. If your an average gamer, or you hardly play itll take you some time to complete the game. Hardcore gamers can take this game in a few days pretty easily if they play alot throughout the day.

Very few people sit on the fence when it comes to this franchise. Reach isn't going to change any minds. With Halo: Reach, the bottom line is simple: If you love Halo, you WILL love this game, a LOT, and if you hate Halo, it won't convert you into a fan.But if you're one of the few still on the fence?Reach provides what might be the best Halo experience to date. For multi-player especially it's as robust an experience as you'll find on a console.So yes, fence-sitter, this might be the time to finally give Halo a try.First, the looks. The game looks great. Bungie updated theHalo 3engine, allowing it to pump more polygons at any given moment. Halo has never been about eye-candy in the way some games are, but rather about using the graphics engine to create big, epic experiences for the player. That's present in spades here. Battles in this game can be HUGE, with dozens of characters on screen at once. If you thought some of the big firefights in Halo 3 were intense, wait until you get a load of these.And in Reach, you'll be fighting alongside a squad. That twist alone makes Reach a new Halo experience. You'll be pushing through a dramatic conflict to save the planet of Reach - those who have readHalo: The Fall of Reachknow what that means - and the battle is a big one. Arguably bigger than the Earth invasion of the core trilogy.This squad isn't just made up of nameless, faceless drones shouting slogans and dying in droves. As they did withHalo 3: ODST, Bungie put a lot of effort into fleshing out these characters. You know who these people are. What they want. What makes them tick. You care for them. It's arguably the strongest writing in a Halo game to date.It's got to be, too, because the story is one of the franchise's most powerful. Without spoiling too much, let's just say this is Halo's \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"Everything else is as you'd expect. Loads of new weapons. (Love the needler rifle). Vehicles. An epic campaign that throws a million obstacles at you. (Outer space combat for the win!). Enemies that are smarter than ever before. (The Elites are deadly and genuinely scary.) Plus new gadgets in the form of armor abilities like cloaking, etc., which you can use over and over after they've recharged. (These add a nice layer of strategy.) It's a blast.Yep, when it comes to the campaign, Halo: Reach shines.The multi-player is just as good. Maybe better. As always, matchmaking is easy as pie, and the available game modes are many. Customization is a cinch. Maps are varied and generally well-balanced. Those who played the beta know the action is faster than previous Halo games, but also more forgiving at times. Reach incorporates a kind of ranking/level advancement system not unlike those we've seen in other recent shooters. You get a constant stream of rewards for your play, from bits of armor to weapons and more. These carrots are likely to keep people playing.As in the past, expect Bungie to keep tweaking online play, adding maps, features, and content for many months to come. That's the exciting thing about their approach. Reach won't be a game you play, put down, and forget. They'll keep pumping life into it for a while yet. That means good value for your gaming dollars.The bottom line is simple: If you don't like Halo, this won't win you over.But Halo fans NEED to have this game. It's outstanding in every way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2010"}

If anything, the advertising campaign of Halo: Reach makes the game out to be a memorial to those who were lost in the fictional world of Halo with the moniker \"Remember Reach.\"It is truly ironic that Bungie would decide to end the Halo franchise by going back to the beginning, just before the events of Halo: Combat Evolved.However, with this in mind Halo fans, like myself, felt compelled to see the story end and begin anew similar to watching the end of Episode III of the Star Wars saga.  We know Reach fell and that Master Chief was the last of the Spartans hinting that all others perished, but fans want to know who the past Spartans were and how they met their end.  Halo Reach provides such closure by showing the Halo universe, more specifically humanity's war with the Covenant, in the most gritty and desperate way possible.First, the story.  Halo fans have been somewhat cheated in recent years with the unanswered questions generated at the end of Halo 3, an almost campy story from Halo: ODST, and the completely unrelated one from Halo Wars.  While both games had their strong points, and believe me I still play ODST with my buds online, their stories proved very lacking in the end.Reach redeems the franchise with a gritty portrayal of a desperate battle in an even more desperate war.  The player follows the not-so-silent protagonist Noble 6, the newest addition to Noble Team, a group of Spartans tasked to investigating and later defending the planetary hub of Reach.  Each mission getting more and more desperate than the last as the team struggles to survive knowing full well that they are losing the war and death is getting ever so closer.  Imagine WWII in space, the Allies are losing, and the Nazis want to kill everyone and I do mean everyone in the name of a psychotic belief; THAT is how desperate humanity is just at the beginning of the game.  The extinction of humanity is a very possible outcome should Reach fall.With this in mind I can safely say that I was generally moved by the flow of the story.  It was not complicated, boring, overly-emotional, or just downright campy.  It was tough, gritty, and downright nasty, but compelling at the same time.The characters themselves were unique and easy to get along with without getting into the traditional racial and cultural stereotypes that typically accompany military-style games.  While Noble Team is diverse in race, gender, and culture, there are no clear stereotypes, which has really been a big nuisance in recent games such as Final Fantasy 13.To amplify the story and atmosphere the player is treated to beautiful visuals as well as wonderfully composed music that doesn't seem out of place.  If I can credit ODST for one thing it was well-placed music that helped move the story along.  Halo composer Martin O'Donnell certainly has come of age since he made the interesting compilation of Halo: Combat Evolved almost 10 years ago.  The music isn't exotic and abstract but, like the story, gritty and mean.  Select guitar riffs combined with O'Donnell's love for African drums really intensifies the player's attitude to something akin to, \"I'm gonna kill all of you\" when you assault nearby Covenant forces.The visuals are very stunning.  In one of the earlier missions when I was dangling my feet out of a VTOL craft, bored out of my mind while waiting to be inserted in a very hot landing zone, my buddy Tom told me to look out over the horizon and \"enjoy the view.\"  I panned the camera upwards to be treated to a very beautiful landscape of grasslands and forests.  The more I took the time to admire the landscapes the more I realized just hot well it looked.  To make it more realistic, the landscape becomes more charred at the battle goes on from a lush world to something the resembled photos I've seen of battle-sites from World War 1.As for other visuals the character and weapons details are astonishing.  The weapons no longer look like smooth plastic toys but something you can beat a Brute to death should you run out of ammo.  The character graphics were not as impressive, but still better than most FPS games that have been cranked out in recent years (Save for Modern Warfare 2).  My only beef with the graphics is that there is so much going on that it causes the frame rate to seriously slow down.  Limitations of the XBox360, there are greater tragedies in life such as Justin Bieber and Alpha Protocol.The game play itself is very smooth and surprisingly well balanced.  It took me some time to get used to the new controller scheme (right bumper is melee and not reload like in Halo 3 and ODST) although this is fairly adjustable.  Unlike other Halo releases, players cannot simply skate through Legendary, the hardest difficulty setting, by having a 4-player online co-op as done so in Halo 3 and ODST.  Surprisingly, Reach has the hardest campaign I've played to date and actually adjusts for difficulty if co-op is used.  I do not know if the game utilizes an AI Director, but it sure seems that way at times.One vast improvement to enemy AI is their ability to utilize your own vehicles against you.  It caught my by surprise when I was trying to retrieve my warthog to find myself being shot at by it.  It took me two seconds to realize that elites LOVE to steal cars and pummel you to death with them.  Next time I'll use The Club.One of the things I liked best about Reach is the complete customization of your own character.  In previous Halo games, you can only adjust color and maybe a few other details but such changes are only available in multiplayer.  In Reach not only can you customize EVERYTHING from helmets to knee pads to voice, but it is shown in campaign mode and even in cut scenes.  When I first started a campaign and noticed Noble 5 in the cut scenes was wearing an ODST helmet with a crimson on gray color scheme I'd picked out when I first booted up I knew that Bungie had done something REALLY right.Another one of my favorites is Firefight.  In a word; perfected.  In ODST firefight was a novel idea but only good for gaining achievements and gamer score in the end since it was overly repetitive and lacked any real customization.  In Reach you can choose everything from rounds to kind of shields used.  Hell, we had a blast for over an hour by enabling infinite ammo, shields and seeing who could get the 10-kill combo or \"Killionare\" achievement first... I lost.From what we fidgeted around with in Forge, the map creator, it seems as though Bungie fixed most of the problems that plagued Halo 3 and ODST.  It is easier to place objects and have a LOT more control over features.  This is good given a good percentage of the 12 maps are classic Halo maps or remakes.  While I'm not a true fan of user made content, I think this is a step in the right direction.Lastly is online play.  I'm not a true fan of online multiplayer since I don't have as much time to practice as your average hardcore gamer.  What I did like was the matchmaking ability that allows you to find online co-op games with certain difficulties similar to what designers did in Left 4 Dead 2.  What really impressed me, however, is how the servers did not spaz out even when I had a 4-player co-op going with people from around the US and on opening night no less.  Kudos.All in all, Reach is an excellent game, a truly good way to end the franchise... assuming they will.  Halo Fans will be delighted while casual gamers may find the ideal FPS game albeit with a little more difficulty than they're used to.All in all, a 9.5/10.  Solid A!  Kudos Bungie!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2010"}

Play space will vary with sensor placement and other factors.","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"A slice of the future","reviewText":"As far as Kinect for Xbox 360 was concerned, I was a staunch skeptic.  I am very happy to say, however, that Microsoft delivered an extraordinary product!  Kinect is revolutionary in what it does, and it's even more so when you take into account the fact that it's still seething with potential in what it can do in the future.  Now despite this, I will say that Kinect is not for everyone.  As of this writing, the software for Kinect consists of casual party games, minigame compilations, dance games and fitness games.  Essentially, there is nothing that gamers who exclusively play Halos, Call of Duties and Fallouts will find particularly enticing.  But anyone who wants to just have fun with more active games would do well to give this a try!The sensor is deadly accurate.  It's tandem cameras and microphone make controlling your Xbox 360 a fascinating experience.  By waving your hand, you can launch your games, music and video libraries from the new Kinect Hub on the 360 dashboard.  Even better, you can do these things with just your voice.  Saying \"Xbox Kinect\" opens up the Kinect Hub, and from there you can control anything on screen with voice commands.  It's slick!  As of now, only the Kinect Hub is controllable this way, which is to say you can't control the main 360 dashboard with Kinect yet.  However, I've been told that Microsoft is working on integrating all of your 360 experience with Kinect, so sit tight!  Controlling Zune videos is also done with voice commands, which is really nice!  Netflix doesn't work with Kinect yet, but this is also being addressed.  You can also set up a Kinect ID, which allows it to see your face and sign you in.Setup of the Kinect sensor is a breeze.  When you first turn on your 360 with Kinect, you will download a system update, and then go right into the calibration.  Once you place Kinect in the designated way, the 360 will do the rest.  You only need to be sure your speakers are on.  I've found that Kinect works in a huge variety of lighting situations.  Even if the light isn't particularly strong, the sensor has no problems seeing me and my gestures.  Most games for it take your picture, and the pictures looks very clear in low light which tells me just how adept this device is.  The only complaint I have is the space requirements.  Kinect generally needs between 6-10 feet of unobstructed space between the sensor and the player.  In my gaming area, my couch is up against the wall, and I have to stand right up against the couch for some games.  Multiplayer gaming needs at least 8 feet of space, so I cannot take advantage of this (I have to do multiplayer one-at-a-time).  The specific space needed depends on the individual games.  I also could not create a Kinect ID because the setup of this feature requires more space than I have.All in all, Kinect is more than I thought it would be.  It is an innovative, futuristic control scheme and it completely changes the way you see your Xbox 360.  I look forward to future improvements, as this thing could be just awesome down the road!Kinect Adventures -All Kinect bundles come with the game, Kinect Adventures.  This is basically a minigame compilation, similar to those that made the Wii so popular.  This game is really great at giving you a taste of what Kinect can do and the type of gaming experience it can provide!  You can play five minigames ranging from bubble-popping, a dodgeball-esque target game, a river-rafting course, an on-rails obstacle course and a fun \"plug the leak\" game.  Early demos of this package were very laggy, but I'm glad to say lag issues have been adequately addressed for this final release.  The game is very accurate and you should have no problems.  The only part that requires some odd timing is jumping, as that is still about a half a second delayed.  However, it is not game-breaking.  The space requirements for this game are also very light.  Single-player or one-at-a-time multiplayer can be done with 4.5-6 feet of space, with more space needed for two-at-a-time multiplayer.  The game also includes demos for Dance Central, Kinect Joy Ride and Your Shape: Fitness Evolved.  Overall a fun game for everyone to get right into Kinect!  4 stars for the Kinect Adventures game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

{"product_name":"B002I0IIPY","description":"","reviewerName":"evani1997","summary":"Amazing!","reviewText":"Sonic the Hedgehog is back in a Wii and DS exclusive game called Sonic Colors. The game has lots of cool features including high-speed gameplay, the 2D and 3D perspectives, multiple control schemes, and awesome power-ups.The storyline is that Dr. Eggman has created an amusement park to make up for his past crimes. Sonic and Tails are suspicious of his motives, so they decide to sneak in and find out what the egg-head is up to. It turns out that he's secretly capturing aliens called \"wisps\" to take the energy from them which can be used to control minds.The gameplay uses both 2D and 3D camera perspectives. The camera follows you very well, but sometimes in the 2D sections, the camera will be zoomed out so that Sonic will be hard to see. However, these moments are very rare. Like other Sonic games, your basic goal is to run, jump, collect rings (which are your health), bounce on springs, run loops, jump on robots' heads, and to finish the level as soon as possible. Most levels are fun and fast, but some are slower and not as fun. The game is broken up into different planets, each containing unique environments. Levels are accessed through a world map, similar to New Super Mario Bros. These levels can be replayed after beating them. The game is pretty easy to play, but there are certain levels that involve a lot of platforming, which can be difficult because Sonic runs so fast.Specifically for Sonic Colors, Sonic is granted special power-ups that come from the wisps. These powers being activated by shaking the Wii controller. In the game, you activate the wisp power ups by shaking your remote. On Wii, there are eight different colored wisps (the DS only has six). These wisps turn Sonic into a yellow drill, a cyan laser, an orange rocket, a pink spikeball, a purple monster, a floating, green creature, and a blue block that opens new paths in the levels. The white wisps give Sonic the ability to boost.Another great thing about the wisps is that they give the game lots of replay value. Certain areas in levels are unavailable the first time you play them because you haven't unlocked the specific wisp that lets you go there.  These wisps are unlocked as the story progresses.There are many different control schemes: the Wii remote and nunchuck, the Wii remote by itself, the Gamecube controller, and the classic controller. I recommend using the Wii remote and nunchuck. In this control setting, you can jump by pressing the A button (press twice to home attack), dash with the B button, slide with the Z button, and move with the analog stick. You can also side-step and drift, but only on specific parts of the game.Exclusively on Wii, Sonic Colors has a bonus feature called the Sonic Simulator which can be unlocked by grabbing the red rings within the story mode. The Sonic Simulator works with optional multiplayer. You can play as a Sonic robot or your Mii on Sonic's body.The graphics in Sonic Colors are incredible because of the amount of detail and color that the worlds and characters are given. Some of the worlds in the game include: the Sweet Mountain Zone which looks like a sunset-lit version of Candy Land; the Tropical Resort which looks like an amusement park at night; and Planet Wisp which looks like a construction site placed in the middle of a giant meadow. Because they are on Wii, though, the characters can be a bit edgy during cutscenes. Even still, these are some of the best graphics on Wii.The voices of Sonic and Tails have been replaced by new voices. Sonic is now voiced by Roger Craig Smith and Tails is voiced by Kate Higgins. Eggman is still voiced by Mike Pollock. I personally prefer the older voices, but these new ones aren't bad.The music in Sonic Colors deserves special recognition. All of the tracks are catchy, upbeat, and keep the game moving. Though past Sonic games had a more rocky soundtrack, this game has a more funky/pop sound to it. This is one of the only Sonic games that doesn't have any annoying songs.Sonic Colors is personally, my favorite game on Wii. The fast-paced gameplay, fun power-ups, replay value, eye-popping graphics, and awesome music make Sonic Colors a great gaming experience.Final Score: 9.1/10For more details on games such as this one, visit [...]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2013"}

Later that summer, I had my first chance to play the game, at a friend's house during our one night off. I was such a novice then and had no idea what I was doing. We played several rounds of the multiplayer levels and I got beat horribly every time. I was such a novice and having never made a kill once could have frustrated me enough not to want to ever play the game again. However, it didn't. I continued to play the game when the opportunities arose and when I purchased an XBOX for the first time several months ago, HALO was the one game I knew I wanted to play first.As far as games go, the campaign mode of the game isn't all that different from other sci-fi action games.  You play a super-soldier (the last of his kind) named Master Chief who is responsible for trying to save a crew and their captain from a bunch of aliens (called the Covenant) that the humans are at war against.  Along the way, Master Chief uncovers another deadly race of foes, called the Flood, that act like huge mobile viruses on legs that turn their victims into zombies. Gaming on normal level is fairly easy. The movie cuts that help explain the story are visually enchanting and the action is usually exciting.  Like many games, you basically run around shooting aliens and Flood, blowing things up, and moving from one point to the next.What makes HALO so unique, however, is the multiplayer options. The best part of HALO are the multiplayer options. Capture the Flag, Skull, King of the Mountain, and Slayer are all different mulitplayer games that can be played. These games can be played in several different formats and if one so chooses, one can create their own multiplayer version.  These games can be played with up to 4 people on a regular XBOX, but it an XBOX is hooked up online, the numbers are limitless.  The multiplayer options of HALO are what have made HALO famous, because HALO was the first console system to successfully monopolize on those options.Overall, HALO plays like many other video games. However, the game is a lot of fun to play and will always remain a classic because of the role it has in video game history.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2005"}

What was unexpected was that this was actually going to be a full-priced game. But it wasn't released for the DS. It was released for the 3DS.Steel Diver is supposed to be a game that should be enjoyed within small chunks of gameplay, not under one sitting.The basic gameplay is that you control a submarine. Not by using the D-Pad or the buttons, but by the stylus, of course (After all, it DID start life as a tech demo). There are controls on the bottom screen that you must slide or tap using the stylus to move the submarine or shoot torpedoes at enemy subs.While it does kinda simulate taking control of an actual submarine (or so it appears to be), it is actually a pretty fun experience. The only problem that I have is that when you try to battle an enemy ship, you still have to control your ship to restrain yourself from bumping into anything, and the enemy may attack after you get yourself ready. At least you can avoid getting hit and prepare yourself once you master it.One minor complaint that may be major for those who crave huge titles is that this game may not really be extremely lengthy.But overall, this is a pretty good game, and I assure you that your undersea voyage will be very enjoyable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"Great Game = Most Fun I'm Having on the 3DS ATM","reviewText":"Of all the 3DS games I've played and purchased so far, Ghost Recon is surprisingly the most fun of the bunch (sorry PilotWings).The reason?  The game's excellent gameplay and presentation.  They are really top notch.  The game is deep, requires careful planning when deploying your (very well diverse) squad.  I like how each squad member has specific pros and cons and how you need to really think carefully when figuring out how to utilize them in the most effective way possible.  Personally I love the unique differences, such as the role that the sniper and the \"ninja\" plays, etc.  This is definitely a solid SRPG game and fans of the genre will really enjoy the solid turn-based gameplay.I also really liked the cutscenes in the game.  Stylistically it fits the Ghost Recon theme very well and it is well produced and works very well in the context of the 3DS.The only reason why I docked one star is because this game really doesn't utilize the 3D effects at all.  I do like how the 3D helps emphasize the top/down look/feel of the game by adding little nuances such as depth/height of environments such as canyons or different floors of the map.  The smoke effects are also sort of neat, but frankly when I turned off the 3D, I had the same amount of fun with the game and didn't feel like the 3D really added to it.That being said, the game is still a solid title and definitely one of the best for the 3DS so far at this early stage.  I really think you can't go wrong by picking up this game, unless you really don't care for SRPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

The story, acting, and narration are all excellent.  I love the Max Payne feel to the narration and how the game is broken up into episodes like a TV show.  That may sound like it's cheesy but it's not.  The only things that make this a 4 star game instead of 5 for me is the lack of any upgrades and how you have to 'light' an enemy up before you can do any damage on them.  These are very small flaws, in my opinion, and really aren't flaws at all. As far as the upgrades, I probably wouldn't have noticed or cared a few years ago but now I've been spoiled by games like the Last of Us, which have all of the greatest aspects of gaming.  Having to 'light' an enemy up is one of the features in the game that help make it unique so I'm really not too put-out by it either.  It's not often too bad but sometimes makes parts a bit too frustrating.  The controls work pretty well except for having to constantly push down the right analog stick to center the camera back over the right shoulder.  Again, not something that I would have complained about in the past but I have got used to the Resident Evil style over-the-shoulder camera.  I wouldn't mind if I could just hit it once and then it stay on the right until I hit it again to switch to the left but it always seems to creep back to the left, forcing me to keep on it like a chore to get the angle that I want.  Either way, it's a fun game with great cinematics, items to find, and an almost noir style of storytelling.  For $20, it's definitely worth picking up.  Any fan of survival horror will find plenty of enjoyment, despite any small issues.Update- After playing through the whole game, I changed my score from a 4 to a 5.  This is a wonderful game and I love it.  I just wish it'd come out on PS3 so my friends that don't have a 360 could play it but I know the company has no plans to do so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8JS","reviewerName":"Saint Tardamus","summary":"Hopefully, a sign of things to come","reviewText":"I love rythm games, but I've noticed a disturbing trend in recent outings from the big boys.  Rock Band 2 was kind of ho-hum, and the last few Guitar Hero games just weren't much fun.  World Tour was decent, 3 was awful, and \"Smash Hits\" was barely worth a rental.  I haven't played the guitar hero band specific titles (aerosmith/metallica).The trend in recent games has been to start of slow, get harder, then get darned near impossible with a flurry of incomprehensible death metal at the end.  The the story arc of recent games is fun, fun, not as fun, frustration, trade in.The Beatles Rock band is very different.  Obviously by focusing on one band you limit the possibility of some genres sneaking in, but what I really enjoy about the game is that this famous rythm game story arc is blown away.  The game is fun from end to end, and doesn't suddenly get impossible and stupid at the end.Another great design note is the way the game follows the Beatles storyline.  It's a story everybody knows, but it's great to see it played in wonderful graphic pieces between sets.Wrapping Up:Pros:Excellent track list from start to finish.  Even songs I didn't know very well are good, and the great ones are amazing.Great design elements that make this feel more like a Beatles game than a rock band game.  The designers really treated the band and their image/music with the respect they deserve.Fun...bottom line, it's the most fun I've had playing a rythm game since the original Rock Band.Cons:Short.  Songs are short, game is short in story mode.  Lots of opportunity for replay value...but if you spent the 250 bucks on the LE version, you'll probably feel a bit ripped off.  To make that point, there's an achievement for beating the story mode in less than 24 hours.  I know I'll leave this game wanting more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2009"}

Sadly it's not.I'm engrossed by the story and I will definitely finish this game to the end, however, there are a lot of technical issues.The combat, while not too bad, feels loose and floaty.  The main character moves like players in old 3d sports games where everyone feels like they're on ice.  The perfect weighted character feel is that of Dark Souls.  If this game had that game's character feel, it would have been better.  This is not too much of a problem, the real detriments are the mechanics noted below.This games does not let you to drink potions while in combat.  Why not?  That's been the constant norm for every RPG that I know of.  Is it trying to be realistic?  Do I need to remind the developers their world consists of elves, dragons, and magic?  Realism is already out the window.  You're telling me a Witcher can use magic but can't find the wherewithal to put a potion bottle to his mouth while in combat?  Only brewing should be limited to out of combat.  For this reason I mainly use potions for boss battles since you won't know when you'll encounter random enemies.You cannot sort items in the inventory.  Good luck trying to figure out what you have and what you don't have, and you'll need to do so because every potion and crafted item requires a formula that you need to collect as individual items rather than entries in a journal or book.  Apparently our Witcher has never heard of the craft of book-binding.Somebody also had the bright idea of creating a trade system wherein you have to use the analog stick to control the number of items to sell.  Let people use the directional pad, it's more precise.Finally, something as mundane as picking up loot is really complicated due to the loose camera controls.Ultimately, these issues do not prevent this game from being fun, but it's not a 5 star experience as some claim it to be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVMYA","description":"","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"It feels like it has more problems than the DS Lite did, but it's still a solid unit.","reviewText":"I finally got around to buying a 3DS and selling off my old DS lite.  I'd been putting them off forever waiting for the price to drop, and good thing I did (since the price really did drop drastically)!  Well, I've had a chance to play at least one game on it, and to mess around with it in general.I can't help but feel that it's got a number of flaws that hold it back from being quite as satisfying as the DSlite was.  The 3DS feels a bit top heavy, as though the top half is a bit heavier than the bottom.  The audio jack is right at the bottom of the bottom of the unit, which means that if you are laying in bed with the 3DS resting on your chest while you play, you can't use the audio jack (same problem as the DSlite had though - I just wished they had changed it).  The stylus holder is in the back of the unit, where it is awkward to get to - it would've been better if the stylus and the audio jack positions were switched.  Also, the shiny finish shows fingerprints, but so did the old DS lite's finish.  I was kind of wishing they'd learned from their mistakes and made them matte to prevent fingerprints.Also, anyone's who done research on the 3DS would know that they all have a common problem where the unit can close too tightly and cause the bottom screen to put scratches on the top screen.  I had to attach bumpers to the top screen's corners to prevent this problem.  The 3DS also has a really crap battery life compared to the DSLite (literally 3 hours to the DS Lite's 10 hours).  Whenever you try to turn off the unit, it forces you to tap a thing on-screen first, all while warning you that you could just leave it in sleep mode.  WHY would a handheld with a battery this poor encourage you to leave it on?!  I've since learned that it's possible to skip having to tap the button by just pressing and holding the power button until it turns off.  It's madness!Alright, now that I've complained endlessly, let's talk about the actual features and good points of the 3DS.  The 3DS feels solidly built, and seems to function well in general.  I suppose the biggest draw of the 3DS for most people would be the 3D aspect.  I've found that the 3D effect does work perfectly, but it does give me a bit of a headache and so I usually keep it turned off.  I suspect that eventually it'll be recognized for the gimmick it is, and largely ignored by everyone.  Other than that, I suppose the other draw of the unit is the better internet browser.  It is indeed a nice internet browser that actually works well.  I can't complain there.  I do like the option to pause a game and exit to the main menu to use the internet browser (good for looking up FAQs) or to make notes using the in-game note-taking mechanic.  That's a rather nice feature.  It also seems like the 3DS is a good choice in terms of game library as many of the series you may have been a fan of of the DS have sequels coming out on the 3DS.  Of course, the 3DS is backwards compatible with older DS games, and that works fine.  DS games do look worse on the 3DS due to the increased screen resolution, but it's not too bad.  You can decrease the screen size by holding down Start or Select while tapping the game icon from the menu (just keep holding down the button until you see the game start up).  This improves the resolution but makes the image size tiny, so I don't know how useful that'd really be to anyone.Overall, I feel like the 3DS has loads more little irritants to its design that I have to fix or put up with.  It just feels like it has more problems right out the gate than the DS Lite did.  Despite this, it's still a solid good quality unit and I'm still glad I bought it.  I'm sure once I get used to it's quirks I won't be as bothered by the problems, and I'll get many years of enjoyment out of my 3DS.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHJAA","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Sophmore Slump","reviewText":"It used to be one of those adages that the second novel was always worse than the first.  This is no longer true, possibly because great first novels have become rarer.  But games, on the other hand, generally get better with each sequel.  Or that was the way it was before 2005.  I wasn't particularily happy with Suikoden IV, but it is Xenosaga 2 that is the current holder of my 'disappointment' award.  For which I will no doubt get blasted.Imagine that your production staff spent so much on improved character graphics that when the smoke cleared, there was only time to put together a core story with about 20 hours of play.  What would you do to inflate the story?  How about a set of 50+ mini-quests that send the player shuttling back and forth across known space.  How about a couple of record length cut scenes?  Throw in a battle system so complicated it takes hours to figure it out.  And to add insult to injury, make everyone move very slowly.  And there you have Xenosaga 2.  A game that really could have been great, drilled into the ground because of the wrong priorities.There's nothing really wrong with the story arc that a couple of additional 'missions' wouldn't have solved.  Instead some relatively trivial bonus dungeons are your reward for finishing the game.  Most of the side quest time is spent traveling, not solving or fighting.  They would have been more enjoyable if the player didn't have to keep flying back and forth between New Militia and the Foundation.  The battle system, which was complicated before now has too many intricacies to count.  Yet once you level up enough, brute force is just as effective as finesse.I have to concede that the character graphics are amazing.  Facial expressions are perfect and the effects are often lifelike.  But the overall graphic level is still pretty much the same as Xeno 1.  I like what they did, but I would happily have sacrificed the new, sexy Shion for more hours of play time.  Even the thrill of having the entire team play in bathing suits wears thin after a while.Hopefully this is just a one game slump.  The producers leave no question that there will be a Xenosaga 3, and I hope they put more emphasis on the story and less on Shion's designer outfit (well, MOMO and KOS-MOS look good, but Shion is always a bit frumpy).  At least this game has filled out the character roster and explained some of the mysteries of Zeno 1.  Hopefully, things will get better again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2005"}

I did have some issues with the camera angles, and in some areas it was a tad raunchy, but this is a Rockstar game. If you're somebody who is easily offended by sexual content, then this game is not for you. It is very mild in its existance and if you manipulate the facts enough, it in some ways ties into the storyline.This game isn't as repetative as the first Max Payne, however. There is 1 sniper mission. Also, I liked how you are not Max Payne (the dude) the whole time. In some places you switch to Mona Sax, Max's assistant and \"confidante\". Also, you do have some escort missions in which you have to protect someone, including Vinnie Gognitti (yeah i thought he was dead too).In total, I didn't like this game as much as the first one. The camera angels had a lot of flaws, and the control setup is horrible.

Whether or not that form is a Xbox 360 game disc, that's up to you but you can read below for details about that;I have been reading a lot of reviews stating that playing the 'Walking Dead' via an Xbox 360 disc is a poor choice so I'm going to walk you through my experience with the game disc version.Upon starting the game up I was prompted to download a 3MB update which I did.  I am now on episode 5 and have not experienced any game breaking issues thus far.  Maybe most the issues have been resolved with the 3MB update?  I cannot tell for certain as I did not play this game prior to the update.Some of the transitions between player controlled actions and dialogue prompts have been choppy and occasionally the game will stutter for no apparent reason.  After clocking in about 15 hours, these are the only issues I have come across.  Nothing game breaking.  These issues are annoying but do not completely take you out of the experience.If you were to buy this game one episode at a time it would cost $5 to download each one, 5*5=$25, not $30, you're paying an additional $5 for it coming on a game disc.It is up to you how you want to access this content but you might be able to save yourself $5 and have a better experience if you just download it one episode at a time, you will need an Xbox live connection anyways to get the update for this game disc.Either way, you'll have a good experience with this game, you just might have a better one in a different format.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

That's all I can say. Secret of Mana (SoM) and it's ilk that used the same game engine (most notably Secret of Evermore) defined, in my  heart, what a live action RPG should be. There where several key things  that defined the SoM game.One was the co-op play with another player  (up to three players total). This allowed the game to be put into the  &quot;play at parties&quot; pile. Games are fun by yourself, even more fun  when two skilled players are in on it. Sadly this is poorly implemented in  Legend of Mana (LoM). It's bad enough when the other player has a hard time  interacting with the game world. Worse when you have to go to a  &quot;special&quot; place for that second person to join. Even lower still  when the NPC's are unstable. By that I mean in SoM the two NPC characters  only left the main character alone for any great amount of time once, after  joining the party. LoM NPC's don't stick around for very long. At least the  other player can &quot;import&quot; their characters.The other was  the incredible item wheel. This gaming innovation allowed the player to  quickly select any item or spell in the heat of battle. This wonderful  innovation in gaming is sadly missing and once again players are forced to  suffer through menus.And finally, the battles stink. SoM allowed  complete and total freedom when dealing with the baddies (Except for the  level bosses). You chose to stay and fight or you chose to run for cover.  LoM battles are loaded on an area by area basis and running is not an  option. This isn't a problem at first but your patience will wear out very  quickly after you fought the same dang monsters for the 26th time.I  own the Japanese sequel to SoM. Suffice to say it is not fair to make this  kind of punishing leap to the American market when the American market  expects a sequel to SoM and not Seiken Densetsu 3. ALL of the key elements  that made SoM a sleeper hit in the US is missing in this one. LoM is  nothing more than an empty collectors item. Although this game does have a  few redeeming qualities. I gave one star to the eye-popping eye-candy,  which make this a great game to watch. And the colorful world is a joy to  explore, but strip it all away and what do you have? An empty game that is  trying to cash in on the underground success of SoM.I give another  star to the insight of ingenious programmer who configured the controls for  one-handed use. You'll need it when your brain reduces it's operating level  to a minimum while playing.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2000"}

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube.

The campaign mode plays as well as the first two entries but again there is little in the way of innovation in how the game is played. Of course, people would scream at radical changes just as they would at no changes. MW3 could have been improved more over MW2 but as it stands it is only a slightly better game than MW2.

{"product_name":"B006JKARN0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jerry P. Danzig","summary":"Time for a New Model","reviewText":"First let me say that GTV XL for under $20 is a no-brainer purchase for anyone who likes racing games.You just can't beat the bang for the buck, with so many cars, so many races, and so many tracks to race on.Let me say as well -- I'm sure glad I didn't shell out full price for this game when it first came out!Basically this latest version of the Gran Turismo series doesn't bring much new to the table; it lacks the \"wow\" factor that distinguished the previous editions when they first appeared on PS1 and 2.What is new here? New cars, some new tracks (I don't think I've encountered any yet in the few hours I've been playing), some new special events (races or training regimens apart from the central GT career races), a new opening credits sequence, and a new -- and annoying -- interface.Of course, the driving here is the piece de resistance, as the game calls itself the \"real driving simulator.\"  And the handling is indeed superb.  I have bought a $100,000 mid-engined Lotus, and the way the car goes from understeer to oversteer when you let off the gas is a thing of beauty.But then what kind of \"real driving simulator\" reflects almost no car damage after a collision?  If you smack into another car, you hear a \"boomp\" and get a nudge as though you're driving bumper cars at a carnival.  IGN claims that if you hit another car or a guard rail hard enough, your car will suffer damage, but whether that will affect your vehicle's performance greatly is another issue.And the game offers a number of frustrations to players, starting with the initial update and installation procedure on your PS3.  This truly takes hours -- I have NEVER encountered a game or program of any kind on any system that took so long to install!Then there is the clunky interface.  As others have noted, it feels as if different groups of people programmed different parts of the game, and no Steve Jobs was present to streamline the whole mess into one logical, functional, ergonomically optimized unit.For example, when you are awarded a new car after reaching a new level of driving experience, why doesn't it simply appear in your garage?  Why do you have to go claim it on a separate page called \"car delivery\" or something like that?  It's just another annoying, time-wasting routine, like some of the extra pages preceding race events that repeat the same information.As others have noted, it's also frustrating trying to enter some races and finding that your present vehicle is not suitable.  Rather than present you with a list of your current cars that are suited, you have to go back to your garage (or the delivery page, if you haven't claimed all your new vehicles)and go from one car to the next seeking an appropriate ride.I should mention also that I really don't see any great graphic improvements here from GTIV.  The world of Gran Turismo is much kinder to cars than people, few of whom are seen and few of whom speak or move in believable ways.  I noticed that some of the replays feature people moving in the audience, but if there are any animated bystanders on display while you're racing, I haven't seen them.I also haven't seen any weather effects yet after a few hours of racing, although I understand they're here somewhere...So if you like racing games, you certainly need a copy of GTV, especially at this price.  But Polyphony REALLY needs to rethink this game for the PS4, incorporating any number of improvements from an intuitive interface to collision damage to better environmental effects.  Perhaps THAT game will again elicit a \"wow!\"UPDATE: I finally saw some life in the crowd while racing at a special event.  Again, this contributes to the feeling that this game is a wild assembly of tracks and races from different times and different design teams adhering to various quality standards.  Meanwhile I still hate the interface -- I may have to go the instruction manual to figure out how to access cars in my garage!  And I wish there were more races in the career mode that are open to all vehicles.  It is SO annoying that you don't qualify for a certain race unless you drive some dumpy little Japanese car you really don't feel like spending game credit on.  Sigh.  Maybe it's time to try the arcade mode...PROS:* Great value.* 1,000 cars to race, many tracks, many races.* Best handling physics of any racing game.CONS:* Horrendously slow installation procedure, long load times (even after loading 8GB on hard drive).* Clunky, inefficient game interface.* No realistic collision damage.* Static environments.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}

Online multiplayer set in the Socom universe.  What more could you want?  Well, how about not having to download a firmware update, a patch, and then have the game tell you everything is corrupted?  It took me a while to get everything set up to play, and after I finally got to the menu screen, it took a while to find a game that would let me in.  When I finally got in, I had adolescent punks screaming at me to \"get the f**k out of the way\".  Not my idea of a good time.  That being said, the graphics are better than average (supports 1080p) and the gun play was fun.  The bluetooth headset is way nicer than the Jabra one that came with Warhawk.  You can customize your character's appearance (face paint, camo, helmets, uniform, boots, you name it).  Sound was very good.  You can hear fire fights taking place half a mile away, and it sounds pretty realistic.  The environments look very gritty with nice draw distances.  Menu navigation can be a little tricky.  I had to educate myself on what some of the terms meant.  It wasn't the most intuitive interface I've ever used.  Overall, it's not a bad game.  It was just the set up that was so problematic.  The game may not have been ready for prime time, but with some tweaking maybe Sony can get this thing running on all cylinders.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2008"}

Portal is Awesome!","reviewText":"The Orange Box is such an extremely good value that there is basically no excuse for you not to buy it. Included on the disc are Halflife 2, Halflife 2:Episode 1, Halflife 2:Episode 2, Portal, and Team Fortress 2.There is probably little need to say anything about Halflife 2, which was one of my favorite Xbox titles. Episodes 1 and 2 continue on in the same vein with the same quality and same level of fun. They are worth the price of the disc.In my opinion, though, the real story here is Portal! I predict that this game will become a classic in short order, and will almost certainly become the basis for further, larger games. Simply put, it is one of the most engrossing games I have ever played. It is primarily a puzzle game, albeit one based on a very novel concept. It is however, blended with just the right amount of ominous, slightly creepy, \"game-breaking\" that becomes the game behind the game. Just play the thing. You will wish it was at least TWICE as long.As far as Team Fortress 2 goes, I don't have anything to report yet, mostly because I don't have the free time required to get involved in an online team-based endeavor. It does look pretty sweet though. I'm not sure how conducive it is to casual play, as it seems to require a high-degree of coordination among player classes, etc.So, Orange Box is definitely 5 stars for Fun. It would get 6 stars for value, if there were a value category, and if it let you give 6 stars. It is the new \"must have\" title on the 360.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2007"}

I played all the main RE titles that came out on various systems over the years. When RE4 came out I thought the game would be similar to all the other RE's that came before it. Obviously it wasnt. And thats not a bad thing either. If you liked RE4 than u will like this one too.The gameplay is very similar to RE4. Only difference is that the graphics are better and the action is more intense. You still cannot walk while you have ur guns aimed at someone but thats not really a big deal to me.The graphics, as i mentioned, are really nice. That shouldnt be a surprise there. The acting in the game is pretty good too. But its the action that makes this RE the best one yet to me.There really isnt any puzzles that needs to be solved in this game as in previous titles. ITs pretty straight forwarD And u can get through the entire game without needing a strategy guide. You may need one for a few small parts but for the most part  the game is easy as far as navigating.If the navigating part is easy then the monsters are the difficult part. There are 4 difficulty levels. The first 3 (amateur, normal, vetern) are available to u right at the begining. The 4th difficulty (professional) wont be available until you complete the veteran difficulty once. I havent played veteran yet but based on some strategy guides I looked at its tough. The monsters are a lot stronger and they do more damage to u than u to them. And professional mode is 10 times as difficult as veteran. But that is the way it is with all games so if you play this game a lot then professional  mode wont b too intense. Also, this game has a feature where the longer you go without dying the harder it will become. The difficulty scale ranges from 0-10. Zero being the easiest. There is a limit though. If you are playing amateur mode (easy), for example, then the difficulty will go from 0-4. It wont go higher than that until you choose a harder difficulty. If you are playing normal it will go from 2-6 or something like that. Of course if you keep dying then the difficulty will stay at the lowest setting based on what difficulty u are using until you get good at the game. Professional mode, however, stays at a 10 difficulty level no matter how many times you die. Veteran mode maxes out at 9.They gave a lot of weapons in the game. Several different pistols, magnums, shotguns, etc. Lots of guns in this game. And most weapons can be upgraded as well. Just like in RE4, you find jewels and money in game that you can use to buy better weapons and and also upgrade them. The only ammo you can buy is grenade launcher ammo. Bullets and even grenades that u throw have to be found as you play the game. Ammo is scarce in this game as is health packs. (yes they still have green herbs and first aid spray cans).RE5 has always been about rewarding players when you beat the game and this one is no different. Ammo is scarce, yes, but you can get unlimited ammo for all the guns in the game except the grenade launcher i think. The way you get unlimited ammo is u upgrade that particular weapon fully and go to bonus features afterwards. You have to purchase the infinite ammo pack for the particular gun you want and then you have to turn it on. Its a really nice feature and you also can unlock speacial weapons that u only get after u upgrade a certain gun. If you beat the game under 5 hours you get the infinte rocket launcher.I dont have any major gripes about the game except i wish you can move around while aiming but maybe if RE6 comes out they might add that. This game is really fun and it has a lot of replay value to it. There are other features you unlock too after beating it once but you have to check them out yourselves.If you like RE games and 3rd person shooters than you might want to check this one out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Michael G. Lustig","summary":"One of the best FPS games ever","reviewText":"COD WaW is way different than COD4.  The first thing you notice is the grainy (almost Sepia) quality of the graphics.  That said, the cut scenes and the graphics are better that COD4.  Unlike anything made by Ubisoft or Unreal (IMHO their games blow), this games smokes all of the competition.Cooperative play is an interesting new feature to the COD series.  You can play in split-screen mode with another player.  Basically, it's solo mode for two (if that makes any sense).  If your comrade is injured, your have to find him and administer first-aid otherwise you both die.  I have 2 HDTVs and 2 PS3s and sprung for a second copy so my son and I can play cooperatively.  It's really cool playing zombie in cooperatiive play.  Oh yeah, don't forget to get your raygun in the second level.  Check youtube for some good glitches -- especially the one on the second floor in zombie mode (bring a flamethrower and an LMG).  Cooperative play on a smaller screens just doesn't work.I completed solo play in Veteran mode and it took about 20 hours.  Yeah, you get killed a lot and it takes forever to complete a mission -- but that's the point.  War isn't running into a room full of enemies and hosing them down with your machine gun without getting a scratch.  It's about tactics, planning and killing the enemy without getting yourself killed.  In Veteran mode, you have no choice other than to plan your moves, use the terrain to your advantage and proceed cautiously.  Simply put; it's hard to survive.  For some reason, I completed a level where you clear out the artillery from the Japanese caves but it doesn't register as a checkpoint so I got stuck and couldn't continue.  If you get stuck like I did the download a saved game from the Internet (for free).Other reviewers said they completed the game in under 10 hours.  I doubt it can be done that quickly unless they're playing at the Rookie level.  No way at Veteran level.There's some cool new fetures too: you can drive and fire a tank, and then there's also a flamethrower.  The tank is OK and the trick is to hang back and take out opponents one at a time -- using the landscape as cover against other tanks.  If you're up to flaming-up the enemy and watching them burn (some burning much more energetically than others), then this is a ton of fun in a sick kind of way.  In story mode, I've done entire levels with only the flamethrower despite its limited range (even though I was packing a LMG too).  This is possible because Activision programmed in a feature that the enemy doesn't shoot at you until you get close when holding the flamethrower.  You can prove this by switching to another weapon and you instantly get shot at.  It's a bunch of fun to burn down trees too.  A word of caution: You can burn yourself up if you walk into the flames.In Veteran story mode, ammo conservation is always an issue.  While your teamates seems to have an unlimited supply of ammo, you don't.  Swapping your weapon for an enemy's drop is an option but not in all cases.  For example, you don't want to drop your sniper rifle for a machine gun.  You're better off locating enemies using the scope and picking them off using a lesser weapon that you have a bunch of ammo for.Online play is good once you level-up to some decent weapons.  Keep in mind this is WWII so there's no lasers, night-vision and barely any scoped weapons.  Automatics are slow and not too accurate.  It takes several body shots to drop a target.  I find myself going for head-shots because a single shot does the job.  There's a new level called Bootcamp that you can play until Level 8.  There's a glitch that you can exploit to level-up more quickly.  Once you're in Bootcamp you can stay there indefinately as long as you don't leave.  In other words, you can level up to 44 in about 8 hours in Bootcamp.This game is rated M for Mature.  The rating is justified because there is some pretty graphic material and language.  For example, when you step on a land mine your legs get blown off.  This is way more intense than COD4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2008"}

Microsoft, you should be completely ashamed of yourselves for this sleazebag Games for Windows campaign that now means that games no longer support controllers that aren't for the XBox 360.  That's right folks, Microsoft cut Rockstar a huge check, and apparently one of the ways that Rockstar is paying them back is by disabling all support for gamepads like Saitek and Logitech.

The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"Happenstance Slugger \"taco\"","summary":"To rate this a five you would have to be in some sort of denial I have never heard of before.

The controls aren't difficult despite what people say , they just aren't that good. They are very similar to what thq has done on the previous UFC games so you will be able to pick them up quickly if you have played those in the past. The problem is they are less intuitive and responsive.This game does weird things like for instance counterpunching is pointless. you can sidestep and work a jab but the computer will still throw some spin kick strait through it. The only way it works is to use the perry system then counter which defeats the purpose. The stamina system makes no sense is unrealistic.The submission system is soo bad I usually dont even pay attention to the actual submission my character is doing. Judging is worse than real life to the point that the winner just seems like random selection.  It is not all bad , the game looks amazing.

It's definitely one of my favourite games in recent memory.  The story itself is nothing special, but it's well-acted and the characters work well together, so you really come to care about what happens to them.  It also has some good laughs.  The ending battle is really long and intense, and is very satisfying when completed.The biggest flaw with the game is the camera, as the professional reviewers pointed out.  Sometimes in a battle, it zooms in so close to you that you literally cannot see yourself or the enemies anymore.  It's as if it's pressed right into your shoulder.  You have to move around a bit, swinging blindly, until the camera backs off and you can see again.  These moments are frequent enough to be noticeable and to deduct a star, but not bad enough to ruin the experience of the game too much.  Another thing you should know is that it isn't possible to die while platforming (except in rare circumstances).  The game will not let you jump if there is nothing to connect with.  This is nice in a way because it's less frustrating than some other games, but also takes away a lot of potential challenge.At the price Amazon is currently asking for this game, it's well worth it.

Yes, the sound effects and some textures got a face lift as well, but all this still can't escape the fact that it is the HL engine and is three years old and still feels like it.That aside, the new campain is a blast. I was expecting more of the same as in OpFor, but Blue Shift shows that someone wanted to do more than that. That I ended up in Zen is no surprise, but that the trip was both creative in design and more part of the story impressed me.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"\"duobpm\"","summary":"A worthy addition to the Mario collection","reviewText":"After 6 years since the hit Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine is unveiled by Nintendo.  I for one was anxiously awaiting this game more than any other.  It is probably because I have loved every Mario game ever, well except Mario 2, but that is another story.  While Super Mario Sunshine contains all of the things that make a platform game great, it is just a tad disappointing as a Mario game.  Don't get me wrong the game is a good one, however, there are just a few things that make it slide from being worthy to Super Mario 64.The graphics are what you would expect from a Gamecube game.  They are all very beautiful and detailed, and a big improvement from the 64 version.  The water effects are amazing, especially in the Hotel level.  Seeing the sunset on the water is truly exceptional.  On the point of character design, Mario has never looked better.  The habitants of Isle Delfino are nice too, but they all look the same with the exception of color.  The only disappointment would be the enemies.  Most of them are just rip offs of the originals, and they don't even look that great.  The good, however, totally overcome the bad in this department.Sound/Music is up next and this is the part of the game that unfortunately fails the most.  The music for each level is just a tad too mellow for my tastes.  It does have a hawaiian ring to it though, so if you prefer jazzy tunes then don't let this disappoint you.  A remix of the classic Mario theme does appear in the game though, so there is some ups in that department.  The voice acting though is incredibly dull.  Peach sounds like a total ditz, the Chancellor has had a bit too much caffeine, and Mario is confined to the usual grunts and yells.  So, basically while the music and sound is lackluster, it is something that can be overlooked.The gameplay is what you would expect from a next gen Mario game.  Nintendo decided to go with the collect-a-thon style gameplay with this one as well.  You go through a total of 6 unique worlds each with their own objectives.  Passing these objectives will earn you a &quot;shine&quot;, similar to Super Mario 64's &quot;stars.&quot;  There are 120 in all but only around 75 are needed to get to the final boss.  The main new thing in this game is the use of a water pack called &quot;FLUUD.&quot;  With it you can spray gunk to uncover items, attack enemies, boost high in the air, or glide across the water.  Along with this Mario has retained his old moves such as side flip, the double and triple jumps, and more. There is also the addition of &quot;Challenge Levels&quot; which will bring back some great platforming memories.  Though challenging and sometimes frustrating (i.e. throwing the controller against the wall) these levels give some spice to the game.All in all, while this game has its frustrating moments, and even sometimes repetitive ones.  It is still a great platform game that is essential to any Gamecube owners library.  Some will love this game just for the fact that it is Mario, while others will find this game to more of a gimmick than anything.  I, however, looked past the minor problems and really enjoyed the game.  If you are a fan of platform games in general, a Mario fanatic, or just want to sit down and enjoy a challenging game, Super Mario Sunshine will not disappoint.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2003"}

I've been waiting on this ever since I fell in love with the previous Atlus title Demon's Souls, and having given it some serious time since yesterday I've got an observation. This game is a fun throwback. Agree with those who say it's worth it just for the return to yesteryear, but also agree with those who say it's just a slick copy of Zelda with little new to offer. I think the disparity is in HOW developers pay homage to classic games for those of us who seek and love that \"nostalgic\" element. Demon's Souls was an incredible nextgen game with a throwback to the gameplay style of 8-bit games, where unforgiving levels literally drive you to the brink of insanity. That just makes success all the more sweet due to how hard you work to achieve it. I hadn't screamed and accused the computer of cheating so much since 1989, all because after I died I had to start all the way back at the beginning and that sucks (and rocks). Unfortunately, Atlus's new attempt to pay homage to classic games falls a bit flat because it's not replicating the gameplay style so much as the aesthetic and plot simplicity of a beloved set of classic games. The result, while fun, leaves you a bit empty and longing for the original. Still, it's not a full-price game, so there's that too. Overall a fun but shallow homage to (some of) the things, not all, that made classic 8bit so great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2010"}

It's difficult to separate nostalgia from objective features that make the game so gosh darn great, but remember that the nostalgia exists precisely because it is that great.Graphics:There are games on the SNES that utilize better technology such as pre-rendered models (Killer Instinct, Donkey Kong Country), but the old 16-bit era was one of artistry without realism. Hi-res graphics didn't matter as much because most games were interactive cartoons. A Link to the Past is precisely that, and I don't think that it could be much improved in the graphic department. The GBA port is exactly the same in graphical style, as well it should be.Controls:In contrast to the original Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past allows you to move in eight directions. Zelda players who have enjoyed Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask might wish for the ability to use more than one item at a time, but you're unfortunately limited to one here. AlttP's collision detection is great.Music:Koji Kondo has produced many little melodies for Nintendo over the years, most notably the Mario theme and (of course) the Zelda theme. In A Link to the Past, we're treated to a number of different ballads, all of which are of remarkably high quality. There's the mysterious melody that plays in the Lost Woods, which corresponds perfectly with the visuals and ongoing storyline. When Link works toward his final assault on the game's antagonist, we're treated to a truly epic sounding march theme, which is again perfect for the scenario. The melodies sound good on their own, but what makes them great is that they all correspond so well to game events.Gameplay:A Link to the Past is challenging, but not hard. When facing enemies, there are a number of different ways to dispose of them. But most of them, from mind-controlled Hylian Knights to final bosses, have a vulnerability which can be exploited to make your gaming session a little easier.Unlike the original Legend of Zelda, there is a prescribed order to proceed through the dungeons. However, this order is, at points, more of a suggestion. Often enough, there's nothing stopping you from going ahead to later dungeons if you can't best the final boss. The first time I played through this, I remember jumping ahead and beating the last dungeon to see if I could skip all those enemies that I couldn't beat. Hehe.. you still have to clear every level, even if you do that.Suffice it to say that A Link to the Past had the right mix of storyline development and player freedom, a feat I'd consider unmatched by any later entry into this franchise.Lasting Appeal:Seeing as I've played through it far more times than I'd care to admit, it's safe to say there's some lasting appeal in this game. The fact that the enemies can be killed in so many different ways allows you to try out different strategies each time you proceed through the game.Pretty much every game is touted as the best game ever made, but few games have been hailed as such as consistently as A Link to the Past. There's a reason for that, and I think it's more than mere nostalgia.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2012"}

Featured here are 40 great Genesis games, as well as nine bonus unlockable games from arcades and Sega's Master system. Sure we get those tried and true classic games seen before on other Sega compilations, such as the Sonic series, the Golden Axe trilogy, the Shinobi, Ecco, and Vectorman games, Altered Beast, Columns, Kid Chameleon, and other old favorites besides; but there are a few new additions here that will definitely hold your interest. Playing the Streets of Rage trilogy, E-Swat, Fatal Labyrinth, the Shining Force games, Alien Storm, Dynamite Headdy, and the always underrated action/RPG Beyond Oasis are all here, and are all still incredibly fun to play. And yes, even though Comix Zone and Phantasy Star II, III, and IV are here again, they're still some of the absolute best examples of what the Genesis had to offer. Even though there are still some omissions that I would love to see on a Genesis compilation like Eternal Champions, Outrun, the Toe Jam & Earl games, or the amazing Gunstar Heroes (though I'm not sure if Sega or Treasure own the rights there), this collection is still spectacular regardless. Bonus unlockable games include the arcade versions of Altered Beast and Shinobi, the arcade smashes Zaxxon and Space Harrier (still no After Burner) as well as the original Phantasy Star from the Master system among others; and there's a wonderful amount of extra material and a lovely presentation as well.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

They're the one aspect of the Rogue Squadron games that have always rocked. It's the on-foot missions that bring the game down a bit. For starters, it just feels so clunky, and taking control of the heavy-repeating blaster (the gun that the Storm Troopers use) is a little frustrating since the aim centers.As for the flight missions, they are so tight. My favorite mission so far is Attack on the Executor.

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"mike","summary":"Justified buying my ps4.","reviewText":"I bought a ps4 a few weeks ago just for this game. Ive been a fan of the series since the first one and never thought I'd see a third game based on the ending of 2. So when i saw a trailer during e3 my only thought was \"well looks like I'm buying a ps4.\"Story-I'm sure you read about the story so i won't explain it but share my thoughts on it. Although I will say you don't need to know anything about the first two to understand the plot of this one. The story is the simplest one of the 3 and losses a lot of it's comic book feel. Now that may sound like negatives but that really didn't bother me at all. The characters at first i wasn't to attached to like I was in the first two games but they really shine and make you care during the second half of this game. It gets really intense and makes you care. So in the end the simple plot left me feeling fulfilled and glad i played the game.Gameplay-The gameplay works a lot like the first two but tweaked and smoothed out. I always enjoyed the action part of these games but this one really stepped it up adding all the new powers and allowing you to chain moves together to easily take down enemies. I strongly suggest experimenting with the different moves of each ability. Another thing that i enjoyed is that you get more then one ability in the game. Once you've unlocked one you can switch between all of your abilities by finding a source for it. There are 4 abilities in the game. And a few of them make moving around the city and climbing a lot better and faster. With some of them you just go up buildings in a few seconds and don't need to take slow painful time to climb up buildings anymore.Verdict-With a compelling story and extremely refined gameplay  makes this just an extremely addicting game that I play whenever I can. But if you played either previous titles of infamous and weren't engaged in them I'm not sure you'll feel any different with this one. Im already 34% through my second play through and the game just came out 4 days ago. It totally justified buying my ps4 and makes me excited about this game generation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

Beautiful, actually. There are some boss battles that are pretty astounding in how they are presented. There's one moment at the very beginning where a creature named Green Eye appears and the size of this thing is enough to make your jaw drop. There's also another moment when you're running across an open field getting chased by this monstrous worm thing that is an experience on its own. This is definitely a game that benefits from being played on an HDTV setup with surround sound.But then the story kicks in and you can't deny that it makes very little sense, not to mention the fact that the hero of the story is really not an interesting character to begin with. The gameplay itself is a bit repetitive and really, the game just amounts to little more than eye and ear candy. Even when you're not on foot and riding around in the mechs, it just doesn't add up to any memorable experience.The online portion of the game isn't enough to make you want to play it a lot, especially with games like Gears of War and Rainbow Six: Vegas out there. It's kind of stale and just not that interesting.I'm really down the middle on this game. I'd say that it's worth a rental and then if you like it, get it.

The Glade of Dreams being overrun by bad things (again) is just an excuse to play some more Rayman, and with the awesome gameplay experience it is, I'm actually okay with that.I dabbled in the previous entry (Rayman Origins), and while I enjoyed it, I prefer this entry much more. The learning curve is a little less steep while the controls are just as tight, the graphics just as pretty, and the humor even more hilarious (I don't know why, but hearing a crowd go &#34;Ooooo!&#34; every time I find a secret area makes me chuckle). The levels here stood out much more to me, especially one that was based on the background music's rhythm.One thing I like about this game as opposed to some other games in the genre is that all the tools are accessible at the very start of the game. Nothing grates me more than seeing something in a level I can't access because I need some move I'm going to learn five hours later so I can come back.This game is definitely better with friends, but is still pretty entertaining on its own. Legends started out as a Wii U exclusive, and it shows - and is the reason for me knocking one star off. On the Wii U, the player using the Gamepad takes on the role of Murfy, who manipulates the environment (moving platforms, cutting ropes, poking giant carnivorous snakes in the eye, that sort of thing). In this PS3 version, Murfy is mapped to a context-sensitive press of the circle button. I found the implementation to be pretty off. Especially early on, the levels Murfy is in tend to simply be move-have Murfy clear path-jump to platform-have Murfy move platform-move-Murfy-move-Murfy... you get the idea.In some of the challenge levels with Murfy, though, he doesn't react nearly as quickly as I'd like. In one instance you're speed-running through a dungeon while a wall of flame is chasing you, and as your running and jumping you need to have Murfy move platforms to clear your path. In some instances I ran into a catch-22 - I needed to move slower so Murfy could select and move the right platform, but in doing so I'd get caught by the fire. It was a Super Meat Boy-level of challenge unnecessarily introduced into an otherwise fairly carefree game.My gripe about Murfy is really just nitpicking though, as pretty much every other aspect of this game is superb. If you've ever liked a platformer, or need some good couch multiplayer, Rayman Legends is definitely a good pick.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:Greatly improved graphics from the originalExcellent storytelling, especially for the genreStrong enemy artificial intelligenceCons:Cooperative mode is dullDeathmatch only supports 2 players","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"If ya played it on PC, ya played it here","reviewText":"Well, they didn't screw it up. That may seem like a back-handed compliment, but in the case of Half-Life, which many of us consider the greatest computer game ever made, this is high praise indeed. The classic tale of Dr. Gordon Freeman's encounter with government duplicity, a science experiment gone wrong, and horrid visitors from another dimension are all here as they were. Even people who have never touched a first-person shooter know the story. In the middle of an experiment with a mysterious substance, a portal to another dimension opens, spilling into Dr. Freeman's world thousands of grotesque creatures. He must make it out of the Black Mesa facility to find help. Early in the adventure, he discovers that the U.S. troops are already here, but for some reason they are shooting at him. Why would the government want to eliminate all witnesses to this strange alien invasion? That becomes the mystery of Half-Life, still one of the great ones all these years later, even with dated graphics, poor voice acting, and the inherent limitations of a gamepad. To say that Half-Life is a well-balanced, finely orchestrated single player experience is to slight a design that has never been equaled. It is the measure of a tightly scripted adventure. Freeman starts in the bottom of Black Mesa and makes his way up, through ruined halls and air ducts, across radioactive pools and up enormous ventilation shafts. The genius in this machine is the pace. Freeman is challenged relentlessly but never tediously by ceiling and floor cave-ins, timed explosions, loose electrical wires, and of course a menagerie of creatures that all look variously like animated slabs of meat on feet. While much of the action takes place in an underground lab (and some in surface locations), Half Life maintains a remarkable feeling of variety. The assortment of enemy challenges and obstacle puzzles is so ingenious that you forget that you are spending most of your time among gray institutional walls, and the wave after wave of problems somehow never feel forced. The designers make the usual assortment of FPS conventions live by pulling Freeman and us into the strange conspiracy at the heart of the game in a natural, unobtrusive way. Even the best of game designs can be killed by poor control, and in the FPS category it is especially hard to get a console controller to have the speed and accuracy of a desktop mouse, which is the way God intended us to play shooters, after all. The Half-Life control scheme is about the best we have seen on the PS2 or any console. Front, reverse, and strafing commands fall to the left control stick, while up, down, left, and right pivots go to the right joystick. Shoulder buttons handle jumping, crouching and firing, while the directional keys flip through the weapons inventory. It takes mere minutes to get used to the scheme, in part because the action is so responsive to the controller. Since aiming quickly is very tough with a joystick, Half-Life for the PS2 institutes lock-on targeting, which lets you lock your aim and track on a moving enemy. It is a helpful feature, in most cases, but unless you hit the lock-on button a second time to release the targeting, your gun seems to be inexplicably locked just when you need it to blast that wet sock of an alien that just crept up behind you. Half-Life has a modest arsenal compared to most shooters (rifles, remote-detonated bombs, grenade launchers, etc.), which is fine since this is one shooter that stresses level design, puzzles and plot rather than pyrotechnics. The same holds true for the graphics. It looks as if Sierra's developer Gearbox lifted all of the fuzzy texture maps straight from the three-year-old original. The enemy and ally bodies have gotten an upgrade, more detail in faces and bodies, but this game is not pushing PS2 hardware by any means. HL was always strong on sound, and the same is true in this port. The ambient tracks are menacing throughout, and many upcoming situations are telegraphed by distance sound cues. While the masterful single-player mode is the feature attraction here, the PS2 Half-Life adds a new co-op mission called Decay. This scenario follows the same timeline as the main storyline, but you play part of it through two female characters who are elsewhere in the Black Mesa complex. A single player can switch back and forth between the characters in order to overcome various puzzles, or two players can play in split screen mode. There is also a head to head mode in which two players run a split screen deathmatch for a designated time on select levels. While nice add-ons to the original Half-Life, Decay and Head-to-Head modes are no reason to buy this port. But that's the good thing about this game. Even if you did play it years ago, it is worth a revisit in this competent translation to the PS2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000P297EI","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Same formula as part 3, but somewhat improved","reviewText":"Devil May Cry 4 is the first in the series to be on the PS3 and it truly shows. Dante returns to slay a whole new army of demons, but once again he's not alone. A new character named Nero, who looks VERY similar to Dante, joins his fellow white haired hunter in this latest adventure. Instead of going the way of Devil May Cry 2 where you control Dante for the majority of the game over the new character Lucia, this game has you control Nero for about 60% of the game, while Dante is the lead man for the other 40%. In a way, this game is more like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, which had you control rookie Raiden for much longer than you controlled Solid Snake. Fortunately, Nero is a more worthy replacement for a lead character, but most fans will still of course prefer Dante. The game takes place in Nero's hometown of Fortuna, an island somewhere out there with a city full of people who worship Dante's father Sparda as a god. Nero is one of the Holy Knights of Fortuna's Order of the Sword, whose job it is to follow Sparda's example and defend the human world from demons. The game begins with Nero and most of the townspeople attending a gospel-like lecture at a cathedral where the Order's leader Sanctus is preaching to his people about Sparda; then Dante drops in through the stained glass window on the ceiling and murders Sanctus in front of everyone. As Nero, you duke it out with Dante, he leaves, and then demons start attacking the city.From there you control Nero as he tracks down Dante to find out why he killed Sanctus. About halfway through the game you're put back into Dante's comfortable shoes to right all the wrongs that have occurred. The game plays with the same fast-paced ferocity we've come to know and love from the previous games. It actually plays exactly like the third game, but with slightly tighter controls and more balanced difficulty. Make no mistake, while this game is thankfully easier than the third one, it's by no means a cake walk. The demonic enemies are as freakish and fun to fight as ever, and the boss fights are a blast. Dante and Nero have the same controls, but different kinds of blade attacks. Dante plays the same as he did in the previous game, armed once again with his sword and pistols, but later gets his hands on more diverse weaponry (wait until you see the Pandora). There are some improvements to Dante's gameplay moves as well. Now you can switch between ALL melee weapons and firearms on the fly with the shoulder buttons instead of only having immediate access to two of each weapon type at a time. Also, instead of having to choose to stay with one Style (Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Trickster, Royal Guard) at a time, you can switch between all four styles with the directional buttons. You no longer have to wait until you reach upgrade statues or be between missions to switch your weapons and styles like in the previous game.As for Nero, he only has access to his sword Red Queen, his revolver Blue Rose, and his demonic right arm the Devil Bringer, but that's sufficient for him. The Red Queen has a revving fuel injection system (like a motorcycle handle) that gives his sword swings a fiery charge and increases their damage and speed. Timing the revvings with the sword swings to make continuous charged strikes takes time to master and adds an extra bit of challenge to the gameplay. The Devil Bringer is something else entirely. It's an upgradeable ability that has Nero's demonic right arm release a ghostly, luminescent extension of itself to grab enemies of all sizes, either up close or at a distance, and perform devastating smashing attacks on them. Tougher enemies and bosses have to be stunned first before Nero can use the Devil Bringer on them. He could also traverse through certain areas and reach higher ground by grabbing distant grapple points and pulling himself in with the Devil Bringer. This move is activated with the circle button and is Nero's answer to Dante's Styles list. Overall, I still prefer Dante over Nero since he's a bit stronger and his physical attacks can stun enemies more quickly, but Nero is a good character by his own right. In terms of character personality, Nero is a bit of a jokester and has a similar \"I don't give a crap\" attitude as Dante, but he's generally more serious, especially when someone he cares about is put in danger. Dante is still the same as he was in the first game with hints of his younger self from the third game, which is great: that's the Dante we all know and love, a laid back smart @ss who can take anyone on.Now, special mention has to go to the graphics. This game is beautiful: the character designs and environments are wonderfully detailed, crisp, and clean. They look almost real enough to touch. The lighting and particle effects are especially great, from the burst of a demonic fireball to the Devil Bringer's ethereal glow. With this game's diverse array of characters and enemies, as well as the unusually bright environments (not very common in DMC games), one could easily mistake Devil May Cry 4 for a Final Fantasy game at first glance. The music is a lot of the same rock and metal music (which I love) and the occasional orchestral scores, which fit the game as always. One problem I have with this game is its story. Without spoiling anything, I'll say this much: it's like they came up with something that could really interest the gamer and then decided to leave it unfinished. After all the bad guys are dead, the game leaves you hanging with regards to Nero and who the heck he really is, not to mention what his connection is to Dante. There are a couple of indirect hints as to his identity and background, but they're much too ambiguous, and in a more annoying than interesting kind of way. It's like Capcom told us it has a yummy treat in its hand, held it out to us, then yanked its hand back and said \"you'll have to wait another three years to get this treat.\" As a lover of stories, to me this is a real pain, hence the four star rating. Plus, the game is a bit repetitive with recycled enemies and level designs. I don't mind a little repetition in certain games, but even I found it a bit much in this game. When you start controlling Dante, you go through the exact same levels as you did with Nero, only backwards. Still, Devil May Cry 4 is a blast from beginning to end. Here's hoping part five will be great also, and that it answers some questions about either Dante or Nero's past (hopefully both).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

A Classic!!!","reviewText":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (the game) by EA Games is sooooooo much fun in so many ways.  From the fantastic graphics to the breathtaking story, this game will keep you interested for many hours of gameplay to come.  Here is why you HAVE to buy The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers for the Nintendo GameCube.1. Gameplay: So much fun!  The basic story is well...you start out on Mount Doom (in the Fellowship of the Ring.  You play first through the first movie, then the second in the Two Towers.  Great deal ($$$)), where u take on as the character Isiledor (don't know how to spell his name).  You learn all of the basic moves: block, attack, fierce attack, etc...  Then u are ready to begin your battle to destroy the ring!Before each level u choose a character: either Legolas, Gimli, or Aragorn.  Gimli is EXTREMELY strong and high on health, but is a very slow attacker.  Legolas is fast, quick, with swift attacks, and very strong moves.  Unfortunantly, he is the weakest of the 3, and dies much quicker.  And last, but not least, Aragorn, with a swift and cunning sword, and an awsome bow and arrow, is the most balanced of the 3.  Strong, a good fighter, and pretty fast, Aragorn will get u through almost any obstacle.  A very good fighter indeed.When u beat a level, it gives u points on certain things.  How well u fought, your health, your supplies, how many kills u got.  With the \"points\" u earn, u can buy upgrades for each character and boost their level up to a 10.  You can sometimes buy new equipment, new moves, new powers, etc...it's really cool.  And u can go back and do each level as the other 2 characters, so u can get all of them up to a 10.  In the end u have an awsome fighter, and it's really cool to see a super strong Legolas fighting dozens of Orcs, or to watch a powerful Gimli cut through dozens of Orcs in Dwarf style.As for the gameplay itself, it's sooo much fun!  Battleling through dozens of Orcs, shooting arrow after arrow, and defending your other soldiers.  Imagine Helm's Deep brought to life, trying to stay alive as Legolas, shooting Orc after Orcs with arrows, and using fierce attack when it they get too close.  This game is a blast, and the ability to earn points and upgrade your character just adds to all the fun.  The gameplay is so addicting, and I always come back within a few hours of stopping for MORE!!!2. Graphics: While the screenshots didn't look all that impressive, during gameplay, they look fantastic!  You fight dozens of Orcs, each with the horrible, menacing teeth and face, body, and the armor to go with it.  Flaming arrows fly toward you from hundreds of yards away.  Respond with arrows of your own!  Fight off the Ring Raithes from decending on Frodo, or fight with man-kind as you battle through Helm's Deep!  It's soooooo cool, and the graphics bring it to life.  Don't judge it by the screenshots, just trust me.  During the game, they look AWSOME!!!3. Replay Value/ Sound: To go with all this is the voice acting from the movie it self, and the sounds are awsome.  Here an arrow THUD into an enemy, or hear swords clash in a huge underground battle.  The sound was fantastic, and to go with everything else, wraps this up in a perfect package.  But that's not all!  When completing certain challenges, u can see clips from the new movie itself, and watch even the making of the game, and interviews of the men and women who made the whole Lord of the Rings experience so fun to be a part of!  Very well put together, the unlockables will keep u begging for more!As for the replay value, it's just so much fun to go back and try to beat it again in a new game, and of course, to raise the difficulty setting (easy, normal, hard).  All in all, it's a true blast!  Or tryin to go back and earn more points each time!I hope this helped, and helped convince u to pick up this incredible game.  You won't be dissapointed!  Through all of the awsome gameplay, the incredible fun, and the overall depth this game dives into, this is a must-have, a classic, and a game no action loving gamer should be without (not to mention any major Lord of the Ring fan).Thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2003"}

Chance \"World's Oldest Gamer\"","summary":"Tough Game to Master","reviewText":"Many games (most?) have a really rough (tough) section to get through.  You need to have a lot of patience to get from A to B.  Dead Space has such a spot.  Isaac must go to the bow of the spacecraft, sit in a gunner's chair, and try to swat all of the fast approaching asteroids from the ship's path.  There is a time limit to this.  At one point, a female voice says, \"hull integrity less that 50 percent.\"  A couple of asteroids later she says \"hull integrity critical\".  Meanwhile this male counterpart of Isaac is trying to fix the auto fire system.  He says such assinine statements as \"almost there,\" \"one more minute,\" and \"i've almost got it.\"  And then you blow up.  There's no pattern and no other indication of your progress other than that.When I finally got past this area, there was a nutcase with a pet monster to contend with.  The problems just seemed to be getting tougher and tougher.  You need to be persistent and keep trying to do what seems to be impossible.  When you finally overcome a particularly rough segment, you can't help but feel relieved and chomping at the bit to move on.  Just be ready to run into another solid wall of opposition.There are two videos worth watching:  DEAD SPACE:DOWNFALLDead Space: Downfall(a prequel to the game) and DEAD SPACE:AFTERMATHDead Space: Aftermath(a prequel to Dead Space 2.  They fill in a lot of blanks.  But I also recommend the book DEAD SPACE:MARTYRDead Space: Martyr.

Sound quality not what it should be.","reviewText":"If you are looking for great sound quality, keep looking. I let these &#34;burn in&#34; on my PC for a 10 hours, playing various music from classical to death metal, then tried them on out the PS3 (don't own the PS4). The headphones, depending on what Tone mode you choose, don't sound horrible, but they never come to the quality of sound you would and should expect from a $150 headset.I own a few TB headsets and I've compared the sound from them to this, and the XP 400 really does sound better than this set, and at the time of this writing it is about $30 more. It's $30 extra well spent, and even though it says &#34;Xbox 360,&#34; it works on the PS3, no problem. It doesn't do PS4 out of the box, you need another adapter (available from Turtle Beach), so if the PS4 is your sound target for this set, you might want to wait, or check if older TB sets can be made PS4 compatible.I also have the PX 51 (much more expensive than this set), and it also sounds better than the PX4s. I would struggle recommending them over this set to someone looking at these because it is a $100+ premium on top of the $150 for these. That set is compatible with the PS4 with an update though.Setup is easy (on PS3, and works on PC/Mac if you have optical out). Sound quality is OK. Chat quality is very good, so Skype on the computer, and voice chat over PS3, sound great to both me and the person who is on the other end listening to me speak.In the end, if you need PS4 capability, this might be the easiest set to purchase. It almost definitely is NOT the best set to buy though, given the sound quality isn't quite as good as even the XP400s that are two generations older than this set.Not recommended unless you absolutely need PS4 capability and must have it right out of the box without an update or another adapter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2013"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Marella","summary":"Try again SEGA","reviewText":"Sonic Unleashed is yet another failed attempt at reviving the franchise based on an anthropomorphic rip off of Super Mario.

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

Music is still there, but usually in creepy hallways or rooms with dangers.GameplayOn a scale from 1-10, 1 being like trying to move a logging truck with your own bare hands, and 10 being like the best amusment park you've ever been to, I give RE a 9.

This action-packed follow-up to Monolith Productions's award-winning supernatural shooter F.E.A.R. begins where the previous game left off. This time, you'll come up against Alma's powers from the perspective of special forces operator Michael Becket. After an enormous explosion has devastated the city of Auburn, you'll quickly discover that what seemed like an ordinary mission to retrieve and interrogate Genevieve Aristide is anything but..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Ghoulish supernatural enemies give F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin a horrific, cinematic feel.View larger.You'll explore and do battle in the dark corners of the ruined city of Auburn.View larger.An enhanced graphics engine offers more dramatic effects.View larger.Improved enemy AI means you'll need better tactics.View larger.Project Origin Run Amok: Alma's BackgroundFans of the first game will be familiar with the suspenseful story surrounding the psychic Alma, a peculiar and disturbing odyssey that adds depth to her devastating quest for revenge and immediacy to gameplay. Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Gareth Mc Bride","summary":"An Amazing Follow Up To The Original Classic","reviewText":"After a nearly four year wait, two expansion packs, a change of publishers, and a title change, the follow up to our 2005 Game of the Year award winner F.E.A.R. is finally here. After successfully obtaining the rights to the name F.E.A.R., the new sequel is called F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin instead of the planned Project Origin. Regardless of what it is called, developer Monolith Productions and Publisher Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment have unleashed one of the best 3D shooters and action games ever made.These time out players are put in the role of Sgt Michael Becket as you and your team are dispatched to obtain Aristide, an executive with Armacham Technology Corporation. Starting roughly thirty minutes before the climatic events that concluded the first team, you race through various locales doing battle with private security and fearsome Armacham Black Op soldiers as well as the deadly Replica soldiers.Following a spectacular visual sequence, the player wakes up and finds that he has been altered and now has superior reflexes and speed which like in the original allows players to enter a bullet time mode and move much faster than your enemies and their gunfire. This as before, results not only in a wide range of possible tactics but some truly amazing combat as gunfire whizzes past you in slow motion as do clouds of fire, debris, and blood.With his new abilities, Becket has drawn the attention of Alma who appears throughout the game and when she is knock off and brutally dispatching all those in her path, and thinning the ranks of Becket's support team, she is grappling with Beckett himself. In one of the games new combat features, players can grapple with Alma and other enemies by clicking the mouse buttons. Successfully clicking the buttons fast enough allows players to land a blow and gain a tactical advantage. If a player is to slow, they often do not get the chance to recover from their mistake.It is learned that Alma is attempting to absorb Becket, and with the surviving members of his team, he must battle against legions of enemies and get to a top secret facility in order to amplify his new powers. It is hoped that once this is done, Becket will have a chance to face and defeat Alma and that only he alone can end the destruction that has been unleashed.This of course is easier said than done as a never ending legion of foes with some of the best A.I. and tactics you will ever face are waiting for you. The great ability that enemies displayed in the first game to take cover and avoid fire has been enhanced as enemies will not set traps, move objects as they advance to provide rolling cover, leap, roll, and jump to avoid incoming fire.In a nice twist, players can now use objects to provide cover such as knocking over a table or desk.One of my favorite tactics was to pull over an object and then place a proximity grenade shortly before activating my bullet time and moving away at a high rate of speed. Once normal speed resumed, enemies that made the mistake of advancing on my position often got an unexpected surprise.The game also has explosive barrels and clever items such as power boxes and fire extinguishers which can be used with explosive and devastating results. The joy of the game is being able to find ways to make your environment work for you by using electrical current and other factors to set traps and help even the odds when faced against superior numbers.The weaponry in the game is first rate as players are able to take up to four weapons with them. There were pistols, machine guns, shotguns, and a nice addition to the nail gun known as the \"Hammerhead\" as well as a sniper rifle and missile launcher. New weapons included a plasma weapon and a great laser that allowed you to slice up your enemies and a napalm weapon. There are also several grenade types such as proximity, frag, incendiary, and a great one that is essentials and E.M.P. blast that disables tech based enemies.As good as those weapons were they paled in comparison to the Mech stages of the game where I was able to ride an assault Mech and cut down enemies with chain guns and rocket fire. There are also segments of the game where players can use the mounted gun on their A.P.C. unit in order to mow down advancing enemy forces.The enemies are a lot more than your usual 3D shooter heavies as aside from the clever tactics they can deploy, they are armed to the teeth and often take a barrage of hits to bring down. There are also some supernatural and stealth based enemies to content with who delight in sneak attacks in dark areas.Players also have the ability to melee and use the unarmed combat moves that were established in the first game as well.The level designs were good and the impressive graphic engine really allowed the detail level of maps such as a lab, hospital, subway, factory, school, apartment complexes, and much more.The voice acting and music in the game are a cut above the standard fare and while the game was not as intense from a scare point as the original, the action and intensity of this game were beyond compare.F.E.A.R. 2 also offers great multiplay as I enjoyed Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and the other online modes. I hope to see new maps in the near future and would love to be able to bring the mech battles into the game at some point.The game allows players to setup controls in the way they chose, but I was stunned to see that game did not offer a save system and instead opted for a check point save system. This was a big disappointment to me as like many gamers, I do not enjoy having to replay portions of a level should I be killed.I did experience a couple of technical hiccups such as some lag when using bullet time in one instance and a couple of delays when new areas were accessed. Despite this, using my Razer Lachesis and Lycosa I was able to deftly move about the games with ease and I love using the Razer Destructor gaming pad as it truly added to my online and solo play experience with greater mouse tracking.All in all the game was highly addictive and enjoyable and is an early leader for our game of the year award. I just hope the wait until the next chapter is not as long as F.E.A.R. 2 is a true classic that delivers the goods gamers want and deserve.4.5 stars out of 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2009"}

It will be up to you to carry out orders, earn respect and make New York City your own. Featuring the voices of James Caan and Robert Duvall and the likeness of Marlon Brando.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Even with it's flaws, The Godfather is great","reviewText":"The Godfather video game tells the tale of a young man that you name, create, and customize as he joins the famous Corleone family of New York to not only raise through the ranks & become a made man, but to seek vengance on the people who brutally murdered his father many years earlier.This game plays like GTA, and by this I mean it's an open ended game. You can traverse all over a beautifully crafted (and large) New York & New Jersey. You get to do side missions that are covertly named \"Favors\" and \"Hits\" where you'll find yourself doing numerous amount of things like driving someone somewhere to taking out a well armed & protected caporegime from a different family. On top of that you can go and take over rackets, extort businesses (so much fun.. you can bash the owner's head into a cash register or shoot up his building), bribe police, hire protection, collect film reels which unlock parts of the movie, hijack cars, rob banks, buy safe houses & hotels, blow up 100 safes, participate in boxing matches, hijack racket drug trucks, bomb enemy businesses, perform all executions, earn money as well as respect, and take down enemy warehouses and compounds. On top of all these extras, you have to do the main storyline which takes you through the entire Godfather 1 and beyond In addition to all of that good stuff, you can also buy clothes and mess around with his hair, eye, and facial hair color. For clothes its mainly like suits and stuff... things that people wore back in that time period. The customization is pretty deep, besides what I mentioned already, you can choose how muscular or skinny he is, how big his jaw or eyebrows jut out, lip size, skin tan, etc.You get a huge variety of weapons in The Godfather which include revolvers, shotguns, tommy guns, bombs, handguns, molotov cocktails... they are all at your disposal and are able to be upgraded via black market merchants scattered throughout New York, although you must buy these upgrades. Furthermore, if you have access to the X-Box Live Marketplace then you can buy & download even STRONGER weapons for you to purchase within the game.It doesn't stop there. As you progress through the game you gain levels which, in turn, allow you to upgrade your characters abilities. These include aiming & precision, speed, strength, how well you fist fight, how much ammo you can hold, and many more categories. Also, by going up levels and upgrading yourself, you go up in rank which means you can hire better crew members/protection.Graphically speaking, I have to say EA did an excellent job creating New York and all of the characters within the game. Each character looks like their real life counter part practically to the T.. it was amazing to see the detail and effort put into the character model. New York looks amazing as well, you can really see the difference in culture from back then to present day and its really cool to see it. Marlon Brando looks AMAZING. Easily a 10.The music was spot on and really fit with the game, creating the perfect mood and atmosphere for you to enjoy it. The sound effects are perfect, I've never heard or seen a more satisfying explosion in a video game in my life. The voice acting is superb, sporting most if not all the original cast reprising their roles.. amazing.But with all this good stuff, why didn't this game get a 10? Well the targetting system can be tricky at times, meaning that you will wind up aiming at an enemy behind you instead of the one standing right in front of you. Additionally, the game's difficulty is like a rubber band - one minute its ridiculously easy, the next its super hard. The cops seem to come at you for almost any reason, and the same goes for rival families. Finally, your radar and map are complete garbage when it comes to pinpointing your objectives.. I can guarentee you'll drive or run right past it maybe 3 or 4 times because the map doesn't indicate where it is very well. Also the ending was strange because your character becomes the Don of NYC & the Corleones... what happened the Michael Corleone..???To sum it up, this game is guarenteed to give you atleast 30 hours of excellent gameplay that will drag you deep into the mobster lifestyle. For casual gamers and die hard fans of the book/movies alike, The Godfather is a must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2007"}

WoW is the game that I've found myself coming back to more than once.Having lost my original account due to a hack, followed by a subsequent banning by Blizzard because of the actions of another player - it was with a certain amount of trepidation that I decided to put my fate back into range of the itchy trigger finger of Blizzard.I spent nearly $100 on launch day for a new copy of WoW, the Burning Crusade, and a time card.  I have had so much fun, for so much time over the past couple of weeks with the game that I do not have any regrets over my purchase.I created a Blood Elf, one of the new races added with the expansion.  The back story of the 'pretty' Horde race is captivating and adds a lot of depth to what at first glance seems like a simplistic game.True enough, the game is very simple.  I find myself enjoying a formula that \"just works\" however, because Blizzard seems to have balanced a multitude of systems, story, quests, etc. and if it took the old K.I.S.S. principle to do so, so be it.The new starting area for the Blood Elves is gorgeous, and the quests in the first couple of starting areas around Silvermoon will take you nearly to 19 or 20 before you have to set off for the Barrens/Stonetalon/and the areas you are probably used to.As always, even if I am doing a random quest in the middle of nowhere, it is almost assured that I will come across more players on the same quest that I can group with if the difficulty is too high.These quests and activities you perform are not \"Oblivion\" deep, but they are sufficiently compelling to keep you interested in what happens as a result of your quests, or starting another quest in the middle of another that causes you to have to improvise and deviate from your plan prior to heading in.So the breakdown is - if you've never played WoW, I can still recommend the original game and this expansion ($60 combined) for players.  If $40 is too much for the additional content in music, areas, races, professions, levels, resources, items, etc. then I feel like you will be missing out on a larger part of the overall game that the Burning Crusade has added for players.Does it add enough content to justify the price?  Yes - I can say that this expansion does.  I cannot speak for future expansions, but if Blizzard puts the same time and effort into the small details as they did in this expansion - WoW will be a destination many of us will take for some time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2007"}

The graphics are awesome, great story line, game play is what you expect from UBI Soft and you've got this great big sand box to play in. Personally, I feel FC3 and Assassins Creed are the bars for other developers to meet. In FC3 you can actually do stealth moves and get a realistic reaction from the AI, the bad guys aren't crack shots with every thing from pistol to machine gun at a quarter mile range. The animals are beautiful and can be a real rush when they grab you by surprise. The island is a scenic masterpiece. And! The hang gliders from FC2 are back and much more fun to fly.

The side quests are endless. There are many rewards and the AI is fantastic! You really do develop survival instincts as you progress. The animals are also an interesting take as you have to watch your back from pirates as well as wildlife. You can also kill the animals to craft things such as bigger weapon holsters to hold more weapons and gear and such. You also collect plants and craft different drugs you can use to enhance things like visual awareness and rifle accuracy. The list of things you can accomplish is endless.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"ShoppingGeek","summary":"Not enough actioin","reviewText":"Only about 30% of this game is spent in actual action situations. The other 70% is spent reading and typing, which really isn't that much fun, and that was without my ever reading the pages and pages of \"Codex\" material that the game keeps giving you.Secondly, I was induced to buy Mass Effect by the promise of \"the vastness of space\", but the fact is that, for the most part, you pick a planet from a map and you are dropped onto it. None of the action actually takes place in space.In addition, while the layout of buildings and land for the main missions is varied, the numerous side missions mostly use one of only a couple of different building layouts. Even the landscapes of the many different worlds are structured the same and only colored differently.Thirdly, the graphics only rate a \"B\" by the standards of games like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Fallout 3. There is very little texture to the landscapes; mountaintops peak with sharply drawn straight lines, etc.When Mass Effect finally gives you some action, it is pretty good. In fact, I put its targeting/shooting system far ahead of Fallout 3's and even better than GTA4's. The only drawback is that like the Companions in F3, the 2-man crew that you MUST take every time you leave your ship is more of a nuisance than a help early on, then they take over the game later when their powers grow.So, 5 stars for the action and the main story line, 3 for the graphics and 1 for everything else, for an average of 3. Still not bad for half the price (or less) of current hit games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

In the new game Dead Space, E.A. has crafted a truly gripping and immersive game that is truly frightening to play.Cast as engineer Isaac Clarke, you and your crew arrive for routine repairs to a remote mining ship, the Ishimura. The docking procedures do not go as planned and Clarke and his team find themselves trapped aboard the ishimura, and if this was not bad enough, something has gone horribly wrong aboard the mining ship.Very shortly into the game, Clarke becomes separated from his team, and under siege from a series of bizarre and deadly creatures that infest the station. Armed with a simple plasma cutter weapon, Clarke must not only survive the aliens that roam the station but he must complete several tasks such as restoring the ships tram service and unblocking vital areas of the ship.As the story unfolds, Clarke is able to upgrade his arsenal through the collection and use of power nodes, and through collecting credits, is able to purchase new weapons such as military grade rifles and flamethrowers to fight off the Necromorphs.Clarke is able to keep in touch with his team through the game thanks to the com system which allows for a holographic display to appear before the player. For those who do not want to have to stand in place to watch the messages, you can move around the ship and still watch the messages as the screen will travel with you as you move.Players will also be able to gain access to various crew logs as well which will help fill in the back story of what happened aboard the Ishimura prior to your arrival.The game has plenty of challenges moments aside from the deadly creatures as low gravity and zero air locales present new challenges that players will have to overcome.In a very shrewd move, simply pumping several rounds into an enemy is not enough to bring them down, as they will develop new limbs and vulnerable areas as the game unfolds which forces players to adapt their combat style to an ever changing enemy. Players also have a stasis option which allows them to momentarily slow objects and creatures in order to pass them or gain a strategic advantage. Players also gain other skills as the game unfolds such as the ability to move large objects via a special option on the weapons.Another nice feature is allowing players have numerous save stations throughout the levels which thankfully does not force players to repeat tough areas of the game trying to reach a needed checkpoint in order to save progress.The game also has a great inventory system which allows players to use their health packs, examine their weapon and ammunition options, as well as see what is in their inventory.The game does offer an automap via the display in the suit, but I at times find this tricky as I was not able to keep the map engaged and open doors, and with multi level sections, I at times become lost trying to discern if I should go up, down, or around in a new area.I could not get over how immersive the game was as the designers are to be highly praised for crafting a game where you clearly have a sense of dread and are worried about things popping out of nowhere. I am not the easiest person to scare and on more than one occasion in the game, I found myself on edge thanks to the sounds and settings of the game, and also thanks to an enemy that appears often out of nowhere. During one early stage of the game, I was watching a set of machines operate after completing a repair. Since I had cleared the room earlier, I thought I was safe, so you can image my surprise when I was concentrating on a control board only to find a deadly claw appear over my shoulder with no warning or sound.The story cleverly combines the best of science fiction and horror and reminded me of \"Alien\", \"The Thing\" and \"Event Horizon\", but not in a way that seemed to copy any of the films. The visuals of the game were amazing, as so much detail was paid to the look and layout of the ship. As I walked the dark and dangerous corridors, I was ever alert to the grids, vents, doorways, and shadows where my next attacker could appear at any time without warning.The audio quality of the game is also a huge feature of the game as the clever use of sounds such as clattering metal, doors opening, and more are used to infuse a sense of dread into players, as well as keep you on edge as on more than once occasion I whirled in the direction of a sound ready to fight the unknown only to find that my enemies were waiting elsewhere.Playing on the Playstation 3 system I was happy to see that the game was dual shock enabled and using the Dual shock 3 control allowed me for a new level of enjoyment thanks to the rumble features of the game which added a new dimension to the gritty combat of the game.Rarely do I find a game that not only delivers a compelling and scary story with solid action and graphics as was the case with Dead Space which is simply one of the best games I have ever played and is destined to become a classic.5 stars out of 5.Rated M for Intense Action and Carnage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"one great game","reviewText":"this game is my second favorite game . it has a whole lot of great things about it . first of all, the multiplayer . it has alot of fun modes(siege, capture the flag and deathmatch),in online and offline gameplay ,and it's very very fun .but the game also has alot to it's single player gameplay . i think the storyline was great , and the cutscenes and movies are extremely funny. the game also has alot of weapons with 5 upgrades for each ,and another thing i liked about the game is your headquartes. you can go there anytime you want , and you have a weapon vendor there , an armor vendor(and you can trst new weapons there before you buy them) , a trophy room ( for special tasks you do) , an arena in which you can fight enemies and test new gadgets , and , my favorite, play 5 different arcade games in which you play as captain quark.and of course, you go there for mission briefing.also , aside from arena battles ,there are battle missions , in which you fight tyrranoids ( which are evil aliens that are controlled by the bad guy , doctor nefarious)with thew help of some other robots. these are very fun , as you need to do different things, like taking a plane and attacking the enemie's base , or assassinate four different commanders, or turn on a defensive circle of turrets, or.. .well, you get the idea . they're really fun.and also there are alot of bosses , and the replay value is great . like i mentioned above , there is a trophy room , in which you can earn trophies by doing special tasks or by just finding them  ( there is a type you find and another type you earn by doing special missions)and if you earn them all you get a very interesting thing . so i definitely recommend you buy this game .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2005"}

Playing it right now.Repeat this mantra \"Not a sim, Not a sim, Not a sim...\"If you read many of my other game reviews you'll see I like driving games. Specifically sim driving games. Being I am no where near a millionaire I probably will never drive any of these cars in my lifetime. So I think of sim driving games as a way to bring a bit of realism into my living room. When I got Blur from my game rental place, I was about to pack it up and send it back to them asap. I had seen the clips and other snippets of the game and a driving game with power ups and all that had no place in my stable of _real games_,or so I thought.My son and I really enjoyMario Kart Wii. This game is a more grown up version of that. The commercial you see on TV now with the mario like character wanting to play a grown up racing game is spot on. It combines the fun of that with real cars. Unlike Mario Cart, you can get up to 3 power ups and keep them in a queue on your back bumper. When you want to use it hit X and fire away.Models: +First off I love the realism of the car models. They really do look pretty good. You start off like many other car games of this genre and you get a hooptie to begin with.Fan system: +Play this online and you earn fans. Fans are like Rock Band games ( musical ones not the company) and these fans can get you benefits, boosts and cool toys for your ride.Lights: +Lights unlock the cars. The higher you finish, the more lights and better cars you can get.Damage: +/-Damage in this game is pretty good. Based on an arcade model of damage that is. Your car will be blown up and shot into the air, land on its roof and keep going. Its done well though and not too kitschy.Lack of Achievements: +As of right now I don't have any and that is a good thing, some games seem to launch them at you for just logging in. Not here. You have to complete some tough challenges to get a _sticker_. These are your badges that can be seen as a trophy. 4 complete challenge = 1 sticker. These are tough.Power Ups: +This game has a ton and each are a blast, literally. Of course there is nitro and boosts to speed. Also there are some really crazy ones that can take your opponent out in a blaze of less than glory.Ease of play: +This is very easy to control with the six axis controller. Right trigger is gas, left brake and X is fire off the next power up you have in your queue.First Impression: +Overall this game has won me over. Its definitely something you would see in an arcade, but that doesnt make it any less fun. Take it as it is and I think you will have a good time with this game.I plan on playing this a ton this week and will update this review as I get more into it.Thanks for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2010"}

When I chose a jacket or coat, as soon as I tried to \"save\" and \"Join the family\", the game locked up. I tried multiple times and it did it every time until I took off the coat.#2 When I took over every family and tried to return to the compound \"To discuss my future\", the game froze. It froze every time I reloaded and went to the compound. I can't see the ending because of this.Buy at your own risk. Maybe I got a defective disc.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2006"}

Blending hong kong action with an open world to explore and do what you will so you can take down a deadly criminal organization.-STORY--Wei Shen is a cool character and is quite adapt in taking on situations that will prove his loyalty to both the triads and of course the HK police. The story plays out in a familiar pattern like other open world games. Many of the characters are well thought out and are likable. The only gripe I have with the story is its all to linear with no choices or branching paths with different outcomes. Also i never got the impression that Wei was ever in danger, he knew most of the triad members which kind of gave him a easy pass in. It would of been more engaging if there were tense moments where you have to use dialogue and stealth to avoid suspicion.-GAMEPLAY--The gameplay for the most part is very easy to get into and is smooth. Controlling Wei is easy and all his actions are performed with very small combinations. The fighting is what you'll do the most, it plays like the Batman arkham series combat but a little more strict with the countering, for ex. pressing the counter button too early will leave you open to attacks. Traversing is mainly done with the A button, using it for context actions like sliding and leaping over objects. This is always prevalent in the chase gameplay which is quite riveting.The missions are varied enough that you'll never doing the same thing and it incorporates many of the random side activities to the main missions which is a nice touch.Spread out HK are collectables that you can collect to gain you money,health upgrade or face experience.Also there are side missions or events that are triggered if your near the specific person.There is plenty of things to do in HK and the level of detail is quite amazing, I found myself on foot often just to explore the alleways or see the pedestrians doing their thing. Most of the fun comes from exploring and finding out what activities there are.The vehicles in the game handle arcadey with quick turns and exaggerated top speed easy to pull off.-SOUND--Voice acting is top notch, the setting of HK brings with it a exotic language but you'll be surprised to hear more english this of course is for obvious reasons. Many notable actors lend their talents to the characters but the one that sounded familiar to me the most is Tom Wilkinson who plays Pandrew.Music is varied but I found myself listening to the hip hop and HK stations the most.But the music is good enough that you'll want to know some of the tacks.-Graphics--Very good in my opinion its even superb at night with a great ton of detail added to the city. The rain wash effect looks amazing and the reflection effect from the streets to the cars look quite good, I highly recommend exploring the night market it looks amazing.The characters have a lot of detail when it comes to clothing and facial features but are lacking somehow I don't know what but many of them look plastic like.RECOMMENDAbsolutely, SD is a fantastic open world game and brings a new style of open world action. With smooth fighting and gunplay it can in the future carve its own categories or maybe even its own genre. The setting,story and especially the gameplay I'd say is its selling point. If you long for the days of returning to Hong Kong after Shenmue 2 ended SD is a great way to experience an always unique setting rich with culture and history.Thank you and enjoy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","summary":"You'll Enjoy This Game If...","reviewText":"So there are a ton of 5 Star \"Best Game Ever\" Reviews and a ton of 1 Star \"Trash\" Reviews.  I'll try to explain why someone would like this game.Concept:  9/10Take Black Ops, set it 13 years in the future, add spy tech and drones, streamline Multi-Player, and Add More Zombies.  It's a good idea and it's a ton of entertainment for $60.  Especially if you play on X-Box Live.Gameplay:  8/10Call of Duty has been Activision's Annual Cash Cow and they're not about to scrap their formula and start from scratch if they're making $500,000,000 on opening day.  It's designed to make the average Joe feel like a Hero in half hour increments.  The game is basically a very high production shooting gallery with assisted aiming.  You run to very clearly marked checkpoints, killing bad guys along the way.  The game's aiming system will make everyone feel like a Commando as they run through Missions that rival the most insane action sequences Hollywood has to offer.There's no training mission or anything.  You just get thrown right into a battle with your allies yelling at you to go faster, run here, and kill that guy!  GO GO GO!  This is Call of Duty!  There ain't no time for training!  It's an FPS, RTS, Tank Driving, Air Combat, Horseback Riding, Run and Gun, Sniping Game, with Zombies!  The downside is that the Player never really gets properly trained on how to play and they can't make decisions for themselves.  Because of this, they are 100% reliant on HUD information:  Objective is 112M away.  FOLLOW this guy.  There were a few times where I found myself tuning out all of the great over-the-top action sequences as I just sprinted to the next checkpoint.  If I strayed too far away from the path or accidentally killed an ally, I was insta-failed and had to play the checkpoint over again.  There were a few \"Ok, what do you want me to do?\"  Missions, that broke immersion.Black Ops 2 features some new additions.  You can modify your starting equipment, guns, attachments, and grenades, and replay levels to get a \"High Score\" that shows up on Leaderboards.  During the Campaign, you make some very obvious choices that will affect the game's ending.  There are 4 main endings which really pay off the decisions that you made.There are also 4 Optional Levels that Play like an RTS.  You can coordinate your troops from a satellite view and jump in and control them manually if you want.  At first, this was a bit confusing, but if you learn the controls, it's fun.  But it is pretty difficult to multi-task.  Not everyone is going to like this feature, which is why these missions are optional.Story:  5/10The game flashes back to Missions that took place in the 1980's, then flashes forward to 2025.  You play most of the levels as members of the US Special Forces.  The story is narrated and held together by a crippled veteran who's been through hell.  The main villain, Menendez, runs a massive terrorist organization and he's got a plan for world revolution and you follow his rise to power.  You even play a few levels as Menendez (and he seems more powerful than Wolverine.)  I really tried to get into the story, but it felt like a B-Action Movie without the obligatory forced romance.  It was over-acted and under-acted at the same time, and reminded me of the plot of Team America World Police... but it wasn't supposed to be a comedy.  If you like testosterone, action, and meaningful choices, then you may like the story.  If you manage to take the story seriously, then you will enjoy the multiple endings.Multi-Player:  8/10The changes aren't going to make everyone happy.10 Point System.  When equipping your character classes, you get 10 points to spend on items.  Perks cost 1, guns cost 1, upgrades cost 1, grenades cost 1...  And you decide how you spend your 10 points.  You get 5 customizable character classes and you can arm them for every type of scenario.  Close range, Defense, Assault, Sniping, Objectives...  It's simple and it's great.When You go up a level, you get a Token.  This is used to unlock a new Perk, Gun Attachment, Weapon, or Kill Streak Item.  This is also simple and great.The Guns are a mixed bag.  Some people will like this, others, not so much.  At the low levels, it takes a while to kill your target.  Maybe 5 hits.  So, even if you get hit, Tak-Tak, you can still run for cover and make it.  As you go up in level, the guns become a lot more deadly and you die fast.  The guns also have a laser site, which helps you shoot accurately from the hip, so you don't have to waste a second to look through your sights.  To counter this, the higher level sights all have a special abilities.  Some allow you to see stationary enemies through walls, so you can ambush the campers.  Others highlight enemy targets across the map, so you can pick out the snipers before they get you.  So, you'll need to decide if you want to run and gun or stalk your enemies.Kill Streaks are a bit tougher to get and they're on a point system.  You get 100 points for an enemy Kill and 25-50 points for an Assist.  The Steaks cost 400-1000 points and there are some incredibly powerful ones, but as you can imagine, they are really hard to get.There are a few main problems with Multiplayer:Many times, you spawn right near an enemy and you die before you can even turn your head.  This is no fun.  On the flip side, the game doesn't really penalize you for deaths (Unless you are in Deathmatch) and the base career stats only count your kills and wins.  So, if dying, respawning, and dying in 2 seconds makes you mad, you will hate this.  But you respawn again almost instantly, so it's really not too bad.Lag Compensation:  Think of it as Latency Socialism.  If you have a super fast connection and you're fighting against an enemy with a slow connection, the game helps out the slower player.  You may shoot first and as your bullets hit - Tak-Tak-Tak...  and they fire back, it seems as if they kill you in 1 hit because the 5 of their bullets hit you all at once.  Tak-Dead.  There is also a bit of weirdness if you try to run around a corner for cover.  On the Final Kill Cam which shows the replay of the last death of the match, many times you see an enemy take cover and the bullets go right through a steel wall and finish him off.The Lobby...  Many Players complain about not being able to get into a game quickly.  I never had any problem with this.  I'm sure Activision will have this fixed over time.  The game just sold 10 million copies in its first week and trying to match 350k Players at one time from all over the country is no easy task.Zombies:  7/10There are also changes to Zombies.  More Modes, More Maps, but they're small, and Objective Based Gameplay.  There's enough content here where \"Zombies\" can almost be a stand-alone game.  Play alone or Play with friends!Sound:  9/10The sound is top notch and puts you right into the action.  Gunfire, Explosions, Swearing...  It's all there and it's loud.  Some of the background music choices are questionable, though.Maturity:  MThis is a gory game full of graphic war violence and a ton of foul language.  But when I play online, everyone with a microphone sounds like a pip-squeak and they swear when I kill them.  So, this game is suited for older teens and fans of R-Rated Action Movies, but a lot of the audience is in the 3rd grade.Replay Value:  10/10There's a 7 hour Campaign with multiple endings, leaderboards, different weaponry, and difficulty levels.  There's Multi-Player with a ton of different modes and unlocks that will take you months.  Then there's zombies, which can be enjoyed both single Player and Online.  For the price of a tank of gas, there's 100+ hours of content here.  Even if you only like 1 or 2 of the Game Modes, it's worth the Price.Overall:  8/10This is a very good game with a ton of content for $60.  Is it perfect?  Nope.  Is it going to make all 10 million gamers happy?  Nope.  But if you're looking for another Call of Duty Game with Multi-Player and Zombies, then you should enjoy this one.  There are some positive steps in the right direction and this is the most ambitious Call of Duty Game to date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000A09EP","description":"Join Mario and Luigi as they team up in a strange new land for an action-packed quest to retrieve Princess Peach's stolen voice.","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Mario and Lui... other guy star in an awesome RPG full of personality, entertainment, and FURY!!!","reviewText":"Mario has had an ongoing streak of awesome RPGs, starting at the end of the SNES' lifespan and continuing through today. Mario & Luigi is the main handheld franchise of the Mario RPGs, starting with 2003's Superstar Saga on the GameBoy Advance. It was most likely the best game on the platform and one of the greatest RPGs of all time with its hilarious dialogue, fantastic gameplay, and outstanding visuals. Even with six years behind it, Superstar Saga is a fantastic game in every aspect that's hard to not enjoy.The game begins with an ambassador from the Beanbean Kingdom coming to visit the Mushroom Kingdom as a gesture of peace. Only it turns out that an evil villain, Cackletta, disguised herself as the ambassador to steal Princess Peach's voice. This sends Mario and Luigi on an epic adventure to stop Cackletta from taking over the world, because Peach's voice is needed to awaken the Beanstar, which will grant Cackletta all her evil desires.The story takes a few interesting twists and it is a pretty decent tale in its own right, but what really pushes it forward is the hilarious dialogue and unique personality. Cakletta's helper, Fawful, is especially laugh out loud funny in his hysterical lines and how he says them. Luigi also adds a lot of humor to the story even though he has no dialogue; he just does so many funny things that will always keep you laughing. Each character is unique also, and their individual personalities are extremely evident in the way each of them talks. Every single minor character, even, has very distinct individuality and that makes the game feel very special and unique. On top of that, there is a perfect amount of dialogue in the game: not too much to where you start to fall asleep and not too little so you can follow the story without any problems.The story and all the elements surrounding it make Mario & Luigi a highly entertaining adventure, and that area is backed up by some fantastic and enjoyable gameplay. Outside of battle you control Mario and Luigi at the same time, which sounds complicated but is actually very simple and 100% functional. A and B are used for commands (jump, hammer, etc.), L and R cycle through commands, and start swaps the brothers' positions between front and back. Whether one is in the front or back changes what a command will do, also, like hammering Luigi into the ground or jumping on top of Mario to get a higher leap. All these commands work perfectly and the game's puzzles implement them all very nicely. The puzzles are, for the most part, not mind-bendingly difficult, but they require you to use every bit of your knowledge of the pair's abilities, which balances out the difficulty quite nicely.Mario and Luigi are also both used in the game's battles, which are extremely entertaining. Mario is controlled with A and Luigi with B, and they can dodge enemies' attacks with their hammer or a jump by using their respective buttons. Learning how enemies attack is vital to defeating your foes, because you can often avoid taking damage in battle. Mario and Luigi can attack alone or together for one of the game's best features: Bros. Attacks. Using these abilities is vital to your success in the game and they are very intuitive, fun to execute, and enjoyable to watch. You have to press A or B at the right times, depending on the attack, to successfully pull off the maneuver. The Bros. Attacks take on a variety of different forms, like hitting Mario at an enemy or throwing Luigi. There are eight Bros. Attacks in the game, which seems like a small number until you discover the advanced techniques, which greatly change the attack and can do even more damage. Battles make up the core of Superstar Saga's gameplay, and none of it falls short of being outstanding.Superstar Saga also delivers some pretty fantastic graphics that are some of the finest on the GBA. The style fits the game perfectly and allows for many fine Luigi moments. Everything animates very smoothly and the characters all look sharp. The game is very colorful too, making the screen a constant visual treat. The game's use of 3-D is also some of the best on the platform, both in and outside of battle.Mario & Luigi contains numerous catchy tunes as well. You will most likely find yourself humming to the overworld theme and possibly tapping your foot to the battle music as all the tracks are enjoyable to listen to and very catchy. Sound effects are also done very well and fit the game's style and personality wonderfully, with classic Mario sounds and likeable character voice clips to boot. The sound quality is also higher than many GBA games.Value is yet another positive note for Superstar Saga. Mario and Luigi's main quest takes about 15-20 hours to complete, a fairly lengthy adventure. While you can't save after you defeat the final boss, I can almost guarantee that you will want to replay the game at some point. It's so much fun that it's totally worth replaying; it's hard to not immensely enjoy it even the second time around.When a game comes around that's as fantastic as Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, you simply can't miss it. It's funny, entertaining, charming, and every area is of highest quality. While I somehow can't find it in me to give this game a 10, I'll award it a score that's pretty darned close because it's about as near to perfection as games get, and it's just too likeable to not have a great time with.Positive:+ wonderful sense of personality+ perfect system of controls+ creative puzzles and enemies+ Bros. Attacks are simple and fun+ smooth, colorful graphics+ awesome, catchy music+ lengthy but not at all tiresomeNegative:... (empty space)LAST WORD: Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga is a must-own handheld gem for its unique sense of personality, outstanding gameplay, and overall quality unsurpassed by any other GBA game. If you haven't played it before, purchase a cartridge as soon as you can, because you simply can't regret it.9.8/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"billygoat","summary":"Really not very good, here's why","reviewText":"First off, I have to say I'm really surprised that this game got the solid reviews that it received. It ranks last or next to last out (folklore is poor) of the 25+ ps3 games I have played. Here's why.The game really has very little game to play, most of the game is comprised of cutscenes. The gameplay itself is easy and very repetitive. The bosses are the worst I have ever encountered. Other than the praying mantis, they are just time consuming endeavers and very boring. The fact that you can purchase additional weapons, etc. in the middle of a battle is stupid beyond belief. The ending battle is the worst possibly in video game history.The story is not very good either. its long, overly dramatic and corny. The potty humour is embarrasing.The graphics are pretty good, but no better than other solid games. The load times are terrible and poorly placed. Replay value, not much.To summarize, I really don't get it, I had fairly high expectations of this game because from my experience reviews are usually fairly accurate. Want a really good game that is fairly recent try Demon's Souls.Addtion to previous review:Would like to add to my original review due to playing game again and skipping the bad cutscenes. My review is that the game is still not very good. The stealth part of the game is good, however the bosses while not hard or just very boring time consuming endeavers. If you play this game you'll see what i mean. Act 4 has very touchy controls when you fight vamp, this is a really ridiculous battle.When your done with vamp you have to endure the most embarassing cutscene in the history of games, watching octogon cry is incredibly bad. I do not get the reviews of this game , i gave it a 2 but that is being generous.Act 5 is still terrible.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

It has all the favorite characters that I can remember from the past games from Nintendo's hit franchise. It basically has the same format that N64 players appreciated, and so for those people there will be hardly anything to learn. With the new Wheel, it just makes the experience more simplified and fun. The new Mario Kart is so fun and engaging, that you and your friends will have sore backs from all the physical play! You take the good with the bad!First, the wheel makes it easier for you to treat your Wii remote \"plus\" as it is intended: as a car wheel. You use many vehicles, like the new speed bikes. But even with the handlebar vehicles, you still treat your remote as a wheel. You must remove the rubber skin on the remote and slip the wrist ban and pass it through the hole in the center of the wheel. The remote will then snuggly fit into its molding and you will be ready with your wheel to play for hours. The wheel helps, because without it, I sometimes use the remote as it was unintended: tilting the remote instead of tilting and turning for sharp, clean turns with skid control. If you are new to the Wii, the biggest attraction of the Wii is the motion-control! It isn't merely a bunch of button pressing, it is physical, and you get a good workout even playing Mario Kart (at least I do).In order to unlock the plethora of additional material, like extra maps, carts, and characters (including your Mii) you must spend some time completing Mario Kart on first player. This can be a drag if you are ready to go with friends/family and want to unlock additional material at the same time. Other than that, Mario Kart Wii is made to have fun with all your friends/family and it is great for having loads of fun.Mario Kart is fast and adrenaline pumping even on the 100cc circuits. The 50cc circuit will be easy for most people who have played Mario Kart before. But even for the veterans out there, 150cc will be challenging, and sometimes frustrating. There are new ways to come back from behind that have been introduced here. They are included in with the tricks that we have all come to know and enjoy. The frustrations of being blinded by squid ink, shrunken down by storm clouds, and then nuked by some guiding missile, do not make the game unfair, but fun! As long as you are with people who don't suffer from anger management issues, there shouldn't be a problem. There are loads of ways of losing the lead, but then there are tactics to learn that usually lead to success. It isn't just blind luck that determines winners and bad fate for losers, there is strategy to be had while playing the computer, online, or with friends/family.The characters are plentiful, along with an interesting array of vehicles to play with. I personally love playing with Toad and I like to drive motorcycles because they are good on turns and acceleration. I get knocked around by the larger guys with heavier weights, but you really cannot avoid getting knocked around, so its great to have the acceleration to get going again fast. I love the retro maps that are in the game. The new Mario Kart Wii has basically something from all the Mario Karts (from snes to N64 version, including handheld versions).I have put in alot of time and find that there are lots of rewards in this newest Mario Kart Wii. The replay value is as high as it gets, and it's the most fun I've had playing a game since N64 days. Games like this are the reason why I wanted a Wii in the first place. The sights and sounds will bring you back to the golden years of video games. The wheel included is not some gimmicky article of trash; it really helps to develop your skill in driving. I love this package!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00309XHD0","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"First Impressions - Dead Space 2","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 was one of my favorite games of 2008.  The mix of survival horror with the award winning sound and ambiance it produced was an assault on the senses something of which I have never experienced in gaming before.  Immediately this game became one of my favorites and is permanently placed in my top 10 games of all time.  It's without question that Dead Space 2 was high on my anticipated games list.  Could the team behind the wildly successful Dead Space 1 put together another classic or would they suffer the sophomore slump like a lot of games have in the past?  After spending a solid 6-7 hours with the game, here's my first impressions.Dead Space 2 had an uphill battle from the get go following the success of the first.  Most people played the game but for those that didn't, how do you bring them up to speed?  Include a handy \"Previously On...\" sort of movie to get them caught up.  The option is available from the main menu when you begin a new game and it's a great addition to any sequel, not just this one.  This brief movie with a voice over and in game footage from the first game and Extraction (on the Wii, now free with PS3 version) tells the story of Unitology and it's obsession with the marker.  The events leading up to the second game end with a brief explanation that Isaac Clark survived the first game only to be \"rescued\" by a space colony that has him in it's psyche ward.  After experiencing the events of the first game, Isaac is slowly losing grip of reality due to the effects of the marker, and with that the game begins.You take control of Isaac while a man is trying to break you free from your restraints (you are in the psyche ward after all).  A nercromorph bursts through the ceiling and destroys the man immediately turning him into the enemy.  You get to see this up close and personal and really get a feel for the gruesome nature of the transformation.  Unfortunately, Mr. Necromorph didn't get a chance to untie your restraints so you begin a frantic run from all the inmates breaking out of their cells...as necromorphs.  After fleeing the scene, you meet up with someone who equips you for your journey and you first meet the voice of the woman who claims she is trying to help you.  Without much to go on you have no choice but to trust her and you begin your journey to find her so she can cure your mental illness, something that will eventually kill you if it's not properly treated in time, compliments of the marker.Dead Space 2 begins extremely strong and it doesn't let up much after that.  You'll be in contact with the woman trying to help you from time to time as you make your way through a new ship that is filled with new and exciting areas.  On the Ishamura, you were mainly in maintenance hallways and medical facilities.  It seemed that everything was very cut and dry.  On this ship/settlement, you will see shopping malls, rest areas, crew quarters, and other \"normal\" areas that you would expect on a space colony.  As you travel, you'll notice how a seemingly normal life was blown to hell when the invasion/infestation began.  The way the world is set up is very believable.  You'll notice pictures on doors or audio logs of everyday life going on as normal just hours before you took control.  The devs do a wonderful job of making the world very believable and you can almost feel the dread the resonates off of every corridor in the game.If you played and enjoyed the first Dead Space, it's almost a given you are going to enjoy the second.  It's very similar in gameplay and design to it's predecessor with a few key differences.  While the first Dead Space wasn't open world by any stretch, it was more \"open\" than part 2.  Dead Space 2 gives the illusion that you are in a sprawling colony in outer space but you will rarely venture off the beaten path.  You will can explore rooms that are connected to the main path, but for the most part, this is a linear experience.  Don't be put off by that though.  Linear games are inherently bad, they just usually fall prey to bad story or design.  This is not the case in Dead Space 2.  The linear gameplay adds to the excitement and makes sure you experience set pieces and story in the manner in which they were created.Gun play and weapons in general are identical to the previous game.  You aim and fire weapons with L1 and R1 (on the PS3 version, which is what I'm playing on) and the alt fire is the R2 button.  I'm guessing on the 360 version it's flipped with triggers for aim and shoot with shoulder for secondary.  The weapons all return with some new ones that I have yet to really start exploring.  If you played the downloadable game that came out before Dead Space 2 and/or if you played Dead Space 1 and have a safe file on your console, you will also get some additional weapons.  If you have the save file, you'll get the old plasma cutter you had in part 1 just without any upgrades (boo!) and if you have the DLC game you get a Hacker Suit that allows you to hack objects easier in game.  Neat additions, but if you don't have them, don't worry, it's no biggie.The enemies in the game are just as frightening as they were before with some sending that excitement to the next level.  For starters, the little kid like enemies are absolutely terrifying if you encounter them without realizing.  The first time I found myself up against them I died after being swarmed from all sides.  A little tip, if you see them coming, get in a corner so they can't surround you.  The other enemies you'll encounter are memorable enemies from the first game and the same holds true as it did then, go for the limbs.  I'm sure there are plenty more out there waiting for me as I hit the second half of the game later this evening so I look forward to seeing what the game can throw at me.Dead Space 2 is an amazing game.  If you haven't played the first, I highly recommend you do so as it is a monumental experience that shouldn't be missed.  It will also shed light into why Isaac Clark, the main character is losing his mind in this game.  That seems to be the main premise of the game up to the point which I made it.  Isaac is so affected by the marker in his previous experience that it's literally making him hallucinate and see his dead girlfriend everywhere he turns.  He'll see dead bodies flailing when none are there and at one point tried to shove a needle in his eye thinking someone else was doing it to him.  He's losing it and we're along for the ride.  Will Isaac lose it completely or will the cure be applied before he does harm to himself?  We'll just have to finish the game to find out.So, do I recommend this game?  What do you think?  The game is fantastic and I hope from what I wrote so far it's piqued your interest.  If you enjoy survival horror, welcome to the next evolution.  High intensity combat isn't for the Gears of Wars of the world only.  You can still have suspense with lots of combat and there's plenty in Dead Space 2.  If you found yourself enthralled by the first game it goes without saying that you will be equally if not more enthralled by the second.  The devs listened to the fan base and they developed a well polished game that has done nothing by improve upon it's prior formula of success and deliver on all promises of a superior product.  I have yet to play the multiplayer, but from what I hear it's similar to the BioShock 2 multiplayer: decent, but not needed in the end and forgettable after a couple months.  With a game as good as Dead Space 2 is turning out to be, multiplayer will be the last thing on your mind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

Either EA completely overestimated the online fan base for this game, or underestimated how many people love the normal Franchise/Dynasty career mode, because those original modes are not to be found in this title.I'm willing to bet 9 out of 10 gamers simply want a Madden that plays well, and has relevant modes, vs. them introducing any more engines.  The feature of Madden 13, the \"infinity engine\", is supposed to give more life-like reaction in plays when players make contact vs. canned animations.  What you end up seeing more often than not (players tripping over each other when a play is over) borders on the height of hilarity, vs. the realism they were going for.Let's not go into the fact that if you do attempt to utilize the \"Connected Careers\" mode with your own player, it is going to take DAYS of gameplay (not hours) to improve your player in any meaningful way.  And I don't just mean playing seasons, I mean you have to PRACTICE.  Even Allen Iverson thinks that's ridiculous EA.For my money, despite the slightly dated look, Madden 10 is the best Madden of this generation, including a more slick halftime presentation and commentary.  And best of all, that can be had for a mere $3-5 bucks (if you can swallow not playing online as the servers are done).You've been warned:  Avoid any and all Madden games until the arrival of the PS4 and Xbox 720.  You're better off just booting up Madden 10, or even going back to the PS2, playing Madden 2005, that for my money, is the best entry in the entire Madden franchise.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect.

{"product_name":"B00000K1VA","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"not the best place to start, but RE gold for veterans","reviewText":"Resident evil is one of the longest run PlayStation titles out there. It is really a shame that Gamecube is the exclusive RE platform now, because Playstation always did it best. Since th very birth of PS, there has been resident evil, and RE 3 does not dissapoint. RE 3 puts a great new spin on the series, through the arch super villan nemesis. Nemesis (as you can see from the box art) is a menacing tyrant, much like the tyrants in RE 2 out for the lead character Jill's blood. The great part about this game is the difficulty setting. While they really make no difference, it can give the new gamers to this title a bit more edge, since this is one of the harder RE titles.The thing that makes this game so adicttive to survival horror junkies like myself is the claustrophobic action, Throughout the game you have the idea in the back of your head that nemesis could be, and usually is, behind every corner. For some this good, for some this is bad. Some people enjoy walking through the city for hours and not having to worry about running themselves out of herbs and ammo every ten minutes. However, for most others it adds a great suspensful feeling to the game, and makes you feel more and more like your action do matter a great deal.As for the controls, no one will like them at first. It is sort of an acquired taste that most survival horror games have when ti comes to controls. Since all the camera angles are stationary (it makes the game look better so don't complain) this game utilizes the up arrow as always being forward. Some people seem to understand it better if you explain as being an RC car, whether face south, north, east or west, up wil always drive you forward. There realyl is no way around this configuration, it really is best to dive right in and get used to it, even if it means being massacred five minutes in a bunch of times.In conclusion, I would not pick this RE in particular for anyone new to the series. With the inclusion of nemesis, you are required to make split second decisions, and it will often confuse,a nd ultimately lead to the death of more novice players. If you are new to the series, try RE 2, RE 1 has a few problems present for newer players, but RE 2 is the perfect balance of horror, and simplicity. If your a veteran to RE, look no further for fun, just don't expect it to be a cake walk!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2004"}

{"product_name":"B004H0J5S2","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"A Fun Lower Budget Adventure","reviewText":"The First Templar is a pretty unknown release, as it seemed to just sneak out without any press or gamer adoration. Needless to say, I was quite skeptical of this game's potential. So fast forward a month later, I have some credit sitting around, and this game is available for a slightly cheaper price through Amazon Warehouse, so I pulled the trigger, and guess what? I actually enjoyed this game. Now, The First Templar is no big budget production, make no mistake about it. This is a smaller budget game from a developer that isn't well known at all. No one part will blow you away about The First Templar, and even as a whole it feels very outdated, but that doesn't make it bad. Now read on and find out why.Positives:- A Deep & Interesting Tale - The story in The First Templar revolves around the Order of the Knights Templar. Throughout the game there's an overarching story, as well as more story to find littered throughout the environments. It's all well done and will keep you involved in what's happening.- Single Player & Co-op - This is a game that is both enjoyable in single player and co-op form. The A.I. for the single player performs admirably and doesn't fail you under dire circumstances. However, there's also drop-in drop-out co-op play, which is well done and didn't present any issues while I was playing.- Simple Yet Fun Combat - The combat system in The First Templar allows for some really cool looking combos, finishers, etc. There's also block and roll mechanics for defending yourself from the enemy.- Nicely Rendered Environments - While no one object will really impress you visually in The First Templar, the environments generally look really nicely detailed and crisp. The resolution is rather sharp, so you won't get a sub-HD image here.- Goofy Banter - The characters throughout the story use some rather cheesy and enjoyable banter, which will keep you entertained throughout the experience.Negatives:- Graphics - The First Templar looks like a PC game from about 2004 or so. It's not a super ugly game or anything, but it certainly looks a bit rough at times. This isn't a cutting edge graphics pusher.- Animations - Aside from the combat and finishers, The First Templar's animations feel very rigid and poorly done.The First Templar won't redefine what a video game is. The First Templar won't make you fall in love. However, The First Templar will give you a fun and enjoyable action romp with some good banter and an interesting story. If you're all about graphics, this game probably won't satisfy you, but if you're looking for something a bit different and fun, I'd recommend checking this one out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"D. C. Obraztsov","summary":"Very good RPG.","reviewText":"I waited until the release of this game to purchase because I am more of an RPGer than an pure action type of gamer (for the most part), and wanted to find out exactly how \"RPG-like\" this game was.  After reading it was very much like an RPG, I bought it right away.  This definitely isn't the best RPG ever, but is it worth your time if you love RPGs?  Yes, probably.Is this Skyrim?  No.  It's not as big or in-depth, but it is a large game with plenty of quests and things to do.  Overall, I enjoy Skyrim more than this game, but if you get a little tired of the bleak atmosphere in Skyrim or a really annoying glitch (with huge Bethesda games comes lots of glitches), then switch right over to this bright, sunny relatively glitch-free world.Graphics - they are stunningly beautiful, at least to me.  Some complain that they are a little cartoonish/\"Fable-like,\" but I found them to be a perfect mixture of the cartoon graphics and realism.  It's very stylized and sleek.  The world is so bright and beautiful, which is really different than a lot of the darker RPGs these days.Battle system - first, the fluidity of the character's movements is amazing.  I haven't seen anything quite as fluid in an action-RPG in a long time.  The battle system is relatively simple, and you can choose what kind of \"destiny\" you wish to have (rogue, warrior, mage) and change it at any time.  It is completely possible to master all three throughout the game.The fighting itself is obviously not turn-based, and reminds me a lot of Devil May Cry or Gods of War.  In \"reckoning mode,\" (a bar that fills up after hacking and slashing) you are this unstoppable force where you perform little moves on your controller to defeat enemies with extra strength and HP.  Some have complained that the game is too hack and slash.  If you find this to be an issue, I recommend making the difficulty a bit harder.  At the moment there is no hardcore mode, but hopefully that will come out to please some gamers.Storyline - the storyline isn't bad and some are better than others.  There are TONS of sidequests at every corner, and some become a little repetitive.  I love the amount of characters that I am able to talk to, however, and learn their opinion on things.My least favorite parts about this game are....Dialogue options - it doesn't feel like my dialogue options matter at all.  You don't get too many, and when you do, what you choose doesn't really matter.  Maybe I'll see more of an affect from my options, but I'm starting to doubt it.No followers - yes, no companions, no followers; you are all alone.  Every now and then someone will follow you around and assist you with a quest, but no awesome dialogue with companions.  That is quite a bummer and something I was hoping would be in the game.Ko:A isn't super linear, but it's not a sandbox world like Skyrim, either.  Mobs seem to always re-spawn in the same place, what you do is somewhat limited, etc.  For a casual RPG gamer, this is a great buy.  You'll spend countless of hours having fun on quests and discovering the world.  For the more hardcore, classic RPGers, you might not like this, OR you'll have to be open-minded.  It's not a BioWare game like Dragon Age where you get to know your companions really well and influence so many of the storylines, and it's not like a Bethesda game (Fallout, Elder Scrolls) where you have this massive sandbox world where you can do anything you want.  It's a little scaled down, but still fun.  I'll say that it's a casual, nice change of pace from your regular intense RPG.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0044SA734","description":"","reviewerName":"Fizhy","summary":"Just Didn't Make It","reviewText":"This game was highly rated which led to me buying it. Honestly, it was quite boring. You are sent to do quests (Main, Faction, Side, and Tasks) and will at any given point have over 20 to do at the same time. It doesn't sound bad, but that just means you are constantly running from place to place and never really getting a chance to work on the story. Running around for hours just gets boring and all of the side quests seem like more of a chore than an enjoyable game. Another awful this about this game is the combat. It is extremely repetitive with little variation which is sad in a game as long and thought out as this one is. It froze on me twice and has a couple of problems that could mess you up (not letting you drop quest items even after the quest is over so you can't carry as much for the rest of the game). The game isn't all bad, the graphics are nice and it does have a lot to do in the game (meaning it is long). If you did every quest in the game (without DLC) you would be looking to be around 70 hours of gameplay. Overall, I would say it is a 5 out of 10 easliy one of the 5 worst games I own. If you are looking for a good RPG of this style (swords, archers, wizards) I would recommend Dragon's Dogma. Much better combat and story with more hours of gameplay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXFKE","description":"","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"Lots to see, little to like","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed 3 was easily one of the most anticipated games of 2012. I was wary about buying into the hype, but ended up getting the game anyways. While I don't regret my purchase, I can't help but feel very disappointed like many others. Put simply, the game is too big for its own good. Here's my review:Story: 3/5This game tells a story within a story. Desmond relives the life of Conner (your assassin), who fights for the Americans in the Revolutionary War, killing the evil Templars along the way. In the real world, Desmond is trying to save us all from destruction by...something. It was far too convoluted and uninteresting compared to Conner's story. They should have just stuck with Conner's tale.Setting: 5/5As Conner, you'll romp through Boston, New York, a large Frontier area that connects everything, and a Homestead area-your base of operations. These are beautifully realized places that offer much room for exploration. Trees, alleyways, rooftops, waterfalls, British encampments-they're all here.Gameplay: 4/5-CombatCombat is now more Arkham style with hitting and countering. While it's much more fluid, it's far too easy. When I-ONE person-can burst into a FORTRESS of Red Coats and slaughter them all with little effort, there's something wrong. The thing is, you can counter and immediately kill regular enemies, even when in the middle of an attack. Even special enemies are quickly disposed of by first disarming them. This basically defeats the purpose of being a stealthy assassin.-StealthYou've got your usual hiding in hay, perching on rooftops, and hanging on ledges, but this time around, you can whistle for enemies to walk to your corner, hide among tree branches, and even blend in with tall grasses. It's a beautiful stealth system (minus your inability to crouch) that isn't emphasized enough because of the easy combat.-Free RunningNow more seamless than ever. Conner is able to navigate trees and cliffs in addition to scaling buildings. Small additions like ducking under clotheslines or sliding under openings make things more cinematic. It's a well done system of movement.Missions: 2/5AC 3 tries to do so many things but some of them are pitifully executed. I'll just give brief rundowns.-Main missionsThe best part of the game. Almost all main missions come with optional objectives which are very welcome challenges. You'll need to complete all optional objectives to 100% this game. The missions themselves are quite fun.-Naval missionsAn excellent addition to the game. The thrill of blowing away ships with cannonballs never wears out.-Courier/Assassination/Delivery missionsDreadful. Courier missions allow you infinite time to deliver letters, item-collecting for deliveries is more tedious than fun, and assassinations are ill-conceived because you really just feel like you're killing random people. None of these provide a challenge AT ALL.-CollectiblesFeathers are just for percentage purposes and do nothing for you. Almanac pages are found to build inventions with no purpose except for decoration/completion. Trinkets are collected to unlock treasure hunting missions that are actually exciting. Treasure chests are good ways to boost your money.-HomesteadYou do very short missions to recruit settlers on your homestead land or improve current settlers. They craft items for you so you can engage in a highly user-unfriendly economic system that is initially tough to grasp, but even afterwards involves endless scrolling through menus. Speaking of money, you'll have lots of it. Too much to spend on anything.-ClubsThe 4 clubs come with challenges and/or side missions that are letdowns. For example, hunting missions have you killing \"legendary\" beasts that end up being as easy to kill as their regular counterparts and Frontiersmen missions have you busting urban myths, but you don't even report these to anyone. Nothing you do for clubs will net you gameplay benefits-it's all decoration or completion.-Liberation missions and recruitsYou do repetitive missions to liberate districts of NY and Boston and gain Assassin recruits for doing so. They can help you in combat or you can send them on missions to free the other colonies. But these liberations of other colonies don't feel significant in ANY way. You just know they're free, and all you get from this is cash and XP for your assassins.-Fast travel unlockingThese were pretty interesting. You'll go through underground tunnels, following signs to point you in the right direction of fast travel locations. Unlocking the points this way is much more satisfying than having them all for granted.Overall:This is a decent game that tries to do too much. Less really would have been more here. So many things you do are just for completion/decoration, that you'll feel cheated into spending more time with the game. Besides this, the story within a story approach doesn't work well for me. The setting is well realized, though, and gameplay, aside from a heavy focus on combat instead of stealth, is better than ever. If you can deal with some of the most extensive content padding that I've ever seen in a video game, this may be a title for you. But I can't give my wholehearted recommendation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2013"}

Martin","summary":"Incredible WW II based game","reviewText":"I originally chose not to pick up this game because I figured it was more horror/scifi based than shooter. I was absolutely wrong. This game is great if you like shooter type games especially the Medal of Honor series.Your mission is to infultrate Castle Wolfenstein and stop the Nazis from unleashing their paranormal plans and win WW II.Graphically the game is very good, not awesome, but pretty good.The best part of the game is that counting each part of every mission, there are approximately 39 missions to do. Most missions are just straight shooter with objectives to accomplish, and secrets that you're able to discover in order to get points to upgrade your amount of health or ammunition at the end of each mission. A few of the missions however, you must complete in as much silence and stealth as possible. So, fans of games like Splinter Cell will also find things they like about this game.The weapons you're given range from real life machine guns, shotguns, flamethrowers and handguns to fictional weapons. The AI is decently intelligent, they don't just stand there and let you kill them if they see you or you miss while trying to take them out from behind.The controls are also great. They're like most shooter games like SOCOM II and are easy to learn and remember. The only drawback to the controls is that there's no option to go prone to avoid getting shot at and you can't jump and hang on a ledge or do things like rappel.The blood and gore are very realistic, so as its raiting would suggest, this isn't for little kids or the squemish.One other drawback to this game is the fact that it's linear. There's only one way to go in order to complete a mission, you can't simply go around enemies, you have to get past them.Overall, this game is a lot of fun if you like shooting up Nazis and like some science fiction.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2004"}

I purchased it based on the strong hype and gripping previews. I say all this because I am perhaps coming from a difference place than others with this game. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this game in almost every aspect.-Story 9/10 - I have seen a few complaints about the plot in this game, but I found it to largely be very exciting and interesting. I loved the conflict in this game centering around the ethical and practical implications of human augmentation, and this conflict was echoed in the environment, graphics, and actions of those around you.-Characters 6/10 - Unfortunately, although this game develops and excellent environment and backstory, individual character development is left somewhat wanting. Although we learn a fair bit about the history of the main character and his interactions with those around him, his gruff demeanor is largely unchanging regardless of what is going on around him. Although the game does a decent job of coloring in his story, for a game that's part RPG, it could certainly be better.-Customizability 8/10 - The augmentation system for the main character is a decidedly awesome way to tweak and personalize your own game experience. There could be a bit more variability available, as it really comes down to whether you are interested in combat, stealth, or hacking. That said, the game does a good job of letting you choose your own way to tackle a situation depending on your skill-set, with the possible exception of boss battles (more on that below).-Gameplay & Mechanics 9/10 - Deus Ex blends together elements of RPG, FPR, and stealth gameplay, and it does a very good job at this. Actually progressing through levels is dynamic depending on your strengths, and the physics and control are well-designed.-Graphics & Sound Effects 8/10 - Although nothing groundbreaking, the visuals and sounds presented in this game do a very solid job of keeping you immersed in the game. My only real complaint is the game does a mediocre job of matching up mouth movements with what the characters are actually saying.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2011"}

I really don't play multiplayer a lot. For me the single player is the game, and multiplayer is an add-on, unlike most people that is the other way around. So after that \"disclaimer\" here is my honest review:There are a couple of tough missions (like the one when the typhoon is hitting the coast, with 4 or 5 tanks against you, when the checkpoint is far away and you have to replay a specific part over and over, until you are lucky to survive and get the next checkpoint, got a bit frustrating like for 1 hour trying to pass that part), but it is an OK, intense short game. If you care about the single player only, it is a rental, if you care about multi-player then it is ok to buy. There are some epic cinematic moments. Game crashes a few time on Xbox One, and you are taken back to the Dashboard, or the game does not want to load (crashing), but I see this with other games, not sure if it is something specific with the game or something else. The guided weapons when you have a lock sometimes don't fire against a moving target when you need to.I have only played the single player for the moment, so it is an ok experience to do it once. Nothing memorable. Having played the last 3 games this is my take:Best campaign:1. Battlefield 2: Bad Company2. Battlefield 4: Even though you are at a plane carrier you don't fly planes, you are mostly a marine. Destruction of environment is back. More intense than BF33.

S.","summary":"So good, and so bad...","reviewText":"This game definitely hit extremes for my taste: action-horror bliss and tedious run n' gun.Needless to say, this game has been recognized for its astounding production quality (graphics and audio).  This is complemented by an intriguing, yet poorly presented, story of one man's inner struggles in a vicious setting.  The setting is well crafted, and feels realistic.  So many little things make the setting really come to life.The core of the game is the atmospheric action-horror gameplay.  The horror is, unfortunately, mostly reduced to enemies jumping out in front of you.  However, there are quite a lot of creepy distant noises and plain frightening enemies.  Most of the game is paced well, though the player is certainly not given any breaks.  The very first enemies outright killed me.  However, near the end game the difficulty level rose immensely.  It was absurd, to say the least.  The last quarter of the game was an endless gauntlet of enemy hordes, coming from all angles.  I had to completely change my play style from patiently conservative to liberally wasteful.  It caused me much grief, as I had to throw out all my previous tactics and patient aiming for quick power.  The game quickly devolved into a trivial run and gun trial.  At times I didn't even want to continue, knowing what ludicrous hurdles were waiting for me around the next corner.Fortunately, the gauntlet of enemies was not too long to spoil the entire game.  The game's many outstanding qualities more than overcome the shortfalls, but be prepared for an end game headache.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"A Human","summary":"Wow..Just...Wow.","reviewText":"I just bought this game a few weeks ago,and it's awesome.

You control Solid Snake, a hardcore mutha who would make Schwartzenegger shake in his shorts, as he infiltrates an oil-tanker to uncover its secret cargo. While onboard, a terrorist group seizes the ship, and all hell breaks lose. From there, the plot rapidly spirals out of control as you learn about the cargo, the Sons of Liberty, and eventually stop WW3. There are some serious plot twists for old fans of the series, too.The gameplay is the star of the show - you must sneak Snake past his enemies and their various traps and detectors. Each area presents its own little \"puzzle\" to figure out, and the amount of manuevers you can perform is unbelievable - hang from a railing, hide in a locker, crawl under a table, almost anything you did while playing \"Hide 'n Seek\" as a kid, you can do here. Best of all, if you are spotted, the game doesn't punish you but simply shifts gears, into a \"Shoot and Run\" style of play in which you must elimate the guards until you can find a spot to hide again. Gradually, the alarm is called off. Perfect.As usual for this series, the bad guys you run into are amazing human beings, with real personality. Konami has a knack for inventing compelling heavies, and I think the ones in MGS2 are actually better than those in the first game. The boss encounters that correspond are actually weaker, though, with not much new to distinquish them from the orignal MGS - just run and shoot, figure out the puzzle, then move on. There is another sniper level, another torture scene, and a few underwater mazes to break up the sneaking.The plot is ultra-cheese, like some mad Anime film about reality and truth. The developers get too excited about their ideas, and as a result we sometimes are forced to listen to 10-minute conversations while Snake is hiding just inches from the enemy. Ridiculous. But my only REAL complaint is that this game is TOO SHORT. That's a fancy way of saying I wanted more, lots more, because I was having too much fun. Not a bad complaint for a video game to have. If you play through and find yourself wanting more of the same, check out the original, MGS1, which has a great PC version...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Dragon Age II Review","reviewText":"Dragon Age puts you back in the lands of the first game, sadly that's where the majority of the involvement of the first stops. You will be playing the character of the Champion, reliving the moments that gained you that title. You will have to face a threatening force and factions that unchecked could destroy the fragile balance of the city.Graphically almost the entire game is an upgrade to the first, something that everyone hoped for and expected. Unfortunately they downgraded the HUD making it look cruder, and there are times where things just don't load exactly correct.The music of the game definitely draws you into the game, but the voices are something let to be desired. There are times where you'll catch pieces of conversation that will disorient you and have you wondering why the heck this is being discussed.The controls once learned will be a powerful ally to get you through the game. Knowing how to switch quickly between characters and pulling up the radial menu to distribute potions can save your gaming experience. There is a wierd thing that did occur when loading into an area, for some reason your currently selected character would be stuck in a moving motion and unless you touched a button would continue on the directional path that they entered the area on.I wanted this game to blow me away like the first one with so many areas to explore, and people to meet. There was also the awesome origin stories that gave you a little bit of something different. None of that was really present in this game. First off you're going to be a human character, gone are the chances to play an elf, a dwarf, etc. There's also the fact that your name is going to be Hawke, or at least that's what everyone will be calling you. The second thing is that you're going to be spending almost the entirety of the game in either the city or in the area right outside the city. There's no real exploration to be done. Speaking of exploring, if you take notice you'll see that there's really only something around 5 different dungeons and they just try to make them look slightly different by locking doors, or putting obstacles in the way to make it appear differently, but if you look at the mini-map it shows you that you're in the exact same dungeon, just with a different name. Maybe I shot to high with this game, but the combat felt clunky, the story was almost non-existent until the last fifth of the game. This felt like an expansion, if it had been marketed that way and allowed your character, or offspring to step into the scene maybe it would have made a better impression on me.If you're looking for a game that gives you the Dragon Age vibe, but feels almost cheapened, then get this game. Just don't get pissed when you find that there's no ending to the story, and that the story hides itself through almost the entire game. Oh and there's the fact that the ability to interact with your fellow companions won't be as easy as the camp site, you'll have to go load into their areas talk to them, and the navigate that part of town to get back to the overworld map. There's too much back tracking and needless running around, which I see as only filler, and a cheap trick to make it feel like a longer game. I really hate to say this but this game gets a 5.4 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Anyway, JD3 comes with tons of fun and it will make you sweat while having it. If you are or feeling young, if you want to get your kids out of the couch or if you want to burn calories yourself, this is the game for you.A MODE FOR EVERYONEOn top of the good old Classic Mode, fans of the series will be able to enjoy their favorite exergame in numerous different ways.Duet Mode & Simon Says: Duet and group dances as well as the dance version of Simon Says make JD3 a good idea for parties and sleepovers. If, like me, you are over 35, this also offers the opportunity for numerous very humiliating experiences with your young ones.Medley, Non-Stop Shuffle & Just Sweat: Very good for getting your heart rate up and keeping it in the aerobic range for as long as you can handle it, without interruptions. If you are really pumped, try giving the Dance Til Dawn Mode a try. unfortunately there is still no calculations for calories burned.Just Create: a mode that is not available for the Wii. It allows the player to create his or her own dancing moves, save them and either repeat them or have his friends try to match them.INCENTIVESBut the game is all carrot, no stick. The better you match the song's moves (and the Kinect here is veeery forgiving!), the more points you accumulate.  mention getting the background to animate!). Increasing your points first allows you to animate the background - and it also increases your mojo. And the more mojo you `ve got, the more dancing modes and songs become available to you.IMPROVEMENTSGraphics received a boost, in both details and backgrounds. You prefer singing to dancing? No problem, JD3 comes with all the lyrics showing on the screen for you to accompany your favorite group or singer (no, no points for turning this dancing game into a karaoke but who cares, right?).NEW SONGSIf truth be told at first glance I liked the song collection of JD2 better. However, I think this will keep happening with every new installment of the series. These games just grow on you. You are having so much fun that the new songs will simply become as dear to you as your old favorites. Give it time.So, yes, the song list may not contain the latest hits but it has some very uplifting dance songs and your list can be enriched online (although not cheaply).This is the COMPLETE LIST of the songs contained in the game, alphabetically:1. 2 Unlimited: No Limit2.

On top of that, more songs will become available online. Some of them may be free but expect most to be sold for...240 MS-Points each. So far three songs are offered online:52.Blondie: Heart of Glass53.Irene Cara: Fame54.MC Hammer: U Can't Touch ThisThe Xbox-360 offers better graphics than the Wii, however the application of Kinect is a mixed blessing. One one hand, one does not have to hold the remote, since the camera takes care of finding you, and there is an extra mode. On the other, this also comes with the known restrictions of said camera: its range is not very wide and it requires the player to be at least 6ft/2m from the Kinect sensor. Not a problem when doing aerobics but dancing is quite another thing. I tried them both, and found that, for this exergame, the Wii to have a slight edge.Overall, JD3 is a great game for the young of all ages.RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Technoboy","summary":"Pure ONLINE RPG MAGIC..

You can buy just about any real-life car that are in showrooms today and also some of the older cars from the early sixties all the way up through to 2005.The manufacturers are all represented here from ASIA,North America(USA),Germany,Italy,United Kingdom,Sweden,France,Korea,Spain.You could buy a 1991 Honda CRX SI and upgrade it to about 580 HP & race it against a Ferrari ENZO. You have a ton of different race series from Point to Point, Amateur, Professional, Championship series,  & Long Endurance races which require pit-stops. Each race is limited to your cars category from D class, C class, B class, A class , S class, R class.Classes D through S have four subclasses ,with 1 being the highest rated & 4 being the lowest. Class R has three subclasses R-GT, R-GTS, & P1. You cars class will raise as you upgrade it & you can sell,& remove parts,adversly you can lower your cars class if you remove parts. There are also brand specific races like Impreza vs.Lancer, RX7 vs. Supra ,American Muscle event,Roadster Challenge,Club Mustang event,Light Weight Challenge,300 HP challenge & many many more.There's also FW drive event,AWD event,MR event & many more.The vast number of different class restricted races is mindboggling ,this game is HUGE! You can Upgrade your cars with a large amount of options including Intake/Exaust,Fuel Ignition,Turbo Charger, Supercharger,Intercooler,& you can swap up to bigger engines ,say example you could put a b18c5 engine from an Integra type R into any Civic.Also you can upgrade your cars other parts like, Tires from Y-rated ,DOT,to Slicks,Brakes,Transmission,Clutch & Flywheel,Weight reduction,Suspension.You can also add body kit parts from Front & Rear bumpers,Side skirts,Roll Cage,Hood,Rims,Spoilers. You can custom paint your cars from about 80 different colors.You can add custom  Decals & Vinyls on your cars left side ,top side,front bumper,rear bumper,& wing & change the shape color of each Vinyl for a completly unlimited amount of custom options.You can move,size,spin,tilt,EACH vinyl & decal & layer them up to 100,you could easily spend hours alone on vinyl applications. You can FINETUNE your cars set-up from Front & Rear tire pressure,adjust each individual gear ratio,adjust degree of camber /toe/castor,adjust ride height front & rear, adjust spring tension from soft to firm,adjust Damping Bump & Rebound,Adjust AERO downforce on front bumper & spoiler/wing, adjust Differential accell & decel,adjust Braking balance & pressure & the E-brake slow/fast.You can then go test your adjustments on any track youve unlocked & while your on the track you can fine tune it as your driving a test run in the pause menu.You can then save your cars tune set-up & then load that set-up before any race to match the track your gonna race on.You also can get a Benchmark setting to see what your adjustments have done ,it will show you Acceleration 0-60mph time ,0-100mph time, Top Speed,Braking Distance In feet ,& Lateral G's. As you win races & championships you will get credits towards purchasing more cars or parts,Also sponsors will give you discounts on parts when you win races & championships.Car manufacturers will give you free cars for winning races,series,& championships.The graphics are pretty good in this game ,the only negative thing is the people look like cardboard cutouts,but its still looks pretty good alot of nice detail.The New York & Tokyo tracks are realy nice. The cars all look fantastic and after youve finished a race you can watch and/or save your replay which looks fantastic.The strongest part of this game is the racing gameplay which is outstanding! And I did notice a big difference in performance after you add parts to your car and/or fine tune it .Its a very realistic racing game that does have a learning curve to get used to ,but once you get familiar with the driving physics its realy fun. The developers did a great job with this game & it shows. FORZA is must own for any fan of Racing sims & it could possibly win game of the year award ... HINTS: I noticed some reviewers saying that they couldnt adjust the steering response & control .But you can by adjusting everything from the camber to the tire & the front bumber rear wing downforce not to mention a TON of other adjustments that can be done to make the cars handle alot better .You can adjust the understeer/oversteer which will effect the smoothness of driving physics, but you cant adjust many of these things until you purchase the available upgrades.Also  if your having problems with high-powered rear wheeled cars spinning out, try adjusting the toe/camber & also the tire pressure for front & rear.A good combo is a lower pressure rear wheel & a higer pressure front. It affects the oversteer/underseer balance. But it might be opposite for some drivers.Try different tire pressures & for better handling . One of the best handling cars in the game is the PORSCE 959 ,its handles extremly well because its a four wheel drive car & can be upgraded to a S class car, In which I had great success with up against the mighty Chrysler ME 4-12 in the S class races & the mighty TVR 12 CYLINDER.The ME 4-12 is very hard to control because of its rear wheeL drive.Another good thing to remember is to go very easy into the brakes ,dont ever slam on the brakes you'll just slide all over the place. Remeber slow is fast in the tight turns . Also if you wanna be a better driver in the long run turn off ALL of the assists except for the green ASSIST line so you'll have a great adavantage in knowing just how fast you can barrell into a turn & try different apex lines into the turn .The green assist line isnt always the best or fastest line.But and I say but that makes a big difference in how your car is FINE-TUNED. FORZA is absolutly the most advanced & most in depth racing game I have ever played. Move over GT4 ,FORZA is in town.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2005"}

This thing charges fast, allows for the simultaneous charging of two batteries and a light indicator lets you know when the batteries are fully charged.  Now this may be a plus or a minus depending on who you talk to, but it plugs in to a wall outlet and not the USB slot on the console.  I look at that as a plus as I have many near by wall outlets and like to leave my USB ports open for other possible peripheral.  That said, the product comes with the cord, charging station and a spare battery for under $30.  It's a great deal.**UPDATE - So after about 1 year of owning this thing and maybe using it two dozen times, it has shorted out.

Yea, there is really no story and I'd love to see more guns (the hunting rifle is essentially useless when you've got two dozen zombies swarming you), but if you're not a game snob and you just want to have some yell out loud fun with a friend then definitely give this a try.Also, this is a really fast paced game, I tried to play RE5 right afterward and it felt like I was walking through mud everything was moving so slow.I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of different guns.  There really isn't that noticeable of a difference between the guns (I can take out a zombie across the street with a shot gun the same as I can with a hunting rifle equipped with a zoom scope).

Unfasten special features and stages by collecting Emeralds","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"Sonic Advance much more \"Advanced\"! (by Laura)","reviewText":"This is a great game.  First off, comparing it to Sonic Advance, which is a good game in its own right, this game is indeed a big improvement.  You not only get to play as all of the characters you could in Sonic Advance, but there is a cool new character included, or I should say two, Cream the Rabbit and her partner Cheese the chao.  The levels are pretty and various, from the quaint Leaf Forest, to the highly enjoyable Music Plant to the icy loveliness of Ice Paradise.  They have added what is called \"after images\" which really adds speed and depth when the characters are running, for it gives the illusion of great speed.  There is also this extremely cute feature, that when you hold up on the control pad each character does a unique action.  This won't help you through the gameplay much, but if you are not in a hurry to get out of the level, at least watch it for a minute.  It really is cute.  I also heard Knuckles' action can be use as an attack.  The boss fights are very different from the other games as, except for the last two, you have to attack them while you are running.  This has various advantages and disadvantages, but overall it makes the boss fights fun and enjoyable with a challenging difficulty.  Personally, how Cream can beat most of the bosses is my favorite.  She makes things ridiculously easy, because all you have to do is smack the B button a couple of times, and her partner Cheese takes care of things.  Now, there are indeed some disadvantages with the game.  Here is a list of them:1.  As I said earlier, the fact you have to tackle most of the bosses while running can have disadvantages.  It is harder to dodge attacks, and if you are struck, it can take some time to recover and catch up.  The good news is you won't die if you fall behind, as the screen will just scoot you along; but if you don't enjoy this sort of combat, than that's a for sure minus.2.  The special stages are fun.  It's basic, you just have to run around a set area, and try to get enough rings before time runs out while simultaneously avoiding a robot that is pursuing you.  The catch?  Try getting to the special stages.  Unlike other Sonic games where you just jump on a spring, you have to collect all seven of these SPECIAL rings in the act.  Please do not get these confused with normal rings.  Special rings are big rings with what I think are wings in the upper center.  Anyway, how do you get them?  You have to find them.  Easier said than done, because most of the time this is infuriatingly difficult, as it is easy to miss one or two, and be left out of the Special Stage.  I admit I had to have outside help to find all of these annoying rings.  On top of that if you lose the Special stage, simply not getting enough normal rings, you have to collect those Special rings ALL OVER AGAIN!!!  While this normally isn't a probem, the hardest special stages (I am speaking of the last one and the second to last one, in Techno Base and Egg Utopia) are also in the acts with the hardest to get to Special rings, and the hardest to survive levels.  That's the last thing, if you don't make it out of the level on one life alive, you can say \"bye bye\" to all the rings you managed to collect.3.  You have to unlock virtually everything.  Unless you can progress in the game all you can play as is Sonic.  You have to play with him and bump into Cream, Tails, and Knuckles in order to play with them.  This game has a tiny chao garden, but you won't receive it untill you complete the game (chaos emeralds included) with one character.  There is also stuff like time attack and sound test that you can unlock by completing the game with more than one character, but this is very difficult, and you will be pretty lucky to get the tiny chao garden.4.  You have to complete the game with four characters to get to play as Amy Rose.  On top of that, Amy is just an extra, which is a real shame since sega missed out on what could have potentially been a funny cutscene in Sonic's story.  I will say that it is worth it to unlock her if you can, for her moves are new and improved, her new spindash is funny, and her control pad action is cute.  Be warned that if you do decide to try and complete the game with her it is for your sheer enjoyment only.  In other words, you get no rewards for beating the game with her.5.  There is some repitition.  If you want to unlock absolutely everything, or complete the game completely, you have to beat the game with every character (including Amy, if you want a real 100%).  This means starting with Leaf Forest and going all the way past Egg Utopia and the Final Boss, chaos emeralds in tow and everything at least 5 times.  The one thing I do not understand is how you can rescue, say Knuckles in an area as far as Sky Canyon, and yet when you begin playing as him, you must start all the way back at Leaf Forest.  It's how it is though, and don't ask me how all of the characters manage to get back there. The Special ring locations always stay the same, so you are just going through the absolute same zones and bosses around 5 times (if you choose to go through it all at once), give or take difficulty depending on you character (Creams easier than Sonic for example).  You will also have to beat the extra boss once, which has a nice difficulty level.  At least the levels are, for the most part, enjoyable, so you may not mind going through some of them so many times.  One of my personal favorites is the Music Plant, where you can actually hop on a xylophone (thats pronounced ZYE-luh-fohn, for those who are youngsters).  Also the scenes after the extra boss are also worth seeing if you can conquer it.6.  The tiny chao garden once again fails to impress as much as one of the big gardens in the Sonic Adventure series.  However, it is still a good place to level up your baby chao, and in this game the chao seem more \"Life-like\" as they actually use the pool.  The minigames also have a little fun in them, I personally prefer the one where you have to make sure Cheese doesn't fall on the ground while collecting the rings.  You will laugh when he does though, as Cream covers her face with her hands, while Cheese's face says as plain as day \"OUCH!\"That about concludes it for me.  The music is so-so, not Sega's best, but still good.  I basically rated the game for four star fun, because of the flaws I have listed, but five stars overall because it is a HUGE improvement from Sonic Advance, which is also fun.  Speaking of fun, if that and those old speedy thrills is what you want, than for pete sakes PURCHASE THIS VIDEOGAME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2007"}

The Dreamcast was pretty awesome, but when it came down to the Nintendo 64, Playstation 1 & 2, and the Xbox all together, it seems like SEGA couldn't keep up with them, as the company began to turn into a third-party developer/publisher. So what do they do? THEY MAKE A SONIC GAME ON THE NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE (With publishing help from THQ)! How cool is that?! Sonic has arrived onto a Nintendo system! Sure, Sonic Adventure 2 on the Gamecube may have technically been his Nintendo debut for us, but Sonic Advance was a whole new game. And even better: It was 2D Sonic fun. Fast forward a year or two later, we get another offering of said 2D Sonic fun.Sonic Advance 2 is a more speed-orientated game compared to its predecessor. Most of the time, you'll be running through levels in an incredible pace. It's like a 2D rollercoaster ride. Nevertheless, it was really satisfying.The level design is HUGE, and is well multilayered. Sonic Advance 1 had multilayered level design as well, but here, it's totally expanded. There are lots of areas to explore if you're not a big fan of this \"go to end of the level\" thing. In fact, to get to the Special Stages in the game, you gotta find 7 \"special rings\" scattered in each level. Everyone's gotta love Special Stages, eh? But even without the exploration factor, the levels are still very fun to blast through. I just wish there were a few more enemies in each level.Of course, the graphics were really detailed, colorful, and vibrant all around. Actually...It seems like they IMPROVED on the graphics department. These new zones look all the more better than they did back in Sonic Advance.Speaking of improvements, the soundtrack managed to be catchier, too. And with level themes such as a Techno Base and a Music Plant, it's obvious we'll be expecting some good music out of here.The only major flaw with Sonic Advance 2 is that it does sometimes feel like it's not offering as much platforming gameplay as it should have. It's speed, speed, SPEED. At least there's still some platforming, but not as much as its predecessor.But all in all, Sonic Advance 2 is definitely worth your while, and if you're into this Sonic stuff, then you're in for a good time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

O.k., first off, shut your mouth and listen up because Capcom Vs. SNK is easily the best 2D fighter on any system that I've seen.Now don't get me wrong, I love most 3-D Fighting games but there are so many of them now and all of which are very similar that it gets so annoying and then you end up saying \"no more fighting games\" and that's not good. Capcom Vs SNK takes the concept of SNK's very popular \"King of Fighters\" series and mixes it up with \"Street Fighter\" graphics, action and gameplay. The first time they combined the 2, I almost laughed thinking that the expections wouldn't live up to the hype. And I was wrong now I still can't put this game down.Another reason I like this game so much is because you really don't have to use special moves all the time just like in the original Street Fighter 2. Sure it's nice to use them and they look so much better, now along with the new and improved Super Specials, this game has a lot more going for it. After all, that's one of the drawbacks (in my opinion), to games like Tekken and Mortal Kombat and Killer Instinct. You get beat down miserably if you can't do any of the characters techniques or special moves and yet, the Capcom and SNK games still give you a fair edge because for the most part, the characters are a little more even and each character has his or her own defining points.Speaking of which, there are a lot more characters and the combination of teams that you can build is almost endless (Try my favorite: TEAM CHEAP that consists of Ryu, Terry Bogard and Sagat or Joe Higashi.

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros.

This game is fantastic that even though I never played the original, it never confused you and caught you up fast.  Funny that my favorite character is always Garrus, as he's just.....your wingman, your best friend, who's always there for you, and now going back to ME1, where he just &#34;met me&#34; for the first time, is weird.  But I guess thats how it is starting in the middle of something :)Overall, the ME series is fantastic, have been with Bioware since Baldur's Gate running on my PC when I was a teenager, and this and the dragon age games are the best experiences in games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"A Truly Beautiful Game... Get this!!","reviewText":"Ever since I first played Tales of Destiny way back in 1999 I have been in love with the Tales franchise. While not as immediately recognizable in the mainstream gaming community as the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest/Warrior RPG juggernauts, the \"Tales of\" series of games have always had a loyal fan base due to the great stories and combat that is the hallmark of the games. The question of whether or not to purchase the latest game in the franchise was a no-brainer for me, and I can say with 100% certainty that I am so happy that I indulged myself.Controls, Music, & AnimationEvery Tales game is painstaking in its delivery of beautiful graphics and music, and Tales of Xillia (henceforth referred to as \"ToX\") continues in that tradition. Simply put, this game is gorgeous and takes every advantage of the PS3 hardware to simply amaze me. The world of Xillia is bright, colorful, and varied. Environments are dynamic; each exploration area is divided by little \"breaks\"; while this may seem annoying, the lack of lag when going through a doorway into the next room is practically non-existent. The screen flashes black for one moment and then you are free to control your character.In addition to the beautiful backgrounds, the characters are 3D mirrors of their anime-inspired sprites used in the cut scenes. While you do notice the difference between the 2D drawing of Milla (the female protagonist) and her 3D avatar, the seamless transition negates any of the very minor aesthetic details. Finally, each character in the game is unique, sporting their own look, and enemies are just as varied and detailed as the \"good guys\".Musically speaking, Tales of Xillia boasts an amazing orchestral arrangement with songs to suit every zone in the game. It is truly beautiful and lends itself well to the atmosphere of the story. When you are in an ominous, dark dungeon the music is creepy, with violins and woodwinds playing higher and slightly off-key, creating the ambiance of a thriller movie. Sound effects cover every aspect of movement, helping to bring the world of Xillia to life. If your character is moving through shallow water, swishing noises will occur with each step. The crackle of fire whispers through a zone, subtlety lighting a path. Birds chirp. When the graphics and sound come together, you will find yourself immersed in a world of magic, mysteries, and more than a few baddies to kill.The controls in ToX are spot-on. Combat is real-time, so players need to be aware of their characters and the baddies on the screen. At the beginning of the game you can alter whether you want harder enemies, a longer input time for combos, and your X- and Y-axis movement [meaning whether pressing upward with the control stick will move the camera up (normal) or down (inverted)]. I chose the hardest setting and kept the input time as \"Normal\". In the beginning enemies attack slower, which is good as it gives you time to acquaint yourself with the mechanics of combat. While pressing the \"X\" button will make your character charge forward and attack a target, you also have different magic/elemental-based attacks that can be access from the menu (the \"&#9650;\" button) which vary based upon who you chose as your protagonist to control. Thus, combat sometimes needs a good strategy; just jumping in and whacking enemies with your weapon does not always work. In this way ToX enhances the gameplay by adding a level of strategy. Once you form a party, coming up with a plan of attack becomes critical; you will be able to combine attacks and setup AI strategies to maximize your combat proficiency (your cohorts will be controlled by AI; from the party menu you can adjust their combat focus, for instance: should that character conserve TP (mana) or go all out and cast the most powerful spells each battle? Do you want a character to heal exclusively or to heal AND attack?)..Finally, in regard to the map and character control, Xillia has everything nailed. The camera rests comfortably in a 3rd person perspective of your character. The camera rotates freely, enabling you to see a complete map and minimizing the risk of an enemy sneaking up from behind. Since enemies are seen on the map and battles are not random encounters, this is a very important function.StoryToX has an over-arching plot of determining why the elements are out of harmony and how to restore mana to the world. When one of the kingdoms in the world of Xillia experimented with powerful magic, they unwittingly caused widespread devastation by draining the world's mana. It is your job to figure out what happened and how to fix it before the other kingdoms start an all-out war.While the story itself is your basic good-vs-evil RPG fare, the depth of the storyline, the complexity of the characters (their personalities and motives) and presented in a manner to both intrigue the player and to soldier onward to learn more. In addition, ToX gives you TWO games in one; at the beginning you choose either the male (Jude Mathis) or female (Milla Maxwell). In either case, the story will unfold from the perspective of THAT character. Thus, while you will travel with the other person regardless, you will only interpret events through the eyes and mind of your protagonist. This, of course, means that you will want to play through the game AGAIN to see another side to the story!As the story progresses, you will find yourself watching numerous cut scenes and work to cultivate not only new abilities for combat but also the friendships of others in your party. Using a robust crafting system, ToX adds another level of depth by encouraging the player to explore and find items. All of this combined will suck you into the game and make you want to press onward (maybe to the detriment of your job... make sure that you don't miss work in your zeal to beat the game!).OverallTo simplify this review, let's recap:Pros:1) Beautiful combat system that keeps enemy encounters fun and challenging,2) No random encounters! Enemies are seen on the map and can be avoided, if desired,3) Beautiful environment, unique characters, and an amazing soundtrack,4) Game controls are easy to pick up and play,5) LOTS of replay value: play through the character-specific storyline depending upon the hero,6) Wonderful and often-humorous storytelling, encouraging dialogue with others,7) Lots to explore and many items to find; exploring the world is visually rewarding!Cons:1) It costs money; but I guarantee that you will find this to be the best $60 spent on a game this year!2) The cut scenes can be a little long at times, but this is a minor irritation at best,3) That Tales of Xillia 2 won't be available in the U.S. for a while!Thus, simply put, ToX is one of the best games that I have acquired and played in 2013. The story is entertaining, the gameplay is fun, combat isn't random and does require strategy (you can't just button-mash and expect to win), and you can replay the game a second time to see the story from another viewpoint. Oh, and did I forget to mention that the graphics are gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing?If you haven't already clicked that \"Buy\" button, you should really do so. This game is a must-have for PS3 owners, Tales franchise fans, or the RPG-lover in your life. This is truly one of the best games I have played, and I encourage you to explore the world of Tales of Xillia for yourself!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Griswel","summary":"Amazing ... So Far","reviewText":"Look, this is an MMORPG, so how the game will play years from now or even six months is up in the air.  However, I have to say, so far so good.First, accept that this is in many ways World of Warcraft set in Star Wars land.  WoW borrowed from other MMORPGs which borrowed from still others and so on, until players got a basic framework that did what needed to be done.  SWG tried something completely different, and suffered for it.  This is not to say that all WoW classes have one-for-one substitutes in SWTOR, far from it.  The Old Republic works far more with hybrid class structure.  Crowd control, for example, tends to be spread across classes (though WoW does that, too).  But generally, healers heal, tanks tank, DPS DPSes and everyone has a health bar and some form of spendable energy.  Heck, tanks even build up rage.  So if you don't like classes and the basic format of other MMORPGs, SWTOR will disappoint.If you like WoW, and eleventy billion people can't be wrong, and you like/love Star Wars, you'll love SWTOR.If you want to be a Jedi, half the classes are Jedi, so enjoy!  Nothing says \"I'm cool\" like starting every fight firing up dual lightsabres and using Force Leap.  Gameplay in SWTOR looks an awful lot like the very cool cinematics the game starts with.First off, the cinematics.  The opening cinematic for all players, and the ones for Sith/Republic are quite good.  But the game goes on in that vein, not with the same quality cinematics, but with cut-scenes and voice acting.  I've heard far from all there is, but it's all been somewhere between fine and outstanding.  If you're not in a hurry to kill the next mob, then it is very enjoyable.  Granted, there is a lot of \"rescue my son Joe\" or, if you're a Sith, \"brutally murder five innocent people in front of their families\", but there are only so many plots to go around.  Also, enough characters are either lunatics or lying to keep you on your toes.There is a separate plot-line for each class.  The game offers even more replayability than most because of this.  The Classes on the two sides are better balanced than WoW or other MMORPGs, because they are identical!  Every Republic Class has an exact duplicate on the Sith side (or vice-versa) with a different name.  None of this \"they got X and we only got Y\" to complain about.  Well, there is one thing.  Sith have lightning shooting out of their hands.  Jedi get, um, very small rocks.  \"Suffer the wrath of my vaguely wind-like pebbles!\"Crafting seems to be well done, though I haven't gotten near the end game yet.  In a nice twist, crafting is done by \"companions\".  After a few levels, you get your first companion, then add more as you cap out.  One can come with you in most places.  Any of your companions can be sent off on various missions to acquire items or Darkside or Lightside points.  It even helps resource gathering - point your companion at the resource and run to the next objective or fight.  No more standing at a forge or equivalent.  Order your droid or other companion to \"make me more of this\" and voila, it pops into your inventory.  Very handy in a pinch.There is virtually no built-in downtime.  Every class has an out-of-combat self-heal that means you're always five seconds from full.  Death is relatively painless, too, though the run back might not be quick.  Instances are typical MMORPG except there are very interesting stories with their own cut-scenes.  This is where the game will change dramatically as time goes on, of course.  They didn't ship with a fully fleshed-out endgame. PvP instances  are fun and instead of zones for levels 10-19, 20-29 and so on, there is a leveling function to generally equalize all combatants.There are downsides.  At release, queues are a quite pain.  This is typical, though, and probably no worse for SWTOR than any other game which was popular at release.  Running is bad.  I don't mean not having a speeder, I mean that travel between places can be a real chore, especially on Coruscant (where city layouts can be maddening).  There are bind points in many places, and a half-hour cooldown lets you make frequent use of it, but travel might annoy you if your comparison is a one-player game (and not, say, EQ1) or simply in comparison with the player-friendliness of the rest of the design.  It also takes some time for your class to translate into the abilities you'll have later, and not just in raw power.  Healing, for example, can be frustrating into your twenties because you seem underpowered for the mobs you face.  As I said, classes tend to be hybrid, and it may be a while before a healer is intended to be heal-only, and not a shooter as well.  DPS, on the other hand, can DPS like a maniac from day one.All in all, if you're considering a new MMORPG, this is the NEXT BIG THING, and - so far - it's been amazing.Final Note - Kudos to Amazon for both their Release Date shipping policy, and for Overnighting both copies I had ordered (without any contact from me, so I believe it was done for everyone).  With the grace period/no grace period drama, it was nice to always know that Amazon would get the game to me on time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

Mostly it was hard for me to aim and shoot. I got killed a lot and I looked for this after seeing \"THE CONTROLLER\"'s last episode where the guy doesn't want to play because he didn't have this attachment (fps freek) on his controller and looked like a total idiot forfeiting the competition to win 50,000 grand.So I bought them thinking \"woah, these must really help since that guy didn't want to play without them and lost an opportunity to win 50,000\". I read the reviews and they said these things really help so I bought them. After the purchase had been done I kept reading the reviews of people saying that these will break up your controller's sticks and its true! They wrap around the stick really tight and unless you want to keep this thing on most of the time you shouldn't put them on at all.Now for my experience: I put them on and it feels a little more comfortable and you do get a little more range in motion. This increases the sensitivity for when you want to do small adjustments but it also makes you push the stick further away when you want fast adjustments.The reality is if you want to get better at FPS you need to work on the basics first! Learn how to move around, how to shoot, how to aim and adjust your sensitivity. By doing these things I am so much better at Battlefield 3. I end up most of the time in the top spots in any kind of match. It just takes time and practice but you don't need these things that will in the long run handicap you because you get used to them and when you go to a competition where you could win $50,000 dollars you will quit like a baby because you can't play with a normal controller anymore.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2011"}

The cut scenes were great and it was an innovative idea.  The new Tomb Raider here follows the same idea of allowing you to jump anywhere and everywhere, even to your death when you thought you could make it.  It also has great cinematic/action storyline.  I like the feature of making you feel like you're actually Lara when you are trying to dodge impediments on land, water, or even air... or when you're trying to get out of a tight spot.  You have several different ways of killing the enemy whether close combat or far away.  You can also be stealthy by doing quick kills while others are looking away.  The world is great and love the secret tomb feature.  I wish the tombs were more in depth though.  I only have two negatives.  I don't like the look/feel of Shanty Town.  This 2nd one is actually just a general for all games.  I with they'd use my PS3 login info as their own for the company... such as Square Enix, EA, and many other gaming companies.

I really did enjoy playing it.  There are a few flaws that keep it from a perfect score; however, it is still an excellent and enjoyable experience overall.  Let's begin the review!Graphics (8/10): The graphics are somewhat similar to FF7 in that your characters are composed of simpler shapes and only have eyes on their faces (no mouths, folks!) However, the graphical world of Grandia 2 looks a lot smoother than FF7's and is less pixelated.  Some people may not enjoy the simple graphical design after having seen more realistic looking games, but it didn't perturb me one bit, the graphics are bright and colorful.  If you need further information about what this game actually looks like, just take a gander at some screen shots.  Note, there are some graphical glitches from time to time, but they do not affect gameplay in any real way.Music (7/10): Hmmm... is is just me or is the same song used for every dungeon?  Why yes!  Well, aside from the lack of variety, the music isn't too bad.  It's nothing to run out and buy the soundtrack for, but it's not so annoying as to make your ears bleed.  Also, the game features voice acting during some (but not all) dialogue.  The voice acting is decent, and there was no one whose voice I really hated.Characters (10/10): Yes, I know these characters are basically stereotypes; you've got the innocent, naive female character, the tough-acting mercenary, the strong, noble beast-man, etc.  Even though I realized I had seen all this before, they didn't feel like stereotypes to me.  The fresh interesting dialogue really made me fall in love with these characters.  There was never a point in which I said, \"gee, these people bore me\".  Personally, I think Ryudo steals the show.  I know some people won't like his pessimism and sarcastic wit, but personally, I found his comments to be really funny.Story (9/10): You start the game as a cold-hearted mercenary who takes a job escorting a young naive girl to a tower to perform a religious ceremony. Along the way, ancient evil is released and you discover the truth behind the ruling religion, etc.  Sound familiar?  Just like the characters, the story, too, has been done before.  However, I still felt that the story was very interesting and entertaining, even if you may have an idea of what's going to happen next.  Grandia 2 does a good job of re-telling this archetypal RPG story, such that it feels fresh and interesting.  Plus, for an \"already-done\" plotline, at least it's more interesting than most.Battle System (10/10): Grandia 2' battle system is more complex than your average turn-based affair. You actually have to factor in things such as range of spells/attacks and timing of attacks.  There is a small bar at the bottom of the screen that tells when you or the enemy will take their turn, if you do certain attacks and hit the enemy while they are in the red section of the bar, it will cancel their attack, forcing them to wait longer to get off a move.  This works in reverse, too, of course.  This system really adds more depth to the gameplay.  Another plus to the battle system is that your characters will move around on the screen during battle, eliminating the \"let's all line up and attack\" feel of other turn-based games (by the way, I'm not bothered by attacking in lines, but others may enjoy getting away from that).  Also, because you move around and spells and attacks have ranges, factoring in how close you are to the enemy and how bunched together the enemies are (which means you can hit them all with one spell) is important.  Overall, I found the battle system to be fun and interesting.Gameplay (7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see... I really enjoyed the \"meal conversations\".  This is where the character's are further developed by allowing you to choose people to talk to while having dinner.  I feel this aspect really does enhance character development.  On another note, the linearity of the game really hampers it.  You can't ever backtrack to previous places past the last two places you visited.  Even if there is no logical reason you couldn't return to the first town you were in (not like it was destroyed or anything) the game never allows you to.  In fact, you don't have free travel even by the time you get to the end of the game.  That, and the fact that the world map is a point and click to the next place sort of deal, might turn people off.  There's also a disturbing lack of sidequests and mini-games available.  I recall there only being one side dungeon and one minigame.  Hmmm...  The menus and controls are fine, and other than the points I've already mentioned, there's really nothing else that's note-worthy.Overall (8/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  Personally, I derived great enjoyment out of this game despite its flaws.  It would have a perfect score if it weren't for the lack of sidequests and the linearity.  Whether you not these limitations will prevent your enjoyment of the game is a matter of your own personal preferences, but I found the overall Grandia 2 experience to be worthwhile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2008"}

Wii, like all the previous releases in theSuper Mario Bros.franchise is a side-scrolling platforming game where players collect coins as they attempt to make their way through progressively more difficult game levels using their ability to time jumps over obstacles and avoid a slew of enemies. But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane. Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros.

It has been nearly 25 years since Super Mario Brothers came out, and the famous plumber from Nintendo has captured so many delightful hearts and the ability to save Princess Toadstool (a.k.a. Princess Peach) from the menacing destruction of Bowser and his alliances. With so many gamers still awaiting the upcoming sequel to the widely acclaimed Super Mario Galaxy next year for the Wii, they definitely know they are in for a treat. But, that doesn't mean Mario is waiting in the wings with something new months down the road. He has something new for hard core fans that brings in a whole lot of new excitement and challenges, with a bit of nostalgia for hard core Super Mario fans young and old alike. Back in 2006, when New Super Mario Brothers came out for the Nintendo DS, it really reintroduced the classic and driven platforming that die hard Mario fans have known for years, with a new generation of gaming on the go. Now, that classic gameplay and Super Mario Platforming we all have known and loved, is again here for the Wii's gaming fans and the excitement is definitely here.New Super Mario Brothers Wii for the Nintendo Wii, brings in all the classic excitement and gameplay we've all loved past & present with new twists in the hard core way we've played with Mario, Luigi and his friends for all these years. The gampley is very simple, as you go on another quest, trying to go through the depths of the mushroom kingdom, saving the princess from the doom of Bowser. The game has over 60 different stages in the mushroom kingdom which you battle classic enemies from goombas and koopa troopas, as well as outrageous enemies that haven't been seen in the Mario universe in years (especially Bowser's Koopa kids like Larry, Roy and Lemmy from the original Super Mario Brothers 3 from the old NES days) to score your way to the top. There are new and returning power-ups that help you on your challenge from the originals like the mushroom and fire flower and the returning Ice Mario (from Super Mario Galaxy,) to new power-ups that brings in outrageous fun like the Penguin Suit, that allows Mario to slide like the classic penguins on his belly through sheets of snow and ice, to help him trounce on enemies, and score points and extra lives, and the propeller hat, which allows Mario and Luigi to spin like a whirly-bird helicopter propeller in the sky, to help reach coins for extra unlockables and new challenges.The graphics look absolutely amazing, and brings in the simple and unique look that was drawn in from New Super Mario Brothers from the DS, well and recognized as a whole for classic gameplay. The control is also very simple to master, as you can play wither holding the Wii-mote like the classic NES controller that you've known and loved for years, or choosing to control Mario by using the Wii-mote & nunchuck controller, which also works very well too. The other additions that handle well iis the ability to play with Mario in a multiplayer melee challenge, by either helping your teammates through the challenging levels, or knocking them out to their doom and making them lose a life. The enjoyment never seems to end for the hard core Mario fan in you with this great challenge.All in all, New Super Mario Brothers Wii is a fun and delightful game that challengs you well with fun and energetic mayhem. I absolutely have to say it is a fantastic treat for the must have Super Mario fan in you, young and old. I absolutely loved how challenging the game looks and the gameplay doesn't seem to lose that muscle either. It is pleasingly, pure fun for anyone who loves the classic little plumber in the true and top form fun for all gamers alike that want their way to score through the mushroom-loving, Super Mario Brothers universe.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: A- for multiplayer and solo playOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A non-stop, turbo charged, action packed thrill ride","reviewText":"This is the type of game that you will either love or hate. There's very little room for a middle ground. Vanquish is a sci-fi, third person shooter which pumps you full of adrenaline, drops you on the fast track, and sets you off at full speed until you reach the finish line...with very few pit stops along the way. Set in the not too distant future, a space station orbiting Earth has been taken over by the Order of the Russian Star, a militaristic group that has forcefully gained leadership over Russia. Using a powerful microwave emitter in the space station, the Russian wackos fire the weapon on San Francisco and most of its inhabitants are literally cooked alive. Quite gruesome. Unless the U.S. surrenders to the Russian Star within 10 hours, New York will be the next city that feels what it's like to be a hot pocket in a microwave oven. The U.S. responds by sending a few hundred platoons of Marines into the space station to take back what's theirs and stop the next attack. Leading the assault is Lt. Colonel Robert Burns, and along for the ride is DARPA research agent Sam Gideon, the player character. His job is to assist the Marines while testing out the true star of the show, the ARS (Augmented Reaction Suit), although he also intends to free his old friend Professor Candide, who has been captured by the Russian Star inside the space station. And...that's pretty much it. The barebones story doesn't really get anymore interesting from there. There's only a small collection of main characters and they're all rather two-dimensional and clich&eacute; (I normally make it a point not to use the term \"clich&eacute;\", but no other word best describes the characters in this game).We've seen them all before in so many summer blockbuster B-movies: Sam is the snarky jokester with a heart of gold who sounds like Solid Snake's understudy; Burns is the very tough and macho military straight-man with a chain gun who only cares about taking out the enemy and completing his mission; Elena is the cute and highly intelligent girl who provides Sam and the others with intelligence on enemy positions and mission objectives; and Zaitsev is the leader of the Russian Star who takes pleasure in watching his enemies suffer and fall before his army of robots as he oh so evily sits on his chair and watches as the chaos unfolds. Much like the Ninja Gaiden games, Vanquish's story is added simply to provide a logical reason for all the fighting and shooting. Fortunately, this is one of those few games that can get away with having such a throw away story because everything else it does is executed to near perfection. The game looks great, controls like a dream, has very fast paced action, and has a bunch of challenging enemies for you to shoot down and blow up. The game revolves around moving from one battlefield to the next and shooting down all the bad robots who get in your way. Most of the time you're either in some open square or some underground base fighting large groups of enemies. A few missions change things up by having you riding on moving platforms and shooting down flying enemies in a couple of on-rail shooting scenarios. Another mission has you sniping searchlights before they spot you and give away your position to enemy cannons. These are somewhat rare, but they keep the game from getting too repetitive.Many of the environments in the space station look the same with all the white washed walls of the many buildings, bases, and control rooms making everything have the look of being very technologically advanced, if not entirely varied. The only significant environmental change is in this one mission that takes place in a tree filled park. Also, a few incredible set-pieces involving collapsing buildings and bridges shake things up further in a chaotically satisfying way. The character and enemy designs fare better than those of the environments, especially the ARS (I wish I had one). Even the way the parts of the suit move and shift as Sam controls it are quite impressive. The gameplay is just as incredible. Using the ARS's BLADE (Battlefield Logic ADaptable Electronic) function, Sam is able to replicate and store up to three different weapons that he can switch between on the fly with the directional buttons. He can pick up the more traditional assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers; but he can also carry more unusual and \"futuristic\" weapons such as a gun that fires a large and slow moving orb of energy, a gun that shoots bladed discs, and a gun that fires several homing lasers into the air that rain back down onto their targets. These weapons can be upgraded by picking up another of the same weapon that you currently have equipped (assuming it has full ammo) or by picking up instant upgrade icons normally left behind by certain fallen enemies. For example, if you have a fully loaded shotgun, then picking up another one will give the shotgun a point towards its next upgrade (I believe three or four points are required before reaching the next upgrade). Depending on the weapon, the upgrades include increased rate of fire, increased firepower, quicker lock-on targeting, etc. Sam can also carry powerful incendiary grenades, as well as EMP grenades that temporarily disable most enemies. He is even capable of commandeering the enemies' mounted gatling guns and Star Wars-esque walking platforms to help even the odds when facing large groups of regular enemies or just a few of the more powerful enemies this game throws at you. The ARS itself possesses some amazing abilities that give Sam the edge over most enemies he faces.Built in jet boosters allow him to power slide at high speeds across the battlefield, the suit's increased strength makes Sam capable of sending his enemies flying with explosive melee attacks that change in style depending on what weapon is equipped (punches and flip kicks), and AR mode functions like bullet-time and slows everything down to a crawl, allowing Sam to shoot down more enemies in mere seconds and target the weak spots on larger enemies more easily. AR mode also automatically activates after getting critically injured, allowing you to make a quick escape from your enemies and recover. Using every one of these abilities to their fullest is required in order to not get yourself killed too much. The special abilities all drain the suit's energy meter and if you allow it to run out, the suit will overheat and place Sam in a more vulnerable state. When overheated, the suit will be unable to perform either of its special abilities, and even Sam's dodging and aiming will be less refined without the suit assisting in his performance. It takes roughly ten seconds for the suit to cool down, which in the heat of battle can seem like an eternity. While that may sound frustrating and cheap, the game somehow finds just the right balance in its difficulty so that even when you're overheated, you can still escape from enemies by doing things like dodging continuously or throwing an EMP grenade to slow down the opposition. You're never completely defenseless. However, while boosting and using AR mode cause the suit's energy meter to gradually decrease, using melee attacks on enemies automatically drains it completely, which I feel is a bit much. It just doesn't feel right for such an advanced piece of hardware like the ARS to overheat so easily after a single melee attack. Sometimes a melee attack can be your only option when a really tough enemy has you cornered, and once you use it, you'll be vulnerable from attacks from other enemies who could be on you in seconds. It would have been better if melee attacks just drained the energy meter by one third instead of emptying it out straight away.Many kinds of deadly robots are thrown at you simultaneously: the standard red colored foot soldiers, the larger hulking Romanovs that can kill you quickly if you're not careful, armored tanks with saw blades attached to the front, giant robots that alternate between taking the form of armored spiders and bipedal juggernauts, and even the Russian version of the ARS with abilities that seem to surpass those of the one Sam wears. The tougher enemies previously mentioned make up the game's boss fights, and while they repeat themselves quite a bit, they still don't play out exactly the same way every time. Even the quick time events that play during these boss fights function differently between each battle. The QTEs all normally involve spinning the analog sticks or jamming on one of the face buttons until an on-screen meter is filled up before you run out of time; they really spice things up even further and impressively show off what the ARS can do, whether it's catching a missile and shoving it back into a robot's built-in cannon or treating the head of a giant robot like it's an oversized punching bag. When fighting all these enemies, players must do all they can to take advantage of using cover to protect themselves from enemy attacks, but staying put for too long is inadvisable since most forms of cover will eventually be destroyed after repeated hits from enemy fire. Either that or certain enemy attacks will be able to get around the players' cover and damage them anyway.Unlike in other third person shooters that require frequent use of cover in order to survive, being too defensive in Vanquish will get you killed more often than not. Finding the correct balance between offense and defense is the way to ensure your survival. Take advantage of the boosting and AR mode to use hit and run attacks on enemies, but keep an eye on the energy meter. Additional weapons are normally rather plentiful, but lots of times you're required to hunt for them in the middle of heated battles. It's all about risk and reward with this game. Even though Sam is accompanied by Burns and his Marines through 90% of the battles he fights, they're really not too helpful with regards to taking out enemies. For every 100 enemies that get killed, Sam will be the one who takes out the first 90, while Burns and his men might take out the other 10. Still, they do prove to be decent distractions for the enemies and will draw their fire away from you at times, giving you some much needed breathing room for a few seconds. At times Marines will be injured in battle and you can heal them with a special injection, and doing so is actually worth your time since the Marines will normally drop additional weapons for you to pick up after you heal them.Aside from the previously mentioned shortcomings involving the ARS's melee abilities, this game does have a couple of other minor flaws that I was able to mostly overlook, although other players probably won't be able to. At times, Sam seems to die a little too easily, especially for a guy wearing highly advanced power armor. Some enemies can actually kill him with a single powerful attack. Fortunately, many of these attacks can be predicted ahead of time if you watch the enemies' movements and if you're quick on your feet. Being able to only carry three weapons at a time may seem like another limiting factor, but even if you find yourself fighting enemies and you're not carrying a desired weapon, chances are it will be lying around somewhere in the battlefield inside a crate or something. It's just a matter of using the ARS's abilities to get around quickly, find the weapon, and attack. I found the limited carrying capacity of different weapons to make things more exciting and it added a nice strategic element to the game. Apparently, dying too much and restarting from the previous checkpoint slightly decreases the upgrades on your weapons, but this can be easily remedied by restarting from the beginning of the mission. Don't worry, most of the missions are quite brief and don't require too much backtracking.The game is also quite short, around 5 hours long. Normally, I would think that was too short, but since almost every minute of this game is made up of fast paced, non-stop action, it ends up feeling longer than it really is. Plus, if it were any longer, then the gameplay might have ended up getting too repetitive. Many players already find this game to be quite repetitive, but I didn't since the action is very addicting and you have the freedom to try many different strategies when getting past enemy forces. Plus, you have special (and very difficult) challenge missions that you unlock as you progress through the main game to increase your playtime. Even the rather plain and predictable story didn't annoy me much, and luckily there are actually a couple of surprises thrown at you towards the end of the game. The focus was clearly on the incredible gameplay, spot on controls, and beautiful graphics...and it really shows. Those who are still curious about Vanquish but may be less tolerant of its flaws or aren't sure if the game's unrelenting, fast paced action will be too much for them should probably rent it first or try playing the demo, which really captures the overall feel of the game. Fans of third person shooters and action games should buy this game straight away, especially at its current price. I'm hoping there will be a sequel, but not just because the game's ending requires one. If a sequel to Vanquish is released that makes improvements on the melee attacks and provides a slightly better story, it will be a day one purchase for me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

When you play this, expect a single player experience rivalled only by a handful of other games.The graphics are stupendous. Very few games have a level of immersion like this one. You'll play it and you will feel like you're deep under the ocean, exploring the city of Rapture.The surround sound is top of the line. You'll be able to pinpoint the locations of anything that makes any kind of noise in this game easily. This is one to play with the volume all the way up. Oh yeah, hopefully your subwoofer can handle the thudding footsteps of the Big Daddies.The controls are just right and are never frustrating. Little to say other than that.The game itself is really in a class of its own. I love the mood that this game instills. It's tense to a point where I can safely say that this is one of the only games I've played where you dread turning the corner ahead of you. The intro to this game alone is simply jaw dropping and grabs you and doesn't let go from the outset. There are moments in this game that are literally terrifying. I'm not going to go on record as saying this is the scariest game I've ever played but it truly is an experience in fear and anxiety.This is an instant classic and while there's no multiplayer, keep in mind that not every first person shooter was meant to be a fragfest. This one is about putting you in the middle of a terrifying scenario and making sure you believe you're actually there for every second that you're playing. Sure you can nitpick little things here and there but there's nothing in this game that comes even close to ruining the sheer perfection that is Bioshock.I can't recommend this title enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2007"}

What it does well is exceedingly impressive but faulty features or those that dont live up to potential do enough damage to affect the overall perception and complete value of the product.(UPDATE) With the lockout ended and the season underway roster updates have arrived to help alleviate some of the problems it caused to the product. First round rookies are in but second rounders still no where to be found and NBA Today is working though seems to lag behind by a day. Patches have also helped to improve some areas of the game though nothing drastically.POSITIVES-NBA's GREATESTThis is where primary resources for NBA 2K12 were spent and it pays off with an enriching experience even if it may not have longevity beyond the first play-throughs. The authentic touches given to the 15 match-ups in terms of presentation, commentary, the nature of the audio, and rule implementation is fantastic. It's just unfortunate that those special elements can't be applied to games elsewhere and are instead limited to the mode itself.-ROSTER OF HISTORIC TEAMSNBA 2K12 features 36 historic teams - some carrying over from last year (but thankfully with more of the real players included) and several new ones being introduced. Actually the 36 is double the 18 of 2K11 so that is significant advancement. It's a great mix of popular squads and time periods with most complaints coming from the absence of Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller (and with that no classic Pacers teams).For those bored or fed up with the current state of the NBA the teams are all compelling in their own ways or based on individual history as a fan. For myself it's fun to re-live the days of Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton but really all the teams of the late 80's and 90's for nostalgic reasons. They have to be unlocked by completing the NBA's Greatest mode however - and the Kings and Warriors are limited to the early run of copies via insert code.-GAMEPLAYNBA 2K12 builds off what 2K11 did very well - though it doesn't feel all that much different overall and instead has improved incrementally in a number of areas. Gameplay has been the central focus of the NBA 2K series and it still excels there. The new post-up mechanic is the biggest enhancement this year. The number of options available in the post are now numerous and work well which helps better balance out offensive effectiveness from the outside-in. I also really like the ability to contest shots or passes well with the right stick. The overall flow is quite good and fast breaks are also more effective after years of struggles in that area. There's a rich satisfying feeling for winning or even down to executing a single play successfully.Despite all that there are some bothersome elements such as the CPU shooting (and making) an abnormal amount of threes with far too many players capable of making them consistently, the abundance of deflected passes and inability to \"thread the needle\" or pass to a cutter in the paint, the lack of ability to choose to bounce pass, defensive rotations are sometimes questionable, and for some reason players can't outstretch their arms when defending inbounds passes. It was also an odd design decision to paint gaudy giant colored circles on the court for zone defenses - though this can be turned off with \"Who to Guard\" in the controller settings.-PRESENTATION/ATMOSPHEREThe broadcast style presentation is enhanced this year - with new camera angles, intros, and quarter-breaks. \"Playoff crowds\" finally make an appearance and greatly improve the atmosphere. The crowd doesn't always react properly to events but are much improved otherwise. NBA 2K continues its excellence in commentary with Steve Kerr as an additional analyst. It's very impressive how the commentary flows - even if something happens on the court that needs to be addressed immediately the guys will go back to and continue the story from the point they left off. The new pre-game intros are sharp as well.NEGATIVES-MY PLAYERWhat was supposed to be a huge improvement to the career mode is fatally hampered by incredibly bad trade logic. Rosters are constantly churning - often through trades that made no sense for the team or involve big name players that would never be moved. The gameplay experience is still lacking due to poor teammate AI, opponent 3PT attempts/percentages too high (no sliders in this mode), and difficulty in simply moving around as players are like magnets pulling the user into what become akin to brick walls. Despite having the NBA Draft with generated players they actually aren't added to the team rosters which creates issues of its own. There is also a freeze that halts progress if the user's team wins the Championship. My Player does do some things well - its attempts to implement more off-the-court elements are appreciated but they mean little when everything else isn't properly established first.-ONLINE PLAY/ONLINE ASSOCIATIONArguably the worst online experience in years and little progress has been made in the last week plus since release. Online play is plagued by overwhelming numbers of disconnects and heavy lag/poor responsiveness - while popular modes such as Crew were removed without any prior notification or even acknowledgement since. It's embarrassing that the promoted new website, which is to house important features consumers were anticipating, not only wasn't ready for release day but remains unlaunched. The biggest disappointment comes with Online Association - admirable in the goal of delivering an online component to the complete offline mode - but coming up short by not including all the necessary options and admin control.-NBA LOCKOUTThis is no fault of 2K Sports but the lockout does have an effect on the product's value. 2K was smart to increase the presence of legends and historic teams in a year when fans would potentially be turned off by today's NBA. They could have planned a bit better though by expanding NBA's Greatest presentation for use elsewhere, making it easy to edit historic teams and move players onto other rosters, and by allowing historic teams to be used online (without having to pay for it through upcoming DLC). The lack of rookies does sting even in a down year for talent and well-received features such as NBA Today are rendered irrelevant.SUMMARYNBA 2K12 is a game that one desperately wants to love but the severely troubled features make it difficult to do so. Coming off a year in which NBA 2K11 delivered just about the total package - 2K12 extends on a good thing with its historic team-related content and the relevance to the product but otherwise fails to come near re-creating the perfect storm of last year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

The gameplay concept, the visual style, the soundtrack, even the backstory are all conceived and executed with such a unique flavor that, when presented as a whole, it's difficult not to be drawn in by all the weird little idiosyncrasies. It's not a complex game, nor is it especially challenging, or long.Using the analog sticks exclusively, you'll roll the katamari around with tanklike controls. Pushing both sticks up moves the katamari forward, pushing both sticks down moves it backward, and pushing one stick up and one stick down will cause it to turn. There are a few other tricks, such as moving both sticks up and down really fast to gain a quick boost, or pushing in on both sticks to hop on the other side of the katamari and quickly change directions--but this is basically all you'll need to know in order to control it.

{"product_name":"B002V14VOC","reviewerName":"sft","summary":"Hard going underground","reviewText":"METRO 2033 is a flawed and glitchy game that is wholly redeemed by it&#8217;s great atmosphere. As a fan of survival horror I was hoping for something truly creepy, like the old Silent Hill games used to be, and it pretty much delivered on that front. Post-apocalyptic Moscow and its subway system are populated by some pretty nasty creatures (as well as groups of Nazi soldiers, which is perhaps a little incongruous) and I was properly startled on several occasions when these critters jumped out of nowhere. The game looks pretty good, if not outstanding, and the gameplay itself it pretty straightforward FPS fare. There are quite a few glitches though, such as lag when gun swapping, sticking points where there&#8217;s nothing to get stuck on, and enemies that behave oddly and seem to have ESP. These glitches can make the game frustrating at times. It&#8217;s also a pretty tough game, but that&#8217;s not a criticism. If you like survival horror, and can put up with the frustrations, this game is definitely worth a play through. 3.5/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date.

This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future.

{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Not all it could have been","reviewText":"As far as movie tie-in games go, this is one of the better ones. But standing on its own merits, \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" is a game with a great combat mechanic and decent graphics, but at the expense of nearly everything else.The plot of the game is loosely based on the movie. You'll spend half the game in flashback mode during the jungle missions, and the other half starts out following the basic premise of the movie but quickly takes a left turn and goes its own route. The ending is practically identical, though, leading to some awkward tie-ins, outright conflicts with the movie (without spoiling it, someone who was supposed to die doesn't, so they invent a whole new character to explain how the boss gets a certain ability) and the glossing over of some plot points completely. But, plot is very secondary in this game.It's all about the combat; it's brutal, constant and in-your-face. You will find tons of ways to slaughter, dismember and otherwise incapacitate your foes.The game has a bit of a level-up element to it. New moves unlock at arbitrary point, which is a bit annoying as there's no explanation as to how Logan magically learned to do the Claw Spin. This is also one of the game's big failings, as to max out your character (both in terms of leveling-up as well as unlocking achievements) you need to play the game about 1.5 times. For example, on achievement requires you to kill 2000 enemies, but there are only about 1300 in the whole game. Normally you would just import your existing character into the \"Hard\" setting you unlock when you beat the game, but doing so erases your save data and your progress toward the achievements. You also can only have one game going at a time. What this means is that you have to beat the game, replay about 2/3 of it checkpoint-by-checkpoint to unlock the achievements, then you can restart on hard (but you'll still lose all your progress, including the ability to replay levels that you already beat but haven't got to in the new game).I mentioned that the graphics look good, but even here you can find evidence of shortcuts taken and general lack of quality. Occasionally Logan will get stuck in a glitchy run-pattern in the jungle levels that force you to quit and reload your game. The designers had the excellent idea of showing Wolverine taking damage and healing in real-time, but when the camera movement forces Logan's body to go transparent, he is always shown in his default outfit at full health, but will go back to whatever state he was in when the view returns to normal. Later in the game, you will meet a shape-shifter, but all their shifts occur either off-frame or are blocked from view by objects between them and the camera: this reeks of lazy programming.The game is a fairly standard length for an action game - if you spend a couple hours a night on it you'll beat it in about 10-14 days. And it is somewhat fun at first, but by the end all the shortcuts really compromise a game that had some promise. Is it decent? Yes. Playable? Yes. Good? Eh.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

The Assassin's Creed games are have been among some of my absolute favorites in current gen gaming!  I have owned them all before...have played through II twice and Brotherhood & Revelations once.  I eventually went on to trade each individual game toward other game purchases, with the intent of later readding them to my collection later for the right price.  I'd never expected them to actually combine these 3 great games into one low priced set, and when they did, that's what I wanted for my collection!  I own Assassin's Creed III as well, so my collection of these titles, as far as I'm concerned, is now complete!  I don't own Assassin's Creed I, but it's honestly not all that big of a deal to me.  When I started playing these games, I had started with II.  I had never played I beforehand, and so then when I went back and tried out I, compared to II, I just couldn't really get into it.  I played most of the way into it and abandoned it.  So in my opinion II, Brotherhood, Revelations, and III is where it's at!  Looking forward to future Assassin's Creed titles as well!As I write this, I have not had a lot of time yet to delve back into these games, and I have a few other games to finish up playing first before I will.  I did read in another review that the bugs have been cleaned up pretty well in this set, so that's good.  I do seem to remember quite a few glitches, most especially in II, but they'd seemed to get better with Brotherhood and then with Revelations.  It wasn't enough to take away from the general enjoyment of the games, but it was kind of bothersome at times when things would glitch out here & there.  Glad to know that Ubisoft has fixed the majority of these issues and that they'll run a lot smoother the next times I play them.  And I fully intend to marathon them when I do too!One other thing I read is that each game will have to be installed before playing, though you still have to have the discs in order to play.  Sounds kinda stupid to me to do things that way, but whatever...I don't really care.  I have plenty of room on my hard drive.  Furthermore, I did also read that when you boot up the game, there's no select screen to chose which game you want to play first.  Supposedly only Revelations boots up at first, and then you have to exit out of that to get to II and Brotherhood.  Seems like kind of a hassle...they oughta just give you a selection screen as soon as it boots up.  Doing things this way, they may as well have given people each game on an individual disc.  Doesn't make much sense to me, but oh well...it's all just minor stuff compared to the grandness of these amazing games!I would have to say that character-wise, Ezio so far has been the coolest character in the Assassin's Creed games.  Connor in III was pretty cool, but there was just something about Ezio that I liked even better...he was just seemingly more sauve and I got into his character more than I did with Connor, although I did like Connor too and empathized with his plights.If you are an epic action adventure gamer and have maybe never tried any of these games or maybe only one or two of them, then I highly recommend doing so!  Epic games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2013"}

It's single greatest strength is the game play mechanics of the bionic arm. The arm serves as both a weapon and a means of swinging from place to place, which for me was allot of fun while being very challenging. Unlike games like Prince of Persia where you just hit a button at the right time to \"link\" your next acrobatic stunt, in Bionic Commando you have to time your swings and line up your next swing with much precision and grace. Personally I enjoyed the challenge of perfecting my \"swing\", because it is lots of fun and soaring through the air has a sort of innocent quality that I very much enjoyed. Though the negatives are a lack luster story, mediocre graphics (though the environments themselves are well put together, the textures are just nowhere near as sharp/clean as they should be), and somewhat boring combat. The combat plays like an arcade shooter from 1995, no cover system (similar to Gears of War or Drakes Fortune is sorely lacking) and a very very basic AI hinder this game from being memorable in light of far more advanced games available on the market. But hey, for less than $10 bucks its worth playing this game to experience the unique and distinct swing mechanics, that is if you have the patience to master it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2010"}

The size can be attributed to both the ear look, the mic boom, and the actual earpiece/receiver. The design as I interpret it is more function over form.The design of an over the ear loop and adjustable boom in my experience make this headset a bit more comfortable than traditional BT headsets, particularly those that don't have any type of over the ear support. This is particularly important during long gaming sessions. The boom is designed to adjust though within a very small tolerance. This is still important to anyone with a smaller or larger than average head. Additionally Gioteck includes a number of in-ear pieces so there options for comfort there as well.Personally I found the headset to be comfortable for about an two hours before my ear really started to ache and bother me.--------------------USE:In-game audio quality is a mixed bag. For certain this is a mono headset which is fine for communication with other players online, however, I found the audio quality sounded quite muffled. Especially compared to my PX-21 headset but even compared to my Plantronics BT headset that I primarily use with my smartphone.Friends that I played with online had no complaints about my voice, background noise, or static.--------------------CONCLUSION:This is a decent entry level headset. I'm hesitant to slam or praise this product as it does perform just not impressively so. If you can spare about ten more dollars I would recommend Sony's own PlayStation branded BT headset that in my opinion performs considerably better.Notes:There seems to be some confusion over what this headset will and won't let you hear. This is a headset for in-game communication with other players when playing online with your PS3. This headset cannot play back in-game audio or sound-effects.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
