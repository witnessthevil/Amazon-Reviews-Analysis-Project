{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Madden 13: A mixed bag of good and bad","reviewText":"It's late August and almost Labor Day weekend and it's the start of gaming season when Madden arrives. This will be the first one I have bought since the 2009 edition and the reason being is that supposedly so much was changed and `rebooted' to finally give the game a fresh coat of paint. The madden series this generation has been accused (and rightfully so) of year after of giving tiny changes and being nothing more than a $60 roster update but supposedly this is the year all of that changes and with the early release that you can get prior to the full game, has it really turned a corner?In my opinion, even after reading the `glowing reviews', I can attest that it has but only marginally so, as some of the complaints I have had in years past, EA finally started to fix.InterfaceThis by far is the biggest change in the game's iteration as once you hit start you immediately are greeted by the menus that you need to use for the game and for most players, it may take some getting around but it's clean and uncluttered and shows you everything that you need to get around the game. There are still a few hidden items that you have to dig for but once you get used to the interface, finding them is a snap.ControlsIn my opinion, if you have played one Madden game you have played them all and this is no different. If you are even a casual user, you can pick up the controls and go play and one thing that I like and dislike is the gameflow menu as you call plays in the game. This was something implemented a few years ago to `help' new users to the game and also make games go by quicker, which is fine but I wound up turning it off as I realized that on offense and defense, the AI seemed to call the same few kinds of play during the course of a game and if I wanted to be creative, I would have to call my own plays. The one plus to that however is if you still wanted to let the AI call some other types of plays you can shift the menus and call `aggressive' and `conservative' kinds of plays from the playbook or, you can turn it off altogether and use the standard that we have been used to. Other than that all the standard controls are there and I am sure that hardcore users will be right at home.Graphics / PresentationThis by itself was the biggest surprise of them all and also still shows how far EA STILL has to go to reach the NFL2K5 benchmark. The graphics in this game have obviously improved and the Infinity Engine has added some realism to the game when it comes to tackles and contact but I still see a few quirks that just don't make sense. RBs who don't `flow' around linemen and seem to get stuck as they try to hit a hole, players who tend to trip and fall in weird manners when plays are whistled dead and players who lay on the ground for long periods of time for no reason. The player faces themselves a looking a little better but it's almost clear to see that the graphics card put into the systems in 2005 can't really render them correctly but today's standards (yes we are in need of new hardware Microsoft and Sony!) and the crowd while looking a little more diverse still looks to be 2D cutouts in the stands. I do still not understand why EA can't seem to work the same kind of voodoo that the 2K series can work ...but I digress. As far as the stadium and lighting renderings, for the first time in a long time, EA finally is on the right track and getting the lighting system right; an early afternoon game and a late afternoon game lighting wise are 2 different creatures. They still need to work on getting a 7pm game (which would probably end around 10pm) to get progressively darker. Yes, it's a nitpick but if you are going for realism let's pull that out. The crowd noise has improved as now it doesn't sound like white noise as much as it has in the past. But as far as the positives, the commentary from Jim Nantz and Phil Simms is superb. Finally EA is learning how to dynamically broadcast by ripping a page from 2K5's book! The whole presentation itself feels more like a TV broadcast than a game and it's something that has been missing for years and it takes a while for it to get repetitive but Simms and Nantz feel like they are both in the booth calling the game as opposed to just 2 voices phoning it in. It's cool to hear when they call out Papa John's pizza as the sponsor, that Gatorade display that pops up giving stats and so on...but it still something missing. It's still kind of weird to hear that they are going to a post game show and....there is no post game show. EA, after all of these years, even with the ESPN license, why can't you still during a franchise game post scores during the game or for Pete's sake in halftime? It may seem like a small issue for some but I have always believed that knowing the scores especially my division rivals always added a little extra sense of urgency or gloating to the present game I was playing and without this I have always felt that instead of playing a connected league / season, I was playing in a bubble without any way of knowing what was going on until the end of the game. Even FIFA has the common enough courtesy to update you about other games in your leagues even if the feature is a bit tacked on. It's not difficult to do and even the earliest Madden games had that feature so why this can't be implemented is beyond me and has been a nitpick of this series since it's been on this generation's systems.Game face and Connected CareersNew to this year's Madden is the game face utility which lets you take a picture of yourself and put it in the game. It's been used sporadically in years past in NBA Live and most recently in the FIFA series. EA still has a lot of work to put into this feature because unless you are just pale, you have your work cut out for you to get your game face anywhere near close as you want it. It took me nearly 3 hours and some Photoshop help (I am a black guy after all!...heheh) before I finally got a rendition of me that wasn't ghostly pale, blue or green and in some cases too orange. Weird thing is, on the website itself, you can get a perfect rendering of yourself but somewhere between that rendering and the game download your skin color changes thus if you have patience to do this it may take a while to get it right and off you go.The Connected Careers mode is cool so far not a  huge leap that it's touted to be but it can keep you busy for far longer than you expected. You can either create a player or coach (with or without your game face), use an active player or coach, or use a legend and put them in the game. This biggest difference in playing as a player and a coach are these:- Playing as player is very similar to Superstar mode is that you have control over what team you start with and you have to work your way up the roster as you cannot come in as a superstar yet. Also you only play when you have plays designed to utilize you. In order to build your player up you have to earn XP from practices and mini games. You can skip some of these and still get XP but not as much as you would get if you participated.- Playing as a coach gives you total control over the team and you play it like a regular franchise mode but also in order to improve your team you have to do things between weeks (cut your roster, go to practice etc.) to earn points and build up players. These too can be skipped and like I just mentioned you get fewer XPs by skipping.- You can take a created player only in the player mode; you cannot create a player and bring him into the Coach mode.- You can start a career online with a few buddies and play as long as you want and even bring it offline (I haven't tested it but will update once I do)I also liked the virtual network mode where you have a twitter feed letting you know what happening around the league and I have noted to that when you are doing some things like negotiating contracts and so forth, players will chime in when they are happy or not happy about their situation, so now it's important to keep your team happy and also the experts and they will give praise and criticism for things that you do during your career. It still doesn't quite feel as `newsy' as it could be unlike NCAA Football but its there and the potential is there.Speaking of Twitter and Facebook, you can post results to your actual feed after each game if you desire.So after 3 or so years, it looks like EA is trying to turn the corner to make this one of the better football games they have put out in years. There are still many technical hurdles that I am still surprised that NFL 2K5 has set the bar high for that EA hasn't jumped and still stumped as to why. The presentation has gotten better but still missing a few things, the game play still feels about the same to me as I am not a hardcore player and I know that other reviews can give more details to the technical aspects of the game but overall, this Madden and the direction that EA is trying to take this series in, feels like after so long, it's worth a buy and not just a roster update.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

I've played every Mario Kart game since the Super Nintendo version, and I must say that this is most definitely, in every single way, the best of them all. Here is my review.Graphics: 9/10. Smooth framerate ( somewhat choppy in WiFi mode ) in single player, great animations, nice looking tracks... this is a really good looking game, but they are not as good as they could have been. The graphics could have been cleaned up, and the game is somewhat glitchy. If you \"snake\" around a corner and almost hit the wall, you can see through it. It's nothing bad, just something to take note about.Sound: 9/10. Everything Mario. The karts sound good, the voices for the most part sound really nice ( except for DK and Bowser; it seems like some really bad impersonator tried to do their voices. ). The music is also really good... then again, what in this game isn't?Control: 8.5/10. It takes time to master \"snaking\", but once you get the hang of it, you will be king of the track every single game. The controls are very simple if you don't include using the \"snake\" button; all you have to do is drive... that's really it.Fun: 9.5/10. 8 player local, 4 player WiFi, 4 unlockable characters, 16 new tracks along with 16 classics, 36 selectable karts... this game has got it all. A downfall for this game though is definitely the blue shells. I constantly will find myself on the third lap about to cross the finish line, get hit by one, and get into second or third. It doesn't matter though; THIS IS THE BEST DS GAME OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. Hell, the only REAL problem for this game is that you will probably wish your DS's battery life was a lot longer.9.6/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2005"}

In fact, I would go so far as to say that some games ease the violent tendencys and allow the player to reinact their more brutal fantasys. This game kept me from violently \"reacting\" to several pleople. It was theraputic, in a sense, to brutally murder these sprites.But the game itself, aw, man.... Graphics were great for a 2003 game on PS2. I'm sure the Xbox version looks better, but it looks excellent on PS2. The enemies are somewhat repedative, but the gameplay is tense and exciting. There are also little extras, like the sweat stains that appear on the main chracter's pits if he runs too long and the bloody nose if you get pounded in the face too much.The dialog is excellent. It motivates you to either get away or retaliate. Sneaking in the dark is hard when these guys are calling you a coward.The weapons are SATIFYING. The sicle in particular is my favorite. I like giving the enemies a surprise enema Bob Barker Style. The guns are a little tacked on, but the meele weapons feel right.THe stealth mechanic, however imperfect, is awesome. ANy little noise generates a field around you that alerts enemies. You run too fast, the enemies around you will know. You hit a truck, the enemies will come running. YOu kill thier frien while they aren't looking and they turn around. They also come up on thier dead friends and kick them saying, \"Poor guy, didn't see it coming.\" I mean, EXCELLENT! The AI is not so terrible in the game. Sure, it's not rocket scientists, but it is fine for PS2.It is imperfect, but this games wasted about three years of my life.

{"product_name":"B000NPOGWK","description":"When Final Fantasy II was released in 1989, it was seen as a triumph in gaming. One of the first games to be appeciated for both its incredible graphics and immersive gameplay, Final Fantasy II was a fully-developed game world, one that surpassed even the amazing Final Fantasy I. Now this remastered new version comes to your PSP, with updated graphics and new content.","reviewerName":"Marcos \"proletariat\"","summary":"A classic reborn on the PSP leaves you pining for an updated version!","reviewText":"It needn't be said, FFII is a classic that laid the groundwork, as did the other early Final Fantasies and the early Dragon Quests (i.e. Dragon Warrior) for almost all RPG's to follow. It is fun to revisit whether playing on your original SNES console or on the PSP or Gameboy Advance.What I will say, however, is it leaves you pining for an updated version of the game. Why is it that Square Enix only updated FF IV, and only on the DS for that matter?? I guess it all comes down to money, but ALL of these epic games deserve a 3D overhaul - I absolutely LOVED playing the updated version of IV on the DS- it was amazing.I originally bought a used copy of Final Fantasy I & II (Dawn of Souls, I think) remake for the Gameboy Advance and played it via the GBA slot on my DS lite (on a side note, I'm glad I kept my DS lite after I got a DSi and eventually the 3DS so I could still utilize the GBA slot).Playing the remake on the PSP is essentially the same... I enjoy it slightly more on the PSP as it does have a wider screen and a few extras, but, again, I so wish Square Enix would release more updated versions of these epic classics for both the DS and the PSP.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00EN1IF7C","description":"","reviewerName":"Colin Brown \"Colin Brown Microsoft MVP\"","summary":"A rushed buggy product for launch and many issues.  Do not buy the Limited Edition.","reviewText":"Forza 5 was probably Microsoft's Premier launch title.  I've owned and played all the Forza series up to this one and was honestly looking forward to it.  Did it live up to the expectations and hype?The answer to that unfortunately is a resounding no.First the good.  The graphics on Forza 5 are stunning to say the least.  The tracks, reflections, cars and attention to detail are very well done (however some do get annoying).  Sound wise, there isn't very much to the game apart from obviously the engines.When playing the game, Turn 10 have decided to make a lot of the races in the early morning which means there is a low sun angle.  Now whilst this may look very pretty it very quickly gets on your nerves. For example, you are racing against the clock on Road Atlanta doing a cone slalom race on the short track.  You have to weave your way through a bunch of cones and get over the finishing line in a prescribed time to earn gold, silver or bronze.  Every cone gate you miss adds 5 seconds to your time.  So you are coming up over the rise on the short circuit and turning into the sun which effectively whites out the road.  You get so much sun glare that you can't even see the cones that you are trying to drive through so you miss 3 or 4 gates and have to do the lap again, this time remembering that there are gates that you basically can't see.Now whilst this may look visually great and &#34;realistic&#34; for that time of day, in reality it is just annoying.  I noticed Turn 10 starting this trend in Forza 4 and they have taken it to the next level in Forza 5.  It really adds nothing to the racing and is just there to make the game look prettier.At the end of each race you have to sit through a 30 second or so animation of your car coming to a stop from 3 different angles, I guess to show off the damage done to the front of your car.  This is nice the first few times you see it but again it quickly becomes annoying as you can't skip it, especially when you have seen it 100+ times.Split screen 2 player mode is very buggy with texture tearing and in a lot of races the sky textures completely disappear to be replaced with just black, almost as if you are racing in the dark. But this only happens on the bottom of the split screen, not the top one. Another bug when you are playing 2 players is when your friend picks up the controller and connects (for some weird reason the game insists you sign into the Xbox itself as a guest), then it says the initial controller has been disconnected. You reconnect the initial controller and now that controller is no longer the primary one and you have to swap controllers with your friend.  I'm not sure however if this is an Xbox issue with the Kinect trying to be too clever for itself or whether it's Turn 10's fault, but again it is annoying.For the most part, driving the cars seems fairly similar to Forza 4, although I'm certainly not convinced that these are modeled after real world car handling.  Driving a Ferrari 458 at just over 30 miles per hour into a turn and the back end starts sliding away. No way, my SUV won't do that and it's not a supercar.  If the handling of a real world 458 was that bad Ferrari wouldn't be able to sell any (I've actually driven a real 458 around a local track here and I can tell you it does not handle in that manner, it is a superb car to drive).I bought the Limited Edition game for the extra cars, the 1250 credits (which should have bought you any car in the game but doesn't even come close) and the VIP membership.  Like others here, I have not received my day 1 cars, my Limited Edition cars etc.  This is something Turn 10 needs to fix ASAP.  Why spend the extra money for no benefit?Track wise, there are two excellent new tracks, Abu Dhabi formula 1 race track and Prague.  These are simply superb and if you ever get the Lotus Formula 1 car that is available in the game, excellent to drive around but overall there just simply aren't that many tracks (maybe about a dozen) and some of the tracks don't even have alternative routes.  It feels like there are around 1/2 the number of tracks that Forza 4 launched with.  Rather than try and make more money with micro transactions and car packs Turn 10 should release more track packs as you quickly get bored with racing the same 10-12 tracks and configurations again and again and again.The game overall just feels rushed and buggy, like Turn 10 weren't quite ready to release it but were under pressure due to the hard deadline of the console launch.  Hopefully they will release patches soon to fix quite a lot of the problems that appear in the game.Overall it's a fairly fun game to play even though IMO the game is not finished.  It's not as good as previous Forza games and Turn 10 should stick to what they are good at, car handing, tracks etc. and stop with the silly visual effects like reflections and racing into the sun.Given the amount of problems with the game at this point however I honestly couldn't really recommend it unless you are hardened racing or Forza fan.  A disappointment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2013"}

I did, which will be obvious by the smaller power supply, also at the time they were posting lot numbers, which help. I have had no heating problems what so ever. I bought a cooling stand anyway from Intec which has nice green lights and two big fans...but I hardly even use it. The system is as stable as a rock!  I have played it for hours on end.I will say that people need to be aware that, like any computer...DO NOT BLOCK THE AIR INTAKES! I don't mean to shout, but to call attention to this. Yes, it is a gaming console, but it is also a computer. I would not suggest putting it on the rug, or wedged between two other objects....make sure the air intake has at least 6 inches all the way around. I think that once you are aware of this, you will never have overheating problems.The console itself in nicely designed, although I think the base might have been made broader to avoid tipping. I would have preffered the black elite, especially since I have since upgraded the drive to a 120GB anyway, but at the time it was hard to find the new heatsink and chip the Elite as well...so I bought the Pro with the 20GB drive (Its just not enough if you want to get the most out of the online experience...you really end up with like 13.7 usuable space with all the stuff they pre-loaded)Xbox Live-I do not mind paying a subscription to get exclusive game add-ons (Sometimes for free) and Free Demo's of new games.

I like to play it in my office after work hours or on the weekend..the Wii just is not portable...plus the Wii is not a graphic powerhouse at all.

Only reason: Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  That game was simply amazing.  Great campaign, amazing multiplayer....there was hardly anything wrong with this game.  So it would make sense to get excited for its sequel, because they can only go up from there, right?WRONG!  I don't know how they managed to do it, but they went backwards.For one, the campaign was short and made little to no sense.  It took me four hours to beat it on Normal when the prequel took me eight.  You would think the game would become more challenging and a more memorable experience, but this isn't the case with Modern Warfare 2.  It's almost like they only put the campaign to fill up the extra space on the disc, or do what Unreal Tournament 3 did and only have it there to prepare you for the online.  The story, like I said before, made no sense.  At one point, you're undercover with a Russian terrorist group, then you're trying to hunt them down, THEN you're with another task force doing the same, THEN you're fighting off a Russian invasion, and now you're trying to kill a U.S. General.  Why?  According to Infinity Ward, \"We don't know, and we don't care.  Just get to the multiplayer\".  Be honest, that's why most of the fans bought the game, anyway.  I'm sure they didn't ruin that portion of the game.Unfortunately, coming from a hardcore CoD4 fan, they ruined the online play.  Whatever the first got right, the sequel took it and made it wrong.For one, the weapons in this game are completely unbalanced.  For example, the FAMAS can kill with the same power as the M16, but with no recoil.  Shotguns had such ridiculous range, some players would say \"He just sniped me with a shotgun\".  On top of being able to duel-wield some shotguns, not only could you hit someone from far away, but keep hitting them until they died.  On top of that, you can do too much in this game.  For example, in CoD4, if you had a grenade launcher, you weren't allowed to have a first perk, nor could you have two attachments on one gun.  In MW2, not only can you have a grenade launcher and a first perk, but it can be easily abused.  So let's say you have a FAMAS with the grenade launcher, and you're choosing a first perk.  Well now you can have Scavenger, kill someone with the launcher, pick up another round for it.  Kill, pick up another round.  Kill, pick another round up, repeat until the game ends.  That's only one example of how something that was balanced became broken.But the worst thing about the online is (maybe was) the hackers.  Do I really have to explain why hackers ruin online gameplay?  Should I go into detail how people would hack to become 10th prestiges and have everything unlocked?  Or how about looking at the wonderful leaderboards at those holding the number 1 spot with over 60,000.....yes, 60,000 days of gametime clocked in?  For those that don't realize, that's an average of 164 years.....so why would anyone believe you played a game for 164 years straight, while also remembering the game isn't even two years old?There have been recent patches to fix the hackers, but because of them not going to fix the other problems with how imbalanced the online is, and it's pitiful campaign, I can't give this game another star.  It's impossible, especially after playing something that was god-like compared to this.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005MO5G","description":"Although the game will seem very familiar to Sonic fans,Sonic  Advanceis an entirely new creation that's been built from the ground up.  The gameplay, graphics, and sound borrow from the classic Sonic games on the  Genesis and are successfully translated to the Game Boy Advance. The game's  single-player modes are relatively short 2-D platform rounds--each run takes two  to three hours--but replay value is added through the game's various characters.  Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy each have different abilities that make getting  through the game a unique experience.The real star here is the game's link capabilities. The Chao Garden allows you  to raise your little critters and upload them to the GameCube via thelink cableandSonic Adventure 2:  Battle. Having one cartridge lets up to four GBA players compete in one  minigame. Gamers can play two additional minigames if each player owns a  cartridge. Although the single-player game is quite good, the link options give  the title tremendous value.The only notable problem stems from the series itself: There are still entirely  too many cheap deaths resulting from the title's high-speed gameplay. You'll  find yourself zipping along a level only to be hit by an obstacle you had little  chance of seeing, let alone avoiding. Ultimately, the only way to get past these  hazards is to memorize where they are.

{"product_name":"B001TOMQSK","description":"Sega Aliens vs. Predator 69038 PC Games","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Three different characters offer unique gameplay, but it's short","reviewText":"This game is half annoying and half incredibly fun. You can play as a Space Marine, an Alien, and the ever popular Predator, so this game is certainly not short on offering a varied gameplay experience. Even though this game is a first-person shooter, which I'm not very used to, it doesn't really play like a traditional FPS, especially when you play as the Predator or Alien. Each of the three characters has their own story campaign, with four to six missions for each of them; it's not a lot, but fortunately the game is challenging enough to keep most players busy for several play sessions. Even though all three characters visit the same locations, the maps are different enough from each other that they don't get too repetitive, plus the characters travel through the locations in different directions. Playing as the Marine is interesting; you feel incredibly vulnerable and your anxiety level is sure to be pretty high when you're going down the many corridors and caverns in the game waiting for the next Alien to jump out of the darkness and try to rip you to shreds. Still, after you've encountered your first group of Aliens, the surprise factor goes down a lot since you'll pretty much know what to expect after that... Aliens, Aliens, and more Aliens. However, the Aliens offer enough of a challenge to keep you on your toes, especially when they attack in large groups. While you're shooting at one or two Aliens in front of you, several more could be chewing on your butt from behind, and they move much faster than you, so running away won't always work if you want to get some distance between you and them. Fortunately, the Marine can knock Aliens back with his melee attack by hitting them with the butt of his gun and shoot them afterwards, but killing an Alien up close almost always spells certain death, since they spurt out nasty molecular acid when they die.One thing that I found annoying about the Marine levels is the fact that the Marine himself appears to suffer from cataracts. It's ALWAYS dark, no matter where he goes. Even the same levels that appear well lit and easy to traverse as the Predator and Alien are for some reason very dark and gloomy for the Marine. The only time you can actually see is when you're outside, but the Marine is almost always indoors. The Marine has a flashlight and an infinite amount of flares that he can illuminate dark areas with, but it's like using a match to light up a darkened movie theater: it's still dark and you won't be able to see much (and the flares don't illuminate for very long either). The darkness also makes it hard to see the targeting reticule, so that's a big design flaw right there. Besides the useless pistol that never runs out of ammo, the Marine can arm himself with two other weapons at a time. He can choose from a shotgun, a flamethrower, a pulse rifle with grenade launcher attachment, and a sniper rifle. I find the sniper rifle particularly useful since it's x-ray scope can pick up enemies hiding behind crates, enemies in the dark, and even cloaked enemies. At times he can also use a smart gun/minigun that can track targets within range and kill them quickly, unfortunately the Marine can only carry this weapon by itself; he has to drop both of his previous weapons to carry the smart gun. Also, like in the Alien movies, the Marine has a sonar/radar device that can pick up targets as they approach with an audible beep (taken right out of the movie), no matter what direction, but it won't always save you from getting surprised by enemies as they pop out at you. And for health reasons, the Marine can carry up to three health items, and his health can partially regenerate.Next is the Predator. I love the Predator. When you play as the galaxy's deadliest hunter, you have access to its one of a kind weaponry. In the beginning you carry the plasma caster, stealth camouflage, thermal vision, and two sets of retractable claws for melee combat. Like the Marine, the Predator can also carry up to three health items. Eventually, the Predator will gain access to other advanced weaponry: a bladed throwing disc that can deflect off surfaces and slice up enemies, mines, and a throwing spear that can kill enemies in one hit. Then it will get access to Alien vision, which can spot Aliens and their spawning holes even in pure darkness. In order to keep things more balanced, the Predator has limited energy so it can't continually use the one hit kill plasma caster; initially you can only fire two or three shots before running out of energy (but the energy meter goes up as you progress through the game). Fortunately, the Predator can recharge its energy by draining generators of their power. The best thing about the Predator is its superior physical abilities. It can go toe to toe with many Aliens with its retractable claws, utilizing light and very slow heavy attacks, and its armor protects it from the annoying acid the Aliens spurt out when they die. Most impressive is the Predator's jumping ability; by focusing on nearby cliff walls and tree tops and highlighting the spot you want to jump to, the Predator can jump up to 20 feet in the air precisely to the highlighted spot, which comes in handy when you want to escape from a large group of enemies. Despite the Predator's greater power, it's usually better to play it sneaky when facing the Marines, since their weapons can make short work of the Predator if it gets outnumbered. A cool and VERY gruesome thing the Predator can do is sneak up on or knock down human enemies to perform trophy/stealth kills, which usually involves the Pred tearing off its victim's head and spinal column, sometimes stroking it and making its trademark clicking noise after the kill. It can also perform trophy kills on Aliens after knocking them down.Finally, there's the Alien. Playing as this creature was more interesting than I expected and ends up being the most unique \"character\" to play as. It can climb up walls and ceilings, crawl through air vents, and hide almost in plain sight when in dark corners (you can kind of tell when you're hidden when the targeting reticule changes appearance). The downside to climbing up on walls and roofs is the fact that the view changes when you're upside down and so on, so it can be very disorienting, especially in more compact indoor areas. Unlike the other two characters, the Alien doesn't use any weapons other than its claws for light and heavy attacks, and it can also use its stabbing tail for heavy attacks from a distance. Like the Predator, the Alien can also perform its own stealth kills after sneaking up on or knocking down its enemies. When it sneaks up on unarmed humans, it attaches a facehugger to the human's...face. The Alien's health regenerates over time after it takes damage and it can feed on dead humans to regain its full health in a flash. Plus, the Alien is supremely fast. It can run four times faster than either the Marine or Predator, but this can also work against you; it's easy to run right past an enemy you intended to attack, giving your enemy the chance to shoot you in the back.Let me close with a quick mention of the game's story, graphics, and sound. The story is average, but it's interesting to see how the three different storylines connect to each other. The character and environmental graphics are quite good, the Predators and Aliens look awesome. The human characters however, could have looked a bit more polished. The sound effects are right out of the Alien and Predator movies, from the guttural roars of the Predator, shrieks of the Aliens, and the sounds of the Marine's pulse rifle when firing, as well as the previously mentioned sonar when picking up approaching enemies. All very nice touches. Still, the gameplay is short and doesn't really have a lot of replay value; it should have had more boss fights, especially against Alien Queens and more Predators. I rented this game, which is what I recommend most players do instead of buying it, especially FPS gamers who have better games to choose from. However, I will buy it soon, since the gameplay is fun and challenging. Even though it's short, the deciding factor for me to buy it ended up being the fact I could play as a Predator, plus the game is no longer a whopping $60.00. I'm not a huge fan of FPS games, but since this game doesn't always play like a traditional FPS, it's a good middle ground for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2011"}

This Japanese game design style of punishing players for not perfecting controls and experimenting with various approaches by having players repeat things nonsensically over and over again is quite painful. This is the reason why Western game designers are making much more money hand over fist in their games. In fact, this grueling methodology very much takes away from the experience of what otherwise could be considered a masterpiece.

{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek G","summary":"Beautiful, linear, and much too short","reviewText":"Edit:  Since the Version 2 patch in 2014, I can now recommend this game.  The story is still short and linear but the loot has been improved tremendously.  The weapons are better (I have Legendary items from pre v2.0 that have worse stats than the rares I get now) and the armor and weapons you get are more tuned for your character. In the past I kept getting items for other characters all the time.  Now that's a rarity.  One other major improvement is I no longer have the jerky, stuttering movement that I had in the past.  I'm guessing it's because Blizzard moved all the calculations to my computer instead of the servers.  Diablo 3 never needed to be an online game, that was just the excuse Blizzard used to promote the garbage Auction House that is now gone for good.  We still have multiplayer, though, so bring your friends.  Also, you can now choose what difficulty you want upfront.  No more being forced to play easy mode.---Original Review:The hype was strong and I almost bought this on day one because I love hack-n-slash RPG's.  No sense bringing up the mess that was Blizzard's attempt at forcing us to play a *single-player game* over an always-online connection.  Even now (patch 1.05 as of the time of this review) I experienced stuttering movement and other latency issues.  Plus, there's nothing like starting up a solo game and finding out you can't play because the remote servers are down (yes, it still happens.)  It's so annoying that I will never pay full price for any \"always on\" requirement and I hope others will do the same.As far as D3 the game is concerned, there are three things I think Blizzard has done better than the competition.  First, the art style is incredibly well done with unique, detailed environments.  Secondly, the level design is excellent.  So many times I tried to game the system by making my way down paths I believed would take me directly to a dungeon exit.  Instead, I found myself consistently fooled into clearing out the entire level before I was able to progress in the story.  Finally, unlike nearly every RPG to date, your companions are both intelligent and useful.  You actually want them around when the battles get difficult.Unfortunately, these positives can't save the fact that the game is very short.  My character completed the story in 25 hours and I like exploring areas searching for hidden treasures and secret dungeons.  If you played the game straight through and avoided the side quests, you could probably complete it in under 20 hours.  In addition, I was only able to make it to level 32 before the game was finished.  Since the level cap is 60, I'll need to play through the story a second time just to unlock all of my available skills.  Speaking of which, you have no choice what difficulty level to play.  The game forces you to play \"normal\" difficulty (which is actually quite easy) before you can play the next highest difficulty level.  The quests are remarkably standard and while crafting was available, we were locked out of using items we crafted unless we hit an arbitrary level.  Starting to get the picture?  Instead of being given the freedom to go where you want and do what you want, Diablo 3 holds your hand and tells you what you can and cannot do.  It's so linear that it's like playing the single-player campaign of a FPS except in third-person view.Fortunately, I purchased this game at a major discount but I would have been upset like many of the other reviewers if I paid full price.  Since you're only getting half a game, I would recommend purchasing this at half price and that's only if you're a big fan of the genre.  Just don't forget you'll have to go through the hassle of signing up for an online account as if you were playing a MMO.  If you're not a fan of the genre, avoid this game altogether.  Blizzard is asking too much and providing too little.  A much more enjoyable, and less expensive alternative is Torchlight II.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2012"}

You've got an awesome main character, story, great combat and sweet gadgets. You've got trophies, riddles, challenges and DLC to keep the fun going. The game isn't diluted with multiplayer and the main campaign is almost the right length. What more could you ask for?You're Batman:You play as Batman, does it get any cooler than this? The gadgets are fun, way cooler than what you typically see in other adventure games. As you earn experience from defeating baddies you can use that xp to purchase upgrades for gadgets and combat moves. This is great because you can choose the upgrades that suit your needs as the game progresses. Extra damage resistance, more batarangs, special combat moves - its your choice.Combat:This is probably one of the best combat systems I've played with. Let me start by saying each fight, each time you go against an enemy, each punch and kick looks choreographed. Its that awesome. What I really love about the combat system is you can choose how much time you want to spend learning it. If you don't really want to learn it right now you can just button mash and get through the game, might get difficult especially towards the end but that's your choice. If you want to put in the effort to learn the timing of combos you are rewarded with critical hits and bonus xp meaning easier fights and earlier upgrades. I chose to not learn how to do the combos effectively and just button mashed. After beating the game, however, I started working on the combat challenges and those forced me to get better at the combos. I enjoyed the combat portions exponentially after that. No joke. I recommend taking the time to learn the combos, its worth it gameplay wise and fun level wise.Combat can be as simple as just pushing square for punch. But there is also Counter, Dodge, Cape Stun, Throw, Instant Takedown, Batarang, Batclaw, and Ground Takedown. Do all 9 and you earn a trophy and a nice variation bonus. Check YouTube for some great videos showing how intense the combos can get.Challenges:As you progress through the game you unlock challenges which let you replay parts of the game to get the highest score (leader boards). There are only two types of challenges - predator and combat. Predator is you've got a room full of bad guys on patrol and you have to take them all out in the shortest amount of time possible. Each predator challenge has 3 medals you can earn for things like doing a silent takedown on a bad guy or taking out a bad guy with an explosion. They become increasingly difficult, such as one medal for taking out 3 bad guys using 3 different explosives on 3 different walls - that one took me a while.Combat challenges are simple, there's a room full of bad guys coming at you and you have to take them all out - trying to get the highest score. The higher your combo the more points. The 3 medals are always just points thresholds. So the key to completing/medalling these challenges is mastering the combat system. If you get all medals on all challenges you earn a trophy, and you know its so worth it!This is a fabulous game that is immensely fun. Controls are easy, being batman is a great time. The main campaign has a good length and the challenges are a lot of fun to do and get more life out of this game. I'm looking forward to replaying it on hard. Batman Arkham Asylum is a game that focuses on a few things - single player, gadgets, combat, etc - and does them superbly. One of the most fun games I've played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

The basic premise is stereotypical; your character is a thirty-something ex-military smart-aleck who teams up with a helpful researcher and a heroine as tough as you are to defeat a mad scientist and his experiments.  Sounds like a few too many bad sci-fi movies, right?  However Farcry takes the premise and turbocharges it.  The action is intense and the scale of the game is large and more involved than you would originally think.What made this game stand out so much is it was one of the first to successfully render a tropical environment.  Most sci-fi games and movies do industrial and barren landscapes as they are forbidding but also easy to do.  Seeing a full fledged jungle, with plants blowing in the wind and birds flying overhead was simply awesome for 2004.  The designers also understood the need for variety, as there are night scenes, some industrial and science fiction, and even a few in abandoned ruins.There isn't much I can fault the game for except for age and linear gameplay.  While you can run all over the map and use any vehicle from a truck to a hang glider, you have specific things you have to do and not an awful lot of interaction aside from the main characters.  This can be a letdown to people used to the newer crop of RPG shooters where you have multiple quests and can choose the moral balance of your character.

Patterson","summary":"Fast Paced Intense Battles","reviewText":"I always say the two most important aspects in a game for me are graphics and gameplay. And this one excells in both!The combat is fast and intense. There is plenty of action and loads of weapons to try out. I say try out because whatever you start out with will run out of ammo and you'll eventually have to go back to using the German weapons. I almost always finished the levels using a German machine gun and rifle.One aspect that really really bugged me was how my teammates ALWAYS got in the way. I don't know how many times I got killed because I would go into a room and start getting shot only to find that I couldn't go back out the way I came in because Joe Jackass is crotched down in the doorway trying to shoot. They constantly get in your way and prevent you from moving. And in close quarters intense combat that is not something you want.The lighting in the game seemed a little much. Some slight subtle light rays are good, but Tryarch layed them on thick in this one. It very unnatural looking a lot of the time.The multiplayer is a blast as well.

But thanks to their new digital debut in the action/RPG genre with X-Men Legends, you've never seen Xavier's men (and women) quite like this before. X-Men Legends is equal parts super-powered team-brawler and carefully customizable RPG in the vein of successful genre-benders like Baulder's Gate, but mixed with the familiar flavor of the Marvel universe - meaning Legends is saturated with atmospheric authenticity and comic book continuity. The exciting and original story (penned by former X-Men comic authors) starts when Magneto's minions attempt to kidnap a powerful young mutant named Alison Crestmere for use in his attempts to rule the world and subjugate humanity. In order to combat Magneto and his evil Brotherhood of Mutants, you assume control a group of four X-Men selected before each mission stage from an overall pool of over a dozen of these famous fighters, with the ability to switch between each character on the fly. Perhaps the coolest part of X-Men Legends is the handy Dynamic Joining feature, which allows you and up to three friends to each take control of an X-Man at any time and come and go as you please without disrupting the progress of the story mode missions - thereby effectively transforming a simple single-player game into a multiplayer melee at a moment's notice. Fortunately, the friendly AI is also quite bright, allowing your uncontrolled characters to follow your lead intelligently without being distracting or requiring any substantial coddling. Each individual X-Man also has a set of upgradeable and unique mutant abilities that are useful both in heated battles and in solving small puzzles and overcoming otherwise impassable obstacles, making the character selections a crucial part of pre-combat customization. Legends also packs a plethora of side-quests, unlockable items, mini-games, hidden bonuses, and multiplayer modes to keep you busy well beyond the scope of the primary missions of the story mode. Chief among these extras is the inventive Skirmish mode in which you and your pals import your saved character data and individual statistics to battle it out in a head-to-head duel, with the myriad of entertaining and addictive Danger Room challenges coming in a close second. The bulk of X-Men Legends is comprised of team based combat with waves of enemy soldiers and can, at times, become a bit repetitious. But the cool ability to perform specialized combo attacks with your teammates adds a nice layer of depth to the battles and becomes an integral part of defeating challenging bosses and defeating overwhelming odds. The detailed environments also boast an impressive level of destructibility that allows your mutant marauders to bust through walls and leave beautiful rubble piles in your wake. But Legends isn't just about beating the bad guys, as the aforementioned \"RPG elements\" are rather substantial. Character buildup is accomplished via an accumulation of experience points earned in battle that can then be used to purchase new mutant skills and enhanced statistics that incorporate each character's unique powers from the comic book series. Plus, each character can equip several defensive and offensive items, which can either be bought from Forge or earned through victories, making Legends more than just a simple fighting game with player stats.X-Men Legends isn't perfect, but it comes pretty damn close. A few notable gripes do arise, like the abhorrently sluggish and leisurely loading times and the unimpressive and outdated cinematic sequences that jar with the otherwise slick visual stylings. The camera also hangs at an awkward  perspective and occasionally moves too far out to cover all the action, leaving you with a screen of indiscernible mini-mutants. However, such complaints seem petty and entirely forgivable when juxtaposed with the stellar cell-shaded graphics, excellent voice acting (with Patrick Stewart reprising his cinematic role as Professor X), and multiplayer mayhem that make Legends look and feel like the A-list game that it is. Whether you're a long time X-fan or simply an action/RPG enthusiast, X-Men Legends is an outstanding addition to any gamer's library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2004"}

Basically, your character and the rest of his troops jump out of planes and into different WW2 locations and basically either destroy something or kill nazis. Theres really no \"story\" like the other Medal of Honor games where you feel that your character is doing something extrodinary (like in Frontline where you infiltrate a German base disguised as a Nazi with some Nazi papers). You get your usual array of weapons in this game ranging anywhere from the M1 Garand and BAR assault rifle to the Panzershrek, Springfield sniper rifle and MP40. However, each gun is terribly inaccurate and do almost the same amout of damage as each other. What do I mean? Well for example I will be holding a Thompson machine gun, I will literally empty and entire clip into one soldier and he will do. On the next victim I used the Gweher and it took me an entire clip to lay him out. You are also awarded upgrades to your guns such as less recoil or a scope if you score enough headshots and kills with said guns. However, most of the upgrades are completley useless since the aiming and recoil (even with the upgrade for \"less recoil\") is still atrocious.Lets talk hit detection. Pretty much, no matter where you shoot a Nazi...he will simply shrug it off and run away. You could shoot him in the chest with a Springfield (which in real life would blow a huge gaping hole in his chest cavity), he'll stagger for a minute and then dive behind cover. This is EXTREMLEY annoying, and is actually one of the reasons a previous MOH game did so bad (anyone remember Rising Sun?).The multiplayer is garbage. If your allies, you parachute into the action. Sounds cool right? Not when enemies snipers just keep picking you off before you hit the ground. It probably wouldn't be so bad if you could.. oh, I don't know.. shoot a gun while parachuting?! Basically, your a target until you hit the ground. Ontop of that, your allies and enemies aren't clearly labeled. So for instance, you'll see a character standing there with no name or anything above his head... you kill him, and boom you score a team kill because you had no idea. God, so lame.Your allies AI is disgusting. They will just stand there and get shot at without doing anything. The best example I have of this is in the 4th level where you are fighting in the city - I had an allied troop taking cover in a ruined building.... with an enemy standing right next to him. Terrible.And additionally, I guess the game testers must have been sleeping when they gave this game the thumbs up. On more than one occassion bullets would go right through the walls or cover you are trying to hide behind. LAMMMEEEEEEE.Oh, and expect to have a screaming match with your TV. This is one of the hardest titles ever. You'll die over and over and over and over and over and over just to gain an inch of land and then have it taken away because the checkpoint system is garbage. Since your AI is so bad and there are clipping issues, you'll basically be fighting the entire Nazi army by yourself.The graphics aren't next gen, and are actualyl a step down from what Call of Duty has set as a standard for the genre of WW2 shooters. Characters look choppy, the explosions are pixelated and sloppy, and the only thing good about the graphics are the environments & guns.As for as music goes, this has the worst soundtrack in the entire franchise. I was deeply dissapointed with the generic war time music used instead of the epic chorus and strings usually used. And the fact that the theme song isn't even the same is heart shattering.As far as I'm concerned, the Medal of Honor games are dead. This is just a terrible game all around, and its really sad because I'm a huge fan of the series. The sheer lack of effort in almost every aspect of the game makes this an untouchable title. 2.5 rounds spent in my Garand out of 10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Carlos E. Coto","summary":"Game review","reviewText":"Afer buying the collectors edition, I posted a review about the products inside. Now after playing and finishing the game, I can post my whole opinion of the game.Uncharted 3 is one of the most anticipated games this year. Showned last year at the VGA(video game awards), the trailer left many of us waiting to see more of this game. With breathtaking moments, and jaw dropping scenes, uncharted 3 is one of the most interesting looking video games out there. With that said, lets get to the review.Uncharted 3 starts easy with knowing a bit about the history of Nathan Drake and an obsession he has. (due to spoilers I will not type anything out that might give anything away.) As you progress throughout the game, you get to learn more about drake as he characters from the previous games explain more about his personality and what exactly is he trying to acomplish. The story takes a turn for the worse when drake is stranded in the dessert and tries to find his way to the atlantis of the sands.Gameplay: the gameplay is simple and yet complex at times where you'll see jumping from building to building fighting some enemies and sneaking. In this game sneaking a lot is the key to dying less or from wasting bullets. A lot of enemies will be waiting around in every corner, so be careful. As for a main difference in the combat style is the ability to use bottles as weapons and trying to find ways to subdue the enemy.Story: the story of this game is very interesting on its own. But as a critique, I enjoyed Uncharted 2 a lot more than the story of this game. Not saying that the story is bad, but hard to compare it to the second game. Overall the idea of trying to find the clues of Sir francis drake and heading to find the secrets, Atlantis of the sand is a very deep interesting story. Some things could have been done to make the story better but overall, it is a nice story with deep ties to know more about Drake.Sound: this is where it gets interesting. This game has many different sound system options which might make the game feel very different and unique. Ranging from the dolby pro-logic to the dts 5.1 to even linear pcm, the game offers up to 7.1 surround sound. The surround sound can be changed to a more dynamic feel depending on how big your center speaker is, how wide or how narrow you want the sound to be, and how loud, Midnight being really different in the sound system.As for the sounds and the music, very well detailed and amazing quality within this game. The score of the uncharted series has always been one that has kept me well into it especially during the fight scenes and dramatic moments. To some the score doesn't mean much, while to others music is a way to help you enjoy a game even more and how deep it can get you within. The natural sounds of the games such as hearing the waves keep you deep within, sometimes it even made me feel I was there.Voice and character acting: The orginal cast of uncharted comes back in this game, aiding and promoting the series with all they can offer. Having the same voice actors in the game makes the game feel like a part of a trilogy without ever making it feel different or far off. With the new characters added, they give it their all including the new antagonist which makes the game feel so realistic, including with the character animations.Graphics: The graphics in this game are superb, running at 60 frames per second (30 in 3D). The areas and places are wonderfully well made and with the cinematographics, it makes you admire the work and artstyle that went into making this game. A lot can be said about the graphics, but for me it is the admiration of the sceneries and the details that make me want to just stop and look around for a while seeing everything there is to see.Stereoscopic 3D: This game can be played in 3D and I must say I am impressed by it. I've played 3D games before, but none look as stunning as this one. The shutter glasses however, might make the game hard to see in some points where you might need to either up the brightness or remove the glasses and play normally. But the 3D feel of the game just keeps me from taking them off as the in depth perception is absolutely stunning, especially when seeing the treasures you get. Be warned though, there may be moments where you will get tired as the 3D might become heavy. You can make the 3D to be less potent in the options menu at the title screen.Game overall: Uncharted 3's story mode keeps me amazed and surprised at almost every corner. The game is very fun and enjoyable. It is  a fairly quick game and easy to gain trophies. To some it is a rental, to others is a must buy. But I did enjoy beating the game on medium and going to try my luck on crushing as well as getting the remaining treasures. The game also offers online multiplayer so you must have an online pass to play this game online. The online pass comes with the game brand new. Not sure if you have a 7 day trial for renting the game, but if it does, you can try it and see if its a must buy for you.Uncharted drakes deception gets a 5/5. Hope the review helps without spoiling anything.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

Despite Steam fanboys attempting to boycott the game for its quick release, it has proven to be an admirable sequel to the original.There are several new game modes in L4D2, along with 5 new campaigns to play through, new characters, and a continuous story arc through each played campaign.  The one which will prove most challenging is survival mode, which removes the easy find feature for the location of other players and weapons/ammo.  Zombies are also more diversified, letting you kill undead clowns, police officers, and biohazard suited bad boys.While the game shines in terms of offering enough new content to validate a sequel rather than an upgrade, what doesn't shine is the graphics.  The Source engine was revolutionary in June 2004, it just looks plain old now.  It becomes most obvious during the day missions.  Characters look blocky, jagged, and when compared to Half Life 2, doesn't have much difference in look and appeal beyond a few layering and dynamic lighting effects.The main concept of cooperation in L4D2 is marketed well though.  Coop shooters are quickly becoming popular with the casual gamer crowd as it envelopes a sense of community rather than competition.

The only thing I've noticed is that the cooling fan is pretty noisy, but that's it. And it works fine even though the box it came it was unbelievably beat to heck by UPS, to the point the box was noticeably ripped open and taped shut again (Amazon's poor packaging didn't help things).As for the console itself, I see great potential. As with any launch, the games are pretty lacking- my PC would laugh at the new Killzone game, for example (30fps? Really?), but I can't wait to see the future PS4 exclusives coming down the line. Exclusives are going to be the main strength of the PS4 over the XboxOne, which Microsoft has always seemed to have trouble securing outside of Halo.

Same missions, and the customizations are basic. It would be cool to upload your own tattoos onto your character with the way they hyped customization, but its so basic. I'm disappointed I paid full price for this when it came out. I honestly am waiting for GTA V. The map is basic, and the game isn't as interactive. You can walk into your safehouse, but not some of the properties you buy. I wish it was more interactive knowing its the same Stillwater map as the first 3. They could have revamped the rendering and what not, maybe add more interaction between characters. In GTA you could have girlfriends, etc, here you have a few gang members to help on missions, that's it. With teh time they had to create this game, they could have added a Sims like interaction in the game. It also gets repetitive after a while. I'd wait to buy this when it hits $20.

{"product_name":"B007C72F2U","description":"","reviewerName":"AK529","summary":"Much better than Civ 5 but still not as good as Civ 4","reviewText":"This expansion pack has definetly improved the game. But the question is why did us loyal Civ fans have to wait another 1.5 years and pay another $30 for the game finally to be improved? Civ 5 should have been like this from day one.  People who haven't played any other civ games will really enjoy this game and probably won't even notice or miss any of the cool stuff that is still missing from Civ IV. I still feel like Civ 5 is dumped down version of Civ 4. Civ 5 still lacks a lot of the micro managing and extra features Civ 4. Ofcourse I didn't expect an expansion pack to fix Civ 5 completely. Another issue with gods and kings is that it doesn't include any of the previously released dlc for Civ 5. So someone unlike me who has already purchased the dlc would have purchase all the dlc and the expansion pack to get all the civilizations.There are number good things and equally or more bad things about gods and kings. Good things: more units, more civs, more wonders, more city improvements. New game concepts like how a meele naval unit can now occupy a city without a ground unit isa great addition. Another one where naval units are now stackable on top of ground units in the sea for extra protection.Bad things: Religion and spies are a great addition-finally! I personally preferred the way spies were managed and used in Civ 4. In gods and kings the only way to get a spy is when you enter a new era.  There is a limit to how many spies you can have I think it's 6 or 7 something like that. Also you can station the spy in one of your cities, another civ or another city state. I just find thind the control very limited and tedious.  I also found the stealing technology concept annoying. Enemy civilizations constantly stealing tech even though I have done all that I can to stop them like station spies in my cities and buld numerous improvements and wonders.  Religion I'm glad they added it also but again I missed they it was in civ 4. One thing that annoyed me right away was enemy civs converting and spreading religion in my cities and there was no way to stop it. The only thing I could do was reconvert my cities.  I also wish there was a way to win a religious victory. The great people abilities have changed in gods and kings. For example in civ 5 all great people had the ability to to cause a golden age. In gods and kings only the great artist can trigger a golden age. Also in civ 5 the great artist could be used to create a culture bomb which was one my favorite features of civ 5. There is no great person that can create a culture bomb in gods and kings. But the great general can create a citadel which does expand borders and can be used to kind of substitute for the culture bomb. The citadel does take up the tile improvement is suppose to be used more for defense from military stand point of view.One thing I really miss from previous civilizations is the victory screen when you make it to alpha centauri. In gods and kings and civ 5 you don't even have to wait until your ship makes it to alpha centauri.  Basically as soon as your spaceship is built you've won it.In the end I'm happy we got this expansion pack but there is room for improvement. I guess we will have to wait another 1.5 years for the next expansion pack. Hopefully it will be based more other components like science, better AI, improved religion, improved spies, improved game concepts maybe bring more stuff in from civ 4 and make it like the beyond the sword expansion pack for civ 4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA30","description":"","reviewerName":"ObiWanShinobi","summary":"Death Can Be Fun...Sometimes","reviewText":"If you played the original Darksiders and loved it to the point where you would play a worthy sequel - then I have some good news for you. If however, you haven't played the original, or were on the fence about it, then the following is for you.Darksiders 2 picks up where the first one left off, both from a story and gameplay perspective. It's still an Action/Adventure title that borrows HEAVILY from other games out there. This time around it's Prince of Persia, Borderlands, Shadow of the Colossus, Portal, God of War, and Zelda(s) mainly. And if that sounds like a sweet list - that's b/c it is. However while the Darksiders titles make no bones about the great gameplay ideas that they're literally copying, the elements that they borrow are never quite as good as the games they come from.Overall Darksiders 2 is an improvement on the original concept...but it does have some serious flaws. And in true Sergio Leone fashion - there's some Good, some Bad and some Ugly.THE GOOD:1.) The action/combat is way better this time around. In the original Darksiders the main character, War, was big, slow and clunky to control. Upgrades in the first Darksiders came by way of improving/adding things to the 2 or 3 weapons you get during the course of the game. Coupled with the fact that War handled like a Buick - the combat never really felt all that deep or fulfilling.Death on the other hand is like a ninja spider monkey. Controls are tight and responsive. Taking a cue from Borderlands - Death can collect a whole host of different weapons and armor (both found and dropped) with tons of different attributes. In addition, a skill tree for secondary magic attacks and a more robust leveling system make for a more satisfying RPG element. All that together makes for a much more fulfilling combat experience this time around.2.) Graphics and additional gameplay elements are also super awesome. The whole claw wall-running/climbing thing from the last Prince of Persia game is great. Same goes for the section/boss fight of the game that they pretty much ripped from Shadow of the Colossus. While there isn't much original about these elements - they're still awesome.THE BAD1.) There's a couple of little things that hinder the overall experience. The menu's for instance aren't the worst I've ever seen... but they do take a bit to get used to, and aren't easy to navigate.2.) The controls took a bit to get used to as well. I would have really liked to be able to map some of the buttons.3.) There's a lot of load time in-game. It's not tragic or particularly annoying it's just that every once and a while you'll open a door and have to sit there for 5 seconds.THE UGLY1) The game is huge. Which may sound like a good thing, especially when the graphics are great, and the entire game looks like either the cover of an Iron Maiden or Yes/Journey album. But in this case, the size of the game just plain-old-fashioned sucks. The main reason is that enemy to empty space ratio is crazy outta whack. Which leads me to #2.....2.) The whole game is a series of fetch quests. The whole thing. You will literally spend the entire time Going-To-Get-The-Key-Of-This-Or-ThreeStones-Of-That-For-Some-Mytical-Figure-So-That-They-Will-Tell/Give-You-Some-Other-Thing-Or-Open-Some-Door-For-You. Maybe a boss fight. Rinse and Repeat.So when you add 1+2 = You End Up Spending About a Solid 75% of Your Time Just Walking Around. And with the Fetch Quest issue you'll be walking the same path over and over again. Sure there's a puzzle or two in the mix, lots of hidden paths, side quests and collectibles.. but that doesn't make up for the fact that most of the time I spent playing the game was just \"walking around\". Swapping out some of the puzzle elements (which aren't crazy challenging or really diverse) for some enemies would have been a good idea I think.So while in the end the Good, totally outweighs the Bad & Ugly - it doesn't cover up the fact that they exist. I had a lot of fun playing the game and have no problem recommending it. If you're looking for a solid Action/Adventure title this will do the trick. However, if action is what you're looking for, and a lot of downtime sounds like it might be a deal-breaker for you - I would definitely consider that before you buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"A.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

This game basicly lacks replay value, and that hurts a game now, a lot.

After playing the Japanese version I wasn't disappointed at all, as a matter of fact, I was highly impressed.  The puzzles are simple and not very complex, that is until you inch your way to the end, then it starts to pick up a bit, but nothing to absoultly tease your brain over.

Nonlinear gameplay, gripping story, interesting characters, high degree of customization, it's all there.Some things have been improved.  Characters can now be raised to level 30 instead of 20, so gaining experience induces a faster sense of progress.  There are more items to collect and use, more upgrade options, more force powers and more party members available.I was most impressed with the level of depth the main characters displayed.  The graphics were adequate; nothing too amazing.  The voice acting was acceptional and the music was of high quality.However, there is a sense that the developers rushed this product out prematurely.  There are a significant number of gliches throughout the game...much more than in KOTOR I.  Maybe it's because this game is from a different developer.  There are misspellings, dialogue repeats, and unresolved quest issues.  While these glitches don't detract from the overall enjoyment of playing they're enough to annoy some people.Like KOTOR I, this game allows you to choose light or dark paths to follow.  Many elements in the game change depending on which side you're on.  Because of this there is high incentive to replay the game all over.

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Brendan Foy \"Foy\"","summary":"I'm Batman.  At least it certainly feels like it!","reviewText":"I'm late to the party, but it didn't take me long to get as buzzed as everyone else for this dark horse of a Dark Knight game.  Having just completed story mode and all it has to offer and now working on the 12 different challenge maps, I can say with confidence this is the best Batman game ever made.  The reviews do not lie and are not exaggerating.Prior to this game, the best Batman outings I can recall were the original Batman game based off the first Tim Burton movie on the NES, the awesome Beat 'em Up \"Batman Returns\" based off the second Tim Burton movie on the SNES and both the Genesis and SNES versions of Batman: The Animated Series.  It has been a long time since we saw even a decent Batman game, most have reeked of mediocrity.  Even the good games I mentioned failed to capture what it truly meant to be Batman by either focusing on platform or combative elements.  Other games have attempted to showcase his Detective and stealth abilities but fell short.  Arkham Asylum changes all of this.In Batman: AA you get to experience, through an interactive format, all that makes Batman such a compelling Superhero.  The game captured the brutality of his combat in a most satisfying fashion, gives you plenty of opportunity and even a requirement to stick to the shadows and take down your enemies silently with stealth, stalk your enemies like the nocturnal predator Batman is, make use of cool bat gadgets from the batarang to the batclaw and even behave like a true Detective.  All of the Batman's talents and tricks are on full display here in a beautiful gothic setting which rivals the best Batman graphic novels.When I first heard of this game and read up on it, I figured it would turn out average or worse, like most recent Batman games.  I assumed it would focus on sloppy combat mechanics with the occasional gadget thrown in for superficial use.  I could not have been more wrong.  The combat is fluid, intuitive and immensely satisfying.  The moves are quick and brutal, particularly the unblockable takedowns done in slow motion where bones can be heard crackling.  The combo system is relatively simplistic, relying mostly on a couple buttons and the directional stick for basic moves, but seeing as how this is far from being primarily a beat 'em up, the simplicity in no way holds the experience back.  In fact, the combat feels more rewarding than most games which provide heavier doses of it and has an old school feel where you need to rely on timing, positioning and keeping track of what types of enemies are around you.  Beside the basic armed and unarmed minions, you have some tougher guys mixed in who can really mess up your rhythm if you're not careful.  The gadgets add to the depth of combat where you can throw 3 batarangs, drag up to 3 enemies towards you with the ultra batclaw and more.  Things can get pretty crazy but you feel the power of Batman the whole time, without it all being too easy.  There is nothing more satisfying than swooping in on 10 thugs and taking them out with the grace and finesse of a Russian figure skater.Aside from the combat, there is the flipside which is Predator mode.  This is where you flip on your \"detective vision\" which is essentialy X-ray vision so you can see your enemies through walls and plan out your attack.  This vision also highlights ideal spots to hide to help you with taking our your enemies like the Stealth Ninja Batman is.  This usually consists of grappling up to Gargoyles near the ceiling, crawling through vents, scurrying under the floor or blowing up breakable walls as enemies walk by.  The gadgets allow you to take out enemies from afar, distract them, lure them, stun them, confuse them and just completely terrify them as you take them out one by one.  Uusually while you surgicaly remove each threat from a room, the Joker, voiced by the immortal Mark Hamil, can be heard yelling at his thugs for being so incompetent through the Asylum P.A. system; this can be quite entertaining.All of the voice acting in this game is exceptional, even when it comes to cameos and small bit characters.  Along with the terrific art, graphics, sound and music, the voice actors bring this game to life and suck you right in.  Many of the voices are from the animated series from the 90s, a wise choice if you ask me.  Batman, Joker, Poison Ivy, Killer Croc, Bane, Riddler, Harley Quinn - they all sound spot on and convincing.  If you take the time to explore and look around (which you will), you can find \"interview tapes\" scattered about where you can listen to these guys speak during their psychological evaluations.  Listening to these tapes adds much to the characters with lesser roles and there are all sorts of bios and backstories for a massive number of characters not even seen in the game.The developers have a clear love and devotion to the source material.  Everything in this game was meticulously crafted and then polished with such care.  You have atmosphere, great voice acting, great music, great art, fun combat, stealth, gadgets, detective work, puzzle solving, platform elements and exploration elements.  You have a good story with good storytelling as well and there even some horror elements for good measure.  The only real gripes I have are that the pacing of the game slows down to a crawl for about an hour or two in the beginning of the game after a jaw dropping opening sequence (things pick up very quickly though and don't let up until it's all over) and there isn't quite as much combat as I would have liked.  Those who need their combat fix, as well as more stralth takedowns, can play the separate challenge modes which are quite addictive.  I just would have liked to have seen more of these incorporated into the game's main story.  The boss fights are fantastic, but I would have liked to have seen at least one more featured in the game.  Speaking of boss fights, the mind numbing run ins you have with Scarecrow are unlike anything you'll play in console games these days.The hype is real, this game rocks and is one of the best games this generation.  If I wasn't such an RPG junkie who loves Dragon Age, I would name Batman: Arkham Asylum as the best game of 2009.  Easily an 'A' on the letter grade scale.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Most Gorgeous God of War So Far","reviewText":"With Kratos revenge fulfilled in the God of War 3, I was curious to see what type of story and experience Santa Monica (the developers) would bring to God of War: Ascension. After thoroughly finishing the campaign, here is what I think.******************************Pros****************************************Gorgeous Environments and Graphics: This is the strongest suit of the game. As I mentioned in the intro, this is the best-looking God of War game yet. Especially the scenery and the environment of the first few chapters blew my mind. An experience that must not be missed.**Brutality and Ultraviolence: When the developers said, they are going to bring more human side of Kratos I was worried. To me what make Kratos a unique character is his rage and mercilessness.  Fortunately, Kratos is almost as brutal as all the previous games (a little less angry and confused though). I had fun punishing enemies with such brutality.**Good Mixture of Platforming, Puzzles and Action: This is why I loved all of the previous god of war games and this is why I liked Ascension. The gameplay is very balanced in all three aspects. Puzzles do require some thinking but are quite solvable without a guide. Platforming is fun but not torturous like Dark Souls. And both of these are balanced with action heck&slash; gameplay so this game does a great job keeping you engaged..**Well Thought Overall Level Designs: Of all the areas I loved the beginning chapter area and Tower of Appollo. They are both very well designed. And it was rewarding seeing the tower of Appollo transform as you progress through chapter. Very authentic.**The Combat, Weapons, Magic and Gadgets: They have changed the combat somewhat from previous God of War games. For most part I liked it. Now magic is part of your chain blades. So switching different magic gives your chain blades different combos, ability and finishing moves which don't use your magic bar. And then there are 4 unique magic which will use magic bar. The gadgets also give you pretty awesome abilities. Unfortunately there are a few of those. I wish they had more.**Upgrades: Like previous game you can upgrade your blades, magic, health and gadgets. Gives you incentives to hunt for chests and explore the levels. Such RPG elements are always welcome by me.**Bosses and Enemies: This is one of my favorites for God of War series. There is decent variety in enemies. Loved the Juggernauts. Variety in enemies also means variety in brutal finishing moves. Makes the experience satisfying. Bosses are also pretty great. Loved the fights against sisters.New Game+ mode: Very appreciated. Adds longevity to this awesome experience.Multiplayer: Fun but.... (see cons)******************************Cons****************************************Glitches: There are not many. I only encountered one (but a frustrating one because it was in the toughest level... Yes the trials). Fortunately, restarting the chapter solved it. So won't hold it against them.**Number of Bosses: There are decent number of bosses, but less than God of War 3. Definitely want more in future games.**Story: This is the weakest point of the game. Compared to other games, it had a decent story but compared to previous God of War games, it was really pale. I was left very unsatisfied in the end.**Multiplayer: Why? Seriously Why? It is fun but it doesn't belong in God of War. I would rather have 5-10 extra chapters of campaign than Multiplayer.******************************Conclusion**************************************While it does have some cons, but for most part they are subjective and I will not hold them against the awesome experience this game provides. If you played previous God of War games, this is a must. If you didn't, It's still a great experience. I would give this a 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

To really progress, you probably spend more time on the boat than you do on the ground. This was a detriment at the beginning, but the boat stuff is growing on me. The boat stuff doesn't feel like Assassin's Creed to me, but it's still solid, fun gameplay. When you actually start playing the side missions feel totally like AC, but some of the story missions often feel more like the tedious portions of AC -- lots of follow these guys around while hidden and eavesdrop. This is NOT the pinnacle AC game, in my opinion (having played them all) AC: Brotherhood was BY FAR the best AC game. But if you want the boat stuff to mix up the AC formula but less hunting than AC3 (and without the terrible RTS stuff of AC: Revelations), this is a solid addition to the AC series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2014"}

Nintendo even put all of the DSiware applications onto the 3DS eshop. I really do like my DSi, however. The design is sturdy and easy to use. The DS software has been produced for over 5 years, so games are not an issue. The 3DS can play normal DS games, but they appear in low quality because of the screen size.

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Good stealth gameplay with reasonable graphics","reviewText":"The latest in the Tenchu series lets you choose to be a male or female ninja, out to do good and save innocent villagers.Gameplay involves you sneaking around, watching your stealth meter (a la splinter cell) and trying to achieve your objective with the least amount of notice possible.If you must fight, you have your ninja sword, as well as throwing stars, caltrops, and other ninja-ey items. To reinforce (as if you could forget) that you are a ninja, your enemies yell out &quot;Ninja!&quot; all the time. But strangely, if you manage to hide, they forget all about your presence in a short while.The graphics are reasonably good, in an Onimusha style. You have floating petals, trees with individual leaves. But the water looks more like a river of mud and the backgrounds are very much like walls of mud.You can replay levels to try for the ultimate rating in each one, looking for all of the hidden items.A good game for those who enjoyed Way of the Samurai and Spliter Cell.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8FZ","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Brings Back the Good Old NES Days","reviewText":"When Nintendo re-released the original Super Mario Bros. as Super Mario Bros. Deluxe for the Game Boy, I was pretty excited. I had been longing to play that game again for years. My NES had long since died and that game was one of my all-time favorites. Now we get the original Super Mario Bros 2 for the Game Boy Advance. That is what Super Mario Advance actually is. If you never owned a NES and/or never played Super Mario Bros 2, you should definitely get this game. If you did play this game on the NES, you should still get it. It brought back great memories of playing the old game as a kid. Plus, it adds some new aspects to the original game. Now, instead of playing through the game to beat the final boss and being done, there is actually replay value here. Every level has 5 red coins and 2 yoshi eggs hidden somewhere in the level that you have to find in order to completely beat the game. Is there a whole lot of incentive to actually do this? Not really, but it still adds another dimension to the game.I should also mention that these NES games work perfectly on the Game Boy Advance. The control works fine, the graphics of the Game Boy Advance are actually better than those of the NES. Hopefully Nintendo continues this trend and releases more of its original gmaes on the Game Boy Advance.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2002"}

Nevertheless, I have recently played a few classic NES titles. Here they are- now with updated and improved graphics, some cool new things to see, and on a much smaller cartridge than the original.Super Mario Advance is essentially the second of the vaunted Mario Bros. series (yes, the #1 selling game series in HISTORY) ported over to the GameBoy Advance. If you loved the classic as much as we all did, you'll love this too. If you didn't like it, you are an outcast. Just pretend you do so we'll still think you're cool.The only downside to this game pak is that if you played Mario Bros 2 so fanatically that every button press is permanently encoded into your brain (as I did) you might find that the same sequence still works. However, you will also die several times as a result of picking up things that weren't there before- like the super-huge onions and the gigunto Shyguys. The new things are enough to make it fun to play at least one more time, and for those of you who were *gasp* born after the heyday of the Great Mario Bros., you will be required to play this at least once.

How Sony could release a handheld with only one analog stick (and a lousy nub at that) is beyond me.  They can correct this horrendous design flaw (which is the big reason why not one great game has been made for the system), by coming out with an add-on, that plugs into the usb port, and adds an additonal analog stick.  Even better would be an add on that adds two analog sticks so the nub can be ignored.  It would snap onto the PSP and should be very easy to design.

I've played Pikmin 1 and 2 to the end, and can honestly say that Pikmin 3 is 10 times as great as the first two games combined! The instant I started playing I could tell that the controls were improved A LOT. The characters run around SO SMOOTHLY! It even makes Olimar and Louie's controls from Pikmin 2 seem clumsy. And the graphics are CRAZY AWESOME!!! (When you walk in the water it looks REAL!) The game mechanics are very similar to the original Pikmins, but it feels like an entirely new game. The environments, the music, just EVERYTHING gives you a better feeling-it feels...fun! You won't have to try to love this Pikmin game! Bingo Battle is a lot like Pikmin 2's battle mode, but with a bingo-y twist, making it surprisingly more fun and addictive. Story Mode seems really great so far (with a heck of a lot more story than Pikmin 1 and 2). And the boss battles are a very nice addition! And Mission Mode is PERFECTION!!! Nintendo really made this seem like \"the lame mode\" when advertising Pikmin 3, but it's quite the contrary. I might even go so far as to say it's better than story mode. There is optional co-op play as well. You can select from 3 different styles of missions: treasure-finding, enemy-hunting, and boss battles. Boss battles is really just what it sounds like, nothing too special, but the other mission styles are incredibly challenging and fun (Good luck getting all the gold medals...)! The Wii U Gamepad makes for a great map in every mode, but I must say I'm a little disappointed with the gamepad controls (I play with a Wii remote and nunchuk). I was also disappointed that the thing where you can press \"down\" on the d-pad and have all your Pikmin walk in a certain direction was removed, but it was totally worth the brand new ninja-like dodge roll! The new Pikmin are also amazing! I find both the winged and rock Pikmin a lot more creative than the purple and white ones (Winged Pikmin are the best things ever). Yeah, this game has a few little flaws, but they can easily be overlooked. I would definitely recommend Pikmin 3 to any Wii U owner, and it greatly surpasses New Super Mario Bros.

In Black Flag you take on the role of Edward Kenway, a Welsh-born privateer turned pirate and eventual member of the Assassin Order.  Kenway has travelled to the Caribbean during the Golden Age of Piracy in order to provide for his newly expecting wife.  Due to an unexpected turn of events Kenway turns towards a life of piracy and assassination in order to survive.  Kenway inadvertently becomes involved in the war between Templars and Assassin's which has been secretly waging for more than a millennium.  Here are my thoughts on Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag;Pros+ First Assassin's Creed game that delivers an open world experience.+ Seamless transitions between navigation, naval combat, boarding ships and exploring islands with minimal loading screens.+ Addictive gameplay makes you want to achieve 100% synchronization.+ Engaging story that keeps you interested through the entire experience.+ Unique and rewarding multiplayer mode.+ Brilliant original score by award winning composer Brian Tyler.+ Plenty of side activities to do alongside the main storyline.+ Kingston, Havana and Nassau were all beautifully designed even though they felt a bit small.+ Freeroaming gameplay was fun as always.+ Gorgeous graphics as with all previous titles in the series.+ Fast-paced ship to ship and melee combat.+ No beggars!Cons &#60;Contains SPOILERS&#62;- Less variety in gadgets and utilities.- No puzzles to solve or challenges to complete.- Missions are slightly less varied than in previous releases with a bit too much emphasis on tailing missions.- Story can meander and doesn't do much to advance the overall tale of the Assassin's Creed franchise.- A few quirky camera issues, especially during naval combat when you're attempting to board enemy ships.- Courtesans and fighters were of little use.- Limited armor customization.- Game crashed a few times while I was playing it.- Story felt a bit short but the side activities lengthen the overall play time.- Limited ship piloting.  Overall you primarily only pilot your own ship, the Jackdaw.Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is yet another solid release in Ubisoft's franchise. The introduction of Edward Kenway added a new and interesting character to the game as did the ability to fully pilot your own ship throughout the games story.  The game boasts beautiful graphics, a compelling story, engaging gameplay and delivers an open world experience unlike any of the previous releases.  I did feel at times the game tried a little too hard to be a &#34;pirate&#34; game rather than an Assassin's Creed title.  However, that being said Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is sure to please the majority of fans of the franchise, especially if you enjoyed the ship aspects of Assassin's Creed III. I logged over 80 hours in this game and am eagerly looking forward to the next installment in 2014.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

That was a major mistake on my part as this is an excellent game.I recently bought and played Aliens Colonial Marines and really liked that game which made me decide to pick this game up and give it a try. This is definately a survival horror game especially playing the Colonial Marine part of the campaign. You will have a nervous and foreboding feeling the whole time you are playing as a Marine. The Aliens will be everywhere and coming at you from every angle at times causing you to be constantly looking from side to side and back to front. The only time I found myself completely relaxed is during one of the cut sceens.This game is broken down into three different campaigns. Marine , Alien , Predator. To me the marine playthrough is the best. You have none of the super powers like the Alien and Predator, leaving you with a more helpless feeling. As the Predator you have your super weapons and your cloak ability that renders you virtually invisable. As the Alien you can climb on wall , are extremly fast, and are virtually undetectable in dark spaces.All and all this is a great game even being several years old. this game is definately worth your time and money. Buy it used or buy it new it doesnt matter you wont regret it.Edit : I purchased this game for only $17.00 in like new condition here on Amazon , so If you dont want to pay the high price of a new game you can pick it up used pretty cheap.

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Split/Second vs. Blur:  Two games at the same time, which is better?","reviewText":"Simply by virtue of being released 1 day apart, Split/Second and Blur were immediately connected and compared.  As someone who now owns both games, and has played both extensively (both online and offline) I now want to add my review of Split/Second, as I've written one for Blur already.  This is a straight comparision of how I think Split/Second compares to Blur, as well as if I was rating this game as a stand alone:Graphics:  Definitely a strong point of this title.  The varied locations pop off the screen and are very detailed, as are the cars.  One of the major draws of Split/Second (being able to blow up parts of the track in order to change routes and/or wreck your opponents) is quite spectacular.  It would be like splitting hairs to say which has the better graphics, so I'd call it a tie (4.5 out of 5, edge even)Sound:  Blur's got an edge here simply by their soundtrack (why they chose to not have this as the active option, vs. having to go into the menu and turn it on is beyond me).  But I also think the engine noises, etc. are much better.  The cars in Split/Second seem to be an afterthought as well.  4 out of 5, edge to BlurGameplay:  Again, I think Blur has a significant edge here.  Have a casual fan (i.e. my wife) who doesn't normally play these games?  Put Blur on easy and even she has a chance to win.  Blur also, in general, gives you a much better chance of coming from behind and placing high.  Split/Second has a VERY high level of difficulty, wreck or get \"power played\" and you can usually kiss first and second place goodbye.  This gets extremely frustrating in the later seasons.  At the very least, Split/Second should have had a normal/hard option.  As is, this game is not accessible for the casual gamer; only hardcore racers need apply.  Both games handle well, but drifting in Split/Second (which is required, if you want to fill your power play bar) actually slows you DOWN and without figuring out the best places to do it, makes it near impossible to beat the computer.  Again, it seems very counterinuitive.  3 out of 5, edge to BlurReplay Value:  Split/Second does not seem the kind of game that you can play over and over; there are 45 different decals to earn, but outside of that, there really is no reason to do it again.  Blur, on the other hand, has outstanding intergration both offline and online, and there's always a reason to play it again.  Lack of replay value is one of two negative strikes against Split/Second.  2/5 out of 5, edge to Blur)Online:  Now, this absolutely, positively is where Split/Second got it wrong.  If you're an entry player (i.e. in the beginning) don't even think about going online to play, as the players with the best cars are impossible to beat.  Blur, on the other hand, has the driving license area where it's only rank 1-10.  You have a legitimate chance to win.  Additionally, when I made Legend status and went all the way back to level 1, I managed to still win a couple of races.  Blur rewards good gameplay and powerup strategy; Split/Second is way, way too strict.  Couple this with Facebook/Twitter/Leaderboard intergration and Blur is a perfect example of how to do online for a racing game.  Split/Second online is a big disappointment.  2.5 out of 5, edge to BlurOverall:  I still rate Split/Second high (4 out of 5) because it is more rewarding to win races in Split/Second then in Blur due to the high level of difficulty.  And I do think the concept is very unique and presented well.  Just keep in mind, that once you've completed all the seasons, there is very little reason to go online with the game as the meat just isn't there.  I would definitely put Blur ahead of Split/Second if you only had to buy 1 of them.  Split/Second would make a good rental from a place like Gamefly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

In infamous, the electrified delivery boy Cole can scale tall buildings, skate along power lines, and call down lightning on a whim. The game is considerably more fleshed out than the Xbox 360 game it is trying so desperately to emulate. Why then does all of this feel so unsatisfying and incomplete?I certainly wouldn't blame inFamous' failings on the mission variety. Throughout the lengthy adventure, the main objectives always keep you invested. In one late mission, Cole will be asked to climb aboard and dismantle weather balloons that are raining poison down onto the populace. In another, he must fight toxin-induced hallucinations in a subterranean tunnel. And in between, there are frequent obstacle courses in the city's sewer system that grant Cole new abilities. Sure, some of the optional escort and scavenger hunt distractions become repetitive, but you can hover over those and not be penalized.However, there are moments when innocent bystanders are taken hostage or tied to streetlights along your path, and should you choose to ignore their plights, you will be given \"evil points.\" In fact, almost every story mission forces you to make these supposedly tough decisions, and I think this is where inFamous fails most miserably.There have been other games, from Fallout 3 to Bio Shock, with clumsily implemented morality systems, but inFamous is particularly amateurish in this regard. Every time you encounter one of these key moments, the game freezes and Cole talks to himself about the difference between right and wrong. The developer just beats you over the head with these choices, highlighting how artificial this world feels. I do appreciate how your powers are directly tied to this system, but overall, the implementation is detrimental to the experience.It doesn't help matters that no matter what path you choose, Cole always sounds as if he's channeling Rorschach from the Watchmen movie. He's just an incredibly unlikeable protagonist, and his accomplices don't fare any better. I realize that many other games before this one have fumbled in the morality and story departments. But if I sound overly harsh towards inFamous, it's only because Sucker Punch set the bar so high for themselves with the charming Sly Cooper games. We should all expect better from them.Having said that, inFamous is at least worth a rental, because for all it gets wrong, there are still some moments of brilliance. As was also the case with Crackdown, there is something inherently liberating about crawling up buildings and gliding over the streets below. Sure, the Grand Theft Auto games have their GPS now, but in these free-roaming super hero games, there is no limit to the number of routes you can take. It also helps that Cole is easy to control. The game is very generous in terms of footholds and ledges, making this game a top contender for \"best parkour\" antics.Luckily, those perilous ascents will hold your interest much longer than the main objectives, with plenty of doodads to collect and experience points to earn along the way. There is fun to be had here. I just wish that the game had lived up to the developer's ambitious concept. It will be interesting to see how the conceptually similar Prototype (which I haven't had a chance to play yet) stacks up.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Powie","summary":"Yay buttons!","reviewText":"As an ex-Wii owner I liked the motion controls of my Wii, I was disappointed by the low resolution of the games, the lack of quality and mature games, and horrible online features of the Wii hardware.  I think as I saw more games announced (Sorcery & KZ3), and more positive previews I decided to pre-order it.  Amazon was great as usual, and it arrived on release day.I had already downloaded a few of the Move demos from the PS Store, so after I opened the box I immediately plugged the Move controller in to get it a full charge before its first use. This took approximately 2.5 hours.  While the Move controller was charging I installed all of the demos on the demo disc that I hadn't already downloaded, this will take as a rough estimate around 10 gigs of storage, and around 35 minutes to install them all.XMB Navigation works, but takes a bit to get used to, the Move also works in the PS3 Web browser, it could use some improvement to be more mouse like, but it works.After playing for about 6 hours battery still shows 2/3 full. So I plugged the Move controller into my Windows 7 laptop via USB to see if it would charge, and yes Windows installed a driver for it, and the red light started to flash indicating it was charging. Was glad this worked as I don't like leaving my PS3 on just to charge a controller.The Move controller is comfortable to hold, and fits my average adult sized hands well Tracking for most the games/demo's I've played worked fine without any noticeable lag. Some were better than others, but none bad enough that I question the quality of the Move hardware.I wish the Camera was HD, but it would easily double the cost, but things would look much better when video is grabbed for use in game play (Like EyePets Augmented reality). For anyone with low quality picture, try adding lighting in front of the player.  The video quality looked much better when it was day with the shades open. Lighting isn't a technical problem for most games though since the camera tracks the glowing orb.Sports Champions is a decent enough launch title, while the graphics are not up to par with say Uncharted 2, they are good, and in HD are better than any game on a Wii.  About the only game I don't really like is the Volley Ball, on the other hand  I'm really enjoying the Gladiator game,  extremely fun even with just one Move controller.Of all the Demos available on the included demo disc, and PS Store, TV Superstars, and Tumble are the only two that have my interest now, but perhaps once the price drops on the others I will pick a few up. I'll also be letting my girlfriend play later today when she comes over, and the titles she enjoys will influence what I buy later.I'm definitely enjoying my experience so far, this adds another option for both casual and complex game play, and so far even with launch titles does it well!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

For one thing, the fit was tight. But after stretching out the headband its much better. The ear cup sits on your ear, doesn't cover it fully which adds to the discomfort. I guess they thought a cup large enough to go around an ear wouldn't look cool. Too bad, it would feel better. The ear cover is not a soft material like velor, so not as comfortable as it could be but seems durable. I am using this with my PS3, but it works with the Xbox 360 too. Setup was pretty simple, and it didn't take more than an hour or so to charge.  All initial problems I've had have disappeared. The one thing I can say about pairing, it says that you need to have your headphone at least 2 feet from the controller. I'd say more like 8ft because mine wouldn't pair until I got it back more than 5 feet apart. Overall, the best thing about this headphone is the excellent \"TRUE\" Dolby 5.1 that does not have the hiss of simulated surround AND it works on movies on the PS3, not just XMB games and apps like theWireless Stereo Headset. The quality is shockingly good. I played someCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3and that game really doesn't have that great of a surround experience because of all the explosions going off. So I put inSaving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray] and my jaw just dropped. The beach scene, while still on the boat, I could tell that firing was coming over my right shoulder on the beach, toward their boat. There are several settings that simulate different speaker placement. I just left it on the one it shipped with, number one. Now I know people will say, true Dolby 5.1 needs 5 speakers and a subwoofer. I don't know how they did it, but these sound as good, when it comes to telling where things are around you, as a physical 5.1 system.

The XP300 didn't seem as tight a fit as the XP400. Using the XP300 with my XBox I find that instead of using an optical out cable, it uses an RCA connection. The XP300 has simulated surround vs the Dolby 5.1 surround of the XP400. The simulated surround though is very good with 4 presets, like the XP400 has, to change the simulated placing of the surround speakers.  The XP300 does a good job with simulated surround. I used 5.1 Dolby NetFlix movies to compare the two models with the XP300 used with the XBox and the XP400 with the PS3. It doesn't seem as precise as the XP400 where you can pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. Instead, the soundstage of the XP300 sounds bigger than stereo to create a 3D effect.  But if you get the XP300 and want to upgrade to Dolby surround, Turtle Beach sells theTurtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound Processorthat you can use to upgrade it. The best thing is that the XP300 doesn't have the hiss that the surround of the early wired Turtle Beach P21 model had.UPDATE 6/13The inside of the left band, about 2 inches above the ear cup cracked. The outside started to crack. I contacted support. I had to give them the serial number and after doing so they gave me a Returns Authorization. I paid for shipping and they sent it back Fed Ex.

So it's been ~5 years since I tried any gaming system, much less a handheld (which I've always viewed as worthless from a gaming perspective).  Recently, I had a long business trip, and friends recommended the Nintendo DS Lite and Advanced Wars:  Dual Strike.  I bought both on their recommendation and I can honestly say it is a truly fantastic experience.  It made the trip fly by, I wasn't even interested in the movie or reading.  It even worked great to defuse my frustration about having to wait for an hour in a slow-moving security line.  In this review, I'll write about the system, and will post a separate review about the game.The Nintendo DS Lite blew me away.  The last handheld game system I tried was many years ago, also a Nintendo product I believe, and I hated it.  The screen was too small and too hard to see, etc..  This product delivers in spades.Screen brightness:  configurable and much, much better than previous systems.  The screens are gorgeous to look at and will be visible anywhere except possibly with the sun directly shining on the screen.Battery life was also a non-issue.  I still don't know the battery limit.  My record is ~12 hours on a single charge using the lowest screen brightness setting (still quite usable), and the system never complained about a low charge so for all I know it could last another 12.  It was more than enough to play virtually non-stop on a transcontinental flight w/no access to power.Boot time is lightning fast and makes this system extremely usable.  From off to playing is &lt; 15 seconds.  In addition, you can put the game to sleep by just closing the lid & have it instantly wake up when you open again.  This is a more important feature than it first seems, because it makes it possible to kill even as little as 5 minutes.Stereo music is also quite nice.  I recommend a tiny set of earbuds that can fit in a travel case for the game, but the speakers also work fine if you don't want to hassle with earbuds/headphones.You can have a GBA game cartridge and a (shockingly tiny) DS cartridge loaded at the same time.  In fact, this is used in some games, which unlock extra features in some newer games (including AW:DS mentioned above) and allow other cross-game interactions.  One potentially big downside is that you can no longer plug in your GB Color or older cartridges.  (So if you have old games you love, hold on to your older systems or buy a different Nintendo product to play them.)The touch screen worked flawlessly, but honestly, I don't prefer using it.  Until I try a game that makes great use of it, I'm just as happy using the direction pad and buttons.Local wireless support is a fantastic idea, but I never had a chance to try it.  You can download demos of games from game stores wirelessly, and you can play most games wirelessly, usually with just one cartridge for all players.  The Nintendo DS Lite also supports wifi I believe, but I haven't had a chance to try that either.  (Now if this thing could do email and calendar appointments...)All in all, I am very impressed with this system and recommend it to any game player (casual or serious) who needs to kill some time.  Works great on both buses for a daily commute and for transcontinental flights.Worst aspect?  I chose the black model and am very happy with it, but it does show fingerprints easily.  Maybe the white would look better?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2006"}

Preferring to be left alone to ply his trade, prophecies of an impending Dark Age dictate a different plan for the thief.

While there are some new features, much of the game has been kept the same as its predecessors.The game once again follows Garret, the eponymous thief, as he goes about stealing from particularly rich and wealthy victims. The game takes place in a fantasy medieval world, so in addition to guards and thugs of a more mundane variety there are also zombies, ghosts, various types of golem, and magical items.The game uses a first-person camera and focuses on stealth. The missions take place at night, so sticking to the shadows (hence the name of the game) and moving quietly are key. Guards will often stand near lanterns or hold torches, so approaching them from a spot where they can't see you is important. Garret has many tools that he can use on his mission, both magical and mundane. His melee weapons are the non-lethal blackjack and the dagger. His ranged weapons are much more diverse - apart from regular, deadly arrows, Garret can purchase water arrows (which extinguish lights), moss arrows (which can be used to soften otherwise loud surfaces), gas arrows (launches knockout gas), fire arrows (highly damaging, but also highly visible), and noisemaker arrows (make noise when they hit, and are used to distract guards). In addition to these, Garret also has many kinds of mines and grenades as well.Like the other games, Garret has many missions with various objectives, usually involving sneaking somewhere and stealing something. However, the ability to move around the city itself - instead of going from mission to mission like in old games - has been added. It's also possible to earn favor with either the Hammerites (a technological-based religious order) or the Pagans (a nature-favoring group, representing chaos to the Hammerites' law).The graphics are pretty good, especially in the field of lighting. With the brightness properly set (there is a test when you first play the game to ensure your lighting is right) the  atmosphere is definitely set. Light flickers through bars and windows, and avoiding it is very important to the gameplay; thus, it is well rendered. The human forms are not quite as good, but to be fair it is dark most of the time. The sound is pretty good, but there isn't any music that I could notice (because, well, it's a stealth game).As a whole, the game has done a good job of keeping the Thief franchise going. It's not particularly exceptional as its own game because it's continuing a tradition, but if you liked the other Thief games this one should not disappoint.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Lots of fun, but some confusing downers","reviewText":"FEAR 2 picks up jsut before the end ofthe first installation.

Fine details are crisp and clean, and everything is accounted for. Theres even a very plasuible explanation of all the unopenable doors in the various levels, a nice departure from \"you just can't go that way.\"Gameplay is extremely similar to FEAR 1. Armor, health, and weaponry remain equaivalent, with some nice new upgrades to various standbys. The AI behaves bizarelly though. One neat aspect is how you can kick over gurneys or tables or chairs to provide cover. The enemy does this frequently, and then decides they can't wait, and charges around it. Despite numerous flanking opportunities for flanks and ambushes, the AI doesn't match up to the box description you recieve.The horror is more startle and less tension, with creepy hallucinations and visions of Alma cropping up, especially after the second stage, but still manages to get your heart racing from time to time. It pales in comparison to Doom 3 or Silent Hill, but the game was supposed to be more action and less survival horror, so this is acceptable.All told, a good bang for the gaming buck.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Mark Gilbert","summary":"Use the Force Nintendo!","reviewText":"The wonderful graphic are not without backup, the game is a classic worthy of the history books, although some missions are difficult, if a game is to easy then it gets boring.

{"product_name":"B005YR308S","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"One of the most unique gaming experiences you'll have","reviewText":"I picked up heavy rain because it dared to do something bold and different, and despite a few missteps it did exactly that with aplomb. Heavy Rain tells a story centered around 4 characters, a ex-cop turned private investigator, an FBI profiler, a aspiring journalist, and a family man. The characters are all tied together in some way or another through the mysterious Origami Killer. I can't really say much more than that about the plot, not only because I don't want to spoil it but also because the story actually varies depending on your actions. The storyline is completely branching, and depending on your actions characters can actually die and thus give you a completely different ending than what I experienced. There can be clues missed when playing as the FBI profiler, or a fight lost as the private detective. Anything can happen, and it's all up to you to determine how your story will play out.I played the director's cut edition using the playstation move controllers, and frankly this is the BEST implementation I've seen of the Move controllers in a playstation game. Everything just feels so incredibly natural, such as moving one of the controllers towards the screen to reach for something, or literally swinging to throw punches, etc. Even if you don't have a move controller, the playstation 3's built in motion controls work well enough, and add a different sense of immersion by getting you involved. And trust me, the story on its own merits gets you plenty involved. I was literally without knowing it standing up and coming closer to the TV trying to make my way through a tense moment. And this sort of involvement is something I experienced multiple times throughout the game. It is just a compelling well-done narrative, and the folks at Quantic Dream get my hat's off for doing such a great job with the story and the fit and finish. The graphics are excellent, with very detailed character models. There is a certain lifelessness to them though when looking at their eyes, but it oddly enough tends to fit here because of the rather melancholic nature of the story. There are plenty of surprises, and being able to literally direct your own story gives this game great replayability. I've already recommended this title to all of my friends with a PS3, and definitely falls on my list of games to play. It's a fantastic playstation 3 exclusive that will give you a undoubtedly unique game experience unlike any you've had before. There's a reason this game won so many awards and sold several million copies, and I certainly agree with those sentiments.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2013"}

I haven't had any problems such as heat issues that others have reported.  It seems that microsoft intentionally allowed modding the Xbox so they could take ideas from the hacker / modder community for the 360 because the 360 is everything the xbox should have been and more.  OS interfaces seamlessly with games.  Built-in wireless controller support with no interference with Wi-Fi.  Use your own mp3 player to override the soundtrack in games while still getting the sound effects.  And the ultimate online interface, xbox live.  Seriously, I could go on and on about how great xbox live is.  The excellent interface of the 360 and the seamless interaction with xbox live easily makes the 360 the best of the next gen consoles.  PS3 is too expensive and has a weak online interface and the Wii doesn't even have a true online gaming interface yet.  The 360 is the best value by far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"citan-uzuki \"citan-uzuki\"","summary":"Typical Microsoft Product","reviewText":"There is absolutely no doubt that this is a Microsoft product.  It comes out of the factory full of defects.  The customer buys the product, takes it home, and discovers the problem.  The said customer calls for support.  Microsoft's first reaction is to try to put the blame on the customer.  After all, it surely must be the customer's fault that they're having problems.  Besides, to readily acknowledge a problem might mean more corporate money would have to be redirected to solving the issue.  The customer, like most people, politely and patiently persists and Microsoft finally listens and agrees to fix the problem.  And Microsoft's solution is not always the best possible, in terms of what is good for the customer.  Eventually, the boys from Washington wakes up and decides that they do indeed have a problem with their product.  And then they reluctantly put away the latest copy of WIRED magazine and get to work looking for ways to patch the problem.So now you say, \"Hold on Citan.  I'm looking to buy a console, not one of the Windows Operating Systems.  What are you doin' writing a Windows review here.  Please, I'm begging you.  Tell me about the XBox 360!  And please, make it quick before the boss walks in and sees me surfing the net instead of doing his work.\"My friend, I hate to break the news to you but I am indeed writing a review of the XBox 360!  And you know, brevity is not one of Citan's traits.  But I am sensitive to the fact that you might be reading this while you're at work and are risking the wrath of your boss.  So let me respond to the Big Question, now.Do I recommend the XBox 360?  No, not for the average gamer.  The hassle and aggravation that would result due to the console's high potential for breaking down are just not worth it.  Not for the average gamer.  You see, the average gamer is not extremely particular.  The typical gamer can find many games, from several different genre, that they can enjoy.  So, unless you are compelled to play Gears of War or any of the XB360 exclusive titles, my recommendation is to stay away from this console.  At least for now.  Who knows, the console might eventually become reliable after Microsoft applies a few more \"patches\" to the problems that plague their console.  But don't hold your breath.  Do keep this in mind.  Microsoft is still patching up Windows XP, for Pete's sakes!A new, redesigned version of the console will be released later this year.  And that version will use a cooler-operating processor that should help alleviate one of the 360's main issues: overheating.  It will also have a larger HD.  I recommend that you wait until then to make your purchase.Well, I am an optimists.  I can find humor under circumstances that would make the average person suffer a coronary.  This is a quality that helps me cope with my work, as a computer technician and a part-time public school teacher.  I knew before buying the 360 that the potential for hardware failure was very high.  Much higher than just about any consumer electronics product out in the market right now.  But, I am surprised that my brand new console lasted only one month!I rarely played games off of my 360's disk drive .  Mainly because I do not care for First-Person Shooters.  But I do download a lot of movies and television shows for viewing.  I also play a lot of arcade games.  Basically, my console has had gentle treatment.  One day, two weeks ago, my console started to lock/freeze up.  The picture on the screen was distorted.  It happened while downloading a movie.  I called Microsoft and ofcourse, got the Standard Response: \"Overheating usually happens because the customer fails to provide adequate ventilation\".  I then told them that mine is out in the open, on a wire rack.  Ventilation ain't the issue, Louie (the Microsoft Tech's name).  So the tech agrees to send a shipping box.  I was instructed to remove the HD and the faceplate.  I would be getting a refurbished unit, most likely.  I asked to be transferred to Live support, so I can get my spent points back.  The lady on the other end refused to give me back my points, at first.  Even though my purchased movie failed to download due to their crappy console.  She said it was against their policy to give back points until the customer receives his replacement console.  I asked if they will automatically credit them back once the replacement arrives.  She said \"no\", I would have to call again and request them again.  I refused to end the call and she finally agreed to give them back to me.I talked this over with my fellow computer techs.  Their advise was to ask the retailer for an exchange.  That way, I get a brand new console instead of a refurbished unit.  Besides, there are many customers who got their refurbished replacement and it did not work right out of the box.  Thankfully, I made the console purchase from here, Amazon.  Amazon customer service apologized for my troubles and agreed to ship me a brand new replacement.  It should arrive later this week.  All I can say is that Amazon customer service is awesome.  Thank you, Amazon.I had heard numerous issues with the console prior to purchase.  I knew that where there is smoke, there is fire.  But I am accustomed to dealing with hardware issues.  I receive, and make, a lot of technical support calls.  So this is normal for me.  But it may not be to you.  If you dread such things, then stay away from this console.  If you're comfortable with it, then that's fine.Are you buying for your children?  If so, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  Consider this scenario.  It's Saturday, you're looking forward to a relaxing day at home.  And then your child runs up to you in a state of total panic.  Being the good parent that you are, alarm bells suddenly go off in your head and you begin to inspect your child for possible signs of injury.  The child finally tells you that his brand new XBox 360 has broken down, right in the middle of his/her game!  Your jaw drops.  After you recover from your brief WTF moment, you agree to call Tech Support.  After the obligatory Q&A;, they agree to send you a shipment box, for the console's return to them.  And then they agree to send you a refurbished unit for replacement.  And now, you wait patiently.  YOU, wait patiently.  Meanwhile, five times everyday, you get the following refrain (sort of like what the raven says in that famous poem!) from your precious child, \"Is it here yet?\"All joking aside, if you simply must play the games that are exclusive to the 360, then make the purchase.  But do so from a retailer that would allow you to exchange the unit, when it fails.  Not all retailers will, according to Microsoft.Do I regret my purchase?  Not yet.  Thanks to Amazon's great customer service.  Also, I have the patience of Job.  I also have other consoles to use while waiting for the replacement.  And being a technician, I am used to dealing with technical issues.There is one other important lesson that I learned from this situation.  You see, one week after getting my console, I wrote a nice review of the console.  I gave it 5 stars for fun and a 3 stars for the overall.  Five stars for fun, because I liked being able to download movies and shows.  Three stars overall, for the console's potential reliability and build quality.  I would like to revise those ratings now.  And I will explain my reasons for lowering the fun rating.  The overall rating decrease should be obvious.  So what did Citan learn?  Basically, you cannot own a video game console for only one week and write an accurate review of its potential quality and reliability.  One week's experience is not enough.  I learned that.  I have now experienced those \"anecdotal\" problems that others have mentioned for myself.  That makes them more real, and not just someone's words.  On the same line of thought, I also did not want to rewrite the review on the same day of the problem.  Fairness, to me, to the XBox, and to you is important.I realize that the best way for me to get a lot of \"helpful\" points is to give the product a 5-star rating.  Giving this product, or basically any product, a low rating guarantees me a lot of \"unhelpful\" points.  You see, a lot of people who are reading these reviews are the so-called supporters of the console.  A lot of readers already made the investment and are just curious as to what others are saying about their baby.  And you've got people who have made up their minds and are just saving up for the big purchase.  They do not like to see low ratings for their chosen console.  But that is fine.  They no longer need the review.  You see, reviews are written for people who have not made up their minds.  Reviews are written as a service for the people who are still doing research. I can only hope that no one bought the console based on my original review.I lowered the fun rating because the hard drive is much too small for its intended purpose.  And honestly, a product's reliability will affect how fun it will be to own.  And unlike Windows, there are atleast two other alternatives to this product that are worthy of consideration.UPDATE 3/25It's been confirmed that a newer version of the console will be released in April.  It will have a 120gig HD, and HDMI output.  It will also come in black color.  My advice to you, if you are set on purchasing a 360, is to hold off and wait for the new version.  You see, I really do not believe that the problems with the current console have been corrected.  Plus, the upcoming version will be a much better value.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2007"}

I have played Rock Band, Karaoke Revolution and of course thousands of other video games - and I never excelled at anything like I am at this.  So, it is seriously fun for me as I zoom through the levels and pick up achievements.  But that's not the only reason I like it.The music is great, a variety of 70s disco, hiphop, reggae, and pop.  There are a huge variety of movements. The choreography is actually quite well put together!  There is a logical progression through the levels, and the choreography repeats itself often enough for you to learn it to the point where you don't need to reference the flashcards.  The movements really match the music, sometimes even the lyrics!Having all the achievements and levels is a fun motivator too.  I love games that let me unlock stuff, as I get a thrill from it, and getting achievements excites me too.  I guess that's why they add things to games - people need more than a fun playing experience sometimes - they need their little star chart...and I'm no different.I can say it compares strongly to the Wii dance game, whose name I've already forgotten.  That game was much less satisfying because the Wii doesn't have what the Kinect has - the ability to actually see you move.  It's not hard to dance with this game and they don't penalize you  much for missing a step, but they _can_ tell if you used the right arm and even if smaller body motions match the step.  I tested on the Merengue step - and the game can tell if you are moving your hips as well as your arms and legs.The silly feature to me is the FreeStyle, which I find interrupts my flow, and all the picture taking.  The Kinect games are obsessed with the camera feature.  I don't ever check the photos.  I don't like the sped-up version of my freestyle dance that they show.  I think the whole camera thing is a gimmick for now, until a game figures out how to really use it to play a game.In the next version, it would be nice if they made it like Rock Band where you can create a character's look and change clothes.  In this game, you have a pretty broad choice of characters to be and two outfits each- one has to be unlocked.  It's funny - I'm a girl but my favorite character to play is Mo.  He's funny and cool.  None of the girls really strike my fancy in terms of being like me - with maybe the Latina boxing girl being the closest.  all of the characters represent some funny dance- cultural stereotypes, from the far-out raver girl to the \"mean girl\" to the emo boy to the breakdancing b-boy.I love that you can download new songs.  I am satisfied with the selection right now but will probably be downloading songs.  In fact, when I hear songs on the radio, I now think - ooh, I hope they make that for Dance Central.Tonight I played for an hour and a half and I wasn't tired - could have kept going but the Xbox 360 was in demand by my spouse for Assassin's Creed II.  I could definitely see this game being a great way to get cardio in! Who needs a fitness game when you can dance?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001BNFQKO","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"GRRR Theft Auto","reviewText":"This has got to be the most frustrating game to try and set up, especially when after 4 hours trying to install it it wouldn't run properly.For starters, it took about an hour to install, and was annoyingly asking to swap from disc 1 to disc 2 to install, then finally it finished installing, and I thought, YEY, Finally I can play GTA 4... but no, I couldn't... it wanted me to download Windows Live Games, then register an account, ok, another half hour wasted downloading that, then it says you can not play this game unless you are signed in to windows live, or you won't be able to save your game or upload videos for whatever reason... ok, so I wasted an hour downloading and installing that stuff only for it to finish and tell me it needs to update some things for live.... sigh.... after another hour had gone by I thought I had everything done right, 3 hours trying to install this and that and I go to play the game, and what do you know? The graphics don't work.... so a link says, download the latest drivers here for GTA:IV.... so another hour goes by downloading the driver updates.... and what do you know? they don't work.In order for me to play this game, I will have to not update all the drivers and download all that stuff that I wasted 3 hours downloading, I need to upgrade the computer to the latest hardware in order to get it to work.... forget it.... judging by other reviews here that would be a waste of time and money, too.Why couldn't Rockstar develop a game that just installs once, and works? None of the other GTA games where so complicated, and why, why, why, WHY, do you HAVE to have Windows Live to play the game? What is the point of not being able to play the game OFFLINE, and save your progress to the HARDRIVES before you decide to try and play multilayer in a game that wont even run on the computer?Rockstar should be sued for making this gigantic mess, and forcing you to download and update because they have some deal going with microsoft to make a complicated enough install of a game that eventually you realize you are not going to be able to play anyway.I wish amazon.com didnt filter words, or i'd tell you exactly how I feel about this.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001TD6SN0","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"The one and only true Final Fantasy fighting game (Bradd's review)","reviewText":"Dissidia is the best Final Fantasy fighting game because it's the only FF dedicated fighting game. It can be played in Story Mode, Arcade or Online. I enjoy all three modes and I recommend it to all Final Fantasy fans and to those who love fighting games but not everything is perfect.GAME MODESIt all starts with a movie that that goes through every main character from every Final Fantasy game individually. If you do the Story Mode you can be one of 10 'good' characters and fight your way to the finish.When you play Online you can be a good character or play as the villains if you can afford to buy them for Perk points in the Perk shop.In the Arcade mode where you can earn Perc points and Gil if you fight well you can also be any of the 10 good characters or any of the 10 main villains.Any battle can be replayed but that's not it. Once the battle is over it can be saved and then edited and saved as a movie. This works in any mode: story, arcade or online.GAMEPLAYIs different form other fighting games in that you have to use a combination of melee and ranged attacks. This earns you Bravery points. The more Bravery you have the more life damage you do when you perform a primary attack. You can also collect EXO points on the battlefield to transform yourself into a stronger form and do an extremely powerful attack.You earn Perc points and Gil in the Arcade mode or in the Story mode and you can use them to buy equipment, summoning gems, cool costumes or to summon any of the 10 main villains.THE GOODS AND THE BADSThis is a fun and addictive game and I've been playing it every day for a few days already. I found the 'Teen' rating to be appropriate because anyone younger would find Dissidia hard to play.In my view, there are a few problems too. For example, you cannot play as Zack Fair form 'Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core' because he is considered a secondary character. It also takes some practice to get used to the battle system. Online battles can be glitchy sometimes with the game freezing for a second or two but that could be because of the Wi-Fi network.______________________________________________________Note: The above is mainly Bradd's review with me responsible for some edits.

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Yet another fumble by Electronic Arts.","reviewText":"For the past couple of years I've watched Electronic Arts, formerly one of the most reliable game companies on the scene, squander its reputation with game after game filled with relentless B.S.  I gave it another shot with Medal of Honor Frontline, because it was part of the franchise I'd played for a long time and I thought, how bad could it be?I should have remembered that the last two Medal of Honors I've played, Spearhead (for PC) and Infiltrator (for Gameboy Advance), both sucked.  Frontline was the first time since Medal of Honor Underground that I played this game on a console.  It should have felt like home -- instead, it felt like I was playing Spearhead without a mouse.  What caused them to mess up the control scheme so badly, I can't tell.  But now your character aims blindly thanks to a touchy-feely right analog stick.  I've had to do much more minute aiming adjustments in Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, targeting distant enemies in the head, and I found it even harder here, though the enemy is just several steps away from me.  From the first level, I bumbled about blindly because foolishly, the game designers now rely mostly on sound to let you know where to go.  Not that bad a thing, except they botched the sound mix.  Rule of thumb in sound mixing:  Music and effects should never, never drown out dialogue.  Here, your superiors' instructions are neatly covered up in the gunfire, overloud music, and ambience.  From the beginning, I had to run around the beach while under enemy fire, looking for scattered teammates who were supposed to be yelling and waving at me to reach them.  Well, I can't hear them, and since there's no radar, I had to rely on blind luck to find them.  A very dumb flaw, easily fixable, but neglected.  Did they actually *test* this thing on real players?As with 90 per cent of games these days, the lighting looks good, and the music is great.  But once again, this game qualifies as a good-looking, good-sounding product that flunks its grade on mechanics.  I don't feel like I'm in control of my character.  Nothing is more of a drag than that.  I should've listened to my instinct and passed on this one.  I regret even the reduced price I'd paid for it .  Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor Underground were such classics, it's baffling how EA managed to botch it all up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Carolyn \"Dedicated Yaoi Fan.\"","summary":"Whoa...","reviewText":"God this game was so cool - up until that chick Ashley turned up, that ruined it with her flashing her undies every single time.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Jan Parmelee","summary":"Great game with so so graphics.The game still is fun though.","reviewText":"Okay when I first heard about Super Mario Sunshine in August I thought it was going to better than it really is.

Very nostalgic, brutal, funny, and un-PC across the board; The Lost and The Damned offers a more hardcore experience, including little side on bike gang fights that reminded me somewhat of San Andreas and the turf wars; The Ballad of Gay Tony is more eccentric, colorful, and more of a throwback even so; the colors are brighter, there is a lot more neon, the free jumping is back from the tallest building you can find......the characters are really strange, but the story, as in TLAD, is very amusing.As always, there are lots of cool things to do; just driving around in the right car in the right weather with the right song can be fun in and of itself; Great new songs, TV shows, Radio Talk, funny billboards, great game cross references, and internet stuff.

Now PS3 has a 320 gig console bundle with plenty of space for all your audio, video, and gaming needs.The bundle is a perfect way to ensure that an active gamer has everything he needs to immerse himself in the fun. I've already reviewed the Move system separately and I enjoy it quite a lot. The camera is quite accurate and you can engage in quite active gameplay that keeps you exercised and entertained. Note that this bundle only comes with ONE controller so you'll want to buy at least one more, if not three more so that you can play with a friend head to head.There is of course a normal controller for sit-down-on-the-couch playing, and again you'll want to have a second one so a friend can play with you.We use our PS3 to stream Netflix movies in high quality video and love it as our main video machine. We also play regular DVDs and BluRay DVDs in it. Even though we own a Wii and XBox 360, it's the PS3 we are using most of the time.If you already have a smaller PS3, is this worth the upgrade? If you don't own a Move system already then I'd say definitely. I adore Move and think it's well worth the price. If you do already own a Move system, depending on how much you use the PS3, it could still easily be worth it to buy the bundle and then just resell the Move components. That larger disc space definitely comes in quite handy.Are there any down sides to the PS3? Certainly there's always the issues of what games are available on what platform. There are some games that simply are only available on the Wii or the XBox. That's why we own the other consoles. Also, I still lean towards the XBox having the best integrated online experience. XBox has simply done a good job with their Live implementation. But even with that being said, we use the PS3 far more than we use the other units. It runs more quietly. It has more features. If we see games on multiple platforms, we'll go for the PS3 version first.Well recommended to PS3 fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2011"}

I was frustrated th first few times I played and just couldnt figure it out. I didnt give up though and figured the controls out it just took me a couple of times looking and sounding really bad.  Has a lot of songs but a lot of them i have never heard of before.  I had heard of some of the artists but they where theit lesser known songs(guess they didnt want to pay the big bucks for the good songs).  The game follow you from a garage band to playing big venues.  It does have some rather demonic things in the game you play a guy with horns named Lou(as in lucifer) and other references to you becoming a rock god.

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"Stephen A. Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"This Isn't your Dad's Tactics Game....","reviewText":"To begin with, cast aside your doubts, oh ye who played the original Tactics on the PSX. Cast them aside and open your mind to the possibilities that a Tactics game could and DOES work on the GBA. As involving as this little game is, comparisons between the two would not do FFTA justice. This is a different game, different storyline, and a phenonmenal piece of gaming history all in it's own right. From the simple beginnings of Marche, you immerse yourself in a world of highly detailed combat, strategy, and intense blow-by-blow moves. Your troops can be customized to your liking. Don't like the Thief? Switch him to a Soldier. Need to customize? How about a Mage with Shield Break (from the Soldier's set)? This level of finesse deserves a bow to Square-Enix and to Nintendo. Remember, folks, FFTA is a strategy/RPG with heavy emphasis on the strategy portion. This is NOT FFX2! There is a storyline, yes, and it advances quite nicely at the finish of certain &quot;jobs&quot;, however, what it does NOT have is bottomless depth. All in all, however, any fans of previous Square titles, and even those that were fans of the original FFT, will find a worthy addition to their GBA libraries. Sound, gameplay, mechanics, it's all here. Enjoy your adventures in this compact world.  :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Jack R. Tallent","summary":"Fun and Immersive Shooter","reviewText":"GoW was the game I most looked forward to when I got my 360; so much so that I refused to play it until I got my HD home theater system in place.Now that I have completed the single player campaign on \"Casual\", I am ready to finish it on \"Hardcore\", a testament to the replay value of this game. (And that's not even touching on the multiplayer elements...)First of all, the game is beautiful. It takes full advantage of your High Definition display to render crisp, detailed environments. The game designers also make good use of the 5.1 surround, making the experience even more immersive.Gameplay is not overly complicated, and allows the player to do what he wants without too much problem. A VERY important aspect of gameplay is getting into cover, which is accomplished with a single button. The same button also allows various ways of getting out of cover. This, combined with the ability to shoot from cover, and \"active reload\", makes you feel like you're really fighting the Locust.The story line IS quite linear, although you are presented with branching choices at a few points in the game. You are also given very simple control of your squadron, although this does not seem to accomplish much.Speaking of your squad mates: they are ALWAYS injured and you have to go help them recover and get back into battle. This gets a tad annoying at times, and often you just fight on without them, as completing a stage always brings them back to health. I call this my \"victory is the best medicine\" strategy. Your squad mates are also a source of amusing dialog. (Cole's \"Hells to the no!\" is now part of my vernacular.)One of my favorite things about GoW is the design of the many building interiors you encounter during the story. They are simply works of art, and you will find yourself enjoying just looking at the environment.I have already mentioned \"active reload\", which at first seems like a trivial detail, but is actually an important part of the game. AR permits you to reload much faster by hitting the reload button a second time after a precisely timed interval. If you do not use AR, you just reload at normal speed. However, be aware that if you AR and FAIL, you reload REALLY slowly, which can mean your death when Locust are bearing down on you. It adds an element of realism, because it's really easy to screw up, or forget AR when a bunch of Lambent Wretches are bearing down on you.There are also plenty of Achievements to earn in GoW. Many of them are awarded for just completing the various Acts of the game at the various difficulty levels (Casual, Hardcore, Insane). There are some fun ones based on gameplay elements, such as active reload skill, or killing certain boss creatures, etc. There are some Achievements awarded for collecting \"COG\" tags, which are dog tags shaped like little gears. COG tags mark the locations where soldiers have fallen fighting The Locust, and they are hidden in 30 locations throughout the game. This is a fun detail, and encourages you to completely explore your environment, rather than just completing the levels and moving on. Some of them are pretty hard to find, and, to date, I have only collected 25. I like the COG tags.A few minor gripes. The grenade throwing in the game is actually pretty cool; you hold down the left trigger and you see the trajectory, complete with bounces, your grenade will take when you throw it. The problem is you often cannot see where the trajectory will take your grenade because you are looking UP at the arc. Since where the grenade will land is pretty much what you care about, this is a little annoying. Another annoyance is that sometimes the getting into/out of cover can be a bit of a pain. Often time you are frantically trying to get into cover only to go into a headfirst dive roll into the wall you are trying to get into cover behind. Sometimes you get stuck on cover you don't want.These are minor quibbles, however. This game has everything: lots of cool weapons, lots of cool monsters, lots of cool levels, lots of achievements. Heck it even has the obligatory \"Driving a Vehicle Now\" level. (Is there the obligatory Lava Level? There must be...) Also, the game is sufficiently challenging for ANYONE. I initially jumped right to Harcore (cause I think I'm Hardcore) but I was getting killed in the TRAINING LEVEL. It may, in fact, be impossible to beat the game on Insane without a partner.Anyway, you will get your money's worth on the single player campaign alone. Then there is the MULTIPLAYER aspect, which I will not even touch on here. Needless to say, if you have a 360, this is a must-own game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2007"}

The shooting mechanics and gameplay are much better than uncharted ga but there is no storyline here. The only complaints I have for this game include:1. Too easy.  I platinumed this game in about 2 or 3 weeks max. I would have done it in 1 week but I had to max out operatives and it sounded like too much work so I went to other games instead. I finally got the platinum this morning (and I ordered the game around September 1st).2. Sometimes the ai is dumb. One example is when I played hvt wizard. I got to the last part of the level and I was killing enemies down a long hallway. The next enemy to run up would look down the wrong way to the wall then the obvious place of where I was located. Why he would turn towards the dead end wall instead of down the hallway is beyond me. And about 5 enemies in a row do this. The ai is not always like this but in some parts they are. They are also inconsistent. Sometimes I would take down an enemy with a silencer and enemies down the stairs would hear me and other times they wouldn't.these complaints are very very minor though and I think the game is amazing.  I hope a second one is made.  I did not have any of the freezing or crashing issues other people reported. I think the fw upgrade and unit 13 software upgrade took care of this.  I would definitely recommend to other people.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2012"}

Encounter valuable allies and dangerous enemies on Wayne&#x2019;s search for the truth.","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"Thawing out the old school","reviewText":"Capcom, you've done it again!  The developer that brought us Resident Evil continues its excellence in the next generation.  In an industry that is relying more and more on realism and sequels, Capcom bucks the trend.  First they graced the 360 with Dead Rising, the most original horror game in years, and now they've outdone themselves with the delightfully old-school shooter called Lost Planet: Extreme Condition.The concept of bosses is a gaming convention, and in my opinion, one that should never be forgotten.  There's nothing quite like the experience of outwitting and outgunning an overpowered enemy that is your superior.  Let's face it, a good boss will usually squash you multiple times as you desperately try to figure out its weaknesses and patterns.  The feeling of victory becomes that much sweeter as a result.  Unfortunately, the boss has started to lose its popularity in favor of a more cinematic, realistic experience, especially when it comes to shooters.  Thankfully, Lost Planet reminds us just how majestic boss fights can be, in jolting, electrifying fashion.There's nothing overly complicated about LP's plot.  Main character Wayne is found frozen in the wastelands of E.D.N. III, a planet that humans are trying to colonize.  The local life forms, known as Akrid, take offense to the human invasion, and fight back.  Wayne's father is slain early on by a particularly menacing Akrid called Green Eye, and Wayne is off on a mission of revenge, despite his amnesia.  That's basically it.  The story serves only as a device to set up the gunplay.Some have called LP a next-gen Contra; a 3D version of a 2D side-scroller.  In many ways, that's accurate:  your goal is to run from one end of the level to the other, killing everything in your way.  Barring your path to the next level is a boss, which you must defeat to advance.  Capcom throws a couple of interesting elements into the mix: a grappling hook that can be used to scale snowdrifts, ice walls, and structures, and a constantly shrinking timer linked to Wayne's life that must be refilled by destroying enemies.  These are interesting additions, but Lost Planet is unashamed of what it truly is: a run-and-gun shooter in which you must kill them before they kill you.The highlight of the game, and the reason to buy it, is the gorgeous, menacing bosses.  There's no way I'll spoil any of them for you, but rest assured that they are some of the most spectacular, memorable, intense, and downright fun experiences you can have on the 360.  They have no mercy, and ask for none.  They will come in all shapes and sizes, and all are pattern-based with weak spots, just like the bosses of old.  They will give you a sense of wonder at their beauty, and will cause your killer instinct to boil.  Your thumbs will ache as you make yourself become a master of the unusual controls, vehicles, armored suits, and weapons in order to defeat them.  Forget tactifully ordering a squad of elite commandos, levelling up your party, or trying to stealthily hack computers: these are knock-down, drag-out virtual firefights of the highest order.Needless to say, Lost Planet wraps these uncomplicated wonders in some of the best graphics seen to date.  Capcom is not only a master of design, but also of technology.  The explosions and smoke are comparable with Gears of War's.  The frozen wastelands have an identity to them that is unmistakable and haunting.  No slowdown or camera problems to hinder your viewing pleasure, either.  A game set on an ice cube might sound boring, but this is one of the most striking settings that's been produced.Multiplayer is passable, but not exciting.  To be honest, it didn't seem like it was the focus.  If you have any interest in playing an old-school shooter with a new-school coat of paint, Lost Planet belongs in your collection.  Its basic nature is incredibly refreshing, and believe it or not, satisfying.They don't make em like this too often anymore - enjoy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, AGAIN, WITH THE BEST OF ITS KIND SINCE CRYSIS 1","reviewText":"((INTRO))Far Cry 2 was, while commercially successful, divisive game by Ubisoft that failed to recapture the magic of the original PC exclusive Far Cry (not the various console spin-offs), while Crytek, the developers of Far Cry, moved on to Crysis that revived and improved upon the spirit of Far Cry under EA (Of course Crytek later ran into a similar dismay with Crysis 2).After several botched attempts to rekindle the popularity of their old franchises such as Silent Hunter, Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell, alongside the annual milking-fest of Assassin's Creed and huge backlash of 'Always-Online' DRM fiasco, the name Ubisoft is not exactly synonymous with creative change and progress.Far Cry 2 was far cry from 'Far Cry' not because the setting was changed from tropical jungle to African jungle, but because the game was a drag to play and never maintained the consistent flow with tension and excitement from gameplay.  The color palette was washed out and heinously brown, the world felt lukewarm and monotonous.  And realistic but ultimately tedious chores that emulated the real life like far drive travel methods, cars breaking down for maintenance, guns jamming, malaria and it was a good FPS but a disappointing game at the same time that forgot how to be a fun game.Is Far Cry 3 any different from 'business as usual' approach by the developers slash publishers who's been doing just that for better part of the past 10 years?  Let me just say it out loud; Far Cry 3 is exactly the kind of the first person shooter for people who enjoyed the original Far Cry and Crysis.((THE GAME))The game starts with action right away just like the first one instead of puking and passing out over and over like the second one.  You are an ordinary every man, a young college kid named Jason Brody and you are stranded in the pirates-infested remote Rook Islands with your brothers and friends after skydiving gone wrong and captured by a despicable psychotic pirate leader named Vaas.  With no formal combat training, you narrowly escaped with your life and healed by a local named Dennis Rogers, and you slowly learn to be an efficient killer and take down all the pirates and Vaas and slowly reveal the politics of the Rook Islands that harbors a few intriguing plots that involve the handful of colorful characters and endless humanoids to kill.The setting is moved back to the tropics, but this time, you are given the whole islands without any barrier instead of the sectioned off areas like the first one.  And the game world is a huge open world consisted of two big islands and the vicinity with diverse topography and some unique landmarks and set pieces crowded with enemies and wild animals everywhere.  There are also many indoor, underground and underwater actions, and plenty of intense scripted big set piece moments.How refreshing is that there is a FPS that you cannot always go Rambo on?  While the gunplay is rock solid and action is just as intense, you cannot always run and gun in Far Cry 3.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of gun-toting action.  But you must learn to be stealthy.  In fact, running and gunning straight up would very often ends with your death.  Stealth has to be your preferred Modus Opperandi if you want to survive for long.  Luckily, the stealth approach is just as competent and rewarding as all out gunning approach.  Each encounter with enemies is fight for your survival.  You must learn how to use everything at your disposal to plan your route, something that was severely lacking in Far Cry 2.  You need to survey your surrounding using your camera and methodically plan your course of action sneaking using your knife and bow or sniper rifle to shave off the enemy number, then with the perfectly timing all out shooting to maximize the damage.  There can be many different methods of killing enemies using environment and wild animals.  Enemy A.I. is very relentless.  You wouldn't know how many times I wishfully uttered 'Cloak engaged, maximum armor' repeatedly.  All in all, the gameplay feels much more tight and the main story is focused and scripted as if in linear corridor shooters, and that is a good thing.Unlike the second game, it makes so much more sense to go around killing bad guys and cause mayhem and destruction precisely because you are stuck in isolated islands from the rest of civilization with those bad guys, and you gotta do what you gotta do to survive and escape from this hellhole.  No more convoluted inter-factions politics, just actions, and no more monsters / aliens / zombies twist in the second half, thank you so much for that.  You have several travel modes such as hang-glider, para-wings and parachute, many different vehicles and boats available.The story is interesting, if nothing special, but it's also grittier, more violent and serious than the tongue in cheek campy first Far Cry.  You will encounter several surreal drug-induced hallucination and psychological trips throughout the main story mission like Max Payne dream sequences or Arkham Asylum Scarecrow sequences.  They wisely focus on the pure unadulterated FPS action with breakneck pace using much restricted and guided linear progress within the main storyline.  Between each mission, you are free to roam around the open world.  You can liberate the entire islands section by section by climbing up the radio towers in the world and survey each area, doing so opens up your map to reveal key locations in the given area, a la Assassin's Creed.  Once you take down the area strongholds and clean up the bandits, the area become friendly.  Opening up the map also makes many different weapons and equipments available and new side activities.  Then you can engage in side quests and activities such as hunting, wanted reward, assassination, gambling, racing, etc.  What stands out with all the side activities is that they all directly reward you with leveling up.The robust crafting system lets you expand the various inventory capacities by hunting various wild animals scattered throughout the world.  Weapons customizations are very diverse and deep.  You gain XP points by killing hostiles and completing objectives, then you allocate those points to open up different skill perks and level up your abilities in form of ancient tribal tattoos.  Action and maneuvering vehicles are very realistic and intense.  The game world is bigger (10 times) than Far Cry 2, which was already huge, but it's also so much easier and fun to explore, thanks to many moving vehicles and fast travel system at all the safe houses you unlock.The graphics are very impressive, among the best with Crysis series and Just Cause 2 on PC, with DirectX 11 compatibility and all the bells and whistles of PC specific options.  Far Cry 3 Looks majestic on PC when you max all the possible options.  Unfortunately there's no destructible environment, a minor letdown.  The game also comes with a very competent map editor, just like the previous two and the first Crysis.((DRM))One time online activation via UPLAY, another proprietary DRM like STEAM and EA ORIGIN.((OUTRO))Ubisoft rectified all the shortcomings of Far Cry 2 by bringing back the core elements of Far Cry 1, infusing the things that worked in Far Cry 2 into Far Cry 3, and came out as a winner.  It's  now EA and Crytek's turn to correct the course with Crysis 3 to recapture the essence of Crysis 1 and Far Cry 1.If you are a shooter fans but are looking for something different from the annual slugfest between Call of Duty and its wannabes and are more keen to first person action games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, No One Lives Forever, Far Cry 1 and Crysis 1, look no further; this is the game you want to play.  In my opinion, Far Cry 3 is not only better than Far Cry 2, but also better than Far Cry 1 and up there with Crysis, minus destructible environment and the nano-suit (oh, how I miss the suit), but Far Cry 3 does many things Crysis doesn't.With a long, focused story progress and single player story campaign that last 20 to 30 hours, huge open world environment with bunch of side activities, intense and smart first person shooting action, nice stand-alone co-op story campaign that lasts 4-5 hours and fun multiplayer modes, Far Cry 3 redeems the franchise and Ubisoft from the past sins, if briefly until the next 'all-too-familiar' fiasco that will surely happen unless Ubisoft goes through the fundamental changes.  But I am feeling very forgiving and immensely enjoying Far Cry 3 to think ahead that far for the moment.  Far Cry 3 is the most impressive first step toward the redemption, and a great sign for things to come.  Terrific job, Ubisoft!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

Donkey Country had it all. Flawless, clean and sometimes breath taking graphics and effects to complement the endless arrays of level by level challenge and outstanding game play.The many bonus levels intrigued you and challenged you to be your best. The animal companions gave you an extra incentive to play because the Swordfish, the Rhino and the Frog made it that much better and that much fun.The other thing that really revolutionized action/adventure type games was Donky Kong Country's boards and levels because none were exactly the same. Each board had it's individual quirks and perks and each board gave you that needed challenge that other action/adventure type games lacked at the time.You could not put this game down. Me, personally, after 8 months after this game's release, I was still playing it because it was still that good (that and I was determined to play a perfect game and clear all the boards including the bonus levels).This was the first installment of the newly revived series and it was a MUST NEED and still is. I would definately recommend this series to anyone and for those of us Triple Crowners (own the PS2, X-Box and Gamecube), I would definately stop all of the other games I was doing when the next installment of the Donky Kong series came to the home system.

The new pokemon look awsome. There a lot of better things in the game then the previous pokemon games. Example, TMs are use unlimited rather then use once. If you have internet you get to transfer to Pokemon dreams and see new stuff. There is only one bad thing about the game and that is as you level up it is even harder to continue to level your pokemon in one area because as you level up the experience you gain from the pokemon you defeated decreases rather staying the same like the other games. Counts for trainer battles to. So example you receive 32 experience points for defeating a level 4 pokemon while your pokemon is at level 7. Once it levels up to 8 you suddenly  receive only 28 or 29 points for defeating that same pokemon. It continues to decrease as your level increases. However, if you defeat a pokemon at a higher level then yours, you receive more experience than you would in other pokemon games. Other than that, this pokemon game is a must.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

Denick","summary":"\"The time is near at hand which must determine whether Americans are to be free men or slaves.\" -George Washington","reviewText":"I am a longtime fan of this series (as well as third person action titles like \"Uncharted\", \"Gears\", and \"Resident Evil\"), and I have played every \"Assassin's Creed\" entry that has appeared on consoles. AC3 is my favorite of the bunch, surpassing even the debut of Ezio in Renassaince Italy three years ago. Though some \"sandbox\" fans may lament the fact that the game keeps you on a rather tight leash for the first few hours, I feel that the story is so stunningly presented, and your missions so riveting to execute, there is little to complain about. You'll soon be given the opportunity to either stick closely to the engrossing narrative, or to roam about in the fascinating sandbox (and in true AC style, there are a few surprises revealed during those early hours that are a thrill to take part in).The setting of the Revolutionary War is fascinating, particularly for fans of early American history. I found the story to be highly engaging, and I couldn't wait to see what came next. The game controls beautifully in every aspect, from free climbing to combat. Controls are so responsive and intelligently implemented (following the AC pedigree, but refined to their best incarnation yet), I'm generally not even conscious of the controller in my hand. From a technical perspective, the graphics, sound, and voice acting are among the best of this console generation, if not the very finest. A great attention to detail can be seen in elements such as the shadows, the snowfall... even the pores of characters' faces are realistically rendered.But there's more to AC3 than the measurable assets. There is something about the way in which the entire package comes together to create something intangible, something truly rare. In the shoes of Connor (and others), I hear the snow crunching beneath the soles of my feet as I traverse this wilderness of the northeast and the textured surface of Boston's cobblestone streets. Far beyond that, however, I can FEEL it... this game has so thoroughly immersed me, it is as if I have been transported to another time, another place, and into the shoes of other human beings... I feel as though I have truly assumed the role of the characters, embarking upon an incredible adventure.I realize it's fiction, of course, but I feel as though I am actively taking part in one of the most remarkable events in the history of mankind, shaping the world as we now know it. The goal of games is to create experiences for the players that would otherwise be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality. In that regard, AC3 is a great success. I have been able to lose myself in its experience, and every moment spent in Connor's shoes has been enjoyable. It is one of the finest games I have ever played, and the scope of its vision and ambition has left me stunned.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000R37S78","description":"More Information Coming Soon.","reviewerName":"AlexJouJou","summary":"Extreme fun to feed my RPG addiction!","reviewText":"Jeanne D'Arc is a fabulous game. Everything about it just shines. It is true it doesn't stretch the genre (Tactical RPG) or provide anything really new or innovative. That's o.k. with me because I just wanted to have loads of fun with a game and not with figuring out a new idea or concept. After Avalon Code for the DS (which was very new, unique, and innovative although not a tactical game) I was ready for some good old fashioned tactical gameplay. Jeanne delivers in spades.The graphics are excellent. The cut scenes were extremely well done to include the voice acting (not so much common in RPG's). The story was interesting--it started off more historical but then threw a bunch of fantasy components in--so those who want a true historical game will be disappointed. Killing trolls, ogres, and mages? Count me in as I'm all sorts of good with that.Gameplay is truly where this beauty of a game shines--the controls are exceptionally tight. The menu and battle systems are top notch--clear, easy to understand and use, and fairly intuitive. My only (admittedly minor) complaints would be shopping for equiptment and weapons requires you to use the L/R button to scroll through characters and feels a bit awkward at first and that sometimes the little box on the left (your characters stats and info) that appears on the screen when you select that character for movement obscures your view of the field (they would have been better putting it on top left instead of bottom left).I found it easy to get into--with a little more \"meat\" than some others--there is some story you have to get through the first hour or so and I recommend when you start you allocate like 2 hours for play time. After that it is not difficult to pick up and play for whatever period you can--there are regular saves on the map and a quick save in battle. A note that, like other tactical RPG's, the battles can be short 10 minute affairs or longer 25-40 minute affairs--depends on a variety of factors so consider this aspect as well.The difficulty level is not really high--but there were places where underleveling could cause you major issues. I had a very tough time with the escort mission around Stage 10 but I went and leveled up and then it became doable for me.At the current pricepoint this game would be my top pick (along with the 2 Star Ocean games and Brave Story) for the PSP in the field of RPG that someone without a ton of RPG experience should pick up. Do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2009"}

With the original DS being launched on November 21, 2004 this makes the fourth model in 6 years. That's 2 per year with a fifth model due out at the end of the year. I feel that this is what the DS should have originally been, but I guess the technology wasn't quite there yet.Techno JumboAs always I'm going to go in depth on comparing  few models. The DS has two processors the ARM9 and 7 which control each screen. The DSi XL has the same hardware as the DSi, but it's significantly different than the DS Lite. The DSi hardware has the ARM9 running at 133 MHz which is twice as fast as the ones in the original DS and Lite which were at 66MHz. The processors are also smaller which in turn uses less power. The DSi has more RAM at 16 MB which is four times as much as previous models (DS Lite and the original only had 4MB). The upgraded hardware allows for smoother game play and games can look better and do more thanks to this.The biggest thing about the XL is well...it's bigger. It sports two 4.2' screens which is 1.2' inches larger than the original DS and Lite. Does this make a huge difference? Oh yes you bet. The XL also has two 0.3 megapixel cameras that are on the DSi. There is also an SD storage slot that can hold up to 32GB cards. The DSi also has internal flash of up to 256MB unlike the first two models. This allows for downloads from the DSiWare store.So this makes the DS a powerhouse compared to the last two models. The speakers are louder and are more clear and this is a huge steal at $190.New LooksThe XL doesn't just have new looks on the outside, but on the inside as well. The new DSi firmware allows a Wii like menu that allows you to select your games on a horizontal list. You can also press L or R to take pictures on the fly which is a nice touch. The first two DS models had a simple interface that allowed you to select your game and go into the options. In the DSi software you can press the power button the reset the DS and go back to the main menu unlike the first two models. The power button is also on the inside, but thankfully, away from accidentally hitting it. The DSi also allows for updated internet security and a faster wi-fi chip.Another thing you'll notice is the larger pen sized stylus, but there is the mini toothpick built in as well. One major thing gone is the GBA slot, but this isn't all so bad since you can buy any GBA model for under $20 now. This sacrifice had to made to fit the cameras, SD slot and flash memory. You do have to realize, however, that the first two DS models had actual GBA hardware in it and wasn't software emulated (downloadable GBA games anyone?)The ExperiencePlaying the DSi XL is sublime. I have fairly large hands so seeing the huge screens not only is easy on the eyes, but also the hands. The longer larger frame of the console gives you more handle and control on what you're doing. Using the pen sized stylus also helps and I feel I have more freedom. Everything looks bright and crisp on the excellent TFT LCD screens and the 4 different brightness settings help this a lot (unfortunately there is no button for this). The games sounds sharp and even more clear than other models. When playing the same game on the DS Lite you notice sounds on the XL that you couldn't hear before unless you had headphones.I also have to mention the cameras. They aren't great (lower end cell phone quality), but it's pretty decent in good light. The browser also is not that good. Using the same Opera browser from the Wii the DSi browser is slow and doesn't support Flash. It couldn't even load this site very fast. The DSi browser is a good concept, but if you have a cell phone or laptop stick with that. Another thing that I was disappointed in was that you can't save your game saves to the SD slot...maybe a future update will allow this.The DSiWare store is easy to use and familiar if you have a Wii. Unfortunately there nothing but shovelware on the store (with a few slight exceptions), but hopefully some good games will follow. The system also comes pre-installed with two Brain Age games (reviews will follow soon). The battery seemed to last several hours for me as well even when playing system heavy games. The DSi XL is a perfect investment for anyone who has a DS. If you own any other models (even the DSi) trading that in towards an XL is probably the smartest thing you can do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Taking a page from Dawn of the Dead, you play as freelance photojournalist Frank West, and you have 72 hours to get your story and get out of the zombie-infested mall that you now find yourself in.  What makes Dead Rising so much fun is the sheer number of ridiculous and bloody ways you can take out your zombie attackers, using just about anything you find in the mall as a weapon.  The mall itself is wonderfully designed as well, as it always seems as if there is something new to discover.  The game's story is intriguing as well, offering a bit of satirization of the current political climate, and the little touches in the game, from being able to take pictures to the buckets of blood, are fantastic.  What hurts Dead Rising is the handful of technical issues that really mar what is otherwise a would-be spectacular game.  The escort missions, which you will be taking part in quite frequently, are annoying more than anything else, mainly due to the fact that the AI of those you're escorting is less than flattering.  Also, the game's save system is frequently glitchy, and often detracts from the game's real time world and structure.  Flaws aside however, Dead Rising offers much to enjoy; from great graphics and voice acting to some nice homages to classic zombie movies, the game is a real treat.  All in all, Dead Rising is one of the best and original third-party experiences to find on the XBox 360, and if you've missed out on it so far, you should definitely give it a look at the very least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2008"}

This game is beautiful, plain and simple, but some mid-ranged major issues prevent it from being absolutely flawless.On the positive side the game is, as I said, very well made.  The environments are beautiful (as beautiful as multi-console games can be,) everything from the dark tombs to the lush gardens are well rendered and always seem to capture the essence of the moment.  The games combat system is in many ways second to none, the special moves (i.e. jumping off walls) are indespensiable when dealing with multiple enemies, and the games most unique features allow you to rewind (this is limited however) and even slow time.  The enemy AI is well done, because most of the game you are fighting zombies there isn't an incredible amount of intelligence to be expected, but, the enemies do have a \"class\" system, while the weaker zombies are easier to take and much stupider, the higher up and much better equipped enemies can be a real chore to dispatch.  The storyline to the game, while not ground breaking, is gripping and keeps you fully involved in your character, the prince.  Camera angles ocassionally lose focus, but can be easily repaired with the touch of a button, hats off to the development team for including that.However, as I said it isn't perfect, it has a few issues, some of whom keep the game from being 5 stars.  Let's start with the games puzzles.  I mentioned earlier that the developers put alot of care into the game, including the puzzles, but that's the problem, they put so much effort into them they're at times near impossible.  I'm proud to say I never used a walkthrough to figure out any of the puzzles...that goes without saying that some of these puzzles, especially the infamous Hall Of Mirrors, can end up taking you an hour or two or three or four...While a  very hard challenge makes a great game, some of these challenges  will make even the greatest reasoner scream out in fury.  Keep in mind not all the puzzles are like this, just a select few, most of them are very challenging yet very rewarding.The other problem? One word: Farrah.  Your faithful companion for most of the game is Farrah, while I wont give any details so as to let you discover the story on your own, she is your \"wingman\" so to speak, through almost all of the game.  The character isn't the problem, protecting her is.  During combat sequences you may face 6 or 7 enemies at once, Farrah will usually assist with a bow and arrow, sounds great right? Wrong.  Farrah is the most incompetent friendly AI I have ever come across, as soon as she's attacked she begs you for help, causing you to break away from any current engagement to save her useless ass.  What's more is either she gets killed or you do while trying to save her, causing many rewinds and many retry's not to mention words uttered at her expense that Amazon will not let me repeat.But, all in all, this is a very solid game, one of my favorites in a long time.  If you enjoy a solid action/adventure platformer then I highly recommend this title, you wont be dissapointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"This fun romp Retains core Fundamentals from the First and manages to Improve many things but not without a few Flaws.","reviewText":"Let me start out this review by stating that I really enjoyed inFamous, that game was pure sandbox-super-hero game genius.  It opened up sandbox world gaming to me and while its' graphics didn't wow anyone and it often got repetitive, it was one of the most engaging stories and interesting games that I have ever played.I'm happy to report that inFamous 2 takes everything you loved from the first and improves on it in every way. However, this does not come without a few flaws.  The game seems totally rebuilt, though I'm not sure whether they used the same or a different engine to run the game it feels much like the first.  Many things are the same, blast shards, dead drops, jumping, grinding, blasting, electrocuting, it's all here and it's all totally fun, yet it looks and feels different in a new-fun way.Presentation: Much like the first inFamous, this game doesn't really even have menus but instead just launches you into the story and the game itself.  I'm glad the graphic-book comics are back. The new beautiful cut-scenes add a nice touch to tell the story as well.Gameplay: This game plays almost identically to the original Infamous.  New Marais is yours to explore in standard open world style, though getting around is easier off the bat because grinding the power lines is available from the get-go.  You collect blast shards, dead drops, save people, kill people, complete story missions and side missions.  The missions have you do a variety of tasks that usually involve some form of destruction.  However, the amount of skills Cole acquires throughout the game makes these encounters thrilling and interesting not to mention the overall variety of your objectives.Storyline: Basically Cole is looking to amp up his powers so he is ready to face the Beast (as mentioned in Infamous).  That's pretty much the whole gist of the storyline.  While not perhaps as interesting as the first Infamous, anyone already familiar with the characters will want to see how their story plays out.  I haven't beaten the game just yet but I find certain elements a little unnerving, like the random monsters who have little-to-no explanation.Graphics: The graphics are perhaps the best feature of the game.  They look stunning.  The swamps, the buildings, the character models all look really really good.  Everything is gorgeous though it doesn't look as good as Uncharted 2 or Red Dead Redemption.Sound: The music does a good job setting the tone and the mood without being overly noticeable.  The sound effects of Cole's powers are really well done and much improved (and varied) from before which is one of the first things I noticed.  You'll notice seemingly less ambiance noise which is odd for a city as organic as New Marais.  Empire City had the elevated train, more honking from cars and more \"city life\".  New Marais can be awfully quiet in spots.Gripes:First, as you might have heard, the camera struggles many times throughout the game.  I have yet to experience a death that was caused by the wacky camera but please note that it freaks out in tight spaces as well as big spaces, there's probably no avoiding it.  Second, you don't start off with ALL your powers no matter what you import from your original inFamous save.  Having read/heard you could keep your powers, I found this particularly upsetting.  I'm half way through the game and my megawatt hammer is still MIA as is my polarity shield, my lightning storm made a brief appearance but has since been replaced by something that is far less cool-destructive.  I think I could totally get over this fact other than the many reports I heard/read that stated we'd get ALL our powers from inFamous.Conclusion:The graphics are amazing.  The gameplay is as solid if not more-so than the first inFamous.  Your powers are enjoyable, the environments are stunning, the missions are more varied than the first.  It's enjoyable and worth every penny.  New powers have replaced old ones allowing you to feel like an amazing Jedi Knight or something like that, picking up cars and throwing them at a dumb helicopter is extremely satisfying.  This game is very fun, and I'm really glad I picked it up despite my few gripes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"inFamous Too","reviewText":"What a disappointment inFamous 2 is. If you liked, wait...check that...loved inFamous 1 as much as I did you probably already own this and you are either like me (disappointed) or you're completely thrilled to be able to play what is essentially just an expensive new map pack for inFamous 1.While inFamous 2 has the same great visuals and action that its predecessor has, its story leaves much to be desired. But the biggest frustration is that it's like playing inFamous 1 all over again facing the obstacles, puzzles and worst of all hordes and hordes of mutated enemies. It was all fresh and new with inFamous 1, but it just seems all so familiar and repetitive with inFamous 2.And just like a comic book hero, don't you just know that at some point they always write in an episode or chapter where the hero loses his powers? I hate that. That's how you start inFamous 2. The game actually recognizes that you played and completed inFamous 1 and grants you your powers for an initial battle. But you quickly get stripped of those and have to start from scratch building your powers and abilities.For some vet inFamous 1 players this all might sound like just what they were looking for in a sequel. But the feeling of \"Oh, man, not again\" was the overhanging sentiment in my head as I played only about a quarter of the way through the game.I know, I know...you're gonna chastise me in my comment section for writing a review without completing the game. But my point is exactly that: I feel like I am done with inFamous 2...like I've already played it and I just stopped midway through a second (or third) playthrough.So that's my warning with this review: inFamous 2 is a good game, but if you've played inFamous 1 expect nothing more than some new maps with some different looking enemies thrown in. If you've not played inFamous 1, clickHEREand buy it...don't buy inFamous 2 if you've not played the first; inFamous 1 is original and exciting from start to finish; this is just inFamous 'too'.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing.

Actually, the thoughts I had of putting a gun in my mouth were much more entertaining than this piece of shiz. I mean seriously, at least if I put a gun in my mouth I get to have complete control of the gun and where the bullet ends up. The latter statement brings me to my main point, and that point being, if I can't control the aiming process of my gun then what am I actually doing? Why do the gaming companies feel like they have to cater to people by implementing a lock on aiming system rather than a manual one. It completely takes the fun out of the entire experience. Whats truly amazing about this game is the fact that even with automatic aim implemented it's still a freaking hard game!

The music and voice acting are flawless, and the vibrant, cartoony graphics bring Springfield to spectacular life. For all its charms, there are a few problems.

During platform-based missions, the controls fall apart, and the camera gets stuck too easily. In the car, the map display is practically useless.

After achieving worldwide sales success and awards for both the originalMetal Gear SolidandMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty, series creator, Hideo Kojima combines the essence of both games into one unique experience.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Simply Amazing!","reviewText":"When I first saw the remake of Resident Evil for GameCube one of my biggest hopes was that Nintendo would pursue remakes of other classic Playstation games for their system, and then seize the games (like they did with Resident Evil, with only Spin-off titles hitting other consoles). I hate to admit it, because I am an avid hardcore cross platformer, but deep down I'm still a Nintendo loyal, and I wanted Nintendo to take back what it lost last generation to Sony. I had hoped to see remakes of Silent Hill 1, ports of SH2, 3, and the forth-coming 4, and remakes or ports of the entire Final Fantasy series. Needless to say that the announcement of Crystal Chronicles had me in tears (not literally) over what might have been... At least Nintendo got one of the many Playstation games I'd like to see brought to their system... and it's a big one.Argued by many to have been the single greatest game on the original Playstation Metal Gear Solid continued the story that began way back in the late 80s with Metal Gear on the original Nintendo. Although the true sequel Metal Gear 2 was never released domestically the NES was graced with an unofficial sequel called Snake's Revenge. As far as I can tell Snake's Revenge is not relevant to the plot of Solid, which is actually Metal Gear 3.The storyline is well known by now, so I'll not review it, as it is sufficient to say that it remains one of the greatest games stories of all time. So good in fact, that even Metal Gear Solid 2 failed to eclipse it. What is relevant for the sake of this review is that aside from a few minor changes to the dialogue the story of the original is here and in tact.Obviously some people wonder what's changed? Well not much, thankfully. Silicon Knights, Konami, and Nintendo must have felt that it wasn't necessary to fix what wasn't broken. Instead they took the elements of Metal Gear Solid 2 that made it so great (hiding in lockers, moving dead bodies, etc) and used it as the basis of the Twin Snakes. The only addition to the game play I would have liked to see is better use of shadows for cover.Most of the voice-overs are done by the original voice actors, including David Hayter (Writer of the X-Men movie) as Solid Snake. So far the only voice that doesn't seem like the original is that of Mei Ling, and while I miss that adorable Chinese accent, one could point out that Silicon Knights was correcting a flaw of the original game... Mei Ling was born and raised in America, so it would make sense that she spoke with an American accent... even if her original voice was more fun.The graphics have been given a major overhaul, and kudos to Silicon Knights for the accomplishment here. Their previous outings have not been graphically impressive, but always had a decent artistic flair to them anyway. In Twin Snakes they have both. True to the artistic style of the MGS series, and yet better looking on GameCube than on any other system. I was blown away by the animation in this game. It's simply breathtaking to see how fluid everything is. The game does contain very impressive lighting, shadows, and weather effects that simply had my jaw to the floor. Character models may not be as good as those found in the Resident Evil or Silent Hill Series, but they don't fail to impress either.Silicon Knights proved with Eternal Darkness that they are champions of sound on the GameCube. MGSTS is no exception. Gun shots sound real, voice overs are phenomenal, little subtle sounds are very important in this game, and Silicon Knights did great with it. I was blown away by the sound, which tops 90% of the games out there.The enemy AI is nothing short of amazing as well. Though the original was no walk in the park by way of difficulty this game makes MGS 2 look like a kitten. The enemies are that smart. This game has me at the edge of my seat and I am a seasoned Metal Gear fan.In closing I want to say thank you to Konami, thank you to Nintendo, and Thank you to Silicon Knights for this amazing masterpiece. There is very little to complain about. This game is great for both nostalgia, and for newbies alike. Whatever your thoughts about GameCube this is defiantly a must have title... Now lets get Silicon Knights on Final Fantasy VII!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2004"}

With every Bond moment played out before you in an all-new, third-person cinematic perspective, this action-packed adventure could only come from the world of James Bond. What would Bond do? What will you do?","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Finally, another Bond game that has everything","reviewText":"It's telling that even after seven years of adventures on numerous consoles, all James Bond games are still compared to the original GoldenEye shooter that Rareware developed for the N64. Even more telling is that none of them have really measured up, and some of the later offerings (ie Nightfire) felt like more style than substance.Fortunately, EA has finally developed a Bond game to rival GoldenEye in Everything Or Nothing. Part of the appeal is that this time the game feels like a real movie, with Pierce Brosnan, Dame Judi Dench and John Cleese reprising their movie roles, as well as notable stars like Willem Dafoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Hedi Klum, and Japanese model Misaki Ito as the villains and supporting cast. The voice talent lends a whole new level of excitement to the adventure, and makes me want to include \"Everything Or Nothing\" when people mention the movie series.The play mechanics are also much improved. The new 3rd-person perspective feels more Bond-like, and offers shooting as well as effective hand-to-hand combat. Gadgets like the Q-Spider and Rappel Gun add another dimension to the gameplay, as Bond can now spy on enemies and have firefights while walking up walls. There are also numerous vehicle levels with Bond driving his Aston Martin, a tank, a motorcycle, and many others. EA also included many gameplay moments that dare Bond to defy the impossible, such as chasing a plane, driving off a cliff, and a fight with Jaws in a falling elevator. These sequences are what really make the player feel like Bond, and what seperates the game from other 3rd-person adventure titles.However, there's still a few faults worth pointing out. Gadget/weapon switching is still a royal pain. The lock-on aiming, though effective on enemies in the open, is practically useless when enemies are hiding behind crates. Finally, the award system still hasn't changed much, though offering production stills and turntable models of Bond girls is a much better reward than the weapon upgrades in the past.If you're a Bond fan, buy this game, love this game. It's the closest you'll ever get to being 007, and will easily tide you over till the next movie comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2004"}

 and for that guy that said it took him 2 hours to get past the second level boss...that is pathetic, especially if you practiced for a week on the original.anyway, i haven't beat the game yet, but i'm on the last mission, which is just the last boss fight, so i think i can write a review now.first off, the game kicks ass.  everything from the style, to the cutscenes, to the in-game action is top-notch.  i found myself beating the levels, not just to progress in the game, but also to see what the next cut-scene revealed.  this game actually has a story, and it has its corny moments, but you just have to understand that this is just how things are going to be and deal with it.  the over-the-top action in the cut-scenes blew me away a few times, even the opening cutscene to the first level rocked my socks off and got me in the mood to kick some demonic ass.  the character models in this game are fairly well done, the main characters anyway, and the bosses.  the normal enemies are kind of low in the polygon count, but that's okay, because the point of the game isn't to stand around and look at them, it's to shoot and slice them up in the coolest possible manner.  the voice-acting in the cutscenes is surprisingly good, and the motion-captured movements are some of the best yet in any game.unlike the craptacular second installation in the devil may cry series, numero tres brings us right back to basics, but with a few new tricks up its sleeve.  first off, there are numerous \"styles\" you can choose from.  trickster, which helps you evade enemy attacks.  gunslinger, which gives you some new crazy moves with your firearms.  swordmaster, gives you powerful sword techniques that are unique to each sword/devil-arm you have.  royal gaurd, a style that gives you the ability to block and counter-attack enemy attacks.  quicksilver, a style that lets you freeze time, so you can slice and dice your foes with ease.  and lastly, doppleganger, a nifty style that allows you to create a duplicate of yourself to help out in battles.  the first four styles i listed are available from the beginning of the game.  the last two are unlocked at various areas of the game.if you don't already know, the story revolves around our hero, Dante, a half-demon, half-human badass with white hair and a red trenchcoat.  i won't go too far into the story, but i'll just say that the main plot involves his twin brother, Vergil; a girl with a huge rocket launcher, Lady; a mysterious clown figure that follows Dante around, Jester; and an evil, bald man with a messed up scar on his face, Arkham.  overall, the story is about Dante trying to stop Vergil from taking over the world in the worst possible way.  that's all i'm gonna say.on to the difficulty.  sure, i've died numerous times, but this freakin' game isn't HARD.  it's tough.  you have to be fast and agile, and luckily the controls are responsive and easy to use. so what is everyone's problem?  are you just standing around, waiting to get hit?  i beat the first level in less than 3 minutes, and the second level in less than 5 minutes.  i'm not bragging, but i just think some people must be utterly terrible at videogames.  and yes, i died enough to unlock Easy mode, but i didn't go to it.  i bit my lip and kept on hacking my way to the end, where i'm at now, on Normal mode.  sure, some of the BOSSES are difficult, but the only HARD one i've fought so far is the one i'm on now, the END BOSS.  none of the regular enemies in this game are hard, so why is everyone dying?  just keep your eyes peeled and you'll be fine.  me, i jump around ALL THE TIME.  this greatly reduces my chances of being hit.  the first level i had difficulty on was....mission 7, and it wasn't too bad.  you just have to be smart about things.  and every time that i've died, it has been my fault, not crappy programming, or crappy controls, or crappy camera angles, it was just me not being quick enough.  almost every enemy and boss in this game has attacks that can be blocked, and most of them can be seen coming from a mile away.  granted, this game is much more of a challenge than the earlier installments (i'm talking about the original, because i've omitted devil may cry 2 from my memory).  but just be smart about your attacks and evasive manuvers, and you'll be fine.  don't let all the whining about the difficulty from other people change your mind about purchasing this title.  hell, even magazine reviewers are saying this is hard, but i don't see why...honestly, it's not hard.overall, this game is a great package.  packed with awesome action, in game and in cut-scenes, loaded with unlockable secrets and new difficulties, and by far the longest quest yet in the devil may cry series (right now i'm close to 18 hours and i'm at the end of the game), this game is just flat out amazing.  so, if you're up for a challenge (a fair one, i might add) then go ahead and pick this up.  trust me, if you love action, this game will blow you away...multiple times.  so, buy it and have a blast, and just remember....KEEP MOVING!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2005"}

This is the true sequel/prequel to Devil May Cry. In fact, they should rename this Devil May Cry 3: Let's Forget 2 Ever Existed. First off, the graphics have been rebuilt from the ground up, and is one of the best looking games on the PS2, with the only exceptions being MGS3 and God of War. Dante and the rest of the characters are very detailed. Even the enemies are decently animated(the bosses look really good though.) The cineamatics are some of the best action sequences in games, period. It's the kind that most action games and movies salivate at. 2nd, sound is great as well. Granted, Dante does come off a little too cocky for his own good, but not too annoying. The rest of the cast is exceptionally well done, seeing how this is Capcom and they have a reputation of hiring the worst actors around. This time, they did a good job. Music is a mixed bag. I liked it, but for people that hate heavy metal, they're not going to like this. But the gothic vibe is strong and really fits the game. Now the combat. DMC3 is an action gamer's wet dream come true because now, you can choose from several different fighting styles: Trickster(evasion),Swordmaster,Gunslinger,and Royal Guard. The rest is a secret. The best part is that you select 2 melee weapons and 2 long range weapons and switch through them on the fly. The combos are near endless as a result. Replay value is pretty high here, with extra difficulty levels(like it needs to get any harder,huh?), different costumes and loads of other cool extras. My only complaints are I wish the game was a little longer and its difficulty may be a little too much for the casual gamer. Overall, I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. Only other game that compares to this is God of War(which I will be reviewing shortly).Sean David signing off,Semper Fi, Carry on.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2005"}

Overall the game is addicting for the first bit, going through quest after quest, leveling up, dungeon diving. The setting is amazing, it makes for some amazing visuals of nature, different awesome biomes from swamp to forests, as you walk up a mountain it gradually gets snowier and the wind blows harder, though I would like to see in the next game a little more fantasy setting like in Morrowind. The physics are huge plus in this game, like sitting in a river and having it push you downstream w/ it, never seen that before in a game, or shooting a fireball at an enemy and watching him fly back.Gameplay is fun, though I find when using spells the reticule is too small so it's hard to hit enemies when they're moving, the only way really to hit every time is when they're standing still or running towards you, I haven't played as an archer but it'd be the same problem. Something that I find annoying is that you're magicka doesn't regen as fast when there are enemies around as when there aren't enemies around, playing a mage this slows the gameplay down and makes it annoying, when you have multiple enemies you have to run a bit back and wait 20secs until your magicka regens. This completely makes perks like faster magicka regen and cost less spells less useful because isn't that WHY I picked that perk, to have more magicka? It also makes you be cheap in boss battles where it's just a cat and mouse game, closing the door and hiding while you regen, or circling a column with him on the other side while you regen.I along with the many others who have said that going through dungeons over and over does get repetitive and boring, there are about 2-3 areas that you go through until you reach a door that loads the next area, and then finally a boss, grab quest item, repeat, and partly I guess because I'm one-hitting everyone (more on this later) during quests and the boss is either annoying or boring. Continuing on dungeons, the puzzles, I don't really mind the easy ones but the more difficult ones are annoying, you have to get up and look at your computer to figure out how to solve it taking you out of the game, sometimes finding out the clue is in a totally different room or something, the worst ones though are the ones where if you don't know what you're doing and mess it up you have to restart the checkpoint to reset the puzzle. My final but big complaint about dungeons is that, \"hey, I wanna level up my character by killing baddies\", but wait, the baddies are 20 levels higher than you, this kills any sense of progression you felt in your character. There are side quests though that do offer a new gameplay, like House of Horrors was a really memorable one, though they don't always offer much in the way of combat so you can level up your character. The enemies tend to be the same too, Draugr's in every damn dungeon, pretty rarely you come across a new enemy.Now the biggest problem I have with this game, the broken leveling system. So yes, of course, it's better than Oblivion, that just sucked, but it's still broken. As I said before right now I'm going through dungeons one-hitting enemies and my level is only in the teens but meanwhile I have a destruction skill level of 60+... Completely unbalanced. Still meanwhile, I go into a random non-quest dungeon and I'll probably get my butt kicked. Like gaining money, the leveling system is SLOOOOWW, 40+hrs and I'm still ONLY in the teens?!? C'mon! This game lacks so much of a what makes a true rpg great, a True sense of character progression and power, the big parts what makes rpg's great and true rpg's. Why do we play rpg's? To feel a sense of progression, the addiction of watching our character grow, level, and get stronger, but it's just so hard to see that in this game. To get to a new character level in this game you have to gain enough skill levels, and within a skill you have perks, you can choose 1 perk per level up, since it's so damn slow to level up you're forced to put perks into your main skills only, but what if I wanted to level up my speak skill because found item price is different from what it is actually sold as, nope, you're better of putting into your main skill. You'd be lucky to be able to perk up a non-main skill, and extremely lucky to put it into a non-main skill two times in a row (like what if I wanted to rank up my lockpicking skill too because lockpicking is the most horrendously horribly annoying thing in this game? Not if you want to sacrifice a perk...). Main skill perks are a whole another part, even if you put 2 points into getting 50% damage, it still feels almost meaningless, even without gear that's giving you plus damage it just still feels meaningless and not enough. Finally, my last gripe about the level system being broken is that you have 1-2 main skills like say 1 handed if you use a sword plus blocking if you use a shield, or destruction and restoration if you're a mage, I briefly mentioned earlier that my level is only in the teens but my destruction level is 60+, so what happens if I keep playing and max out my destruction skill level sometime when I'm a level 20, the max level is 81 so I'm barely beyond a 1/4 of the way to that, it's going to take forever to level up especially through the higher levels with your secondary skills. It might be because of the way dungeons scale to your level though, but that means later on I'm fighting harder enemies, so again, what kind of character progression is that to go from one-hitting enemies to struggling through dungeons?I can complain all I want, so suggestions for the next game, make skill levels more meaningful, example, give +2 destruction damage if I level up in that, or give us 2 skill points to level up more than 1 skill at a time. Make it easier to level up and get money, it's ssooo much more fun to kick butt in higher levels. Level scaling needs to be more linear, no more 20-30 dungeons, etc, have enemies around your level that provide enough of a challenge so it's a typical rpg leveling arc of easy to level at first then gets longer and longer to level up. It does also get tiring of guards and random npc's telling you that they're not impressed and have no idea of your progression. Do you know what I just did, I just crushed a boss and saved Skyrim, I've also killed several dragons that could've destroyed towns, and oh yea.. I'm Freaking Drgaonborn! I consume dragon souls, I am above and beyond you in every single way. Fable does this perfectly, if you play evil or good people cheer or are terrified of you and they speak of your deeds like it actually was passed down by word of mouth. A reputation system would be great.Finally overall, I'd say play Skyrim, it's addictive and fun for a bit, even if you don't enjoy it after a while like I did I still feel like I got my moneys worth even though I bought it at $60, but if you do enjoy it you'll enjoy it for quite a while.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"You've Been Warned: Not a True RPG","reviewText":"Let's cut to the chase. You've undoubtedly heard that \"Dungeon Siege\" is a game brimming with awesome graphics, \"seamless\" gameplay, and heralded sound. And that's all true. But Dungeon Siege lacks the one thing that it claims itself to be: role-playing. Don't get me wrong; it's still a fun game to play. But if you're a gamer who likes strong plots and powerful character development (as I am), then Dungeon Siege may not be the game for you. However, if you were enthralled with Diablo II's hack-and-slash mayhem, then this might be just your thing. Still, Dungeon Siege lacks any type of user-chosen skill development. Rather, Microsoft has taken the opportunity to present us with a new kind of \"RPG\" that makes your character excel in different areas, whether it be magic, bow, or weapon, depending on how much you use them. Although I understand this thinking and feel it's a novel approach to a game, I would rather decide myself where my character's strengths are. In addition, much of Dungeon Siege is run by smart AI, meaning that your party of adventurers will do what they're told, letting you sit back and watch the melee until it's time to heal with a potion or change somebody's attack scheme. This is all fine until you realize that the whole game can seemingly play itself!I liked Dungeon Siege for its simplicity, as it presents a nice break to real time-stealers like \"Baldur's Gate 2\". But I can't help to feel a little let down by its elementary nature. The eye candy and sound are awesome, but everything else simply feels rushed. Quests are limited, as are social interactions with non-player characters. Too much of the game is simply walking into a field and left-clicking until everything is dead, with a random award of treasure.If you're a Diablo fan, I have no doubt that Dungeon Siege will suit your taste. It's actually less of an RPG than Diablo II, but it's hack-and-slash nature will delight. It's hard to put down once you stop. For those into the epic storylines of Bioware's RPGs, then I urge you to play a copy of Dungeon Siege before making the full purchase. It's simplistic, unassuming tone will offend true \"RPG'ers,\" so you've been warned.All in all, Dungeon Siege is a fun game to play, regardless of its faults. And isn't that what gaming is all about?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2002"}

On that note PS exclusives just take the cake, remember these? Maximos(both)(ps2), Motorstorms, Uncharteds, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Sly Coopers(ps2), God Of Wars, Resistance 1 and 2, Lair(which was beautiful with bad controls), and the list goes on. Well onto this game, its just no holds barred killing fun, there are some spells along the way but nothing that i would consider really making it an RPG, more like a 3rd person mid evil slasher! Also as many have said there is no pause, so if ya gotta poop better go before you start or get ya a porta potty, thats about all the time you'll have between levels, or to eat a chip or take a sip of beer, or coke. The game is repetitive but not enough to get old, you die plenty which keeps it very challenging, note dying on this game is like wrecking in Motorstorm, you don't give up you just keep on going, and thats what it feels like. Creatures are all very definitive and have there own unique attacks, looks, and weaknesses. As i said the game is gorgeous, unfortunately its NOT in 1080p, but we'll see later on if there is a patch to upscale it, not that it really needs it because it still looks great. Castles, rivers, cliffs, trees, towns, towers, all these look so great you find yourself stopping just to view whats around, even though your being beaten and mauled by demons, oh well, your checkpoint is never to far off. So if you like a good challenge and arent afraid to die, then this game is for you, i love it because these types of games are really few and far between, i mean there are lots of imitators but this one definitely cannot be duplicated. Hey i have my 360 and its still fine, but Microsoft better step up or step off with some exclusives, because with games like this, and many more to come its not gonna stand a chance.

I have been playing WOW since 2005 and I never thought anything would ever make me quit. I was one of the Biggest WOW fans their ever was. I bought all the books, comics, and collectables. This Xpack is mostly like having a second Job only its less fun. You have to Grind 5 times as hard for items just to be able to raid. there is no new content most of it is revamped old content. The new dificulty level has turned the community against itself making doing anything with out a guild a very painful experiance.The gear is horible to look at, and there is very few dailies to keep you occupied. The raids are mostly set up for the top eliete whom play the game,leaving the casual player base behind. The blizzard Dev team never listens to the player base, they even removed the suggestions tab from the forums. The things the player base have been asking for for years have been completely ignored. The Avitar models are the same since the game came out in 2004.The game engine is the same it was in 2004, only the environment in the xpacks are new giving the illusion that the game has improved graphics. If you are a new player too the game you are going to be paying well over $100.00 to get all the xpack including this one for a game made in 2004.The game is loaded with bugs and most of the original devs working on wow have been transfered to the new Titan MMO blizzard is working on thus making the game even more buggier. The GM`s do not pro actively police the servers allowing people to activly bot and gold farm / mat farm / honor farm for items.The devs have completely lost touch with the community all the requests that have been asked for by long tearm veterans have been completly over looked such as more charecter slots, updated Avitar models for example.The 2 main specs Tank and Heals have been designed in a way that makes most players fustrated to the point that they have been either shelved by players or exploited for ingame gold for runs, or the ever so popular its my way or ill boot you from the group attitude. This elietest attitude is a complete turn off for new players due to no one giving the new player a break in a dungeon its either you know what your doing or we will vote kick you.Blizzard put alot of effort into revamping Azeroth for new players, but anyone over lvl 60 will rarely see it due to LFG que`s never having to leave the city. Not to mention that the dev team has essentially made the community an ANTI new player game. If you are a new player be prepared for a sound tongue lashing from the elitests. If you are lucky they will just vote kick you with out calling you every explitive in the book.The thing that really agrivates me the most is when they took all of our creativity with our classes and made them all cookie cutter spec's... i mean common Actiblizzion why on earth would you take away every thing that we could call special about our classes. now its like playing tick tack toe with your self. and with pvp or as i call it PVCC there is absolutley no fun in it you are constantly frozen stunned and did i mention frozen.Shared raid lock outs GASP now you can only chose between a 10 man or a 25 man, they only took away stuff only to take more away. And i want to pay $15.00 a month for this? really Actibliz?There is no events during the year other then the same old holiday events that have been going on since vanella. The only really fun events are the ones that herald the new xpack that brings a reason to the new xpack. So you are spending time grinding dailys, doing the same dungeons and raids over and over and over again. There is simply no creativity comming from the devs team.In my opinion Actiblizz is just keeping the lame horse alive long enough to have incomming revenue to fund their Titan MMORPG. there is no way any company would let a major game that millions love go this far down the toilet. Actibliz is their own worst enemy, i will never buy another game from them again.last but not least if you are a parent avoid buying this game for your children at all costs, the community is the absolute worst cesspool of filth, and depravity that the internet has to offer. There is things that you will see, hear, and read that will make you cringe to the point that you cant beleive that someone would be that awfull. The player base almost goes out of its way to be as discourtious as they can possibly be making one wonder why the hang are they playing a multiplayer game in the first place, unless it is their intention to be there just to be mean to others with no recourse for their actions. there are a few in the game that are nice but most of them are leaving for other games.All in all I thought that there would have been virtually nothing that would have made me quit WOW I was completly addicted to this game but this xpack was so bad it made me quit cold turkey and I never even felt bad about quiting.BUYER BE AWARE: this xpack is the worst XPack i have ever seen.

I ended up watching (and playing with) them for about two hours. This game is a lot of fun, and I think Activision has a winner on their hands, here. Because you need to buy additional, physical miniatures to unlock in-game areas and items, the game is really on the right track to be collectable and be a very profitable franchise!The characters in the game are very cartoony, and although there is violence aplenty, there is no blood, guts or flying body parts. Everything is very tame. Voice acting is pretty decent, and there is plenty of humor in the scripted dialogue. It seemed like my kids (ages 9 and 11) were getting the majority of it, though some of it was going over their heads. I laughed out loud a few time, and my son moreso.Controls were easy to learn, and setting up the game with the new \"portal\" device is also very easy to do. Batteries are even included, so no need to go searching through your drawers for spare batteries after you unpackage the game. It all ready to use in about ten minutes.The characters in the game are based on certain \"elemental powers\" that include air, water, fire, earth, tech, magic, etc. As you progress through the game, your characters will encounter magic doorways that are \"element specific\" can only be accessed by characters of the same element. Since you only have three different elements represented in the initial game, you will need to buy additional Skylander character packs if you want to fully explore the game world and collect all the items that ther are to be found. Thes additional characters that you purchase also act as additional \"lives\" for you, as when one Skylander's Health reaches 0, you will have to remove him from the portal and can replace him/her with a different Skylander who then starts with full health. While it may be possible to complete this game with only your initial three Skylnders, it will be very difficult and probably most children will not be able to do it. However, with the addition of only one additional Skylander, most children will probably be able to defeat the end-boss character, Kaos.Each particular character has its own unique attacks, movement, and upgrades to its power set. Characters can reach a maximum level of 10, which can be done fairly easily by the end of the game. Experience points are not lost, even when your character is knocked out of play. Any powers, gold coins, experience points, and equipped items that your character has are saved on a tiny memory chip inside the actual game piece. When you take your Skylander over to a friend's house to play, you will start with everything your character had when you last played! This even transfers over between game systems, so if you are playing on a Wii at your home and your friend has am X-Box, your character will still work on his system! This is a great bit of technology, and hopefully something that carries over into future game design, as well. Parents, because your children will be very tempted to bring their Skylanders to their friend's homes to play, you will probably want to mark your own child's characters in some way so that they don't mistakenly take home other kid's characters or leave their own characters behind! Not finding a way to identify whose character is whose could lead to unwanted conflicts!So far, I only encountered one glitch in the game. One of the characters got frozen up and we had to reset the wiimote to get him moving around again. So, if this happens to you, try this fix before thinking about returning the game.Certain to be on many kids' (including my own)Christmas and birthday lists this year, this is a great game for kids ages 8-12. Now we'll be looking to pick up more pack so my kids can unlock more of the characters and locations in the game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"A true achievemnet in entertainment","reviewText":"Mass effect is not more than a game. I have heard it be called an interactive story and what not, but such labels take away from this title what it really is. It is the next step in gaming. It seamlessly merges Rpg elements with over the shoulder shooters, and adds a rich, well done story of near epic proportions. If all that wasn't enough the characters you are surrounded by are as rich, and varied as the intricate plot in which they reside.In a key moment of the game, which I will not give away, I was so shocked I nearly dropped my controller. The majority of games today can barely force me to give a crap about the character the I control. For me to become so invested in my party was a completly new experience.Mass Effect is filled with wonderful moments like that, but they do not always come easily. Once you understand the mechanics of this game it is a joy to play. But when you first start out you are not given very much instruction on how to play the game. I started my first file as a vanguard, which is a combination of the soldier, and adept class. While the game gave me vague instruction on how to use my new powers, it used in game terminology to describe them. By the time I was 4 hours in, it was clear that I had made real errors in developing my characters, and I decided to start over.To best understand how this game works I strongly recommend starting out as a soldier. Soldiers regenerate health, and are able to use every weapon effectively. While having abilities is cool your team will more thatn make up for that. Once you understand how to use their powers you should be able to start a file as any class you want.Now for the review portion of my review. Mass Effect has gorgous graphics, and controls very well. The differnt classes are well balanced, and your team is always able to pick up the slack, as long as you are giving them direct orders. Left to their own devices your team  is as dumb as a bag of rocks, but few in game ai's aren't so this isn't an issue. Weapons are varied and extremely customizable. The story puts most movies to shame, and the characters in it are extremely well done. There are a number of enjoyable side quests that will keep you busy for additional hours should you choose to undertake them.Now for the negative aspects. Loading screens have been replaced with elevators, to give it a more realistic feel. You will get very tired of riding elevators. Enemey AI is caveman stupid. Forget taking cover the entire fight becasue the enemey has been trained in the Kamikaze style of warfare and will run through your hale of gunfire to get to you en masse. When you visit other planets you are dropped in a vehicle called the Mako. These portions range from boring to insanely frustrating. Boring comes from upwards of 20 minutes of searching for your objective over unnecessarily rocky terrain. The frustrating part comes in the form of the random mercenaries who you will encounter from time to time. The Mako's weapons targetting is painfully imprecise so you will usually end up using hit-and-run tactics, made even more difficult by the Makos's awkward turnng mechanism. Thankfully these sections are usually optional aside from a few story missions.Mass Effect is an amazing game, and you owe it to yourself to play it.Pros: Great GraphicsAmazing StoryRelatable charactersRock solid on-foot gameplayCharacter development and customizationCons: Caveman stupid AIPoorly designed vehicle segmentsNumerous and sometimes long elevator loading timesAnd for some people the game may freeze.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2009"}

Remember how much you'd be squerming all over your seat, trying to cover your eyes up, but couldn't dare to take your eyes away from the screen? How each and every minuet would build suspense up higher and higher and higher til you could barly take it? Now what happens when you watch it twice, or three times, or heck, let's make it four times? Are you still scared? Probably not, and that's how Dead Space works.Dead Space started out with all the right ingredients for a classic horror, much like a great scary movie, each room would paint a graphic, violent story, while your ears would be constantly penatrated by sounds from creeking and moaning to supensful buildups in a ship thats light so dismal you'd think it'd be a catacomb for hopes and dreams. No joke, sound, lighting and set peices are AMAZING, but once you play through a few hours, you start to notice a bad pattern. The monsters. Each and every encounter with the baddies quickly take you out of the vibe of tension and horror, manly for the reason that you know that they will always jump out of air vents. Each and every time. You'll walk into a extremly scarey room, only to know where the horror will come from. Much like a good scary that'd you've seen multiple times, you know what's gonna happen, befor it happens. This one minor fault take you out of the experince of terror very quick. Otherwise, EA would have a winner on there hands with Dead Space.Other minor little faults would be that the monsters are just long limbs, attatched to stick bodies, once agian, a great build up to a scream, but after you see what's coming at you, it looks like a jumbled-up bag of limbs. Also, the 'necromorphs' look like a fish out of water when they die, the dead bodies the dead bodies can be kick around, like they where feather weights became very annoying to, but not to much of a problem.

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Jeff \"Jeff\"","summary":"Nintendo, once again, remains THE innovator.","reviewText":"If you are a GameCube owner, chances are you chose your console partly because of the innovations usually found in titles produced by Nintendo itself.  Nintendo's track record for first party titles is virtually untainted and is completely un-challenged.  While owners of Nintendo's consoles may have less titles to choose from than competitors, the percentage of garbage titles to appear on other consoles far outstrips that of Nintendo's systems.  That being said, Pikmin is an innovative masterpiece that should not be over looked.  The gameplay is fantastic and very addictive.  I read many reviews referring to the game as being short.  While I cannot say the game is long, I must admit that it wasn't as short as I thought it would be, based on other's feedback.  It incorporates two genres (platform and strategy) successfully into what is really a unique new play experience.  You do have to think about how you will go about several tasks, or you won't be able to complete them.  Pikmin's graphics are wonderful as well.  It is a game that makes me smile rather than feeling down after playing.  Many thanks to Nintendo for not re-hashing the same stuff over and over again as competitors do. Just when I think innovation in the game market is becoming dull, a title like Pikmin, or Animal Crossing, or Metroid Prime comes along to challenge this notion.  I only hope there is a sequel.

{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

They are indeed more awkward than on the original GBA, but unless you have real large hands, there shouldn't be a problem getting used to the new layout.  Long-term, though, one wonders what negative effect it has on the human hands; already, our thumbs and other digits are over-exerted from punching on cell phones, console controllers, holding mice and trackballs, and now tapping furiously on small buttons on the GBA SP.

Insane driving and stunts and the chance to pilot the fastest hovercraft in the fleet proves that this isn't just a game that's set in the Matrix universe; it's an experience that's designed to be a true part of the entire Matrix mythos. Enter the Matrix is the story-behind-the-story and features slo-mo bullet time effects, never-before-seen live-action footage starring the cast of the movies, and plenty more. Also available for the Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Gamecube, and Windows PC.","reviewerName":"Ella C. Weidman \"beawei\"","summary":"Enter the Matrix","reviewText":"Never has a movie based game been as good as Enter the Matrix. This has very fast paced kung-fu fights, awsome looking slow-motion gunfights, sweet car chases, and adenline-pumping agent encounters. It also has an hour of exclusive footage done with actors from The Matrix: Reloaded and has very close ties with the movie. You cant fully understand the movie without this game, and you cant understand alot of this game without also seeing the movie. The action is uncomparable to any other game on the market of that genre, unlike most action games where you go through each level shooting everything, here you can get up close and do complicated and fast disarm moves and unleash a devistaing series of punches kicks. The focus(Bullet Time) move has never before been used so well in a game. In Max Payne, you could barely see the bullets fly through the air, but in Enter the Matrix they are big, shiny, and leave a trail of soundwaves behind them, making it an awsome experience to dodge them or fire them. Also, when using focus you can run faster, jump inhumanly long distances, run up walls and 360 kick someone of of it, and do many other special moves not available in regular speed. The car chases are not quite as good as those in a James Bond game, but are still pretty good. The interactivity with the enviroment is the thing that stands out from all the other car chases in video games: Streetsigns fall when shot at, those annoying \"Your speed is ____, the speed limit is ____\" signs explode when driven past at 100mph, windows shatter when you crash into buildings, but there is an awful lot of fog when doing this, and a little amount of innocent traffic in places where there is supposed to be swarms of them, like on the highway. While the car chases arnt perfect, the gunfights are almost so. Focus moves are extremely important to this game, and unlike max payne, is not just a thing to make it look cool. You can barely hit a wall while running and jumping in normal speed, but when you turn on focus, your accurasy boosts much higer because of the slower moving targets, you can pinpoint the heart of a guard after running up a wall and somersaulting off it and then diving headfirst over a deep gap. The slow motion gameplay makes this a blasts, and not only is it used in gunfights, but it also makes your kicks, punches, and throws faster and more stronger, this is very essential when fighting an agent, vampire, or Seraph, in fact its almost impossible to win a boss fight without using a few focus moves somewhere in there. The fighting engine is also great, this could be a great fighting game, only they decided to make it better with the gunfights. There is a wide range of kics, punches, combos, and focus moves, and each one is slightily different whether you have a weapon out or not, for example, when you try a throw move while unarmed, Niobe/Ghost will pick up the opponent and throw them, but while armed, he/she will grab them by the neck, crack it a bit, drop them outward and shoot the opponet in the neck at a point blank range. The liscensing here is also used just as good as the Star Wars series used it's. You will fight many opponents from the Matrix movies, and some that barely made an apperance in reloaded become much more complicated and deep in this game, particualrily the vampires. There are also some heart-pounding agent encounters, imagine, running down the streets of chinatown whith eight agents behind you, all of a sudden, another one jumps out from a window in front, backing away, you quickly turn around and run the only open rode you see and find yourself diving through the window of a tire shop, the owner crouches down and whimpers, you run to the back about to open the door, when you hear some strange noise coming from the owner, you look and an agent stands where the owner was crouching, you elbow open the locked door and quickly run to the pay phone ahead, but all of a sudden someone throws a grenade and it blows up. The chase continues on and eventually you find yourself running across rooftops, sprinting up stairs, and diving through glass. With such great agent chases, forget The Getaway, Enter the Matrix is the most movielike game out now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2003"}

This is just a year after the release of the Super Nintendo in America and also a year after the release of Final Fantasy IV.  Needless to say, it was one of the last RPGs to be on the NES.  The Dragon Quest series has never been too big in America so it's possible that for a lot of gamers, this is the first encounter they've had with Dragon Quest IV.  It stacks up pretty nicely on the DS, but it also keeps very true to its NES roots.  If you were one who played the original NES version and were expecting a Final Fantasy IV DS revamp, you'll be disappointed.  However, it is a treat for those who never got the chance to play the original NES title.  If you did play the original NES game to completion, I repeat, there's really nothing new here.Dragon Quest IV begins by actually taking four chapters to introduce you to the game's four main characters and the last Chapter to be the actual quest.  Dragon Quest differs from Final Fantasy in terms of story.  Dragon Quest puts a lot more emphasis on exploration and from time to time, battling.  So there's not much of an emphasis on story here, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have merits.  It's a fairly good story overall.The most obvious update to Dragon Quest IV is the game's graphics.  Japan got a Playstation remake in 2001 and the graphics here are right on par.  However, it uses Dragon Quest VII's graphics engine.  So there are 2D Sprites on a 3D world.  The facelift is nice, but it looks a little sloppy.  The sprites don't look that much better than what you'd find in a Super Nintendo game and they're pretty pixelated.  It overall looks good, but it could look better.The second major update is the game's translation itself.  Character names, towns, etc., have been changed.  The script has also been rewritten as well.  So if you played the original NES game, there are quite a few changes in terms of dialog as well.  It's also a little neater.The game's updated music is perhaps the best part.  It's now completely orchestrated and it sounds very good.  There are a few old school sound effects that come through as well, but they're appropriate.When battling, however, this is where a lot of the game's old school charm really comes out.  Dragon Quest has the most basic of basic menu battle systems.  Dragon Quest IV doesn't do a thing to update it in the slightest.  The enemies now move in battle, but not much.  You actually see enemies attack and some of the spell animations look good.  However, you never see your enemy go up and strike the enemy.  Beautiful backgrounds and enemies that move a little are nice, but it shows that there's no real update to the battle system.  It probably won't bother you in the long run.  After all, battling is actually pretty fun, but graphically, it's hard not to wish that Dragon Quest IV would've upped the ante a little bit.In many Dragon Quest games, level grinding was a must.  This isn't really true of Dragon Quest IV, at least not in the remake.  Much of the game is pretty simple.  There's no level grinding necessary.There isn't really that much else added to Dragon Quest IV at all.  It stays very true to its NES roots.  You may be getting a game that looks like it belongs on the DS, but it is very much an NES game and holds true to everything the original NES game has including some of its limitations.  If you don't mind that, then the game will be an excellent buy.  If you're not really big on RPGs from the NES era it might not be for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}

Gamespot-4.5, ign-6.3, machinama-6 and so on. Just look at the reviews it's getting on amazon.com and all the people talking about how good it is on miiverse. If you people don't realize yet that ign and all these big game review companies are trying to finish off nintendo, then you won't believe anything. I'm not a nintendo fanboy, but I was a huge playstation fanboy who used to get on youtube and mess with nintendo fans. I have to say that the wiiu is not only by far the best console to ever be released, but zombiu is the greatest game I've ever played aside from perfect dark, and goldeneye n64 (That's right, even though I used to like playstation better, I still realized that those are the two best games ever made). This game completely puts resident evil to shame and makes capcom look like a second rate company. Not only have the resident evil games not reached this level of creativeness, but they also haven't reached this level of horror (This game is even scarier than silent hill and that game was very creepy!). The game is slow and methodic, but that is what it would be like in a real zombie apocalypse. Like it or not, you'll have to think when you're outnumbered by a bunch of flesh eating zombies and you only possess a handful of ammunition. That's where the melee comes in and that's also what everyone said made this game boring. That couldn't be further from the truth for me, because that's what differentiates this game from an action game. How would it be hard or even scary if you had a ton of bullets to wipeout all the zombies in front of you. If that was the case then you wouldn't have to worry about conserving ammo, looting for ammo and planning your attacks so that you don't get overrun whenever there are multiple zombies coming to eat your face. You see, everything in this game has a purpose for why it is the way it is. Oh, another complaint is that there is no story. I say good, if you mean there is not much voice acting and movie clips that interrupt gameplay then that's the best news I've ever heard. Why are we so concerned with voice acting, scripts, and overall movie related content in a freaking game anyway? Lastly, I would just like to say that this game is the closest you'll ever get to being in a george romero film as the lead actor. It really does exude the same eerie feeling as an independent scary film that is engaging in every way and I think it will keep me on edge until the end of the game. I've only played 6 hours, but I am still craving more and I've only used like 80 bullets so far. Please ubisoft, don't pay attention to the reviews and make zombiu 2 because we need more hardcore mature games and I can't think of a better one than this. To all playstation and xbox fans who bought more ps and xbox's over the holidays than wiiu consoles, you wasted your money, because the best game ever made is right here on the wiiu, not those other two consoles. Wake up and stop being a hater of nintendo and realize like I did that without nintendo there will not be any innovation and we will be stuck with the same drawn out concepts forever! Always remember, gameplay over graphics!Update: Now that I've finished the game, I would change my 5/5 to a 4. There were a few things that keeps it from being perfect and they are: Technical issues, like when you hit a zombie with the cricket bat and it goes flying through the air 60 feet. Also, when you hit a zombie on a ledge it will actually walk on air like wiley coyote! The last thing that brings down the score is the electric zombies and poltergeist zombies. These things are ridiculous and have no place in a serious zombie game like this. I mean seriously, why would you try your best to create an intense realistic zombie adventure, but then turn around and create one of the most outlandish enemies in the game. The electric zombie is like a super hero with electricity shooting out of its hands and the poltergeist zombie is like a freaking ghost that teleports. How stupid can you get? Whoever thought that was a good idea should be fired from ubisoft. Lastly, I hope that ubi makes zombiu 2, but if they include more of this crap I will not buy it, because it completely took me out of the immersion of the game and just made me laugh instead at how dumb it all was. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in the way it all turned out. It was just so promising until then and they basically ruined it by implementing those zombies! I still like it better than any other game I've played in the last 10 years so I can't complain too much I guess. I'm just mad because this game was almost perfect in every way!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}

It just isn't going to stand up to too much.The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

(The Game Boy Player is a great add-on for the GameCube that allows you to play Game Boy Advance games on it.)Of course, if I wrote this review back in the day, I'd be comparing it to the PS2 and Xbox instead of the Wii, which the GameCube also had great advantages over the PS2 and Xbox.The PS2 was only two players, while the GameCube was four, and the GameCube has much better graphics.The Xbox had hardware problems and terrible controllers if you didn't buy the type-s.  The GameCube was also about 4 times smaller than the Xbox.Another cool thing about the GameCube is you can buy first-party wireless controllers (called Wavebirds), something the PS2 and Xbox didn't have.But the best thing of all is the Nintendo exclusives.  All of those amazing games on are on GameCube such as Star Fox, Metroid, Pokemon, F-Zero The Legend of Zelda, Kirby, and of course Super Mario.

They said,\"It will remain an Xbox 360 exclusive.\" So I had no choice but to buy an xbox 360 for this game. It's not fair that the first game is an xbox exclusive and the sequels are multiplatform! People who have not played the first game due to the fact they may not have a 360 will probably not get the whole story or origins of the main character. But I'm not here to completely rant about that. I'm here to review the game itself. Saints Row 1 is a good start to the series. This is where the main character started in Saints Row, with nothing, then got an opportunity to join the Third Street Saints gang and take over Stilwater, a fictional city based on Detroit (I think). Customization is nice as well. The downside is your character can only be a guy and doesn't have much dialogue in the first game. If Volition could remake Saints Row 1 with some extra tweaks, like improved graphics, more customization, etc., then that would be a treat. It would be a great idea to do that for next gen consoles. Now I know what you're thinking, I bought an Xbox 360 for one game and know next gen consoles are not long from release? The answer is no because there are other exclusives I want to try on this console. But before I do that, My rating for Saints Row 1 is a 3.5/5. Not much to say since it released in 2006. I said before, it would be a treat if Volition had the will to remake Saints Row 1 for next gen (PS4 and Xbox One).

ITS more like regular golf. there are also 2 other favorites from other GTA  games like street racing and drunk driving. however, the drunk driving isn't as authentic as in previous games like GTA 4. its more silly and  rounded. plus, its usually only a few blocks you have to get to not all the way across town. the longer way was funner in my opinion.the regular missions are usually filled with bullet storms and chaos but I did see a large number of missions which were not just like that. THEY  had many interesting and unique  missions from GTA  games past. this was refreshing and liberating.I use cheat codes A LOT  on nearly every game Ive ever played. I consider games way to difficult to beat otherwise. and they are. I never would've got through VICE CITY,SAN ANDREAS OR GTA 4 without them. all this relying on luck and flukes to pass missions is ridiculous. but , now there is a game  that just ROCKS  and didn't kill me ,initially, over and over. I died maybe 20 times during this entire game. it was great fun. that was the key thing that made it beat out san andreas in  my opinion. games are much funner when you don't have to do the same thing over and over again.the cops were a pain. they were more like a militiant force who hunted me down at all costs. plus, they only had to shoot me 3 or 4 times before I was dead. even on 2 stars, they would not stop unless I hid. they followed me into buildings , even my home.there was a lot of redneck stuff on this game. one of the 3 characters you control is a methead  dealer/user. there is a big city right next to a big desert so theres a lot of redneck stuff to get into like 4 wheeling, many off road vehicles, hunting and more.there are what is called light RPG  elements. some RPG's are open ended, have choices and have multiple characters. this is true here as well. I really like that about GTA 4 and 5. my favorite video game genre is RPG's and I think its awesome that they combined my second favorite kind of game[GTA] WITH rpg's .also, if you've had enough of one guy, you can just switch off to another.ANOTHER THING  I liked about this game is you start with money. you aren't just some low life punk. you are 3 guys who have money and the connections to make waaaaay more.you will see a lot of the cool cars from older GTA  games. you can run into cool cars a lot. in vice city, there were lots of cool cars everywhere and wide streets so you could fly like crazy. they have that here. in san andreas, they had a  lot of different style cars. in number 5 there are trucks, off roaders, sports cars, muscle cars and you never have to look too far for some vehicle to suit your needs. in GTA 4,  there were too many regular cars. that is  NOT  a problem in this game. its like they took  everything wrong with the older games and changed them. only , unlike most games, they nailed it , mostly. plus, they have way more options at the custom car shops. most are for  making your car faster and cooler but, there are also some awesome new additions like bullet proof tires and armor.I said, earlier that it was near perfect. so I guess I have to say what was wrong here. there was a racetrack that I couldn't bet at hooked to a casino I also couldn't bet at. there was the vinewood bowl which was, of course, a spoof on the Hollywood bowl. but I couldn't go there to enjoy music. the language was the worst yet of any GTA  game. now I expected bad language but this was over the top. I have a very high tolerance for foul language and I still found it to be a bit much. I just didn't like having to turn down the TV  whenever anyone walked by because they let the N  word fly over and over and over again . I missed mission plans from  having to turn it down because they cussed 3 or 4 times in every sentence. plus, the \"humor\", if you could call it that was disgusting. it made me want to barf a few times.this last part did happen only once but it was the thing that pissed me off more than anything. Michael, a mob guy with an disrespectful and out of control  family has a son. this son is heard cussing other players online. he frequently says horrible things about sexual assaulting other players and their families. plus, at one point he brags about making fun of a baby who was born disabled. that was uncalled for and sick.so, other than the language and a few minor ways the game could've been improved like gambling, this game gets a 9.9 stars  out of me . and in all of video game history only 8 games ever got and 8 or higher in my opinion. this game rocks and ive had a great time wasting my life away obsessively  playing it. I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Good for Nostalgic Gamers who Need a Backup","reviewText":"Super Mario All-Stars 25th Anniversary Limited Edition is a fresh release for the Wii of four classic games. In essence you're getting Super Mario Brothers 1, 2, 3, and lost levels. These fun side scrollers were beloved by many when they first came out on the NES and SNES systems. You also get soundtrack music plus a booklet detailing some of the history of the games.The first thing to understand here is that these are OLD games with OLD graphics. They have jagged edges. They have simple gameplay. You're learning about classic gameplay here, or reliving your childhood, depending perhaps on how old you are. They aren't going to have cutting edge soundtracks or advanced monsters. You're lucky if you can tell if your little enemy has eyes or not.The second issue is that these games already exist in the Wii online game catalog. That is, even before this special Wii disc set came out you could own all four games simply by going into the online Wii store and buying it there. It would be cheaper to do that too. However, if you do that you don't get the soundtrack or the little booklet. Is that work the extra price? That would be something you'd want to juggle in your own budget.It's worth noticing of course that here when you buy the game disc you OWN the game disc permanently. Nobody can take it away from you. If you download games onto your Wii from the online store, it's an iffy proposition if that Wii gets destroyed somehow if you're able to download the games onto your new Wii. Also, if you want to go visit at a friend's house and they have a Wii you can bring the disc with you which is easier than bringing along your entire Wii.How do the games play? I adored the originals when I was young so I do still have fun playing these \"fresh re-releases\" and reliving those memories. It's funny how the brain remembers the sequences after all these years. So I play for nostalgia reasons - but I'm not sure all modern gamers would find the games appealing. It would need to be someone who appreciates the simple graphics and basic gameplay.So to summarize - there's a group of gamers who won't like these games at all. That's fine, certainly these are old games. There's a group who *would* like them for nostalgia reasons but who would rather get them online for less money. That's also fine. Then there's a group who enjoy these games and want to have the disc for portability and backup reasons. For that last group of people, the disc is just what they'll want.Rating: 5/5 for that one group.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2011"}

I still remember playing the demo in a video game store before it came out - my jaw was on the ground. I remember the anxious feeling I had when I first bought the game and just couldn't wait to get home. At that time - that was the best action game ever and I never thought those feelings could be reproduced. In my mind NOTHING could best that game. The second one was pale in comparison (haven't played the third yet...actually picked GOW over DMC3) could there be a game other then DMC that could do the action genre justice? Enter God Of War.God of War takes the action genre and does everything right. The controls are extremely fluid and easy to learn, the story is engaging, it doesn't seem like a button mash-em (although you do have to rapidly press buttons sometimes... but only when it makes sense to do so), the magic and weapons are awesome, the boss battles are epic, the graphics are amazing - considering the aging PS2 hardware, the sound is spot-on, the camera isn't your enemy... I could go on and on. This game is very polished. It is very obvious that the developers spent an enormous amount of time making sure every facet of this game is perfect - and they nearly achieved that.The Graphics:Simply put, these are some of the best graphics you will see on the PS2. We are in a time now where the PS2 is starting to age a bit, but this game really does a great job of showing what the PS2 is capable of... and it's impressive! It's amazing how much can be packed on one screen and still remain fluid. The monsters are nicely detailed and the landscapes and architecture are jaw dropping to say the least. There is the occasional slight hiccup in the frame rate, but it's rare and when it does happen it's barely noticeable. Another thing worth mentioning is the camera. Unfortunately this game has a fixed camera angle, but fortunately the camera work is done extremely well! Rarely did I get annoyed because of the camera.The Sound:The sound is epic. The music featured in this game fits the atmosphere very well. I found myself completely immersed in this game thanks to the impressive sound effects, music and good voice acting. The voice acting in this game is definitely worth mention. The voice actors are very convincing most of the time. There is the occasional line that isn't delivered quite right, but for the most part the voice acting is top-notch. With the music and voice acting so amazing it's not surprising that all of the other environmental sound effects such as the clanking of swords are top-notch as well.The ControlsThe controls in this game are some of the best controls I've ever experienced. The action is extremely fluid and it's relatively easy to execute the moves that you're intending to. Each move performed goes seamlessly with each other move. You can go from beating the crap out of baddies on the ground, launch one up in the air, kick the crap out of them in mid air, come back down and grab another baddie - from here you can swing the baddie around via a chain (which has swords attached... which is attached to the baddie =) and hit others, then pull out Medusa's head, turn three or four more baddies into stone, shatter them, then one of the baddies might have a circle icon above his head... just hit circle while your near the baddie and you will unleash some true pain! Then you must finish him off by rapidly hitting circle and jamming your sword down his throat (often-times you have the option to hit a sequence of buttons that appear above the monsters head, if executed correctly you will unleash some REAL pain) In other words you can link together some truly amazing combos, and it's not too hard once you get the hang of it! You can string combos well into the 200+ range (it keeps count for ya). Also, there is a meter that goes up and once it's full you hit R3 and L3 simultaneously and all hell breaks loose! This is similar to the Devil Trigger mode in DMC. You can really start whoopin' up once that meter is full. Virtually every button on the dual-shock is used, which may sound daunting but the controls are so intuitive that the learning curve is relatively short. I could go on and on about the combat system, but I'll leave some to you for discovery. It's truly ingenious - nuff said.The Story:The story in this game is also done well. I am one that doesn't like to give away any spoilers what-so-ever, but in a nutshell you play as Kratos. You are sent to kill the God Of War. Initially you want to end your life, before you know it - you are saved from your suicide attempt and thrust into a flashback three weeks prior. You will learn a lot about our depressed anti-hero throughout the game, especially during the mid to later parts of the game. I am not going to spoil anything so you're just going to have to find out for yourself.The ConsThere is very little in this game that I don't like. The camera although often perfect, will occasionally make the game a little tougher (quite rare though). The boss battles are so epic that I wish there were a few more. Some people say the puzzles are too easy, but I don't play an action game to rack my brain on a puzzle for hours, I like them the way they are because they break up the action a little bit without getting overly annoying. That's really about it!ConclusionThis game is amazing. I paid full-price for this gem ($49.99) and I don't regret it at all. Games like this have lots of replay value in my opinion just because they're so darn fun to lose yourself in. There is lots of bonus material as well (mini-games, documentaries...etc). Some of it is unlocked for you right off the bat, other material you will just have to earn. You need to at least rent this game, but I believe that no game library is complete without it.The developers have hit just about every angle right in this game. Even in this short review I have failed to capture it's true magnificence... you will just have to play it to find out what I'm talking about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2005"}

I played only in the easiest mode, as I like to kick back and enjoy all aspect of the game, from the scenes and settings, to the story, to the team action, and to the weapon. I don't care to be the most aggressive, meanest and coldest shooter. It took me about 10 hours or so to finish in the recruit mode.The cold war story was intriguing, but a bit too fast to grasp all details the first time around. The prologue on the ship was a great start, which definitely got my adrenaline flowing! When finished with the game, an epilogue is available for actions on a jumbo passenger plane! There is also the arcade mode which one can keep score.The graphics is still good by today's standard (2012), but not ideal for large TVs. 50-inch HDTV was fine, but putting it on a 1080p 125-inch projection and the details are fuzzy. The music is quite appropriate (when reaching climax of battle). The AI is quote good as the enemies can adapt and own team members can yield if I was aggressive, or take the lead if I was passive on most incremental battle advancements (e.g., room to room).Overall it's a great all around adult shooting game.. even in 2012.

The graphics of this game is really really good as a matter of fact I would say this would look almost just as good if not better than super mario galaxy on the wii which is pretty awesome considering its on a handheld. Controls are good and feel just like how mario games should except mario walks kinda slow or at least I thought it was so you will be holding down the run button a lot(simular to 64 ds). Gameplay is where this game shines as with 99.9% of Mario games that have been released. It plays a lot like a mixture of Super Mario 64 and Super Mario bros 3 they only thing that it really borrows from galaxy is the star coins which in galaxy was comet coins. However there is only one problem with this game in my opinion is that if your a hardcore Mario fan you may be dissapointed by the difficulty and length of the game. You can cruise threw the main game in like 7 hours then you get the harder levels which are just slightly harder that is still easy compared to say Super Mario Bros. 3 but people who don't play to many mario games will be challenged still so it could be a pro or a con about the difficulty depending on who you are. Anyway if you love Super Mario bros. 3 or Super Mario 64 get this cause its the closet thing to a sequel to either game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

It's hip, it's new and fresh something that's has never bin done before.  Jet Grind is not only a terrific Dreamcast game but it simply one of the best Dreamcast games next to Shenmue and Soul Calibur.  The game is an instant classic that no one with a Dreamcast should miss out on.  The game is extreamly original and a very underrated gem, heck this is better then the Tony Hawk series.  It has a pretty cool story.  You're are the GG's a skate gang that pretty much takes over other groups of skaters turfs and to make matters worse you are being chased by a ruthless cop and his minions(AKA swat teams)and Tanks, Helicopters and so on.  This game unlike the sequal JET SET RADIO FUTURE is more challenging because it has a timer.  The games level desighn just keep getting better and better and the best part about this game is.....THE MUSIC.  This game has the best music next to Metal Gear Solid.  The music will really get you into this game which if really awesome.  The game is also pretty original cause you can spray grafiti on walls, trash cans, windows ect.  And no game has ever pulled this off but this game is Cell shaded and is very well done.  Every character and level is so well desighned that your mouth will be drooling in such amazment.  Put simply...the visuals in this game are amazing.

All the levels in UT 2003 feel like the same &quot;techno-grunge&quot; industrial warehouse done with different textures.  Even the outdoor levels disappoint.  Moreover, the game modes stink: gone is fan favorite assault, replaced by the ridiculously stupid and frustrating bombing run.

One day, an assassin named Helter Skelter appears before Travis and the two face off in a battle. Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts. Gameplay is all about using your Beam Katana (via Wii remote) to defeat enemies.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"4.5; unique game on a unique system","reviewText":"On the Gamecube, a game was released called Killer 7 which was quite violent and had simplistic gameplay yet there was something addictive about it and the graphic style was quite refreshing. However unique doesn't mean mass appeal and despite a cult audience, Killer 7 isn't really a big seller but luckily that didn't stop Suda 51 (Goichi Suda) to keep going and announce its follow-up: No More Heroes, exclusively on the Wii. While most Wii owners will undoubtedly pick up Super Smash Bros Brawl when its released, you should also give No More Heroes a go.Story: You play as Travis Touchdown, an otaku geek who buys a Beam Katana online and ends up killing the assassin, Helter Skelter. A woman named Sylvia of the UAA tells him that he is now ranked 11th on the list of assassins and has to keep fighting in order to be number 1 as well as avoid being killed by those who wish to take his place. With a number of odd jobs to take on as well as the ranked assassins, Travis is gonna have his hands full.Graphics: In an age when games are either anime-inspired or going for photo-realistic characters which not only looks unique but rather refreshing even though there's a bit of anime inspiration in its designs. In-game it looks just as stylish although in progressive scan, there's some things like jaggies, minor parts of slowdown and just a feeling of unpolishedness but the game succeeds on style alone as opposed to perfect presentation.Sound/Music: The voice acting is quite good with quite a few swears and funny lines though at times the dialogue's clunky like some of Travis' taunts but other than that, it's just as good as Killer 7's and is quite welcome as opposed to reading it all. The music is just as great as well and if you're a fan of Killer 7 or dance-y soundtracks, I recommend picking it up.Gameplay: Rather than have a on-rails first person shooter, NMH follows more a GTA look with the city of Santa Destroy ripe for exploration which range from gyms (levelling up stats), t-shirt stores, brand new katana models and mini-missions and odd jobs like mowing lawns. This is integrated well and while things get more expensive than your jobs pay out, there's quite a bit to do. Should you go and take on a ranked assassin is where combat comes in. With your beam katana as well as wrestling moves, Travis takes on enemies by pressing A for katana or B for kicking/stunning which allows the wrestling moves. Just before enemy dies, a prompt comes onscreen with an arrow; just wave Wiimote in direction of arrow and Travis will do a special (and quite bloody) kill for cash. Wrestling moves are triggered when enemy is dizzy and upon pressing B, another prompt involving direction with both Nunchuk and Wii-mote so one might do wave both up or down while one half needs all left than all down. It makes combat intuitive enough to get into it quick and its diverse moves and upgrades keep it from becoming stale.But as far as gameplay faults, there's a couple that people will either hate or just minor nitpicks. For one, that game is kind of easy and while enemies will surround you and a boss might be tricky, it's not an overly frustrating game which is welcome but its not challenging and keeps you on your toes. Another complaint is getting money which at times works but the jobs themselves are either boring and not as fun while others can be slightly frustrating.Like Killer 7, No More Heroes will be just as polarizing with some loving and some hating so while I'd recommend you play it since I love it, it's also with a warning of caution but instead of playing minigame inspired Wii games all the time, it's fun to take on something like this and just have a blast doing so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Primevil60 \"Prime\"","summary":"Never grabbed me","reviewText":"I was bored with this game after 15 minutes.

However, having never priorly played War For Cybertron, I am thinking I may play through that one first, and then come back and play Fall of Cybertron, as it is a sequel to the latter.

Well, I got the demo on XBL as soon as it came out, wasn't that impressed, and deleted it to save space(the demo is 1.2gb and my 360 drive is maybe half full because I have some arcade stff, etc). I spent a couple of weeks thinking about if I should buy the full game or not, then thought, what the heck if I don't like it better it should be easy to trade in for the Halo beta, so I picked it up.First thing, I have to say is, I'm so tired of everyone comparing every non linear game to GTA. Sandbox blah blah GTA clone yada yada it gets so old. If I see the word \"sandbox\" again I think i'm going to scream. The GTA games are unique and trendsetting; games that came after them might employ some of their attributes but just because they do, that doesn't make them \"GTA Clones\" or \"GTA ripoffs\" Oy that makes me crazy.Now then, where was I? Oh yeah, Crackdown..as most other reviewers stated, the most fun is actually jumping around trying to find all the power up orbs whatever they're called. I haven't really worked on eliminating the gangs yet, don't really know any of the areas too well, but like someone else said, its really not worth the effort, to use vehicles and spend all the time driving around the big map, when you can teleport from station to station.Last thing I don't like-it frowns on you killing innocents, one of my favorite things to do in a game (I'm evil).

However, when I played the demo for DS2 I knew I would trade something in on release day.I am not disappointed.this game freaks me out. alot. I played it at night with stereo headphones and it both helped and harmed me. Helped because I had a better sense where some of the creeping uglies were at in relation to me; harmful because the sounds -- THE SOUNDS! it's horrifying. There are a couple of GREAT jump-scare moments, too.I was able to pick up on the mechanics of the game pretty quickly -- months of Borderlands and COD last year probably helped. The weapon types don't require you to be SUPER accurate, but once I mastered some attacks using the kinetic abilities I saw an improvement in my ability to stay alive. (Nothing like shooting off a creatures arm, immediately 'grabbing' it, and then launching it into the creatures leg/body/face.)I completed the game in 10 hours with only two sections of the game (toward the end) giving me some headaches. I'd warn people that even on normal there's a steep difficulty change in chapters 13 & 14. look around for nodes and cash -- focus on upping just 1-2 weapons as well as the stasis ability. it will make a difference in those late stages.Anyway, highly recommended game for people looking for a game that can scare you and reward your ability to shoot off creatures' limbs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

In this hot new Capcom title by Shinji Mikami and director Hideki Kamiya, you assume the role as Dante. Half man, half demon. His mother is a human and his father is a legendary demon that was well known for saving various lives in the past. Dante is a demon hunter that will hunt for any demon that threatens humanity, no matter how tough it seems. Many say he's a cocky character, but in truth, he really means what he says and he gets the job done in no time. After all, he does this for a living. And the coolest thing is, even if he gets stabbed by a giant sword, he will still survive and pull it out and recover in seconds. I don't really know how the story goes since I don't own the game myself. I just went to a local videogame store and played it for a while to understand every aspect to the game. The only thing I didn't get a chance to experiecne, was the story. According to director Hideki Kamiya (as recorded on Electronic Gaming Monthly: Issue 149), Devil May Cry was supposed to be a Resident Evil title, but the game's storyline and gampelay features were totally different from the RE series. So they decided to call it, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;. A nice move by the director behind the mask. Still, even if it was renamed, its high quality and great potential from the early Resident Evil series will be recognized in this game by Resident Evil veterans worldwide. If some of you gamers out there have already played such survival horror titles like Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, or any type of survival horror available (yes, especially that crappy survival horror game, Carrier), you'll feel right at home with Devil May Cry. But unlike the other survial horror titles where you character moves like a stiff soldier, Devil May Cry has slick character control. You get to move around freely without having to deal with dull manuvering or holding a button just to run. And the coolest aspect to the game is the combat system. You can finally bust out some combos on your enemies, and it's very easy to master if you happen to be a veteran of Capcom's fighting games or if you happen to study some of the moves from the Strategy Guide. Mainly you begin you combo by slashing your opponents with your sword and ending it with a rapid fire from your double guns. A very cool gameplay experience to survival horror fans. And to those of you who have played Konami's popular Dance Dance Revolution series from Japan, you will notice that the grading system in Devil May Cry is very similar to DDR's grading system. For example: if you happen to defeat your enemies at a short time or pass a stage without dying, you will get a high grade like an &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, or an &quot;SS&quot;. If you do poorly, you will get either a humiliating ranking of &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, or worse, an &quot;E&quot;. Anyway, lets talk about how the game looks. The graphics are superb and flawless, just like any Capcom survival horror title. The detail on the characters and stages look unbelievalbly jaw-dropping ! The stages are so creepy, so terrifying, you'll want to keep the lights on. And one thing you can say about the special effects...it's absolutely stunning ! When Dante gets surrounded by a purple light, he will run faster than ever, and it looks smoother when he runs at a faster rate. And the best part is, Capcom doesn't have to make a whole lot of sacrifices in animation and speed. Besides, this is the PS2 we're talkin' about. And the PS2 is totally unbeatable when it comes to good games (PS2 may be the best, but wait until the Gamecube comes !) and superior graphics. The greatest parts of the locked doors is that a giant ghost hand is guarding it, and if you get any closer, it will grab you, leaving a fairly short energy loss. The sound is excellent. The battle music totally suits the action very well and it will make you want to bust out a crazy combo to the beat of the track (Sorry ! I'm just crazy about bustin' combos when the battle music plays), including the normal RE-like music that you normally hear when there are no enemies at a certain point. All in all, Capcom's Devil May Cry is extremely hard to pass up. This is a must buy for all survival horror fans who have stuck with Capcom's early survival horror titles. Or if you're totally in need to buy a great action title that will definently heat up your PS2 game library, Devil May Cry will totally amaze you, leaving you in a deep urge to play it over and over again until you had enough !REMINDER TO ALL SURVIVAL HORROR FANS: If you think Devil May Cry is the best darn survival horror title to ever grace the PS2 system, Shinji Mikami will be re-creating Resident Evil for Nintendo's revolutionary Gamecube system with unsurpassed 3D graphics and improved control mechanics. In fact, all of the Resident Evil titles ever made, will come to the Gamecube. So what I suggest to all of you guys, is to buy a Gamecube, if you want to see all of the Resident Evil titles fully improved and enhanced. And hey ! Let's not forget about the long awaited Resident Evil 4. That one's comin' to the Cube as well !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2001"}

Every boss fight, regular fight or puzzle being solved all equate to massive awesomeness ... you blast, slash, and jump your way through the many levels, sub levels, and collect orbs to upgrade your gear and give you specials. Yes, this game is truly an awesome classic that sets it apart from the other games, way too awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2003"}

Sometimes I cringe at the idea of what might be, but hope keeps me coming back and buying. It's our special place, and even some of the lesser visits have been interesting from a looking around prospective. After Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3, I guess there will always be hope too, and I was glad I got this because I actually enjoyed Downpour. The controls are a bit clunky in my opinion (one directional pad hit pulls a gun, one downs a health pack) and the weapons can be redundant (how many sticks or bricks do you need to pass and check because \"examine\" comes up?). Still, it has its moments after it gets going. You have to wait for a bit for anything to happen, but it begins to pay off with odd characters and monster design. I recall thinking the roller coaster was creepy, for example, as well as further parts. Combine that with the weird sounds and you get some good atmosphere.I wasn't particularly thrilled with soundtrack choices here, and I've always been a huge fan of Silent Hill soundtracks. Picking up with Silent Hill 2, the soundtracks have been some of the most masterful videogame additions ever. Then you come to Downpour and Daniel Licht. Jonathan Davis instead of Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn? You have to be kidding me, right? If Licht thought this was a good choice, then he obviously missed something crucial in a few of the last games. The portal versions got her doing songs so this was a letdown. Licht's work on the soundtrack was good enough, it added some creepy elements, but those are some mighty big shoes to fill. (and i realize she has some work on here but some is not enough)There are issues in this game. Redundant enemies, issues with fighting, mini-games (I don't like the idea of mini-games in silent Hill. The game is hard enough to find your way through without the distraction sometimes.), checking items many, many, many times only to find out it's a brick or a bottle, the lack of Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. There are some good things too - creepy portions, in-depth backgrounds, some areas you can enter just to look around. Some puzzles are pretty good and some are downright annoying, like most Silent Hill games. It's a good entry, not perfect but it really is hard to expect one to be lately. I just wish they wouldn't screw with the soundtrack elements. They've always been the strongest point in all Silent Hill games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"What a surprise!","reviewText":"I have to admit that I didn't expect much from Silent Hill: Downpour after recent Silent Hill outings. Granted, I liked Origins, Homecoming, and the best of all recent Silent Hill's, Shattered Memories, just for the story, music, voice acting, and incredibly nice graphics for a third party Wii game. However, apart from Shattered Memories, which sincerely impressed me, no Silent Hill has come close to Silent Hill 2 for me. But that all changes with Downpour.First, let's get this out of the way, Downpour has some technical issues that can be annoyances, such as texture pop-in and framerate slowdown when it's loading or saving your progress. If these are problems for you that seriously detract from your experience, feel free to deduct a star from the score. Although Konami has stated that they're going to release a patch for both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 versions of the game, nothing has come yet and it's been months. However, I feel Downpour nails most of the rest so right that I can't help but feel very satisfied with the way this game turned out.Okay, so the bad, beyond the technical shortcomings, would be the enemy design. It's not scary and it's uninspired.That's the bad for me. That's it.Graphics: Excellent when running at a full clip. I especially appreciate the hi-res signs and maps in-game.Atmosphere: Incredible. This is a very richly detailed experience.Story: The most interesting story for a Silent Hill game other than Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill: Shattered Memories.Characters: Wonderfully acted and interesting.Soundtrack: One of the best you'll hear. The original soundtrack, the radio songs, etc. Top notch stuff.Combat: Okay, I admit it's not fantastic and can be a little unwieldy at times, but I really like the impact of the blows, especially when your enemy is down and you're taking it to them.The Payoff: I'll just say that I was very satisfied with how everything was tied together and came to a close.While Downpour isn't perfect, the story, characters, atmosphere, soundtrack, etc. delivered enough that any of the problems were easily overlooked when taking the entirety of the experience into account. Awesome game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2012"}

Granted, it is geared towards children somewhat, and isn't overtly difficult or mature. However, this is a really entertaining game with a lot to do.You play through key points in Star Wars episodes I through III, so you get to play some of the third installment before it's even out in theatres (if you get the game before then, that is). The translation between the films to the game (LEGO style) is spot on, and you'll remember and enjoy playing through all the key events.There's a lot of variety in this game. TONS, and I mean TONS, of extras, unlockables, characters, and different styles of play in different levels. There's even podracing! Each level just feels right and is fun to play. As you gain and unlock characters you can go back to a level and get items you couldn't reach before, because of the new character's abilities. Not only that, but there's a Free Play mode where you can just scour the level for currency and the like, or just to enjoy it again at your leisure.Also, there's an extremely awesome co-op mode. At any time another player can jump in and start playing right along with you, either as one of the characters in the current story (in Story mode) or just about anyone in Free Play mode. This really adds to the fun factor and never gets old. I love that they included this.Visual presentation is stellar. Everything is authentic Star Wars, yet authentic LEGO. It's really cool how well they did everything. On a technical standpoint, the game definitely isn't bleeding-edge or anything, but it isn't trying to be, and it looks really great anyway.  There are some nice effects (lightsabers, explosions, floor reflections) too. Audio is PERFECT Star Wars.All in all, this is a surprisingly fun game. With all the unlockables the replay value of this game is outstanding, and everything is a breeze to play. Not overtly kiddy, simplistic, or easy, people of all ages and tastes (even if you don't like LEGO or Star Wars) will get enjoyment out of this game. Don't be put out by its demeanor: you'll have a great time with this.I definitely recommend LEGO Star Wars as a buy for the PS2 or Xbox. The PC version has kind of clunky controls, and the co-op isn't as good. I haven't played the GBA version. The &lt; $40 price tag is nice as well.Go get LEGO Star Wars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2005"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player.

Blizzard","summary":"How Far Will You Go To Save Someone You Love?","reviewText":"Heavy Rain has been in development for over four years and it was time well spent.  This is a game that cannot be conveniently placed in any specific video game genre nor does it follow many typical standards for game play.  Having finished this game, I can say that this game, along with Infamous, Flower, and the Uncharted series, ranks as one of the titles that sets PlayStation 3 apart from the competition and will be considered one of the hallmark titles for the console.Story:  This game focuses very heavily on the story and I cannot give too many specifics or I will spoil it for you.  What I can say has been seen in the trailers, so it will not be very much of a reveal to talk about some aspects of it.  Heavy Rain is a dark, gritty crime drama whose story is shaped by four player controlled characters.  This is also a very adult game with mature themes and images.  The game starts off with one of the characters son's going missing causing the father, and the others, to race against time to save him and bring the killer to justice.  You alter the story by making certain choices during the story.  You can also hear what the character is thinking or feeling by looking at the dialog choices.  If the character is tense or frightened, they will shake and there is a time limit to how long you can see some choices.  This mimics reality in a way since you don't stand in front of a person and stare blankly for a minute while thinking up something to say or do.  The story can change in very drastic ways and, as such, there are many different endings with some characters.  I will leave it at that, going much farther could alter how you play the game.  Do not, under any circumstances, go to a site that lists trophies, has a walkthrough, or provides much in-game information.  Doing this will spoil the game, just let the story flow how you want it to.  Once it is over, then go and see what you've missed, but not during the initial play through.  You will want to play again since the story is rather short at about ten to fifteen hours.Gameplay:  This game is mostly quick-time event (QTE) driven.  You move your character while holding the R2 button and pointing in a direction.  When an event happens, a series of QTE's come up.  This often requires the use of every button on the controller and it's motion sensing capabilities. Normally, I cannot stand QTE's, but with Heavy Rain, they are easy to understand and see since the button is displayed on the item or person you need to interact with, which is where your eyes already are.  These QTE's will be the standard \"push the button before time runs out\" variety, with some that require you to tap a button or tilt, shake, or move the controller itself in a specific direction.  There are also puzzles where it plays sort of like Twister for your hand with you having to hold down up to five different buttons at once.  During tense, fast-paced scenes, the QTE's are easy to see on a small-ish SD television, but some of the slower button interactions can be difficult to spot.  This generally does not lead to a story altering event, but this requires you to closely explore all areas in the game to make sure you did not miss anything.  Although the game has QTE's it does not flow very quickly and gamers looking for fast-paced action constantly will not enjoy the slow nature of Heavy Rain.Graphics:  This game is gorgeous and should be played on a high definition screen.  The graphics are stunning and very life-like.  Sometimes you will see an occasional artifact or the characters move a little stiffly, but they are rendered very well and the developers clearly spent a great deal of time fleshing out the environments.Audio:  The music is very well done and in conjunction with the graphics, sets a tone that makes the game even more immersive.  Since Heavy Rain is very narrative driven, the voiceovers will have to carry the story.  Luckily, the actors voicing the characters do a very good job at it.  The only problem I have with their performances is that occasionally, some of their accents seep through or a British pronunciation of a word will be used as opposed to an American.Misc.:  I was very surprised with Heavy Rain, I thought it would be filled with annoying QTE's I would have to suffer through to watch the intricate story unfold.  Instead, the story is woven very well, even if it is a little clich&eacute;d in parts, and the QTE's aren't too difficult since they are easily spotted right where you are looking.  When the story was over, I had a blast and was on the edge of my seat in spots.  The developers have created a game with such atmosphere and relatable characters, that the gamer cannot help but be drawn in and genuinely care about what happens to them.  The game does suffer from the occasional graphical artifact, crashing (rarely for me), and trophy issues, but these can be solved with patches.  The story truly shines and parents, especially fathers, will empathize with what is happening.  Other gamers will also be sucked in too, but probably in a different way.  When I finished the game, I found myself wanting more, and the developers will release DLC to further continue the game.  I hope there is a sequel or prequel as this is a world whose characters I want to revisit.  This ranks as one of the best PlayStation 3 exclusive games I have played and is highly recommended for anyone who owns the system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Engaging Team-Based Play","reviewText":"Guild Wars has been touted as being revolutionary in several ways. For those that haven't read the game overview, these can be summarized as follows:1. Doesn't require immense amounts of time to be really 'fun.'2. Little or no time spent doing repetitive tasks and travel.3. Competitive guild-based play, with custom guilds.4. No monthly fees and dynamic content change/addition.The last point is of great interest to many people (myself included) in that this is the first MMORPG to be completely free of fees. However, everyone knows expansions are planned, so this is only 'kind-of sort-of' true.Though you don't do repetitive tasks like gathering food or resources, to find anything remotely useful you do have to kill enemies over and over again. Additionally, the travel waypoints are sometimes very spread out, so you are still going to do a lot of walking. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however (more on that later).The level cap is 20, and it's true that this doesn't make it very hard to become as powerful as you'll ever get. In PVP only mode, you start at 20, so you spend no time at all building up a character. However, this doesn't mean you can become level 20 overnight- it does take quite a while, and the quests are challenging enough that you will likely need (human) help.That said, this game is definitely built for guild-based play. The designers say that solo play is optional, but truth be told it probably isn't. Now that the main features have been addressed, a general overview of the game is in order.The only 'MM' part of the game is towns. While in towns you can see other players in the same district, form your party, trade items, start quests, and configure your skills (a maximum of 8 can be used at one time). You can also take along henchmen if you want to fill out a party or go solo.You can leave town one of two ways- by walking through a portal or by starting a mission. The missions address the main quest and often take you to major cities, thus saving you the trouble of walking. They also reward you with experience and skill points. Quests are separate from these, and reward you with experience, skills, and items. In general, the mission and quest design is well done, but you will find the occasional glitch- some of which can force you to repeat one. When in a quest area, a pointer will show where the next objective is.PVP can be done at arenas, and there's a level cap for each to prevent overly unfair competition. You get experience and (if you play enough) fame for winning matches. This is always a team-based mode, and teams are selected either at random or by party assignment. In RP mode, however, it's quite possible to get far superior equipment than your competition, and thus have a massive edge in combat. A winning team will continue to play matches, and the game doesn't seem very good at auto-balancing the parties.While exploring the wilds, you'll encounter many and varied monsters, which range in classes and difficulty. Most come in groups, and usually are too dangerous or numerous to solo. This is where my first complaint shows up. Frankly, the henchman AI is beyond pathetic, which is why playing with other people is generally advisable (on occasion, however, I've found human players that are worse in that regard than the henchmen. Such is life). If you're in a party, you'll divide the gold, experience, and spoils. This applies to henchmen party members as well.Exploration is really the meat of the game. I've done PVP, but it gets old pretty fast- especially if you keep ending up in a poorly balanced team, which seems to happen alarmingly often. You also get no loot for winning, and nobody really cares about fame. The wilderness areas are very well done, with excellent graphics and accompanying music. The world is massive, and the monsters are hard enough that you have to think about what skills you take- and what your fellow party members are taking. Unlike many other RPGs, a bunch of offensive-oriented people each doing their own thing will likely meet a very quick demise. Guild Wars really forces you to coordinate (especially with healing others and focusing to take down hard enemies) and punishes you if you fail to do so. I personally find this a welcome change in direction.If you should happen to die, you can either wait for a party member to revive you, or (if everyone's dead) you'll respawn at an altar. Sometimes these are placed in very awkward places, which does need to be addressed. You don't lose items, but suffer a 'death penalty' that reduces your health and energy up to 60% (15% per death). You can work this off by gaining experience, killing boss monsters, or completing mission objectives. Going to a town negates the penalty, and this is highly advisable if you get to 60%. Nevertheless, sometimes you really can't go back to town, because leaving an area causes all monsters to repopulate. This can lead parties to conduct suicide raids, in which the sole objective is to kill at least one more monster blocking the way to that quest goal. At times it can be rather frustrating- especially with the more difficult quests. Since the max level is 20 and many monsters are higher, even if you're an experienced player you will likely die scores of times doing quests and missions.As for character customization, you have a choice of skills in which to invest points (a max of 200, which each successively level costing more), and you can design guild capes and dye items various colors. This, aside from the standard appearance choices at character generation and of course equipment, is about all that makes you unique. If you decide you want to change your skills, you can acquire 'refund points' by gaining experience. These let you reallocate skill points. There are six classes to pick from, and you can have one 'sub-class' that gives you access to some skills from another. This is a permanent choice, so it's best to choose wisely.The classes in general are quite well balanced, but there is a 'paper rock scissors' arrangement there. That is, Rangers dominate Elementalists, Warriors dominate Rangers, Necromancers dominate Warriors, etc. If you know what you're fighting, there are skills designed to counter every other class, but some are necessarily better than others. Usually you'll learn what to pick the hard way. Fortunately, there's unlimited refund points available, and you can quite quickly rebuild your character if you decide to just junk it all.In sum, Guild Wars isn't an easy game. This is especially true if you're not a team player and don't like to make friends online. The bottom line is, this isn't a game for everyone. I personally like the party-based exploration and missions, but I know some others that despise it. If you haven't played in the beta and aren't sure which sort of player you are, I'd advise you to get the game and find out. Since there isn't a monthly fee, it won't hurt too badly to try, and- if you decide to quit- you won't feel like you're losing something you paid for by ditching your characters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2005"}

And while your ears are ringing, a new Splatterkill System lets you get your hands bloody!Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"An imperfect yet endearing gore filled treasure box!","reviewText":"Splatter-House has the rare distinction of being for kids yet not for kids. Aka much akin to Tales of the crypt, Lady Death, Vampirella, Creep Show, and Evil Dead it is the type of commodity that is somewhat immature yet has that risqu&eacute; offensive factor that calls out to our inner juveniles with a siren's sweet call!To catch you up Splatter-House is about Rick Taylor. Despite being a nerd and the all around average nice guy Rick managed to woo the super attractive college student Jennifer. The two apparently share a love of Heavy Metal music and paranormal research. As luck would have it Dr. West, a famous parapsychologist wants Jennifer to interview him. In a typically brainless manner all too common in horror movies Rick and Jen go to the super creepy West manor not suspecting the doctor has been turning other co-eds into monsters and summoning demons. Jennifer is kidnapped to be a sacrifice and Rick is gutted by grotesque creatures and left to die in a pool of his own vital fluids. It is at this pivotal moment a cursed wise cracking mask urges Rick to put it on. With a loved one in need of help and almost to the point of flat-lining Rick hastily agrees to the terms. A scrawny geek physique suddenly buffs up to look like a WWF wrestler as grievous wounds mend rapidly. Mask and man are bound as one and only they can stop Dr. West and save the damsel in distress!Yeah I know. The plot is as clich&eacute; as they come but in Splatter-House's defense its' following the original classic faithfully and isn't meant to be overly complex to begin with.If you read a lot of well written books you will be left scoffing at the absurdity early on. Dr. West has added longevity to his life span and regularly sacrificed the residents of the city for a very long time. You would think local law enforcement would be more uneasy. You would also think with all our cell phones and mini cams someone would have caught weird footage from the mansion leading to an FBI and military sting operation. Griping aside gamers should embrace the fact Splatter-House is deliberately campy. The mask is voiced by Jim Cummings (A beloved comedic voice actor whom was many Disney characters including Tigger and Dark Wing Duck) and he constantly delivers jokes that are crass toilet humor. Jennifer is given a few chances to escape but instead she feels the need to make odd gestures with her hands and scream her lungs out whilst not moving her legs one iota. Dr. West gets stabbed in the head by his own dagger and perceives it as a minor inconvenience that a few aspirin can alleviate. He even laughs good-naturedly at the injury! You get the feeling the cast in Splatter-house is gleefully hamming it up and are happy to stay within the confines of cheesy B-movie horror flicks.My biggest problem with Splatter-House is in many ways it doesn't even try to break new ground. It is the most bare bones action plat former you can get. As Rick kills The Corrupted he fills a blood meter. With the stored hemoglobin points he can buy new moves. There's the mask's \"rage gauge\" that allows Rick to heal himself by sucking the life essence out of nearby enemies and he can also hulk up into a more monstrous version of himself. Whereas other action plat former protagonists have special weapons or more finesse Rick is simply a butt kicking brawler. Elbow charges, huge pounding fists, various grapples, and easy to pull off brutal fatalities are his calling cards of choice. His arsenal is that of any dad or uncle with a love of guns and tools. Shotguns, wooden planks riddled with nails, cleavers, chainsaws, and lead pipes are his favorite things!Rick actually accumulates nasty injuries and there are instances his arms can be torn off. It's a good thing he regenerates quickly and I confess it's a morose delight to pick up my own arm (or someone else's) and beat my opponents silly with it! This is one of the more original dynamics in the game.The brawling itself in Splatter-House is mostly satisfying but the plat forming is hair pulling. There are some instances when you simply do not know where to jump. The side scrolling tributes to the original games are riddled with flame throwers, crushing mashers, conveyor belts, spinning blades, spewing acid, pit falls, and swinging chained wrecking balls that can kill you off rather quickly. The insult to injury is the load times are horrendous and the check points are unforgiving.Bosses and creatures are another high point. They all look fittingly \"Lovecraftian\" and it's fun to splatter their buckets of goop all over the screen. There are tougher foes that require quick time events but the developers made these very forgiving compared to other titles of this ilk. There's even a tribute to \"Biggy man\" the chainsaw armed antagonist whom was made infamous by this series many moons ago.The next low point for me personally are the environments. They all had potential but they're usually painfully linear and bland. While it's cool to impale creatures on pikes, punch eyeballs to reveal stairs, or microwave beasties to open doors nothing comes off as \"scenic\" or \"atmospheric\". The mansion segments were the highlights for me in that at least I got to admire the occasional pretty painting, walk amongst rustic comforts such as rocking horses, fire places, and stuffed animals, or mirthfully chuckle over the mounted heads on the wall. I really liked where that vibe was going but later on everything seems to become uncreative dungeons, organ infested living chambers, and industrial sprawls whence you are still stuck doing the same repetitive tasks to progress.The extras related to the remake are mildly entertaining. You can collect Dr. West's audio logs and piece together kinky pictures of Jennifer. Alas, there are better ways to fill in plot details and we've done these types of scavenger hunts in tedium throughout many titles in the past. The best part of all this is West's journal entries which are separate from the audio clips you find strewn about. He's painted as a tragic adversary whom merely wanted to heal people as a doctor and bring his beloved back to life yet he was slowly corrupted through his studies of necro-biology. We've witnessed this fall from grace in plenty of horror stories but it adds more depth to the proceedings all the same.All three of the original 16 bit Splatter-House games can be unlocked in their full splendor. This makes the few pains in the main package worth enduring if you're a retro geek such as myself.Ending the round up on a positive note I confess I dug the sound track. There's some great Heavy Metal going on and even a few moody orchestral pieces.After tallying the facts I will say I admire the team that brought me this. I know they likely didn't have a huge budget to work with but the re-make is very true to its' roots. This is a decent game to buy assuming you are into horror, dark humor, and have a soft spot for the lovable under-dog trying to save his girl-friend.Pros1# Simplistic yet stylistic graphics that are reminiscent of a horror themed comic book.2# The combat is nothing special but it is gruesome fun!3# As campy as it is the voice acting's surprisingly good. Even Rick and Jennifer sound likable.4# You can unlock the 3 original retro classics5# Quick time events are merciful6# Truly sic creature designs!7# In most places the camera can be controlled and rotated manually by the right analog stick.Cons1# The plat forming can feel flighty, clumsy, and frustrating until you get the hang of it.2# Load times after deaths are akin to watching grass grow.3# I had frequent frame rate drops and slow down.Subjective+/- Splatter-House has that punishing old school difficulty. The ground crumbles quickly beneath your feet often and you have to pay sharp attention to your environment. The game harshly reprimands the ignorant. The areas you're in put up more fight than the creatures themselves. Though I loathed this at first I started to like how it's a throwback of those really hard games of yesterday! This is a \"gray area\". Either you adore this type of sadism from your games or you don't!OverallFrankly there are better games of this genre out there. Lords of shadow, Bayonetta, Arkham Asylum, and Dark- Siders are much more polished and precise. This game is related to porno magazines stuffed beneath a mattress, Heavy Metal posters on the wall, and candy bars hidden in boot camp lockers. Aka it's self gratifying indulgence that appeals to us as a guilty pleasure on a primordial level.If you're a fan of Splatter-House this is a nostalgic revival. You get an up to date remake as well as all 3 classic titles which you unlock along the way. It's obvious the developers cared about the fan-base and that is a very rare quality this day and age.Though a could wax nostalgic on the topic of Splatter-house many days I cannot give its' most recent reincarnation a perfect score with a clean conscious. If you are already a Splatter-head you've likely already bought this but for the rest of you proceed with caution!The \"fun factor\" for me is a strong \"4\" but because of a few quirky technical difficulties I can only go as high as a \"3\" for the \"overall\" segment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players' perspectives.MultiplayerBeyond the deep single player mode,Lost Planet 2is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes and play options.

Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

Bisoshock is a sci-fi FPS set in 1960 in a decaying undersea art deco city of the future, where genetic engineering has unleashed madness and rebellion.  Unusual to the genre is the ability to make ethical decisions throughout the game which affect the ending.Bioshock was a runaway PC and Xbox360 hit last year(and a half?), and was used to showcase some of the new graphic touches capable with Vista using directX10, which worried me about the translation... the hardware and associated apps being wholly different things.I'm pleased to report that while some graphic elements are sacrificed or paired down ( that I was expecting), others have been added using the PS3's filter and shader libraries, and on the whole the gameplay doesn't suffer at all.  (purists have the option of unlocking the framerate buffer, which will allow the game to run at a higher clip, while sacrificing some anti-aliasing, etc.)Auto-Aim will probably be a welcome addition for the more casual gamer.  The hack minigame is a little clunky without a mouse (you have to swap out pieces to a swap box, then back in), but still serviceable. Online trophy support is available, not sure who's going to care without an online mode (yep, no online mode), but whatever.A note on sound: from when I owned the game on PC, my ears are much happier with the sound quality on this port. The stereo field is very tight and clean. The original PC version w/EAX effects always seemed a bit of a mess to me.60$ might be a little high for someone who's already played this game, but all the same, it's an excellent add to a PS3 gamer's library.Ports from different systems aren't done much better than this.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

I was one of the \"early adapters\" of the PSP when it came out, buying one at a Sony Style store in Vegas the day the PSP came out.  I bought half a dozen games on Amazon, played through 2 of them, and sold 3 of them online.  I was quite let down by the games, to be honest.  They were okay, but nothing that gave you the hushed (or not so hushed) shivering excitement when you laid your hands on that shiny new PS2 a few years back.So my PSP languished in the drawer for a few months, until I bought a 1GB card and figured out how to load DVD movies.  Then Sony came out with the 2.0 upgrade which turned on the web browsing funcionality.  Since then, I've been using my PSP more as a multimedia center than game machine.  I'm still waiting for some really cool games to come out, as I believe the PSP's gaming potentials have not been properly or anywhere near adequately taken advantage of.  But nowadays I can quickly convert a movie to play on the PSP.  I have a long commute each work day -- close to 4 hours round-trip -- so I find it gratifying to have a portable movie machine with me, especially as my 2-pound Sharp Actius MM20 laptop doesn't have a built-in DVD drive and doesn't have much disk space left.  The PSP is also small and light enough to carry anywhere -- although, to be fair, you might want to get a spare battery if you plan to use it for more than 4 hours on medium brightness.My PSP had one dead pixel (white, in corner).  A second unit I bought as a gift was free of dead pixels, lucky for the gift receipient.  I agree with the guys/gals who opine that the Core Pack is a better value.  Nothing in the Value Pack is worth the extra $50.  So go for the Core.Should you get a PSP?  If you have $200 to spare and have already gone over the DS-or-not hump, go for it.  It's a great little versatile machine that's fun to have, regardless of how you use it.  (Ladies, it makes a nice, cool-looking makeup mirror, too!)  I know people who use it for wi-fi in downtown parks or at Starbucks most of the time.  I also know of someone who downloads dirty stuff for on-the-go enjoyment; he's absolutely in love with this little gadget, I tell you that.  However you choose to use it, the PSP gives you that flexibility, that freedom.  Of course it's not cheap, but who says freedom comes cheap? :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2006"}

well, they're zombies, you have weapons, it's about zombie slaughter.you slaughter your way to new companions, but your companions are all lazy and timid, so they sit around in safe houses and urge you to slaughter your way toward the completion of various chores, tasks and quests on their behalf, some of the chores amusing and some of them tedious. you must either slaughter or run like the dickens all the way; you either slaughter, knock 'em down, or run like hell. if you're bored with that, you can rifle luggage and zombie corpses for loose change and wallets, which does add up if you're persistent. you can also pick up personal id cards and random newspaper clippings, although why you should do that is never clear.the slaughtering is not very complex -- you burn them, dismember them, run over them with cars, blow them up with propane tanks, decapitate them, stomp their heads in, beat them up, thwack them with clubs, axes and baseball bats. don't let your guard down, as there will be one or two zombies pretty much around every corner, guaranteed. shooting them doesn't have much effect, but that's ok because you get to shoot a few random groups of thugs and robbers, and the head shot works very well on them.there are five sandbox settings or \"acts\" in the game -- the beaches, cabins and main building of the resort hotel; the slums and sewers of moresby; the big jungle; the science laboratory and its jungle; a secret prison. you progress by slaughter achievements from one setting to the next. each setting has its own colorful crew of lazy timid people who have new slaughter things for you to do for them. eventually you crawl over every map and slaughter every zombie and hoodlum and meet the big guy for the boss battle.all along the way you don't have many worries. almost every building has a workbench where you can repair weapons for a price. if you're hurt, there's plenty of regenerating energy colas and snack bars to eat. but why bother? if you die, you just respawn in 5 seconds, and face the same opponent with all the damage you inflicted intact. die two or three times, and you can pretty much slaughter anything -- even the big boss guy. of course you do lose some cash each time you die (a penalty you minimize by splurging for weapons repairs first), and it's always more fun not to die and dish out some serious slaughter ... but you're not punished for taking the slaughtering and dying too lightly. after all, you're doing all this for lazy timid people ... you shouldn't *suffer* for it.the game is addictive, if you enjoy continual slaughter. the zombies are rather colorful in a drooling sort of way, and most of them are in swimwear at the resort, or native paint in the jungle. they make all sorts of mournful wheezing and grunting noises as they shuffle up to punch your face. however you have an irrefutable kick move that will stand them up for a head chop or lay them out on their backs, even the ones wearing football helmets. and then it's all about the slaughter. kick, slaughter, kick, slaughter; that's the secret.if slaughter isn't your thing, then there is a minor amusement in collecting weapons. there are all manner of swords, clubs, guns, cleavers, knives and brass knuckles to hunt down or receive as rewards from your lazy timid clients. these can be tricked up with batteries, wire, soap, rubber tubing and other detritus of disaster to make them more powerful or impressive. so that can be fun too, if the slaughter and cash pilfering thing gets wearisome.all along the way, the lazy timid people kept calling me \"you guys\" and \"friends\". i just thought they were nuts. but the cut scenes reveal that in fact it's four of you going on all these adventures -- a male black rapper (my avatar), a male loudmouth ex jock, a tarty black female cop, and a mousy female chinese hotel employee. even so, somehow you're the one doing all the slaughtering. maybe not in collaborative play, but in single play even your buddies are lazy, timid and nowhere to be seen when you need them. oh well, that just leaves more slaughter for you to do ... remember to kick first!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2011"}

It's so much more than that...","reviewText":"You've probably seen how revolutionary Super Mario 64 was on the Nintendo 64. Well, imagine if the game was separated into mini planets, and you see Mario soaring through the air as he was launched into the air. That, my friends, is Mario Galaxy.The game starts out with Mario roaming through a gorgeously detailed Mushroom Kingdom as he runs to Peach's Castle...for cake. But then, guess what? Not only does Bowser kidnap Peach again. He kidnaps Peach in a very epic cutscene! Unfortunately for Mario, a Magikoopa sends him flying into the galaxy, knocking him out.Now, the main game is playing through very big and graphical 3D worlds bouncing on Goombas, collecting coins, and all kinds of other stuff. But, like Super Mario 64, you must collect Stars. Collect enough Stars to be able to play in another world, or maybe have Mario tussle with Bowser. If you were to play the game, you'll notice that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is much, much deeper and more fun than I am describing it.The music is nothing like I've ever heard in a Mario game. I mean, seriously. Once I played the game until after I beat the first Bowser boss, I was thinking \"Oh, my god. These tracks are from a MARIO game??\". The music also breathes air into the spacey atmosphere in the game.The one major complaint I have with this game is that the 2-Player mode is stupid. There's almost nothing the second player can do to help the first player play through the game. Sure, he/she can collect Star Bits, launch them at enemies, and fling those...rubber..trees at enemies. But that's pretty much it. The second player doesn't even have his/her own character (Thanks, Mario Galaxy 2).But other than the 2-Player mode, the game is amazing. It is one of the best Wii games you can buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Charles H.","summary":"Elvis has entered the building!","reviewText":"I totally missed out on this one during that fabled era when the N64 was a modern console. FPS games were never my cup of tea, but out of vague interest, I picked a used copy of Perfect Dark up for my collection of N64 games.Story: It's hard to follow, at points. Basically, this corporation called Datadyne is up to no good, aliens are involved, and it's to Joanna Dark and the Carrington institute to save the day. The story is resolved at Campaign's end, but I'm told that the full story awaits those who complete the game on Perfect Agent.Control: Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter, and the controls work pretty well by N64 FPS standards. They're completely customizable, too. I prefer to play it with the analog for aiming and the C-buttons for moving, but you can do the opposite (which is the default setup) or even flip the thing around and use the D-pad. There's also the option to use two N64 controllers to simulate analogs, but I find anyone doing that hard to imagine.Gameplay: It's easily some of the best FPS gameplay to be had with this console. It's very similar to Goldeneye, but Perfect Dark has some finesse that Goldeneye did not. There is voice-acting, reloading animations, guards that hobble when you shoot them in the leg, and probably other things. Just think Goldeneye 2.0 and you've got a good picture Perfect Dark's gameplay.The multiplayer is top notch, too. You can add in bots as you try to shoot your friends. I prefer Goldeneye because of its Golden Gun mode, but Perfect Dark is right up there for those who lack that preference.Graphics: Age has hit these Rare FPS games like a ton of bricks, but they were quite nice at the time of release. Even now, Perfect Dark has moments of visual niceties. The Carrington Institute, the Datadyne level, the Submarine level, and the one where you're on the alien craft all look pretty decent even now. The plane crash level, alas... I don't think it looked good then. :P Outside of those highs and lows, you've got your standard N64 quality graphics, which have a certain charm about them to us retro gamer types.Music: It's nice. The individual tracks all fit the levels to which they correspond. There are many moments of awesome within the soundtrack.As with all Rare N64 games, there's a lot of replay value to be had with Perfect Dark. There are higher difficulties with additional objectives, (seemingly) smarter AI, and less available ammunition. I'm not sure if like this game enough to see it all the way through on Perfect Agent, but I'd certainly attest to its 5-star quality. Recommended to anyone who collects these sorts of older games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2012"}

According to the ratings on amazon, this game is better than Gears of War 2--not the case at all. There is minimal depth here. Although there are four \"campaigns\", they are each fairly short. Not only that, but only two of them are available on multiplayer, which makes no sense to me.Aside from that, this game is pretty fun and has a relatively high replay value. They did a great job with allowing players to drop in and out seamlessly, which is a very nice touch. There aren't a great deal of weapons either, but that's not a big deal.So although this is a fun game, its really not on par with some of the other great titles that are out there right now, and I think its been rated a bit higher than it should have been.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"The Offline Co-Op We've Been Waiting For!!","reviewText":"One of my largest criticisms of the video game industry is the real lack of offline co-op and multiplayer games in the next-generation consoles.  Pure would've been a great party game had there been an offline multiplayer.  Concurrently Battlefield: Bad Company and Far Cry 2, which were awesome single-player games, would have been even better if the game allowed a second player to join in on co-op.  There is online co-op with a few games but nothing serious.Offline co-op is not as popular as it was with the XBox since every video game developer thinks because World of Warcraft has over 10 million subscribers that the vast majority of gamers play online.  This couldn't be any further from the truth as the many developers are learning that casual gamers have become the dominating class, which has led to Nintendo's domination in video game sales for the past two years.  Most gamers just do not wish to play some random kid in Europe or some 13-year-old kid from Wyoming dropping f-bombs like the Allies in WWII.And let's face it here!  How many times did we wish Resident Evil games were co-op?  Especially Resident Evil 4 or the Outbreak series?  Zombies are fun to kill (again) and maim but doing it with a friend can be such a (non-gay) bonding moment for us guys.Enter Left for Dead.\"LFD\" was primarily advertised, and hyped at the latest E3 summit, as the great zombie co-op game not just online but offline as well.  Based almost primarily on this (that and I love playing as Vietnam veterans), my little brother and I saved up for this one so we could finally kill mass hordes together rather than one at a time while the other sits there patiently twiddling his thumbs.  We brought it to our home, put it in and were immediately taken in by the mass sound interacting with our Yamaha home theater.  It was, for a lack of a better term, really loud.We loved the introduction screen, which pretty much summed up the entire game: run, shoot a lot, help others, heal, run some more, shoot a lot more some at special bad guys, revive fallen team member, heal, run a short distance and get to \"safe\" point and prepare for round 2-4.  Simplistic, yet incredibly entertaining.  The levels are equally simplistic as the linear environments make the path to follow as easy as the aiming system, which is dead-on accurate.  There were many times when zombies would spill through a doorway and were quickly stopped because I took the Microsoft approach of \"point, click, and hold\" and their advance halted as quickly as it started.To me, this was a little disappointing as I was hoping for a more Resident Evil experience where you hoarde ammo and supplies in a true survival horror environment.  Instead, generic piles of ammo will refill your entire stock as many times as you wish (at least in easy and normal difficulty).  Medical kits are a little more sparse and healing requires you to spend about ten seconds without being interupted.However, this is not to say I did not enjoy it.  The gratuitous level of violence, which would make Terrintino retire since he cannot possibly achieve that level of awesomeness, was entertaining.  It was also great to see who got the most head-shots and did the most damage to the special villains.  The sounds and asthetics also stayed true to survival horror as you could hear the groaning of nearby zombies and the crying of special villains known as witches.  Be weary of them as they are NASTY.LFD's greatest plus is the promotion of team work over one-man-army super soldiers.  More often than not, first-person shooters promote the one-man-army mentality by having one person go up against legions of bad guys and emerge victoriously without so much as a scratch.  There have been very few (Brothers in Arms, Full-Spectrum Warrior, Conflict: Desert Storm, etc) that promote team work over solo runs but LFD makes, what I see, at the largest leap forward.  There are monsters that will lunge one allies and another person must \"save\" them by fighting off the monsters either on top of them or dragging them off.  Other times an ally is required to either revive or pull another ally from dangling over a ledge.  Unless the player is unprecedently good, a player cannot survive without help from his/her allies.The teamwork AI is balanced very well as allies will call enemies as they appear, provide fairly overlapping fields of fire, and assist you when possible.  There are some glitches where they will not help you but the majority of the time they will.  Co-Op wise, this really promotes teamwork and communication.  While playing with my little brother, I would make sure our fields of fire would overlap and we'd cover each other as we'd move.  He'd be on point with his shotgun on the left while I provided automatic fire one step behind on the right.Now, this game does have one or two flaws.1:  The co-op was, initially, a pain to set up.  Took us five minutes to set up but after that, no biggie.2:  There are some glitches pertaining to jumping.  There were some times, when we were supposed to jump over obstacles but could not due to getting stuck in the environment.  We have, so far, managed to get out of every one of them but when you're being swarmed by literally over three dozen zombies it becomes a matter of life and death.3:  There are some serious glitches pertaining to saving your allies.  While fighting on the roof of the hospital my character was thrown by a \"tank\" character and left hanging over the ledge, awaiting for an ally to rescue me.  HOWEVER, it was at the very beginning of the level where you are to jump off and not get back up so you could not retreat further into the level.  Unfortunately for me, my friends had already jumped down leaving me stranded and waiting to die.  Fortunately, a spwan point for survivors was nearby so they could instantly respawn me.  This happened one more time to another ally.  Such glitches should be avoided.All in all, LFD is a great offline co-op.  I always thought blowing up zombies would be a great way to promote family values such as friendship, loyalty, togetherness, and love of infinite ammo.  :)A solid 95%.  5% docked for glitches, lack of a backstory, lack of a Resident Evil experience, and lacking weapons.  They needed way more weapons.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}
{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"everything I could have expected","reviewText":"Stick of Truth is the first big release South Park game in over 10 years. When the show hit, Acclaim released a bunch of dreadful titles on N64 and PlayStation without the involvement of Trey and Matt and it showed. This time around, Trey and Matt got involved and the end result is a really good, funny game.First of all, as a South Park product, this is amazing. The voice acting is great. The town looks amazing. The in-jokes and references are constant and hilarious. The story and writing are spot-on. The graphics are perfect - it looks just like a TV episode. I haven't watched many episodes the past few years, but the in-jokes liberally reference the entire run of the show.As a videogame, it's not amazing, but it's very good. The game plays like a Mario & Luigi title. If you have played those games you will feel right at home here. There is an overworld to explore along with a simple turn-based combat system. The combat system uses a small set of skills and there is an element of timing in both offense and defense. It's a pretty easy game, maybe too easy, but the developers may have wanted the focus to be on the story than on the combat.Unlike most Obsidian games, this game is stable and smooth. Outside of some framerate problems on the PS3 version I am playing, I see no bugs or issues. This game really is a lot of fun, and I highly recommend it to South Park fans. If you, say, really like Mario & Luigi but have never watched an episode of South Park, I would say that you probably should watch it before you buy this. While this is a good game, it is first and foremost a South Park product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2014"}

Of course there will be something people don't like, but there are many mods out there to tweak it to your exact taste. Let me just say also I am not a RTS fan. I do not like \"whomever clicks the fastest wins\" games. Yes the battles are real time, but you have a \"pause\" and there is nothing to build when you are engaged in a battle. It's just about moving your troops. Each single soldier is represented on the battlefield. It's truly amazing watching your Legions march across arid deserts, snow covered mountains to engage the enemy and clash together right in front of your eyes.No other game can capture the scope of an immense battle like Rome: Total War can. Especially the battles consisting of many units, it's like an epic battle from your favorite movie.It is not purely the battles, it has a strategy element in it to where you will manage cities, build structures and conduct diplomacy. Diplomats in R:TW are extremly powerful especially if you have a lot of money. An extremly strong enemy army can be defeated with gold much easier than sending an army to oppose it.Overall, even if you are not a fan of Strategy or RTS games you will find this to your liking.

Once this information was revealed, it was an immediate concern for fans of the series who feared that Arkham Origins would not live up to its predecessors Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Fortunately, WB Games did a better job than I and many others expected. While Arkham Origins does possess some noticeable flaws that were much less apparent in the two previous games, WB Games has proven that they have what it takes to develop an overall great game all on their own without having Rocksteady do most of the heavy lifting. Overall, they get a solid B+ in Rocksteady's School of Gaming. Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel in the series showing a younger, less experienced Batman just two years into his crimefighting career. Most criminals still believe him to be a myth or urban legend, while others (namely the ones Batman has already beaten up) know better. The Gotham City Police Department is also on the hunt for the mysterious vigilante who constantly shows them up and makes life miserable for the largely corrupt officers who make up the department. The game opens on Christmas Eve with a breakout at Blackgate Prison started by Black Mask, who ends up killing the corrupt commissioner of the GCPD and causing general havoc in the prison. Batman attempts to interfere with Black Mask's plans, so the mob boss retaliates by placing a 50 million dollar bounty on Batman's head, which a number of assassins like Killer Croc, Deathstroke, Bane, Deadshot, and others are all too happy to collect. Batman is then given free reign to explore all of Gotham City as he hunts down Black Mask, the assassins, and other baddies who apparently have nothing better to do than cause trouble in the streets on Christmas Eve.Given that Batman is able to explore Gotham for the first time before part of it was walled off to form a prison, I was hoping to be able to experience saving civilians from thugs and villains like in so many of those Spider-Man games I have, but absolutely no civilians have been included in this game, likely because the developers were either not up to the task or were simply too lazy, and they use a nasty blizzard as a very convenient plot-device to explain why there are no civilians on the streets. Despite that somewhat flimsy excuse for the absence of civilians, the story for Arkham Origins is actually quite strong and compelling, comparable to the stories of its predecessors. The earlier parts are kind of slow, but a plot twist a little later on introducing the Joker as the true mastermind behind the night's events makes things a lot more interesting (that last sentence was not a spoiler, the Joker's presence in this game was known well before its release). Also, seeing Bruce Wayne's earlier relationships with Alfred and future allies Jim and Barbara Gordon really add just the right amount of drama and fitting foreshadowing. As an added note, the new voice actors they got for Batman and Joker are very decent replacements for Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, especially Joker's voice actor.Gameplay in Arkham Origins is largely the same as it was in the previous games, with a few tweaks here and there. First off, Batman can travel around the city just as well as he could before by gliding and using his grapnel gun to zip himself to ledges and rooftops. The area of Old Gotham that made up Arkham City in the titular game (before it fell into disrepair) makes up the northern portion of the map. A long bridge forms the middle portion, while the slightly smaller and flashier area of New Gotham makes up the southern portion of the city. Due to the larger explorable area, Batman can fast travel between different districts with the Batplane, but only after unlocking the jammed radio towers located in each district. In the spirit of the previous games, there are hundreds of collectibles to find left by Enigma, the original alias of the Riddler, in all the nooks and crannies of Gotham City. He left behind many datapackets (the precursors to the Riddler trophies) that have to be collected and relays that have to be destroyed (but thankfully no riddles that have to be scanned). However, there are a number of hidden messages left by other characters that have to be scanned with Batman's handy Detective Mode, which can be a challenge to find. A lot of the gadgets like batarangs, batclaw, explosive gel, smoke pellets, and cryptographic sequencer return, as well as a lower tech version of the disruptor that is aimed and fired like the remote electrical charge from Arkham City, and therefore requires better aim. There's also the glue grenade, which works exactly like the freeze blast from Arkham City, only it holds enemies in place with glue instead of ice.There are a couple of new gadgets as well. The remote claw lets Batman fire a retracting cable at enemies that can attach them to environmental objects, other enemies, or vantage points to damage or knock them out, but it's chiefly used to create a wire that lets Batman reach normally inaccessible areas or zipline through high breakable walls. The concussion detonator temporarily disorients and blinds nearby enemies to give Batman the edge during combat. The most notable gadget/weapon the Dark Knight acquires are the Shock Gloves: after beating on enough enemies, these gloves gain an electric charge that doubles the damage of Batman's punches and even lets him directly damage armored enemies, shielded enemies, and enemies with shock batons. Speaking of enemies, they're largely unchanged from the previous games, though there are a couple of new additions, mainly extra big thugs and martial artists who require a bit of strategy to defeat. The boss battles and other encounters with classic Batman villains are also quite fun, and a couple are rather challenging, although some are reminiscent of certain battles and encounters from previous games. The boss battle against Copperhead for example plays out very similarly to Batman's battle with Ra's Al Ghul from Arkham City, only with a darker hallucinogenic vibe to it. The encounter with the Mad Hatter plays out in a similar 2D sidescrolling fashion as the nightmarish encounters with Scarecrow in Arkham Asylum, although the Mad Hatter encounter is largely inferior. These similarities aren't necessarily bad, just a little too familiar, nevertheless I still had plenty of fun with the boss encounters.There are also plenty of side missions, with the majority of them having Batman going around Gotham and putting a stop to other villains' plans by destroying targets of interest, disarming bombs, or tracking down and rescuing hostages. For the first time ever in the Arkham series, there are also random crimes that pop up throughout the city that must be stopped. They include stopping gang fights, defending lowly criminals from police brutality, stopping ATM robberies, and defending yourself from ambushes. One other addition to the game revolves around crime scene investigations. They basically used the same crime solving techniques from Arkham City and expanded on them a bit. Like before, Batman can use his Detective Mode to scan for evidence like blood samples and bullet trajectories, only now he can virtually recreate the crime with his Detective Mode, rewinding and fast forwarding the footage to find even more previously unseen clues. An interesting gameplay mechanic, but not altogether game changing either. The only other change in this game revolves around Batman's acquisition of new gadgets and abilities. While most of them are gained automatically at certain points in the main story, certain gadgets and skills like the sonic batarangs and special takedown moves, as well as certain gadget upgrades, can only be acquired by fulfilling challenges in the game's Dark Knight System. These challenges are very much like the Riddler challenges in Arkham City, like gliding for long distances without touching the ground, taking out all enemies in a predator encounter unseen, or reaching a high multiplier count while fighting a large group of enemies. A lot of these challenges can be pulled off without even trying, but there are a few of them that can prove to be rather daunting or time consuming; fortunately, they're not necessary in order to get a 100% game completion. You can even have Batman fast travel to the Batcave at almost any time to get some practice in the challenge rooms, change his costume, or even chat with Alfred.A lot of this may sound like a lot of the same stuff from the previous games, and it largely is, but I personally find no fault in that. What I do find fault in are this game's technical issues. The game can suffer from noticeable framerate slowdown at times, normally when lots of enemies are onscreen or when Batman fast travels with the Batplane, and the game froze on me a few times as well. The slowdown happens enough that it can get annoying, especially when it interferes with combat or while gliding around. Also, the in-game menu is a bit cluttered and certain things like finding quickfire gadget instructions or bringing up the correct menu to show collectibles on the map can be frustrating. Finally, there's the Initiation DLC which includes 5 challenge maps. What makes this DLC different from all the other ones this game has is that it's a story-based set of challenge maps letting the player experience Bruce Wayne's intense martial arts training under Master Kirigi before he became Batman. You play as Bruce Wayne decked out in ninja garb and armed with new weapons like shurikens, a grapple hook, and caltrops, as well as a sixth-sense like ability called Concentration, which basically works like a \"natural\" and slightly limited version of Detective Mode. Aside from dealing with ninja-type enemies in both combat and predator encounters, certain unremovable modifiers that add time limits or make enemies stronger and tougher add to the challenge, not to mention a limited number of retries (running out of retries leads to a game over and you have to start again from the first map). Initiation was a fun DLC, although the price was a bit high for such limited content. In conclusion, Batman: Arkham Origins is not a bad game by any means, in fact it fits in well with the other two games in the series and possesses a lot of the same addictive qualities that will keep gamers coming back to finish just one more mission. However, the cluttered menu and larger number of technical issues keep this from being a leap forward from Arkham City, instead it's more of a cautious step sideways and a half step backwards (the graphics also lack the gritty detail of the previous games, but that's not a huge issue to me). Still, at its current price, this game is worth a playthrough for any fans of Batman or the Arkham series in general.**UPDATE**This part of the review will focus on Arkham Origins' second story-based DLC Cold, Cold Heart, which showcases Batman's first encounter with Mr. Freeze. Taking place several days after the events of the main game, we find ourselves at Wayne Manor with Bruce Wayne hosting a charity event for Gotham's high society citizens and presenting a humanitarian award to Ferris Boyle, CEO of Gothcorp. It's not long before Mr. Freeze, accompanied by Penguin's henchmen, crashes the party and starts freeze blasting everything around him, then he goes after Ferris Boyle. Bruce suits up and takes action against Mr. Freeze and his thugs until Freeze escapes with Boyle, with Batman in hot pursuit. The rest of the game takes place in the southern portion of Gotham City from the main game (New Gotham), with the southernmost district (Burnley) blocked off by ice; the northern portions of the city, namely the bridge and Old Gotham, are also blocked off. One new location within New Gotham that Batman will explore as he hunts Mr. Freeze is the Gothcorp building, where the frozen villain himself first came to be. Batman starts out with the same gadgets as in the main game: batarangs, batclaw, cryptographic sequencer, remote claw, Shock Gloves, and so on, although the glue grenade is no longer available since it has proven to be unstable. About halfway through the campaign, Batman will don the bulky and totally awesome looking XE (Extreme Environment) Suit to help protect him from the extreme cold conditions normally associated with Mr. Freeze. The suit comes with Thermal Gloves, replacing the Shock Gloves, which actually serve the same function in combat, although they are also used to break through certain ice barriers and to thaw out a number of victims scattered about the city who have been frozen by Mr. Freeze's henchmen. The new suit also comes with thermal batarangs, which can be used to break through ice covering certain switches and vantage points, as well as detach large icicles from ceilings to have them fall on patrolling enemies.The enemies Batman faces are the same as in the main game, mostly thugs with knives, body armor, and shields, though there are the occasional brutes and martial artists. One new enemy type are the thugs armed with their own cryogenic guns similar to Mr. Freeze's. Fighting these guys amidst a large group of regular thugs can make things challenging in a fun way, especially since it's possible to dodge these enemies' ice blasts and have them freeze other surrounding enemies instead. The usual predator sessions are peppered throughout the game, with a couple of them proving to be rather challenging, as well as a couple of crime scene sections to help round things out. Aside from the frozen victims that must be rescued, there are also some riots started by Anarchy's henchmen that must be quelled, as well as more hidden Anarchy tags to find with Detective Mode (and they're as challenging to find as before). Completing these side missions provides a few upgrades to Batman's gadgets, though they're not actually necessary to complete the game. It should be obvious who the final boss battle is against and it's a satisfying, if familiar, encounter. It's a two part fight that borrows elements from the boss battle against Mr. Freeze in Arkham City combined with the predator encounters against Deadshot and Black Mask in the main game of Arkham Origins. While not wholly original, the final boss battle was still fun. The story, while nothing new to those who have watched any episodes of Batman: The Animated Series featuring Mr. Freeze, was still well done and had my attention from beginning to end, largely since I've always found Mr. Freeze to be one of the more interesting and sympathetic of Batman's rogues gallery. Personally, I find Cold, Cold Heart to be the best DLC of all the Batman games. Compared to Arkham City's DLC (Harley Quinn's Revenge) and the other story-based DLC for Arkham Origins (Initiation), Cold, Cold Heart was the most complete and worthwhile DLC of them all. If you only play one DLC in the Arkham series, play this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"K.

Set in the original 60's Bond era, the game features movie-based missions as well as original, action-intensive sequences, a broad and deep variety of gameplay, fully-integrated vehicles, social multiplayer experiences, gorgeous women, and classic, upgradeable weapons and gadgetry with modern mechanics.","reviewerName":"W. Scott Heitman","summary":"Dissappointing \"Spiritual Sequel\" to JB: Everything or Nothing","reviewText":"James Bond: Everything or Nothing easily ranks somewhere in the 10 best PS2 games I've ever played.  Since I've played in the neigborhood of 150 PS2 games, that's quite a compliment.  Why is it, that From Russia With Love- the spiritual sequel to EON- feels so mediocre?  Actually, it's pretty easy to figure out, and I'll outline it as follows.The beginning to EON featured the added flair that the Bond movies have had ever since Brosnan started with Goldeneye.  Following this was an original song sung by the talented Mya.  The fact that an artist had been commissioned for an original song was just impressive.  With FRWL, we have a very lackluster opening and some rehashed theme.Admittedly, the story to FRWL comes off with a reasonable degree of fun, but the gameplay has been unbalanced and utterly drained of the things that made it fun.  First of all, the game is a good deal easier- and it's not because I've gotten better at this type of gameplay.  I remember having a difficult time with the second mission of EON on 00 Agent difficulty.  Even from the beginning, the game force the player to consider tactics and ration their weapons carefully.  With FRWL, from the first mission, I found that \"Rambo Style\" was a very possible style that could be used almost all of the time.  Armor was handed out like candy and worse, the armor could be upgraded.The level design has also suffered.  EON's level design was brilliant, enemies attacked you from all sides, but the mechanism used for cover was smooth and well-implemented.  Thus, firefights were always interesting.  FRWL has a lot of boring hallways and rooms.  More importantly, many of the environments are glitchy.  Don't try focus shooting an enemy over a foot high hedge...an invisible wall will block your bullets.  Don't try flying the mini-Q copters anywhere but the intended ducts...again, you will encounter invisible walls.  The more I play FRWL, the more I realise that while EON had fully rendered 3-d environments, corners were cut with FRWL so that the environment is flat-out less interactive.Now for some specifics: Many little things just don't feel as cool with FRWL.  The grappling/rappelling looks far less cool than it did in EON.  Moreover, the fact that little dots denote places where grappling or rappeling can be done destroys some of the immersion and reminds me I'm playing a game.  With EON, you merely had to run off of a ledge to automatically rappel- WAY cool.Another thing they screwed up is the targeting.  The targeting feels more constricted this time, as if they were making the game more for unskilled gamers.  EON featured a very cool slo-mo focus mode where you could pick specific targets or environment objects and sometimes trigger VERY cool bond moments.  FRWL has gotten rid of this in favor of a different, poorly implemented focus mode where the player can shoot items off of enemies.  The horizontal axis on this mode is inverted, making it unnecessarily confusing.  Furthermore, this mode isn't always responsive when you DO correctly shoot something.  The result is that you're just better off run-and-gunning everything.The game also simply comes across as buggy on a number of levels.  You'll find that you accomplish extra objectives on a level only to discover that the game lists them as incomplete when you finish the mission- Bond moments are really bad in this regard.  And there are other little things...As bad as all of that is, I have a bigger complaint.  EON featured a brilliant single-player mode, but the multiplayer was just as good.  In today's overcrowded market of deathmatch multiplayer, EON offered Co-op gameplay.  Even better, the co-op mode featured a campaign of original levels entirely separate from the single-player.  The levels were VERY well-designed to encourage cooperation between partners.  I put countless hours into this mode with friends.  FRWL replaced this with a tired deathmatch mode that doesn't stay interesting for long.  The entire draw of multiplayer in a game that has auto-aim must originate from tactical strategy, and it is Co-op, not deathmatch, that showcases these strengths.Finally, EON had much more replay.  Once players beat levels on the highest difficulty, platinum objectives were unlocked.  Once these objectives were completed, cheats, artwork, and other things were unlocked.  FRWL has very little in terms of unlockables and offers only 4 extra story-less levels in terms of replay.The only good things I can say for FRWL are that the story works and that the score (by 24's Sean Callery) is superb.  Hopefully, EA will realize from the negative critical consensus that FRWL was a wrong step and work on alternate ways to solidify the brilliant formula devised in EON.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

Fun, beautiful, mature, the complete package.","reviewText":"Too bad this game isn't selling millions, because it's a great game.  Oh well, UBI  Soft's loss is our gain.  Just check out that price!Made by the creators of Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil features the same quirky style but aimed at old audiences. You play Jade, a photographer living on a planet under attack from aliens.  She suspects the military is conspiring with the aliens instead of protecting everyone, and joins an underground newspaper to find out the truth.  I liked the above-average maturity of this games themes of family, love, and loss during a war.Gameplay is fun, if not a little generic, but the overall package is wonderful.  Jade's main purpose is to sneak through military bases and take pictures to expose the conspiracy.  As a side-quest, she also collects pictures of animals throughout the world.  Jade fights with a staff and plastic disks, fun but utterly forgetable.  The hovercraft, however, is insane fun, a racing engine where you feel out of control even when you aren't, and the developers wisely made the hovercraft about 50% of the whole game.It has a very parent-friendly shine that tones down the violence, which is probably the reason it didn't sell well - the gloss robs the game of some personality.  The main character fights will a staff and plastic disks instead of guns and bombs.  Funny thing is, the end result is the same, the bad guys are killed violently, so what have we really gained from this approach?  It's mostly not important, but this game has a slight &quot;preaching&quot; tone, so you will probably think about it at some point while playing.There is a ton of personality in this game, little details, mini-games, story moments, but the game is very short, about 10 hours long.

It's like watching a movie.  Unfortunately, it's also like playing a movie.  The storyline is too linear for me.

Sure, you can go back and find all the treasures, but you are always going to be playing the same story every time.  Also, the controls can feel very awkward at times.  I've spent countless \"redo's\" just trying to get to an upper ledge or some sort of thing like that.My final thought is that this is an amazingly produced game, but I wouldn't buy it for more than $40.

They spent all their time on in game graphics and gameplay, instead of cut-scenes like a lot of other game companies seem to be focusing on.

It didn't. The only thing that thickened was a knot of muscle in my shoulder caused by constantly flicking my hand at the screen. I also expected the promised musical interaction to at least lend a bit of fun to the shooting. The musical changes were minor at best and the driving score never paused for more than a millisecond. I played it a couple of times and that was it. I sent my 12 year old neice a copy and her response was, \"well, there are lots of colors\". She quickly adandoned it after playing completely through in an hour or so. She hasn't touched it since. It would have been more fun if they'd dropped the shooting aspect completely and created a game that linked sound and motion to exploring the environment.

This game really blew me away.  I had heard some mixed reviews on this game, but any negative remarks seem to be from long time fans who didn't care for this games more action oriented styling.  Having played all four of the campaigns, I would say that one of them was definitely action oriented, but the other three were more of the survival horror that the series roots started with.  I absolutely loved the intertwining story that plays out over the course of the four campaigns.  I thought it was really inventive and pulled off perfectly.  The graphics were excellent and this game had some of the best cut scenes I have ever seen.  Gameplay was also really fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Q","summary":"An enthusiastic, blind-following Resident Evil fan, no more.","reviewText":"This is probably one of the best Left for Dead games. What? It's a Resident Evil game? No kidding? Well then...First, and foremost, it's tough not giving this title at least three stars, but, not wanting to play the game (after only three hours of game play) compels the score (I also looked at other reviews to see if it would get better - not so much). So...This game has upset me so much, I am at a loss for words - two specific words. Gerbstible and tarkingblark. This game is a steaming pile of tarkingblark, that came out of Capcom's gerbstible!But, let me start, like Tarantino, too far before you probably care to listen: Resident Evil was the first game I had the pleasure to own and play for the original PlayStation. Being a huge Romero style zombie fan, and my first Survival Horror experience, it was like mana from heaven, or from a Ether potion won in a battle near the castle of Baron. I've followed the series through dramatic changes, the slow decline of engaging content from the first to the third, to the introduction of full 3D in the fourth and fifth, yet at the loss of zombies. While disappointing, I rolled with the punches as it kept what made the original so successful - being a great, if not the greatest, survival horror game. With Resident Evil 6 I expected a \"Resident Evil\" style game, so much so I pre-purchased it, and didn't bother with the demo. I was looking forward to similar game play as the series had always offered. It did not deliver. Instead of a survival horror what was made was a twitch-action first person, stage based shooter.I was excited to see that they brought back zombies, that is until they started shooting and leaping at me! They are more like apathetic, lazy mercenaries. You know, union mercs. There has always been an argument between running zombies, such as in Left for Dead, versus those that shamble, as in Resident Evil - err - pre-this one. Now, well, should they shoot, dodge your aim, run, jump, spit, play chess, and perform appendectomies? OK, so I am just guessing at the last two, anyone get to the last stage yet?Survival now is simply how often you kick zombies, versus shoot them. There really is no concept of conservation - no saving bullets. YOU WILL RUN OUT OF THEM. In previous REs, the player had been rewarded for accuracy, and planning ahead. In this game, even the concept of the quintessential \"single head shot kill\" has been removed - one shot takes off HALF the head, the other the rest. Wha!?The graphics, well, they are pretty fantastic. And the controls are VERY nice! They added this leap backwards thing, where you jump onto your back, can aim and shoot, while able to roll left and right, slowly slide backwards, or quickly leap to your feet, as well as having a very nice cover system. Unfortunately, you will never get to use them as this game is more a game of endurance than strategy or accuracy. Constant taking damage, dying, and retrying. I fired more bullets in the first stage of Leon's story than I had ever done in any single entire play through of a previous Resident Evil. There is no longer the \"double tap\" moments I loved - you can't preemptively put down a seemingly destroyed zombie laying on the ground or in a chair. They lie there, immobile, until the game WANTS you to engage them - no incentive to think or plan ahead. So often a zombie I NEW would jump up and grab me, HAD TO. No way around it.The inventory system is pretty horrible, possibly the worst yet for the RE series. But this has very little baring on this review - I would have dealt with it, and still have loved it if it was a true survival horror.They have many different kinds of zombies now - a screamer who causes you damage when they scream, and makes you grab your ears, becoming vulnerable, a huge fat one that takes an amazing amount of bullets to take down (who only seems to show up in cramped quarters where you can't help but get constantly pummeled), a large strong brute-like one that requires being hit in a specific spot to kill quicker, a spitting zombie, a zombie merc who has a machine gun, so many more - if you told me this was a sequel to Left for Dead, I would be less surprised. And all of these (plus more) even in just the first stage, constantly.The stages are entirely linear - you will NEVER back track. Grab it or loose it. It's clear - progress - clear, repeat.A survival horror game is really a strategy game. And when a game changes genres, as I believe Resident Evil 6 has, so dramatically, especially such a long running series, you have the right to feel let down, as I do now.As another review pointed out, if they had called this Raccoon City 2, I would not be at all disappointed in this product. I would have never purchased it, as I really don't like action shooters, or maybe I'd waited for more reviews, tried the demo, or, simply, put less faith into this product.This review was difficult to write - my keyboard is wireless and needs charging, oh, and I was so mixed in that the game probably is a great -something-, just not a great addition to the series. Resident Evil 6 will be the first game in a decade that I will sell. It might be the last Resident Evil game I play. It will definitely be to me a cautionary tale in expectations, and the negative value of pre-orders. Thank you Capcom for the many great years, but we've obviously grown apart, and in two different directions - you decided to appeal to a new, very different audience, I decided, hey, I should read more. A final note, I'm in the gaming industry, and RE was a pretty big factor in that career choice. So if my disappointment seems exaggerated, to me it's not. I've had this fear that the gaming industry is heading down the path of quantity over quality, placating to the masses over creating true, inspiring, artistic content. Game developers, and video games, are truly my favorite art form (suck on that Dali). Like an art form, such as music, when an artist changes their style to something entirely different, for example, imagine Sting becoming a rapper, or U2 operatic, or perhaps Lady Gaga becoming talented, well, it's natural that new audiences may come, but definitely, those that stuck with them when they were standing so close to you, or not finding what they are looking for, or, uhh, what ever Lady Gaga sings about, well, they will harbor resentment, and get their gerbstibless out of the tarkingblark. And that's the W0rd.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}

Unfortunately, she would only let us play the game once a week for one hour because of the violence.  We loved the game so much, but for some reason (probably because we were tired of only being able to play once a week) we ended up selling it to our neighbor and never saw it again.  However, I recently ordered it from Amazon so I can relive the thrill.I am not disappointed.  Although it's been many years since I've played Killer Instinct, it holds its own even against modern fighters like Mortal Kombat Armageddon, Soul Calibur II, and Guilty Gear XX Accent Core.Each character has several special moves at their disposal, and they have quick/medium/fierce punches and kicks.  The combos you can link are absolutely insane, and unlike any I have ever seen.  There are also No Mercies which are like the fatalities of Mortal Kombat that can be used for a really cool finish once your opponent is on their last breath.  You can also perform Ultra combos that reach over 20 hits in a row at a minimum!  Also, Ultimate combos are executed when you do a regular combo, put the opponent to zero HP (at which time you can still continue the combo if you so choose), and then perform the No Mercy at the end.  The smooth motions are fun to watch as you string a variety of moves together to perform insane assaults on your opponent.The graphics are awesome for the SNES.  The characters look really cool, and the enviornments are beautiful.  Killer Instinct has some great music too.  If you get the CD with the game, Killer Cuts, you'll be able to hear better/fleshed out version of the songs.  It doesn't get any better!The game supports an Arcade mode in which you fight all of the characters in succession and ultimately fight the boss of the game, Eyedol.  A training mode is available, as well as 2 player mode and a tournament mode for multiple players.  There are 6 difficulty levels, but none of them are particularly easy.  This game is definitely for skilled gamers or those who are willing to put in the effort to learn the game.  From the first opponent in the arcade mode you have to put up a serious fight to attain victory.I love how complex the combo system is, and the challenge level (although sometimes frustrating) really motivates me to get better and better.  If you want a deep fighting game with great mechanics, cool characters, and is a true classic, then this game is for you.  This was a gem that no fan of fighting games should pass up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2008"}

The update process uses a very sophisticated system, it closes the game and opens Internet Explorer.  Given that even one-man business (like Baseball Mogul) manage downloads within the game, this is not impressive.  At least you don't have to remember to type \",8,1\".Stardock then fails to recognize the serial #.  There was only one \"1\" and two \"0\"s, so it didn't take long to try the variations.  The entry form does not contain separate boxes for each number grouping, and it does not explain whether to manually type in the dashes.  I tried both.  I Tried to login (I own other games of theirs), and it timed out repeatedly, though my connection was fast and functioning fine.  This last could be just bad luck, but it fit the experience.

Watching my brother play it, I didn't think it looked all that great, but the music was catchy and the battle system looked interesting so I bought it...WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS......Well, the music is allright at times, but only at few certain times. Most of the time it is standard at best, and that's the games high point, along with graphics of course.I won't lie, the graphics are great, but who cares about graphics in an RPG? I dont... The storyline was where the horror all started...Blitzball? Please...couldn't they have come up with anything better? This game is a prime example that SquareSoft (now \"Square Enix\") is horribly running out of ideas and is seeking the road of desperation. Surprisingly, this game is made by the team who made 8, which is amazing. I mean, 8 is my favorite FF game next to 6, and I cant believe that team made such a horrid RPG. Sure, there are similarities, such as realistic characters and a story that is more involving of the characters themselves, but come'n, FFX is a tragedy. The worst part of the game, the part that killed it for me, was the Sphere Grid. Oh man, where do I start? Basically, you sit there for long periods of time moving a cursor around this big dark grey/blue \"sphere grid\". It is incredibly boring, making you constantly click on different \"nodes\" and move there, and then use certain items to gain abilities. And what happened to leveling up? I guess the geniuses decided to take that out as well. It is really pointless, because now EXP is taken place by AP, which is a substitute in disguise. Battling seems much more tedious now, and you never truly feel that your characters are getting better, especially when you consider how long it takes to master this game. The sphere grid is just TOO big, and too boring. If I wanted to be bored I would play Mist or Halo, or some other computer game. It was cool to be able to play as summons, I will give them that, but when its better playing as a summon than the actual character you know something has got to be wrong...Just avoid this game at all costs, unless you want to waste a bunch of your life moving a cursor around a sphere grid...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2005"}

Since plenty of people have written in-depth reviews of the original, I'll just hit the high points: An engaging plot, a turn-based battle system that is both intuitive and strategically complex, and a variety of locales and missions that keep things from monotony, but an annoyingly high rate of random battles and an awkward system for leveling up super moves (Not in difficulty, but in finding items - Moonberries - to let you level up moves; i.e., how often you use a move or train your character is irrelevant in terms of learning new moves. This is odd, because you can 'learn' spells by fighting with weapons attuned to the type of spell.).This Gamecube port is pretty much the same game, but with added features. Most notable is Hamachou Island, which previously was only available as a Dreamcast Online download. This is significant because it is the location of the 30th \"Cham,\" which allows one character to fully level-up their weapon. Previously, your only options for maxing it out were to sign up for the Dreamcast Online service while it was up or to play the VMU game that you automatically got about 2-3 hours in and hopefully find a Cham in there.There are also a lot of added side quests and discoveries, which add some nice frills while leaving the core of the game untouched. The game is still very linear, but now there's enough going one that you don't feel quite so funneled into a set course of action (even though you really are).Finally, I like how a new side quest (and new boss!) somewhat explains how and why that crazy Zlivan Bane guy turns up throughout the game, even in places that you were supposedly the first to set foot in...Overall, the game makes some minor tweaks on a great game. While the same annoyances remain (with the exception of the missing 30th cham), so do all the things that made this game great, plus a few more things to keep you occupied for another couple hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2009"}

Tracks are too few, and not very interesting.  Really need more variety and alot less super twisty tracks.  Turn 10 needed more speedways, and less King Cobra type road courses.Also don't help that the AI are horrible drivers.  Racing is a game of giving and taking.  I just wish the Forza 2 AI learned when to give ground when they are outbraked into the corner, or just much slower than you are.  The AI also is way too overaggressive to the point they will drive through you at any given time.  This happens alot if you ramp up the difficulty that forces you to break much sooner to stop from locking up your brakes.  The AI also is quite slow in their cornering.  It gets quite irriating wiping out as the AI for some dumb reason brakes on the exit of the corner instead of hitting the gas.The damage seems a bit unrealistic.  Even on the highest settings it seems more arcade style damage than anything else.  A car shouldn't be competitive enough to go for the win after smoking the wall at 100 mph like the Forza 2 cars do with full damage on.  I don't see the point of having damage if your going to use it more towards a gimmick move to promote sales.  If your going to have racing damage do it right or don't do it at all.  Forza 2 seems to go about half way and stop.Its nice that they let you do cool stuff to your paint job.  Wish they would have a spray brush option to do some fine tuning instead of doing everything with decals on top of decals.Overall a good racer if all you have is the Xbox 360.  I'd honestly suggest the GT series over the Forza series.  Not as a fanboy, but from the fact the GT games are more better rounded on all fronts.  The Forza series seems to go half way really good then seems to rush through the other half for some reason.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2007"}

Garrelts","summary":"First Person Shooter Perfection","reviewText":"I've had this game for two days now and have managed to get pretty far into the single player story mode and played several online matches - and I'm happy to say this is one of the best FPS games I've ever played. Call of Duty has always provided an intense single player mode taking the perspective of differing soldiers - in this case a Marine Sergeant and a British SAS commando. Straight from the beginning the action is top-notch, you'll soon learn that charging the enemy will lead to your death. Sound tactics and methodical movements are key. I own the PS3 version and where other ports have failed on the PS3, Call of Duty 4 shines as an example of what a good developer can accomplish on Sony's system. No dips in framerate, gorgeous graphics and perhaps best of all, surround sound that truly kicks butt! Two very minor gripes about this game would be the short single player outing - around 8 hours from what I'm reading and some of the online matching can take longer than other games to connect. However, giving credit to the quality of the game I will definitely be playing the 'story mode' more than once and hopefully a future patch will speed up the online play. Highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of shooters or anyone looking for a 'AAA' PS3 title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2007"}

I had heard a lot of great things about this title, and I loved the other Call of Duty games. I was a little disappointed in the campaign though. It was short, and while it looked great the story was a little less than I wanted. The graphics look amazing, and the game play has some great FPS mechanics. It does have one of the most memorable online experiences. Even though I normally don't like online it did keep me addicted for a while. Overall a good game, but I have no intention to beat the campaign again. The sequel does look pretty epic.Presentation- The game looks pretty good. The menus are average; the music is uplifting and epic. There are no cut scenes which hurt the overall feel of the campaign. 4/5Graphics- The graphics are the high spot of this game. They look amazing for a FPS. The sniper level looks amazing. It has great photo realistic graphics that impress at every turn. 5/5Story- The story was not that in depth, and the lack of cut scenes made it hard to get the whole story. The nuke sequence was a pretty good idea though. I hope Modern Warfare 2 doesn't continue the story of this game because I can't even remember it. 4/5Game play- A well developed shooter, and there are few things to gripe about. The game play is smooth. I wish they would add a cover system, other than that no complaints. I wish the campaign was longer though. 4.5/5Lasting Appeal- This game does have surprising lasting appeal. The online has kept me involved in the game even if the campaign did not. I hope in the sequel that there is a decent campaign to keep me hooked as well. 4.5/5The Verdict: This game I believe is a little over hyped. It was a decent shooter with amazing graphics and interesting online modes, but the campaign suffered. Still I recommend you pick this up before Modern Warfare 2 comes out. 4.4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"SP Campaign Disappointing...Could've Been So Much Better","reviewText":"I've been playing the Single Player CAMPAIGN portion of Battlefield Bad Co now for several hours and I REALLY wanted to like this game, but I can't wait until it's OVER...In fact, I might not even finish it before it goes in the \"sell pile\".  This is a complete MESS of a game that should've focused more on player FUN.  The pieces are there, but the polish is MISSING.  I can sum up the SP Campaign for you rather easily:If you like picking up a generic handheld weapon, jumping into a military vehicle (soon to be your coffin), riding around the countryside listening to BAD Russian Instrumental Country Music on the radio or your 3 moron buddies endlessly trash-talk each other until one of them stuffs a sock in the other's mouth, repeatedly coming up against superior enemy weaponry, then DYING and respawning way back at the previous checkpoint for the nth time so you can go all the way back to the same superior enemy weaponry so you can DIE and respawn again and again...UGGGHHH.  This is a game with so many great pieces and just downright AWFUL GAMEPLAY!Battlefield has some comical characters as your buddies...But the fun ends there.  They are absolutely WORTHLESS when you come under fire.  They can man a gun in a vehicle or boat WHILE YOU DRIVE, and that's about it.  You pretty much have to take out EVERY approaching enemy on your own.  And I don't really have a problem with that AS LONG AS I'm given the proper weaponry to do the job.  About 80% of the time in this game you'll come up against a Russian Tank, Armored Vehicle, Attack Chopper, RPG Soldier, etc and pretty much all you have is a machine gun and your good looks...So GOOD LUCK with that!What makes this game so awful, specifically?  Here are some things:1) Every time you take damage (and you'll take PLENTY of damage in this game), you have to drop your weapon (press L2 for a \"health shot\") then press R1 to administer the health shot then press R2 to get back to your primary weapon...WTH were they THINKING??!?!  This is so 90s for a combat game, just UNBELIEVABLE!  Get used to the L2-R1-R2 combo and the cussing (yours) every couple of minutes because of that...2) There are many \"COLLECTIBLE\" rifles/shotties scattered among the game and you're supposed to feel like you WON A PRIZE every time you locate one...PROBLEM IS...You can ONLY CARRY ONE PRIMARY WEAPON in this ridiculous game!  So, congratulations on your \"prize\", now drop it back down and thank you for playing...Please move on.  Again, WTH?!?!!3) Since you're apparently carrying the hospital-size supply of health syringes you'll need on your back, you can ONLY carry one secondary weapon...Of course it will RARELY be the one you need to avoid your eventual SHREDDING in the next encounter.  C-4, Bazooka, Anti-Tank, Mortar Fire, Laser-Guided Bomb, Mine or Vehicle Repair Tool...Bank on it...Whatever you NEED won't be what you're carrying.  That's just so STUPID.  The item you'll need most is Vehicle Repair Tool (unless you want to hoof it through most of the Campaign) since you're going to be driving right into Fully-Armored Tanks, RPGs and Attack Choppers that will instantly SHRED your vehicle like cheese.  There's even a \"training\" session at the start of the game for this tool.  So when you choose to carry it, you're back to having your machine gun and good looks to face the Tank, RPG, Chopper...OR, choose to carry the bazooka to destroy the enemy vehicles (after your vehicle was just destroyed) and you'll be hoofing it to the next encounter.  Just unforgivable HORRIBLE design in a military combat game...4)  Missions - An ABSOLUTE FAILURE here.  Every time you complete a \"mission\", you're a loser.  For example, you risk life and limb to go over a country's boundary to steal GOLD from Mercenaries (and keep it for yourselves, of course).  Once you do find it, then you immediately \"surrender\" it to the Authorities?!?!  Gee, thanks!  Want another?  OK, you go in and \"Save The President of Slovaglogastan\" (or whatever he is).  You fight like hell, finally reach him, call for EVAC and are then instructed to \"leave him there...Oh, and by the way...We don't officially recognize your operation so find your own way out.\"  Oh boy, what fun!  Want another?  OK...Your chopper goes down in the middle of a Russian occupied village and all you have is a pistol.  Your 3 friends get \"nabbed\" and you're on your own to find them in the village...So by the time you fight tooth and nail through overwhelmingly superior numbers and armament (as you kill enemies at least you get an SMG with 20 or 30 rounds left), it's \"Sorry, but your buddies aren't in the village...They've been moved.\"  So then you fight your way into a Russian Military Compound to free your 3 friends.  You get inside and \"Sorry, but Intel reports your buddies have been moved to a Monestery.\"  Once again, WTH is with THIS??  It's like something straight out of \"The Military Missions Handbook by Spongebob Squarepants and Patrick Star\"...Just HORRIFIC!5) The most frustrating experience in this game is the INEPT DESIGN...You spend the ENTIRE GAME trying to get from Point A to Point B down either a road or a river.  Sorry, but when you break it all down, THAT'S IT!  Meanwhile, in between Point A and Point B you cruise for 20 sec or so and then an ENCOUNTER.  One or two tanks, an RPG, a couple of 50-cals or a chopper just UNLOAD on you before you can even press \"triangle\" and get in a gunner's seat.  These enemies RARELY MISS and are devastating, normally destroying your vehicle within 5-10 sec.  If you jump from the vehicle, a Rain of Fire like you've never seen follows you and your SMG.  To find something to fight them with, you have to search through half-destroyed homes that all look the same...Then you think you've found THE bazooka or anti-tank or mortar or laser-guided bomb secondary weapon they left for you...You go to pick it up and it's a freakin' VEHICLE REPAIR TOOL or C-4 explosives charge!?!?  See how far you get trying to plant a C-4 charge on a TANK that's firing all guns at you!  I mean, if the game is going to throw a TANK at you and you're already carrying the vehicle rapair tool, then why on Earth wouldn't you find something TO DESTROY THE TANK with instead of the same freakin' tool you're already carrying?!?!  Are you supposed to go and FIX the enemy's tank for them instead of BLOW IT TO PIECES?  This is just SO ASININE and it's like this through EVERY LEVEL of this game...6) I may have spoken a little prematurely in #5 above...Because the absolute MOST FRUSTRATING thing about this game is DYING...and DYING...and DYING.  It's just so EASY to die on Normal Difficulty.  In fact, it happens over and over then you clear an encounter...Then drive 20 sec again until your next encounter, get blown away again, come back to it again, get blown away again, come back to it again and maybe make it through this time.  Then drive 20 sec to another encounter, rinse & repeat.I'm nowhere near the best shooter/combat player, but I can hold my own against AI...Well, USUALLY that is.  Practically every time you face an AI enemy in this game on a road or river, YOU WILL DIE!  In some cases, multiple times.  I just don't \"get it.\"  You'll face superior weaponry, marksman shooters (even 50-cals), superior numbers and you'd just better get ready to repeatedly die while your moron buddy lugging the bazooka around scratches his butt and watches...I like shooters, in fact I PREFER them over other game genres...But this one quickly became an AGONIZING, REPETITIOUS & FRUSTRATING experience.  It's a shame because there are many things I LIKE about Battlefield Bad Co.  Your buddies have actual personalities and are quite funny at times...Of course then there are times when you're riding around or searching homes where they don't utter a single word for 20 MINUTES. Just BIZARRE!The graphics are for the most part Very Good in my opinion.  But I also don't care for the fact that the trees, potholes and shrubbery are visibly DRAWN on the screen as I'm slowly driving a jeep (like I'm playing on an older PC system with limited RAM and a slow processor)...It just takes away from the immersion factor.  The weapons are very diverse and aim quick and accurately.  They pack a punch, although they all kind of shoot the same.  Once I got the MORTAR FIRE under the bridge I thought, \"Alright...Now I've got something I can really use!\"  Then I finished that level and it was taken away when I went to the next level.  One more time, WTH is that all about anyway?!?!The voice talent is Very Good, to the point you'll feel a chill up your spine when the Russians spot you and start yelling.  But again, you'll also get tired of just hearing voices in another language once you've heard it for the 200th time.  The sounds are Very Good as are the cut scenes.  However, after you've watched your unit get screwed over by central command for the 5th time in a row, it's no longer funny.  Also, you'll run low on ammo frequently.  Sometimes you're carrying a Russian SMG with say 50 shells left.  So you walk up to an SMG on the ground that's exactly the same with 30 shells in it...Do you end up with 80 shells like you should?  No...It's either take the one with 50 or the one with 30?!?!  In addition, sometimes you can walk up to one SMG that's different from yours and collect its ammo, but walk over to another just like it but you don't collect the ammo from that gun?!?!  This the way a 2nd grader would design a video game...Almost everything is: This is GOOD, BUT...There's always a BUT or HOWEVER because there were some good ideas that were destroyed through LOUSY EXECUTION.I really thought at the beginning this was going to be a great game.  Now I don't know if I can even grind out a finish to the SP Campaign.  Mindless repetition games do not appeal to me at all...And that's what Battlefield Bad Co has in Spades.  If you play online, you may get more out of it.  At least it's a relatively CHEAP game...Then again, maybe it SHOULD be.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2009"}
