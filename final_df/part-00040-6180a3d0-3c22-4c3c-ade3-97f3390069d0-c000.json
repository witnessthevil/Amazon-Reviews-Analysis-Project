{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Making the Movie Obsolete","reviewText":"I had been following the development of LA Noire for almost two years before it's release. The revolutionary facial imagery sounded cool, and the realistic recreation of a late 40's LA sounded cool. The only thing was I wasn't sure I would like how it played. Two years later and almost 20 hours in, all my fears have been set aside. This is an incredible game.The story in LA Noire puts most movies to shame. The dialogue is so sharp that I had to check and make sure that I wasn't watching a movie. There are only a literal handful of character that I have ever cared about in any game that I have ever played. One was Jonh Marston, and another is the main character in LA Noire, Cole Phelps. I won't spoil it, but much later in the game, Cole changes squads for certain reasons. I knew it was coming, but after it happened, as I was playing I felt the appropriate emotion an hour later. YOu'll know what I mean when you get there, I promise; powerful stuff.I don't need to say too much about the graphics; they're a game changer. From now on, this is the standard that all facial animations will be measured against. The voice acting is flawless; half the time I feel like I'm watching the never made sequel to LA Confidential it is so good. The music in this game is amazing, so much so that this will be the first modern game soundtrack that I purchase. To put it in perspective, after having played a game for a while and getting a feel for the music, I will play one of the many albums I have ripped to my 360;The  with LA Noire I will actually stop playing the game for a second just so I can furhter enjoy the music. It is that good.The game also controls very well. Unlike Red Dead Redemption, which I love, I didn't find myself running into doorways every five minutes. The on foot chase scenes are exhilerating, and I never had to worry about getting caught on a door jam. It would have been nice if everyone that you chased wasn't trackstar fast, but then I relized that you need to be creative with how you chase them. Cut the perp off, and you've got them. The driving sections are probably my least favorite sections in the game, but only becasue I suck at driving. Thankfull, no matter how badly you drive, as long as you stay with them, eventually the criminals will be stopped, and you can take them in penalty free. The gun play is fun and easy. Some people might complain that maybe it is too easy, but why does everything have to be hard? If you really want a challenge, than the next section is for you.The investigation portion of LA Noire is my favorite part of the game. At the start of every case, you have to scour the crime scene for clues that will help lead you to suspect, and eventually the culprit. Once you find the suspect, you have to question them, and the amount of evidence, and how you use it will dictate how successfull you will be while questioning them. Thankfully, the game helps you out here as well. While investigating, music will play in the background. When you pass over a clue, you will hear a deep chime, and your controller will shake. Once you have found that clue, when you pass over it you will hear a softer chime letting you know. You will never need to be afraid that you didn't look in the right place for clues because if you go too far, the music stops, letting you know that there is nothing of interest in that direction.Once you gather the evidence, and get a suspect, it is time to question them. You will ask them a question and have to decide whether or not they are telling the truth. You will have to watch the suspects carefully: are they looking from side to side, are they blinking more than they had been, or are they looking you dead in your eyes without wavering? You will be given three options: Truth if you believe them, Doubt if you don't but can't prove that they are lying, or Lie if you know they are lying and have the evidence to prove it. If you just can't figure someone out, then use your intuition points to help eliminate the wrong options. There is no better feeling than catching a scumbag in a lie, and having the evidence to nail him to the wall.You will work cases in 4 different divisions: Traffic, Homicide, Vice, and Arson, all of them with different partners, and characters. The cases never get stale, and the suspense never lets up. There are mini games, but the game never forces them on you. There are 40 street crimes that you can undetake whenever asked, each one of them unique. You are not penalized in any way for ignoring them, but if you do complete them, you get experience points that count toward getting you more intuition points. You can also search the city for awesome hidden vehicles which are much better than your default car, or city landmarks which give you points for finding them.If you heard that this was a rockstar game and were expecting Grand Theft Auto 1940's, then you will be disappointed. You can't go on killing sprees because you are a police detective. This is not a call of duty game, meaning that it is not wall to wall action. The pace is slower, more methodical and deliberate. If you allow it, you will get lost in the world of LA Noire and love every minute. A masterpiece and an absolute buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

It is probably highly recommended that you play this game on a backlit GBA, the Gameboy Player or the DS. This is why I gave it the overall 4 star rating.Now for the actual game itself. After the great but overlooked Symphony of the Night (due to the fact that Sony and everybody else, which is the audience, wanting 3D games), known for it's gameplay and amazing 2D graphics, fans wanted more so when the GBA launched, a month later, this game came out. some think that this game wasn't as good as Symphony of the Night. Well, even though their mostly right, but people have to remember that this was a game that was meant for a Handheld so of course it's not as pretty as that game. the gameplay is just like Symphony of the Night except there are a few differences. Graphics are good but a bit choppy, your Whip is the only weapon you can use, the Card system is great and has a lot of experimenting, the replay value is good, The Game is not quite as large as the other one (there were 2 castles in the PSone game), The gameplay is more of \"as soon as you defeat this boss this is the next area to go to\" unlike Symphony of the Night in which you can have multiple paths to go (make your own decision on where to go, but still not every place you can go quite yet), the EXP system is actually better (in SOTN, whenever you fight enemies for a long time, they go from whatever EXP points they have to simply 1 EXP so your maximum level to get to is 62 to be exact) but this game doesn't have that so you can go to level 99 in this game. Because this is the rarest of the 3 GBA game (the other 2 were rereleased in a 2 in 1 cart.), some people might make their price higher than 30 bucks so get it while you can. this game is Better than Harmony of Dissonance but not as good as Aria of Sorrow (or the other non-GBA RPG Castlevania games)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"al","summary":"no trophies","reviewText":"it ha been a while since i played this game because there are no trophies in the game.  but this is what you would expect from turok the game dinosaur killing, a forest area and much more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

Johnson","summary":"good; but should have been great","reviewText":"Before I begin, I must note that I have rented both the PS3 and 360 versions of this game and played them extensively.  While I am still up in the air on which version I will end up buying, the only reason I am reviewing the PS3 version versus the 360 version is because this is the version I am leaning towards buying. However my reasons have nothing to do with differences with the game between the two systems.  For all practical purposes, the two versions are identical and there is no need to review the 360 version as well.  See my comments for a quick comparison between the two systems concerning this game.My review:Modern Warfare 2 was one of the most anticipated games in recent history.  After the HUGE success of COD: Modern Warfare, MW2 looked to continue the success.  While the game visually looks better than the first, there are issues (mainly in single player) that have hurt this game.  If it weren't for the extremely fun and improved Multi-player, this game could have been one of the biggest disappointments this year.Single PlayerThis game takes place 5 years after the original Modern Warfare and after a quick training course you are immediately thrown into action.  While the first few levels were extremely fun and creative, most of the levels really lacked any innovation or offered anything new.  In single player, every aspect of the game from visuals to audio is improved except for the main thing; game play.  IW seems to have fallen prey to the Hollywood mentality that all we want is action all the time without much thought put into the actual story line or doing a good job of explaining what's going on.  Attention to the actual story is something they did VERY well in COD4.  However levels on MW2 just turn into nothing but mindless shoot fests.  Its very obvious single player was just thrown together without much thought and it makes completing most of the campaign more of a frustrating chore than a fun and challenging experience.  Things move along so fast with many jumps and holes in the story line, it's very difficult to follow the plot about what's going on.  Even the cut screens during levels are hard to follow because there is so much going on onscreen with separate audio that does nothing but drown each other out.  After a while you more than likely will just give up trying to follow along and just kill everything that moves.  With this game, you will have ample opportunity to do just that; while there is no endless spawning as in the previous title, because there are so many enemies it might as well be.  After the first couple of levels, enemies will just pop out of everywhere on every single level with no break in the action.Each level may look different, but the concept is the exact same; kill hundreds of enemies before they kill you before you make the next checkpoint.  Which brings me to my next complaint; IW still has done nothing about the annoying check point system.  While I admit the checkpoint system in COD4 wasn't as bad as other games I have played, the checkpoint system in MW2 is absolutely terrible.  Because you have to kill so many people before you can even advance you will find yourself having to start ALL over again if you die.  What makes this even worse is that even when you DO reach a checkpoint, sometime the game does not recognize that you made it, so when you die you have to start over TWO checkpoints back frustrating the crap out of you.  Part of my frustration could be the fact that I played on Hardened Difficulty, but even still, the checkpoint system is a big problem.There is a little more variety in the latter levels, but the concept is pretty much the same.  In addition the final levels will more than likely having you wanting to throw your controller in the floor due to all the random deaths and seemingly luck based objectives due to the plethora of enemies.  Once you get through it however, you are rewarded with a pretty good ending and credits.It's a shame single player was such a disappointment.  The levels themselves are gorgeous and the in-game sound and ally chatter is amazing.  Some parts are extremely fun as well.  It's just too bad there isn't a comprehensible story line to go along with it and game play that is for the most part extremely top-heavy with action.Single Player rating:  3.5/3.75Multi-playerAs much as I am disappointed with the single player campaign, the Multi-player makes up for it.  There are some new perks/kill streak rewards that are sure to make online play a little more interesting.  Modern Warfare features new kill streak rewards like Predator Missiles, Harrier Strike and Care Packages. There is also a tactical Nuke strike which will end the game immediately killing every one on the map and giving you the win; however you need a 25 kill streak to do this so it's not something that should affect game play very much as it should be a very rare occurrence.In addition to the new kill streak rewards, there are more perks in as well as enhancements to existing ones.  Some new perks include Hard line which lowers kill streak reward requirements by one kill and Bling which allows you two attachments on weapons.  All perks, new and existing have \"Pro\" versions which enhance them even more.Most of the cheap tactics that many players used are either gone in Modern Warfare 2 or can be countered with the addition of new perks and items.  Juggernaut is gone (sort of) and no more players grenade spamming with the Frag x3 perk.  However \"camping\" is still a big problem in Multi-player.  Because the Multi-player maps in MW2 are all out in the open and you can go just about anywhere, all a player has to do is find on of those places and sit there all day long picking off newer players that are not as familiar with the layout of the maps. This may get better over time; however newer players are hereby warned.While the hated Juggernaut is no longer available in the perk list, it is still here in form of a death streak reward. Death streaks are basically the opposite of Kill streaks and give the player a boost if they are dying too often.  The Pain Killer reward (i.e. Juggernaut) is available after a player dies 3 consecutive times.  The addition if death streak rewards adds some balance in Multi-player and while some may complain about people abusing it, because of the way these death streaks are set up, it will be very hard (if not impossible) to \"abuse' these rewards and still win the match; good players will still dominate.  These death streaks are merely a way in keeping novice and inexperienced player interested in the game while making them somewhat competitive.Finally bullet damage is more deadly even in \"non hardcore\" matches.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  One of my biggest complaints with COD4's Multi-player is that it sometimes seemed to take way to many bullets to bring someone down.  This worked both for and against me but in either case it was very frustrating for me when I was trying to kill someone and for others when they were trying to kill me.  This is no longer an issue with MW2 as a few well placed bullets will bring down your target quite easily. Because of this, getting a kill is highly dependent on who sees who first.  The person to see and fire on his opponent first has a HUGE advantage in stand offs; so my advice is to be very careful before stepping in/out of a room or in the open.  This DOES make Multi-player harder but it's also a little more realistic.The fun factor is Multi-player is much more fun than single player mode, but it does have its flaws.  In addition to what I've already pointed out, there is a problem with over powered shotguns.  (I've been killed from literally 50 feet away from below with someone wielding dual shotguns.)  In addition the sniper rifles have absolutely no punch at all.  Even shots from the 50 caliber Barrett do not bring down your enemy in one shot and without stopping power, the sniper rifles are virtually useless.  The only sniper rifle that is pretty good is the Intervention, and once I complete the challenges with the other three, the Intervention will be the only sniper rifle I will ever use.Finally bullets seem to curve around corners when you are being shot at.  It is quite frustrating to when you run to cover thinking you have avoided being killed only to have a bullet literally curve around the corner and hit you.  This was also a problem in COD4, but it just seems much worse in MW2.All in all, multi-player can be a fun experience sometimes 5 other times 3.Multi-player Rating:  4/4Spec OpsSpec Ops is a new game mode that I haven't really played yet, but from what I can see it will be a refreshing break from single player and Multi-player modes.  Basically it places you in a situation and gives you certain objective to complete in a specified amount of time to earn stars.  There is a wide variety of mission types such as hold off attackers; kill tangos and even snow-mobile races.  These can be played with a single player or with a partner; though some missions are only available for 2 people.I do not have a rating for Spec ops because I haven't played this mode enough to form a solid opinion.OverallModern Warfare 2 is a good game, but keep in mind I only say this because of the improved multi-player and addition of the Spec Ops mode.  If you are only into single player mode, then I HIGHLY recommend a rental to just beat the game and move on.  Is single player worth playing? Yes it is, but if you are not going to play multi-player or Spec Ops then there is really no need to BUY this game.  I beat this game in 4 days playing an average of 90 minutes per day even on Hardened difficulty.  While Multi-player is much improved, single player is below the standards of COD4.  This game is recommended as a purchase ONLY if you plan to play Multi-player and/or spec ops modes often.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It's very easy to be distracted from the story.---When the first Valkyria Chronicles came out in 2008 it crept into the gaming market quietly while other games were breaking down the door.  As a result, Valkyria Chronicles didn't make a big splash at first. In spite of this, however, good critical reception and word of mouth helped Valkyria Chronicles gain a small cult following and become a successful game. Enough to allow for a sequel on the PSP. Valkyria Chronicles 2 is finally here. And while it isn't quite as good as the first in some respects, it's better in others.The second game focuses on Avan, a young man who has just discovered that his brother Leon, who was attending a military academy, has been killed. But the messenger doesn't want to tell him why. So he decides to enroll in the academy himself to find out. As Avan is discovering what has happened to his brother there is a rebel faction rising in Gallia because the Archduchess has just revealed she's a Darcsen. And Darcsen's aren't looked upon fondly by the rebels. This is bad because it means there could be a civil war soon if these rebels aren't stopped. Gallia has enjoyed two years of piece since Squad 7 pushed the Empire out, and now it seems like the country is on the brink of civil war.The good news about Valkyria Chronicles 2's story is that you can jump right in. You don't have to play or know the story of the first game in order to grasp Valkyria Chronicles 2. While it has an interesting premise it's unfortunate you're not likely to get sucked into Valkyria Chronicles 2's story. The story doesn't have the same kind of pull or intrigue of the first game. You're stuck in the shoes of Avan for the game, but it's hard to want to care that strongly about him or his squad. The game spends a lot of time reminding you that he and his squad are a bunch of slackers and it's just too easy to be distracted from the story. What Valkyria Chronicles 2 lacks in story it more than makes up for in gameplay. That is where Valkyria Chronicles 2 shines the most.Unlike the first game, Valkyria Chronicles 2 isn't completely linear. Instead of following the story with each new mission, you're given a list to choose from. And the story missions aren't always available until you do certain key missions first. This explains just why story isn't that important in Valkyria Chronicles 2. There is too much to do outside of the story that it's easy to be distracted from it. When you have to do two or three missions before a story mission... but also have six or seven optional ones to choose from, it's easy to put the story on the back burner. Even then, you'll find that you can buy missions and that you can also do character specific missions.  There's A LOT to do outside of the story this time around.  Valkyria Chronicles 2 clearly wants to showcase its gameplay.The mechanics of the gameplay haven't changed much from the first to the second. You'll send a series of units into the field. There is a 2D map where you can select any unit you want before it goes to a 3D view where you can freely roam so long as you have the AP in your AP gauge to do so. When you find an enemy you can stop and shoot. The closer you are the better your chances of hitting. Valkyria Chronicles 2 adds a couple of things to the mix of all this. The first and most obvious of which is that missions take place on more than one map for any given mission. You'll have to capture bases to go to other maps. Another addition it morale. As you play you'll notice that your morale increases whenever you do something good such as take down enemy troops or capture bases.  Higher morale increases the chances of character potentials coming out. But it'll decrease if one of your bases gets captured or if your troops go down. If your morale drops to zero the mission ends, regardless of whether or not you have troops on the map. Unfortunately... that's the thing about morale, aside from that it doesn't really add a lot to the experience. In fact, it's quite easy to forget about it.Each mission has its own kinds of objectives. Sometimes the objective is to take out all the units, sometimes it's to get to a marching point (Or escorting someone to a specific point) or to gather supplies.  Sometimes it's to take out the supreme commander... but most times the mission is just to capture the enemy base and get it over with. There are also lesser bases to capture so that you can call in and dismiss units as you see fit. It's a fairly good system. And still manages to be unique because there are still not that many games (if any) like it.There are other new things added to the game. You can still show you're strategic chops by sending in swift Scouts, machine gun toting Shocktroopers, tank blasting Lancers, health restoring Engineers and mine disarming technicians, but each character in each class can also upgrade to become something bigger by gaining specific credits in battle. Such as how many enemies you dispatch or something like that. If you do that, you can eventually use your credits to upgrade each class. For example, you can upgrade a Scout to being a Veteran Scout or you can make him a Sniper.  From Veteran Scout or Sniper you can go up another tier.  It adds a bit of variety and customization to the game.  But there is also still a squad focus.  Characters can raise in tiers of a specific class individually, but each class still levels up together.  If you upgrade a scout to level 5, for instance... EVERY Scout (and any tier related to Scout) will be level 5.  It actually works out rather well.  There's a focus on characters as individuals (upgrading classes and unlocking potentials) and then there's as a class (upgrading all your Scouts levels together).  The game works in such a way that you actually can afford to pick favorites if you like.There are still a few hiccups with the enemy AI.  Some missions CAN be tough... if there's a boss on the map.  On the other hand in those missions where there aren't, the AI can be ridiculously stupid.  You'll see enemy units run into... well... nothing and just stop for no reason at all.  Enemies never take advantage of most of your own shortcomings.  In moments when they have a chance to capture a base, for instance, they'll stop just outside of it.  They'll end their turns prematurely.  Normal grunts pose almost no threat because they rarely want to become one.  That doesn't mean there is no challenge to Valkyria Chronicles 2.  Some missions are quite challenging because there's so much thrown at you. In particular, missions with boss enemies (or other special units) can be challenging.  If the grunts are too dumb, the boss enemies can sometimes be relentless and overpowered.  They'll dodge attacks without hesitation, they do enormous damage and you'll find some of them can move all over the place.  It gives Valkyria Chronicles 2 a challenge, though sometimes it makes the difficulty unbalanced.  You'll go into really easy missions that are quickly followed by missions that can be relentless because there's a boss character on the map you didn't plan for.  It can reduce some missions to trial and error.There are SEVERAL characters in Valkyria Chronicles 2. You don't simply find nameless \"Scouts\". Every character actually has a name and a personality. And yes, their personality actually plays a part in battle. Every character has \"potentials\". Some of them do things for you like increase their attack or accuracy etc. They're not all positive, however. Sometimes you have characters whose potential is that they get nervous in battle and thus get scared and so their defense may drop or they may not like a certain environment. It's actually pretty cool stuff. Likewise, characters actually like other characters too, and if you send them in battle together there is a bigger chance that they'll help those nearby allies whenever they decide to attack an enemy.The game also tries to develop them outside of battle. As you roam the academy there will be short snippets that are there for no other reason than to give you a better clue of who some of your characters are. It's nice that Valkyria Chronicles 2 wants to develop ALL of its cast, but there are just too many characters. The game gives you over twenty right off the bat. And more recruits keep coming in throughout the game. It's great that they have different personalities, but it also explains more why the story is in the background. That's part of what makes the story so empty. The game doesn't even opt to pay much attention to it, even when you have exchanges with other characters in it.  For the most part some characters get some nice personality and development through it, but they're moments that almost never add anything to the main story. The story isn't bad, it just doesn't want to reach. Valkyria Chronicles 2 never wants to dig deep... even in moments when it can.In terms of visuals, Valkyria Chronicles 2 is probably one of the best looking PSP games you can find. It's got some beautiful cel-shading. There are also a few anime cutscenes thrown in there. In moments that aren't anime you can see portraits of characters talking to one another. Valkyria Chronicles 2 is a good looking game and seems to know it. It obviously can't look as good as its older brother... but it keeps the art in tact. The voice acting is a bit of a different story. The voice acting isn't terrible, it can just be annoying. Especially in the moments where you hear a blurb. You might be reading something that Avan is saying, for example, but he'll strike a pose and say something like, \"I'll do it!\" or something like that. This happens throughout the entire game, actually. Where you'll be reading something but the characters will grumble or something or say a little blurb. At first it wasn't so bad. But from time to time it gets annoying (In particular it seems like most characters favorite word is \"Yo!\"). For the most part, at least, there's a lot of nicely written dialog in the exchanges. Although, the game opts to be a bit more juvenile and immature than the first game in some moments. This is what makes the game feel like a step backwards. The aspects of the first Valkyria Chronicles that made the story and the characters so interesting... has been left on the cutting room floor.  There's hardly any drama or anything to ensure an attachment to much of the cast.  You may come to like some characters personalities, but it's a shame that even the main characters don't do much to draw you into the story at hand.It's actually not as bad as it sounds. It's a fun game to play. And I'm more than willing to deal with the short comings in storytelling so long as the game remains fun. You probably won't care much for the story that Valkyria Chronicles 2 tells, but the gameplay will keep you coming back time and time again. There's a lot to do and a ton of different missions across several different maps. The game sacrifices story to give you a more fun experience through this and it's something that gamers who value gameplay can accept. The game might be better with a better story, but I can't imagine the gameplay would be enhanced by a better story. If gameplay is the focus of Valkyria Chronicles 2, they've done a brilliant job.Valkyria Chronicles 2 is a worthwhile PSP game. Probably one of the best you can play on the hand-held console. It's easy to be sucked into the gameplay even if it's hard to be sucked into the story. You can lose hours on the gameplay just because it's so much fun to play and because a lot of it still feels fresh despite the first game (not to mention there's just a lot to do). It may be a on a smaller scale, but the expansion in gameplay is enormous and that makes the game worthwhile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2010"}

He just loves to play it. I'm actually looking forward to starting my own game!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2014"}

It is a huge game in physical size - Install disc is included and you need to install it.  At the beginning of the game you pretty much dive right into the action.  If you die, reload of game.  You will die a few times.  I am pretty low key when it comes to playing games, I trudge through the hard parts to get to the good parts.  An average gamer will die several times here as I did and ended up waiting for the game to load more then I played.  The load times are horrible.  I dont have an old 360 and this disturbs me because the load times literally are over a minute.  You die, you can go hit the restroom, move over to the kitchen, microwave a burrito, make yourself a drink.  Cool the burrito down and go back and the game still hasnt loaded.That being said, the graphics are awesome, the gameplay is smooth and pretty precise.  The story is pretty decent and the quests and side quests are fun.It is the technical stuff that bugs me.  I am going to load the whole game onto my xbox tonight and see what I can do to shorten the load times.  If I get the loading down I will raise my star to 4.  Until then, this is a decent game that is as far as I am concerned crippled by load time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Ramos","summary":"I Actually Like D3...","reviewText":"I know everyone seems to be in agony because this game didn't turn out as they'd hoped, but I find the game actually pretty awesome. I never played D1 or D2, so I don't know if those were immensely more fun, but I can say this; Diablo 3 has been a completely enjoyable experience so far and I don't regret my purchase in the slightest. The cons listed by other reviewers either haven't effected me or I just haven't noticed them. Here's a list of why:1. Online Only DRM - My computer is always connected to the internet... always. Every once in a while it may cut out, but that is very rare and doesn't bother me.2. The Auction House - I checked it out once and it really didn't interest me. So I've just ignored it and it hasn't bothered me at all.3. Server Issues - I didn't buy it at launch, so I can't say anything about the initial server overload mess. But I've never encountered an error yet when logging into their network.4. Issues With Items - The loot I've found suits me just fine, no complaints here. Also I like the fact that the better loot is rare, cause it makes you appreciate it more.5. Not Much End Game - This would bother me if I expected D3 to be like an MMORPG, but I didn't. I'm used to games coming to a conclusion, most games do. Then you just play something else or start over with a new character. Every character is so vastly different, it's a whole new experience with each one.6. Lag - Okay this is actually the only con I experienced so far and it does suck. I was playing D3 while downloading some files and it started to lag. I would hit enemies, but nothing would happen. Then all of the sudden the game would catch up and I would be surrounded by dead bodies. It was like skipping an awesome action scene in a movie and it really blew. It's happened a few times now, but not enough to mar the experience for me.Overall I think D3 is an awesome game and people should look for the positive things in the game instead of focusing on the changes they dislike. The 1-star reviews are completely unwarranted. The fact is that this game, even with the flaws people find in it, is still fully playable and gamers can get at least some satisfaction and entertainment from playing it. It's not like this game cause physical pain. Games that actually deserve 1-star reviews are like King Kong for the DS. I loved King Kong on consoles, so I wanted it for the DS. I finally bought, only to find that the game was almost literally unplayable. It was a broken mess and a total embaracement for a company like Ubisoft to publish. That's the kind of game that deserves 1-star, not a polished, fully functional, triple-A ARPG by one of the biggest PC developers in the world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Not the Bioshock we asked for...","reviewText":"...but still pretty friggin' good.Ah, here we are, in the oh - so famliar 'dissapointing sequel' section of the Amazon bin.  But I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that BioShock 2 doesn't belong here.  It should be plucked out, dusted off and placed on a shelf next to other really successfull shooters.  No - the story doesn't live up the standards set by the original, not even close.  But if you can get past that (and it ain't easy, granted) you could argue that the gameplay and level design we've got here is even BETTER than it's predecessor.Let's splice a bit more, shall we?The story for Bioshock was pure Sci-fi genius and the game was Sci-fi/horror excellence.  The rules of the world were pretty well layed out - how Adam works, where it comes from, how the little sisters were raised and... harveseted, where the big-daddies come from.  Part of the point of playing the game was unfolding this deep, rich, layered story and delving into the minutiea of the world.  Hell, discovering the fates of people we meet only through voice recordings was as rewarding as surviving any one level or fighting any given enemy.  Gameplay was solid and fun, but it's not what we remember most vividly.  Shooting and throwing lightning was used as much as a story-telling element as anything else.BioShock 2 does not live up to this standard, not even a little.  But in doing so, it sets it's own.  Our new antagonist, Sophia Lamb, is no Andrew Ryan - she's not as interesting or as scary and her madness is not as palpable or overwhelming.  In fact, her control over the 'splicers' feels a little far-fetched.  But it she was a logical choice (the antithesis to Andrew Ryan in every way) and we need some sort of antagonist to drive us along.  This Sinclair joker is no Atlas - his voice acting is noticably weaker as are his motivations for helping you - but we need him to fill us in on just what the hell is going on and to help us jump from one bit to the next.  The story elements push the limits of the science fiction to the point where it doesn't make sense anymore or starts to feel like silly fantasy instead.  Like, wait, we take control of a little Sister for while?  How does that work?  Some nonsense about Adam containing memories?  Where does that come from?  But there's a shift that's happened.  The gameplay is no longer used to further a story, instead a story is used to set up some awesome new gameplay.  The non-sense about the Big Sisters is secondary to the fact that you're fighting some new, awesome and challenging enemy. And the Big Sisters are pretty awesome, with some devastating attacks and pretty intimidating sound design.  The silly story elements about Adam containing memories (all of a sudden) is used to set up some fun and cinematic gameplay later on that I won't spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  In fact, the final levels of the game are pretty taught and interesting - gone is any sort of obligatory fetch quest of fight with some silly, giant monster.  The final jaunts play out in a smart, captivating way.  In fact, it's arguably much better than the sort of tacked on final fight in the original.  Again, the story elements and characters were secondary to creating some fun, fast-paced gameplay.And fast-paced it is.  Realism has been curved and everything happens quick.  Duel-wielding plasmisd and weapons sometimes feels silly, like your character has four arms all of a sudden - but it works.  It's fun, it's exciting, it's ultimately rewarding.  The new weapons are effective and satisfying to play around with and make the game feel unique to the original.  Enemies are faster, lighter, and more numerous.  We lose a lot of the horror elements but we gain a ton of adventure.  In fact, where the original is Sci-fi/Horror, this new Bioshock is Action-Adventure/Sci-fi.  It's different, but it works.The point is this: Bioshock 2 only fails if you were wanting it to be Bioshock... which is not an unreasonable request - it is a damn sequel.  But if you are able to step back and appreciate it for what it is (and I encourage you to try) what you're left with is a solid, imaginative shooter with some excellent atomosphere, solid voice acting and a servicable story.  It's a different world for a different audience, but it works.  It works damn well.Just, like, call it 'Underwater Adventure Game' or something, and you'll be all right!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"Lots of extra content, but ultimately feels like a God of War clone.","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Vivid depictions of Hell+ Upgradable artifacts and combat techniques+ Unique gameplay feature of absolving/condemning souls+ Lots of extras, including the first portion of Dante's Divine Comedy, \"Inferno\"- CONS:- Looks and plays very similar to the God of War series- Only takes 1-2 days to complete (roughly 5-6 hours of gameplay)- Repetitive enemies- No incentive to play on higher difficulty settingsPLOT:In this game, we're in control of Dante Alighieri, a poet...er...a knight during the Crusades. He's committed heinous acts, but Dante was assured by a bishop that his sins would be pardoned after the fact.  When he arrives home, he discovers his true love, Beatrice, has been murdered and her soul is in peril at the hands of Lucifer. In order to save Beatrice, Dante must traverse the levels of Hell and face each of his personal demons along the way.GAMEPLAY:This game is set in a 3rd person hack & slash mode, with platforming and puzzle elements. Dante has Death's scythe and Beatrice's cross as his weapons.  Each level has various hidden items including pieces of silver, Holy and Unholy artifacts, and Shades - people Dante comes across which he can choose to absolve or damn for their past misdeeds.A mini-game appears when we choose to absolve someone, and this offers us a Holy points bonus multiplier, depending on how many sins are caught. Damning someone has no mini-game but rewards us with Unholy points.During his journey, Dante gains Holy or Unholy experience points which he can use to purchase powerful attack combinations, increase his health/magic levels, and so forth. There are 4 levels of difficulty which can be changed at any time during the game.The game also has different puzzle types including block puzzles, weighted switch puzzles, mystery door puzzles, and several others.Dante's Inferno also offers extra modes including unlocked movies, gameplay cinematics, behind the scenes videos, a challenge mode, and more. The entire canto of Dante's Inferno is included and can be read in a top-down scrolling format.BUT DOES IT FOLLOW THE PLOT OF THE DIVINE COMEDY?Well, yes and no. It's clear the game designers put in a LOT of effort and research into making this game, and there are a lot of similarities to Dante's written work - the levels of Hell, the descriptions of several sinners and their sins found in each area were extremely well done.However, the most glaring contradiction is this: In the game, Dante's journey through the underworld is more of a quest to save Beatrice, whereas in the poem Dante was accompanied by Virgil to travel through the levels of Hell, and Beatrice was rarely mentioned at all.TROPHIES:There are 43 trophies to earn in this title; and 12 more if you purchase the 2 DLC packs.Most of the trophies in this title are fairly easy to obtain, but it can get frustrating because some of the items are hidden a little TOO well. There is no ability to change camera angles, so unless you know where to look, you'll miss a few things your first time through. There is no way to maximize your Holy and Unholy upgrades in one playthrough, so you'll have to play the game at least twice to accomplish this.You cannot backtrack to previous levels after certain checkpoints are passed, so for the trophy hunters, I would highly recommend a strategy guide.Most of the trophies aren't hard to earn but it does feel like a lot of busy work, similar to finding all the jumps inGrand Theft Auto IV.- CONS:First and foremost, this game feels and plays a LOT like God of War. When I first played this game, I felt like I was playing a clone. The combat uses a similar fighting engine, some of the puzzles require moving boxes to certain areas, and boss battles have Quicktime events. Since these elements were all used in the God of War series, it felt like Dante's Inferno copied what worked in those games, but didn't add much of anything new. It's not a bad game, but we've seen this kind of gameplay used several times before.The time to completion also counts against this game. It only takes about 5 hours to complete the main storyline. Unless you're a trophy hunter, there is really no desire to play through the game a 2nd time because there is only one possible ending.As far as the enemies go, they're unique but they eventually become repetitive. As we progress, the same enemies keep showing up, just in greater numbers. After we power up our weapons to Ludicrous level, the enemies doesn't offer much of a challenge.Finally, there is no incentive to play the game through on harder difficulty settings. You can beat this game on the easiest setting and get all the trophies.I found myself wishing the developers had a trophy for completing the game on the hardest difficulty setting like theBioshockgames, but that wasn't done here. This could have added a lot more replay value and challenge for the trophy-hungry gamers.FINAL VERDICT?While this game obviously had a lot of love, exhaustive research and effort put into it, the similar gameplay to the God of War series and the low level of completion difficulty make this game an above-average rental. I've played through it 3 times, but unless I want to read the entire Canto of Inferno, I doubt I'll play it again.Trophy hunters? This game will bump up your status a bit.Casual players? If you've already played God of War, you'll feel like you already played this.There are two more books in The Divine Comedy: Purgatorio and Paradiso. If a new gameplay mechanic is introduced or a trophy is offered for completing the game on the highest difficulty setting, I might give those sequels a try.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A real trip","reviewText":"Shadows of the Damned is one of the weirdest, funniest, and most wildly creative shooters to release on the PS3. Conceived by the famed madman of Japanese video game development, Goichi Suda (aka Suda51), Shadows of the Damned is unlike anything else out there, and is all the better for it. It isn't without its flaws, but with a combination of creativity and fun like this, the flaws don't matter.You play as a Mexican demon hunter named Garcia Hotspur, who's girlfriend Paula is kidnapped by the demon master known as Fleming. Garcia pursues Fleming into the Underworld, where he and his sidekick, Johnson, a talking book who also happens to have the ability to turn into various upgradable firearms, proceed to slay hordes of horrific creatures while traversing the increasingly bizarre and fantastical realms of the underworld. While the game does have several moments of jump scares and fever pitch tension, the game never manages to take itself too seriously due to its outrageous, dark sense of humor and the brilliant chemistry between Garcia and Johnson. Shadows of the Damned is one of the most hilarious video games ever made. Be sure to explore everywhere and look at everything, as some of the finest moments in the game are in these calm, hilarious moments before the storm.The gameplay, which was done in collaboration with the legendary Shinji Mikami, is quite solid and serviceable, if unspectacular. Resembling Mikami's masterpiece Resident Evil 4, the game uses a third person over-the-shoulder perspective in the basic movement and combat mode. Of course, Garcia's movement is much looser and tighter-controlling than Leon Kennedy's was in that seminal masterpiece, and the shooting is also very well done, but the game still does exhibit some of the flaws that such a perspective comes with, such as limited view and a sometimes hard-to-control camera in tight quarters. None of this is anything close to game-breaking, however, as Shadows of the Damned's gameplay is good overall, especially when compared to some of Suda's other titles like No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw.What really sets Shadows of the Damned apart is the sheer spectacle and hilarity of the whole thing. Without spoiling some of the game's best surprises, I can say that Shadows of the Damned isn't just a \"shooter\". It has a lot of moments that will stay with you for a long time, whether they be some of the over-the-top action set pieces, a moment between Garcia and Johnson, or a sequence that will get your blood pumping. What makes Shadows of the Damned special is that it is one of those games that never fails to surprise. You'll see things in this game that you've never seen anywhere else, and that is a rarity in this homogenized market of AAA video games. One final thing worth mentioning is the soundtrack, which was done by the great Akira Yamaoka, who composed the iconic music for the early Silent Hill games. The music in Shadows of the Damned is absolutely stellar...easily one of the best this generation, and few other video game soundtracks can claim to match the mood, tension, and sheer lunacy of its source material so well.Shadows of the Damned is sadly the type of game that we'll likely be seeing fewer of as we move into the next generation of hardware. These mid-tier budgeted games that are allowed so much creative freedom are already disappearing at an alarming rate, as both studios and publishers of these types of games seem to disappear on a weekly basis. But Shadows of the Damned is one of those games that absolutely does not deserve to be overlooked. Its one-of-a-kind blend of campiness, creativity, tension, hilarity, and fun makes it a unique and worthwhile oddity in retail-based world of video games. If you like shooters and are looking for something different, don't skip Shadows of the Damned. It's a game that is well worth your time and money, especially at amazon's very fair price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2013"}

High expectations not met.","reviewText":"I had very high expectations for Uncharted 3, and they were far from being met. This is the first time in my life I paid full retail price for a game, so I could play in right after it's released. I should have waited for the price to be slashed in half! It's really that unworthy!I have played about 50% of the game. I chose to write my review now because it will take me a long while before I complete the game, since I have no motivation to get to it. Anyway, here are some of my comments:[1] The gameplay sucks big time. In the first half of the game, there are only a few gun fights. Why replace the fun gun fights with these boring fist fights? I wanna play a shooting game, yo! Plus, why does the plot make Drake loose his guns so often? That's annoying![2] So far, the plot has been uninteresting and unsuspenseful. I actually have little desire to keep playing and finding out more about the next adventures.[3] Perhaps this is just me, but I feel that the controls in Uncharted 1 and 2 are way smoother.[4] The graphics continues to be good, but I personally think Uncharted 2 has better graphics. Uncharted 3 looks like Uncharted 1 to me, and that's not good. The human faces look more realistic, but that's about it. Oh, while still realistic, Elena and Chloe look different; they look prettier in Uncharted 2.[5] I like the (scenic) setting of Uncharted 1 and 2 better. The shipyard scene is so ugly to look at. On the other hands, the Himalayas in Uncharted 2 are gorgeous. Also, I don't like the pirates theme.[6] The puzzles are retarded. I can solve them pretty easily, but they are boring and annoying. I do like the fact that you can have the game just solve the puzzles for you. However, this option appears only after a period of \"inactivity\". I discovered this option when I took a snack break without pausing the game. Having this option without having to wait would be nice, so I can just bypass the puzzles and get to the gun fights.[7] Drake can only walk, not run, in too many scenes. That makes exploration slow.[8] Contrary to the majority, I could care less about online plays. When I play games, I want it to be offline, alone or co-op with the most one person sitting right next to me. This is just my personal preference. I am not deducting any stars for it.I know I may anger many Uncharted fans out there, but I am ready for it since these are my honest opinions.Update: I initially rated this game as three stars. I am taking off two more stars for the annoying desert chapter. Thank you for screwing up big time, Naughty Dog! Uncharted fans out there, please feel free to leave comments. I never read them anyway.Update: I finally finished the game, and it didn't get any better. I am sticking with my one-star rating. The co-op mode also sucked. Very disappointed with this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

The story takes place in modern day Georgia at the beginning of the zombie apocalypse.  In this 5 part episodic tale (only 3 of the episodes have been released at this point) you take on the role of Lee Everett, former university professor who has been convicted of murder.  While being transported out of Atlanta via squad car, Lee and his police officer driver are involved in a car wreck allowing Lee the chance to escape.  Here begins your story as Lee Everett and my thoughts on The Walking Dead;Pros+ Brutal, gruesome and realistic zombie violence akin to the original novels and the recent television series.+ Great cell-shaded graphics give it the graphic novel feel.+ Excellent blend of characters from both the books and the television series.  Some of them you love, some of them you hate which makes it challenging when it comes to your live or die choices.+ Emotional storyline with strong moral choices that really allow you to connect with the characters.  The drama, humor, tension and action are all very well paced.+ Fantastic original score by Jared Emerson-Johnson.+ Extremely well written.+ Outstanding voice acting.+ Decent replay value.Cons- Some serious stuttering, glitching and lag during cut scenes and even worse during some action sequences.- At times it feels like regardless of the choices you make certain outcomes are unavoidable.- Menu Screen can freeze or stick causing you to have to restart the game.- A few parts of the story can be a bit too predictable.- Episodes are a bit short at 2-3 hours each.Telltale's \"The Walking Dead\" is an interesting and engaging entry into today's ever growing zombie apocalypse genre.  It's important to note that this is NOT an action game and those looking for a Walking Dead zombie shooter are better off to waiting for Terminal Reality's FPS based on the series which is slated for a 2013 release.  This version however is a perfectly blended story with all the right elements of drama, suspense, intrigue, tension and humor.  Add in the \"who lives and who dies\" style choice system and it makes for a truly entertaining gaming experience.  While I wouldn't consider this game perfect because of a few technical issues, it's still an outstanding game.  Currently I have 10 hours of playtime between the first three episodes and am eagerly awaiting the fourth episode scheduled for a later date.  While this game may not satisfy every Walking Dead fan it's sure to please most as it did me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros. Deluxe.--T. Byrl BakerPros:Classic side-scrolling action gameplayLots of extrasCons:Screen isn't quite big enough to show the entire layout of the  game","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Its back and bigger than ever, but is it better?","reviewText":"For you Mario freaks who want to play the original, or those ones who are new to video games and don't have an old NES (which, sadly, are becoming increasingly rarer as time goes on), this is a good substitute.  It doesn't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs.  But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed, and we must continue on.  Sorry for getting nostalgic, but there's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago, with a lot of friends gathered around.  Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry, but I have a lot of good memories from that.  That's how boys bond (and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 --- the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy).  And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - don't worry, Mario doesn't have anything to be concerned about.Anyway, this includes some new features, like challenges (find Yoshi's Egg, 5 red coins, and beat a specified high score), races with Boo, a Toy Box (or something along those lines), and some trophies.  Also, more intriguing, is that that included the Japanese SMB II or Lost Levels for us American and UK folks or gamers I mean.  You have to get 300,000 points on the original, and then Luigi's head will appear on the gaming menu.  Its retitled SUPER MARIO BROTHERS FOR SUPER PLAYERS, and you have to be one to beat it, the difficulty level is so high.  It took us a good 13 years to get the game in original 8 bit format.  One thing about the screen: its not big enough to get the entire game inside it, so they have Mario look up and down.All in all, a good adaptation.  Still, it'd be nice to see the release of more games like this -- mainly the first two LEGEND OF ZELDA games on one cart.  Why don't they do this??  Perhaps with the release of the two new GB Colour Zelda games (they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two) we'll see a release of those two classic Zelda titles.  Other than emulation or on the 8-Bit they're unavailable.  That's a real travesty.Mike London","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2001"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VC","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"On the Shoulders of Giants - The Antithesis for the Favorable Negative Review","reviewText":"When DARKSIDERS was first released (Jan 5th, 2010) I scoured Amazon reviews for several weeks to determine whether it would be worth my time and money.  The most convincing opinion of the time was that of the 2-star review stating the game was repetitive, uninspired and derivative.  As a fan of Zelda and God of War I decided to rent the game with my Gamefly giftcard.  Once I had finished scrubbing off the tiremarks and cigarette burns from the disc, my hour long playthrough led me to believe the review was spot-on and I returned the game without looking back.  I was under the impression that time-limit combo sequences, copy-cat gameplay and formulaic environmental design was all that lay ahead.  After all, those were the defining points of the 2-star review.  ....BUT, just like his Apocalyptic Oppressors, I had dealt War and his allies a huge injustice.  One I wish to set straight.Fast forward to nearly 16 months later and a price drop of $40.  Darksiders came highly recommended by another Amazon reviewer with high rated marks and similar genre interests.  After playing for two hours I found myself ENTRANCED by this game.  My initial disinterest in the title was clearly from not giving it proper time to develop into its own.  The first hour serves as a tutorial for the game.  However, it is embedded into gameplay in such a way as to make you unaware that you are being taught how to play while still holding the metaphorical reins.  The small attention to detail, down to instructional direction, is inspiring.  This game is clearly NOT made by amateurs.  This game consistently provided me with challenging puzzles, a powerful narrative framework, ambitious variety and dynamic visuals.GAMEPLAY:War has such a HUGE arsenal of moves and artifacts that the pause menu is initially daunting.  The game provides a steady stream of equipment and features a remarkable method of mapping these buttons in a manageable way.  Although the game includes a selection of Link's gadgetry, Darksiders spins the angle to embrace the aesthetic and physical facets of the end of days.  War doesn't have a boomerang that makes enemies spin and light red.  He has a Crossblade than saws into his enemies with  visceral accuracy and sadistic destruction.  Darksiders' greatest achievement is in weaving innumerable gameplay elements into a cohesive package within a single atmosphere.  I found myself shooting blue/orange portals to direct soul power, grappling across chasms, using a visor (mask) to see into a different realm, soaring through dilapidated cities on the wings of a griffon, blasting cannons across rickety bridges, and charging my fiery horse  Ruin against tower-sized beasts. Darksiders has an UNCANNY ability to mold various properties into the mythos of Armageddon.  If I had never played the games from which it borrows, I could easily have believed Darksiders pioneered the use of each and every relic.The game took me 15 hours to complete, but would have taken me a few more to find all of the unlockable pieces of armor and upgrades.  Different upgrade tokens can be assigned to different weapons and a multitude of combinations can be used to defeat enemies on your own terms.  Do you want to play like Devil May Cry? - Use a powerful sword uppercut to lift the enemy into the sky and reign down bullets with your gun.  Do you want to play like God of War? - Use your gauntlet to smash a horde of enemies and create a swirling vortex of souls with your Scythe to decimate their numbers.  Start a combo by blowing the Earthcaller horn to stun some demons and club them with your home-run crushing Chaos Eater sword swing.  Every combo has smooth camera work and stunning animation to augment War's abilities.  You have near limitless control to play in the manner you prefer.The Watcher (voiced by Mark Hamill) is a demon sent by the \"Council\" to keep War from disobeying his initial task.  Holding \"select\" will call him forth to provide hints or direction for missions.  This, in tandem with an excellent map and fast-travel Serpent Hole system, keep your progression constant while allowing you to backtrack at any point to collect new items.  From the controls to the weapon and gameplay variety, everything in Darksiders is masterfully crafted and deeply engaging.CHARACTERS:War is a brilliant characterization of the Judeo-Christian horseman.  He stands with impunity at the feet of Heaven and Hell's armies, ready to defend his honor and uphold his code despite the obstacles and cautions foretold by others.  Despite drawing from religious mythos, I personally enjoy the creation of a character who can appeal to gamers from a plethora of religions and cultures.  Rather than embody orthodox Christian overtones, War is an idealization of the solitary hero: resilient, adapting, discerning and powerful.  War's voice acting is superb and does a phenomenal job of conveying defiance in the face of much larger enemies. To great effect, these enemies and allies also perpetuate a believable world caught in a supernatural struggle.  Samael speaks with unearthly distinction and visuals that almost seem to draw ash and brimstone through your screen and into your living room.  The Destroyer seethes deceptive charm like a proverbial serpent to waylay the gullible.  Slitha bargains with cynical distress and convincing intonation.  There are no characters within Darksiders that feel out of place or forcefully acted.  Every enemy or ally  speaks with sincerity and savvy.  Every design is original, detailed and enigmatic.SOUND AND VISUALS:From Voice Acting to Music and Sound Effects, all of the sound in Darksiders is Top-Notch.  The merchant Vulgrim impatiently clacks his skeletal hands for the Horseman's purchases with the same clarity as War's horse rising with gusto from the fiery ground.  There are a multitude of locations which feature the same comic book style art, vividly bright visuals and bold design.  From ashen deserts, crumbling highways, and lush valleys to decaying fortresses and cobwebbed dungeons, Darksiders moves beyond its subject material to visualize a colorful world typically represented with greys and reds.  If you are inclined to like the stylistic nature of this game, everything is a visual treat.  I had not previously been a fan of Joe Madureira, but this game easily won me over.  Enemy and boss variety, environmental structures, and weapon/artifact models blend seamlessly into the surroundings.A FEW MINOR QUIRKS:Despite all of my glowing points,... the game has a few very small annoyances.  Many of the upgradeable tokens feature similar attributes, and some will only work effectively when applied to certain weapons.  A larger variety and the ability to map them to all weapons equally would have made them more appealing.Minor weapon artifacts (Crossblade/Mercy Revolver/Earthcaller) will probably see less action in battle when exploring since you must have  navigational artifacts (Portal gun/ Abyssal Grappling Chain/Mask of Shadows) assigned and selected to move about the terrain. Ultimately, this will cause you to rely more on the \"true\" secondary weapons (Scythe/Tremor Gauntlet) rather than constantly pausing to switch out gear in the menu.  Having some artifacts automatically triggered when you aimed at certain points (Like Metroid Prime) may have been the better choice for grappling, using portals, or activating switches with the Crossblade.  The grappling hook also only works in a straight line (meaning you cannot use it to reach some locations more easily once you have found the artifact).Several sections also have reoccurring moments where enemies respawn and doors are locked, forcing you to combat them all.  These are not terrible, but some seem to have been placed to extend game time in certain locations.The flight sequence (similar to Panzer Dragoon) does not allow you to invert the cursor for shooting, which makes it difficult for people who are used to inverted controls.These are very minor issues in relation to the final package.CONCLUSION:Overall, I cannot wait to play the next installment of this game.  Darksiders was crafted by a team of highly skilled developers, clearly with the gamer in mind.  If you judge this game based on the merits of an hour long tutorial (as I originally did), you are doing yourself a GREAT disservice.  I recently replayed Zelda: Twilight Princess, Metroid Prime 2 and God of War 3.  I can tell you this game is absolutely not a cookie-cutter representation of any one of those games.  Although I enjoy playing all of them, I actually like the tone and atmosphere of this game slightly more.  Moreover, the ending of this game is immensely superior to all three of those games.  The last time I remember playing a game and feeling the end was worth my invested time was Uncharted 2.DARKSIDERS is a fantastic package and comes highly recommended by a converted 2-star believer.

I was hoping it would be a crossover for me, since I do like some Action game elements, but in the end I just don't get excited enough about different combos and finisher moves to master all the button sequencing.  I really prefer mastering a bigger variety of spells or weapons and using stealth or situational tactics over the constant gladiator-style, non-stop fighting with the same weapon against wave after wave of enemies.Pros:- Fantastic graphics- Intense, virtually non-stop, bloody as hell action- Immersive experience going into Hell to beat it and win- Based on a classic book and fairly true to the concept- Very memorable imagery and themes- Puzzles are goodCons:- Emphasis is on learning button sequencing and proper timing for different combos and finishers (not my thing; if this appeals to you, this game would be excellent)- Linear path and really only one way to succeed (there is no stealth option or alternate paths)- Can only save the game at certain save pointsI can see where this would be a 5-star game for gamers who love Action games like God of War.  I was hoping that it would have cross-over appeal for RPG'ers like me.  The concept and imagery did work and appeal to me, but there is not enough flexibility in gameplay to make it fun for me.  I'm just not into combos and finishers enough to work on memorizing button sequencing and perfect timing like this game requires.  If that is your thing, you will love this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005FMLZQQ","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Van Wagenen","summary":"Hard to say for sure if this is an improvement on the old white design","reviewText":"This remote has lots going for it. It's more compact, lighter, nicer-looking (glossy black), and costs less than I paid for my older, bigger, white Xbox 360 remote several years ago.First of all, if you haven't seen or used the old remote, then you can skip most of what I'm about to say. The remote works well and has most every function you'll need. But coming from the old ones left me missing a few things.This new version certainly looks nicer. Black almost always looks better than white, and shows dirt and grime less as it ages. But when you actually pick this up versus picking up the old white one, the white one feels MUCH sturdier and heavier. I don't mind when handheld devices are heavy, personally. So the drastic weight reduction that many may see as a positive, I see as a negative. It is so light it feels like you could snap it in half if you accidentally tripped on it.Some buttons were removed from this new version. All of the Windows Media Center buttons were removed, along with the eject button. Probably 98% of people wouldn't care much about the WMC buttons, but I liked being able to toggle the disc tray with the eject button, personally.The buttons on this version are more rigid and clickity-clackity than the older version, which has softer, quieter, rubbery buttons.But, the old remote retailed for ten bucks more. So overall it's hard to really pick a clear winner. Decide what is important to you and judge which would be a better fit for you based on the differences I outlined. You can still pick up the old version in various places for a pretty decent deal nowadays. I think overall though, for me, I have to admit I am leaning very slightly to the old version over this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

The Vita has the best build quality I have ever seen in a handheld. The screen is pretty sexy and multi-touch is nice. If you use the web browser you can touch two fingers to the screen and move them apart and that will zoom in the screen. Move your fingers toward each other and you will zoom out. Very comfortable to hold. The PSP always felt as if it wasn't quite \"tall\" enough for my hands. The Vita fits comfortably and your fingers will naturally want to rest against the rear touchpad.Messaging people on their PS3s. I was easily able to send messages to my friends on their PS3s. On the Vita you can handle multiple messages because the interface doesn't look like an inbox. It is set up more as a chat room. You can easily send a message to one person or to multiple recipients. You can check your friends list and see what they are playing whether they are on PS3 or Vita.The interface is a bit annoying at first. During set-up I was prompted to sign into PSN. I click on the button and I am told that I need to download a firmware update before signing into PSN. Why? Then I look at all of the apps which are represented by bubbles and I see nothing that looks like system settings or networking. However, one bubble in particular is THROBBING in a \"pick me, pick me!\" kind of way. Fire that one up and it is a tutorial and damn it, it's a voice over which slows things down considerably. You will actually hear a knock on a door and the voice will tell you about it. I quit the tutorial and look for some kind of settings option which is on a separate page (and no hint that you need to look elsewhere for it.) Thankfully you can manage the apps to appear on whatever page you like. Each game gets its own bubble and it will throb at you after the game is installed.The content manager is kind of interesting in that you handle moving files from the Vita itself. I used it with Windows 7 and if you want music, you tap the music button on the Vita and it lists all of the songs in your music folder on Windows. I was a little annoyed that the content manager only looks in My Pictures, My Music and My Videos. You might be able to change that if you want to add content from other folders but as of now I haven't located that option.Pictures taken with the vita camera look...ok. They are alright on the Vita screen but put them on a PC and they look like crap. Videos that you upload to Vita look alright. Not bad but not outstanding either.As for the games- right now I am playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Little Deviants and Escape Plan. The graphics are lush and beautiful but I wouldn't go so far as to say that they are PS3 quality. They are certainly the most detailed graphics of any handheld released to date. Many of these early games use the Vita's various inputs to some degree. For example, in Uncharted you can use the rear touchpad to climb ropes and tilt the Vita to maintain your character's balance. In Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 you can use the touchscreen to perform special moves. I will explain these in greater detail in the reviews for each game.Finally, the 3G. The maximum file size you can download over 3G is quite small and it does not support simultaneous multi-player like what you might see in a first-person shooter. Unless you have a pressing need to check your messages from your friends list or don't have a phone with a web browser, I say save $50 and get the Wi-Fi model of the Vita.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Concerned One \"Thrashfan\"","summary":"A new generation in portable entertainment!!!","reviewText":"This brings DVD quality video, and playstation two graphics/gaming to the palm of your hands.

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"VA Gamer","summary":"Middle of the road MMO, missing some thematic traits","reviewText":"Star Trek Online (STO) is a quality MMO with impressive graphics, engaging combat, and some entertaining content. Ultimately, however, it suffers from an excess of prosaic and repetitive content, hampered by a curious absence of the exploratory and diplomatic aspects so synonymous with the Star Trek franchise.STO remains reasonably true to the source material. Many elements and characters are pulled directly from virtually all of the television series and films, and most are used in entertaining ways. Overall, however, the quality content is too sparse and revolves entirely around combat (absent is the diplomacy, mystery, and scientific wonder of the franchise). The many random missions that monopolize the players' time is painfully rushed and pumped out by a content-generation engine that leads to mission after mission that looks the same and has the same objectives.This rushed feeling extends to the pacing of the advancement. You will only be able to captain a new type of ship, and therefore customize and improve it, every ten levels. There are only 50 levels to advance through which means four new ships. To make things worse each ten-level stretch gets predictably longer and longer, and by level 15 it devolves into a pretty bad grind - largely due to the repetitive content. However, as I mentioned, there is some very enjoyable missions to be found within the avalanche of banality, and the space combat is well executed (even in PvP, which is rare in newly-launched MMOs). The ground (away mission) combat is, to put it simply, tedious and clearly unfinished. The ground content is so bad that you begin dreading having to partake in such missions - they serve to detract heavily from the game and make you just want to rush through them.There is virtually no exploration in this game. Not even within your starship, which is odd for a Star Trek RPG: most of every movie and episode occured within the confines of the Enterprise or some other ship. All you ever get to see is the bridge in STO, and occassionally other portions of other ships during the terrible away missions.Overall this isn't a bad MMO. It sways uneasily being being a good MMO, and a mediocre MMO with too many boring stretches. It does nothing to innovate or attract an audience outside of the genre, so be aware that STO is firmly set in the pre-WoW model of grindy MMO (though it is not nearly as repetitive or grindy as recent MMOs like Aion). If you really want to try a Star Trek RPG, especially a MMO, I'd say give it a shot. If you're on the fence, hold off for several months while the content gets refined and fleshed out.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

Not only is the story in this game enticing and engrossing, it actually is thought out, unlike most games coming out now.  To the people who \"played\" this game and said the graphics looked like those for a ps1, I want to see which ps1 game you're playing because I have never seen graphic capabilities such as Halo on any other game system (PC not included).  The best part of playing this game is not playing the story alone, but rather going head to head with your friends or playing co-op and shooting the elites in the front while your friend sneaks around and melees them in the back.  The multi-player of this game is the best you will ever have with any game.  I have had this game since it came out and I still love battling it out with my friends.  The weapons are well-modeled, as are the characters.  Some of the single player maps are repeated, but you get over that after a minute when you enter the heat of the battle.  Also, this game is not just blast straight in guns blaring.  At some parts you sneak past large groups of enemies, bypassing them completely.I urge anyone who owns an Xbox or who is considering one that Halo is definitely enough to buy the box...(The PC version requires a very good computer to have the half the frame rate of the Xbox version.)The controls of this game are just perfect.  They require a learning time of about five minutes and you'll look like a pro.Another fun thing about the multi-player is the fact that you can change the amount of damage it takes to die.  When playing free-for-all, one grenade and you're blasting off to the ceiling.  In a Team Slayer like game, it takes multiple grenades to die.  This challenges those gamers who like the one-hit kills to try something different.If you purchase this game, you will not forget the experiences and memories that you have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2003"}

It's the best xbox live game to-date. However, it's not perfect. It's not the greatest game of all time. Most importantly, the only mark it has made on history is single day sales.That said, let's get to the bottom line about Halo 2.The Good:-Graphics-A good online multiplayer setup-Fun-Sound/Soundtrack-Dual Wielding is pretty cool.The Bad:-The Ending.-Weapons are still unbalanced, just in a different way.-Levels are still repetitive.-Some Xbox live players are, for lack of a better term, annoying as sin.-No tanks in Multiplayer (in optimatch, at least).Some Elaboration on the Bad Points:I will not discuss the ending, as to not spoil it. It's just bad. Really, really, really bad.The weapons are kinda irksome. If they had left the pistol as what it was in Halo 1, it might have balanced out what they've created. The problem is the energy sword. Most of the maps have 1. Short of the rocket launcher, or a well placed grenade (and that is assuming they don't hit you from behind), good luck getting off enough shots to kill someone with the sword. Granted, if you can keep your distance, sniping is an option. Or if you're lucky the shotgun will do it, but for the most part, it's pretty unstopable. Which is annoying.Equally annoying is the lack of tanks in the multiplayer. The tank balances out the warthog, ghost, and banshee. Without it, the only balancing item is the rocket launcher. Just seems lacking.One big complaint in Halo 1 was the levels you had to repeat backwards. While this never happens in Halo 2, the levels themselves are internally repetitive. For example, big room, corridor, identical big room, identical corridor, slightly different big room, slightly different corridor, etc. There could definately be more variety.Finally, while I like xbox live and the rank/optimatch system, there are a lot of annoying people on xbox live who you'll run into. It's unavoidable, and there's no real way to fix it, but it's there, so be ready for it.Bottom Line: Good game you should probably have if you have xbox live.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002KSPKRS","description":"The Ear Force X41 is Turtle Beach&rsquo;s top-of-the-line XBOX 360 headset featuring 7.1 channel Dolby surround sound, XBOX LIVE chat and a digital RF wireless connection for crystal-clear game audio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview:Combining outstanding comfort with a stunning 360 degree sound field and enhanced online communication, the X41 puts you in the middle of the action so you&rsquo;ll enjoy a gaming experience that&rsquo;s second to none.Playing your favorite XBOX game with the Ear Force X41 is like having a &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; in your arsenal. You&rsquo;ll get a competitive advantage by hearing sound cues that youcan&rsquo;thear with speakers, such as the soft footsteps of an enemy sneaking up behind you, or the loading of a weapon far in the distance, regardless of the direction. By hearing sounds others can&rsquo;t - and by knowing where they&rsquo;re coming from - you&rsquo;ll react faster and take them out before they takeyouout.If you&rsquo;re serious about XBOX 360 gaming, get serious about the sound. Invest in an Ear Force X41 and experience the game the way it was meant to be heard. It will help you to become a better player and you&rsquo;ll have a lot more fun enjoying your XBOX 360.&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround Sound Technology!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Take your gaming to the next level by experiencing how your Xbox 360 was meant to be heard!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;Enjoy late night gaming without disturbing others!Click here to enlarge&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolby 7.1 Channel Surround SoundThe Ear Force X41 transmitter uses a 150MPS Digital Signal Processor (DSP) to deliver genuine Dolby Digital sound, Dolby Pro Logic IIx, and Dolby Headphone surround sound processing technologies - the industry-standard formats for encoding multi-channel sound in XBOX 360 games and DVD movies. The X41 uses the latest version of Dolby technology to create realistic game sound in 7.1 channels for improved surround sound accuracy.Dolby Pro Logic IIx and Stereo EnhancerThe X41 transmitter incorporates the latest Dolby Pro Logic IIx decoding system for surround sound realism from Dolby Pro Logic II encoded audio. When used with stereo sources, the Dolby Pro Logic Decoder also enhances the sound by spreading the stereo signal to provide a &ldquo;wider&rdquo; effect. This results in a richer, fuller sound than normal stereo - almost as if it originates from outside of the headphones.2.4GHz Wireless Digital RF TechnologyThe Ear Force X41 transmits game audio to the headset with an uncompressed wireless digital radio frequency (RF) signal to deliver CD-quality sound that rivals professional-grade wired headphones. Best of all, the wireless RF signal does not require &quot;line of sight&quot; to operate. That means you can stand anywhere near your XBOX 360 and hear a clear, noise-free signal.Chat Boost&nbsp;Dynamic Talkback&nbsp;ExpanderIf you&rsquo;ve ever had trouble hearing teammates on XBOX LIVE when the game action heats up, then you know how frustrating it can be when you have to keep adjusting the chat volume. Chat Boost fixes this problem by automatically adjusting the XBOX Live chat level when the game gets louder, so chat from teammates isn't lost in the exciting parts of your game. As the game sound gets louder, Chat Boost turns up the chat volume automatically so you can still hear what everyone is saying.It's a simple solution to an annoying problem, and it all happens automatically - so you don't have to adjust anything!Microphone MonitoringIt's hard to hear yourself speak when a headset is covering your ears. The X41 corrects this annoyance with its microphone monitoring feature. The X41 adds a portion of the microphone signal into the headset signal, so you can hear a portion of your voice along with incoming chat and game audio. Microphone monitoring not only prevents you from talking too loud or accidentally yelling into the mic, it also eliminates that annoying &quot;clogged ears&quot; feeling when talking while the headset is covering your ears.Bass BoostThe X41 headset DSP also lets you turn on a Bass Boost feature that produces deep, rich bass tones by increasing the volume of low frequency sounds - just like turning up the volume on the sub-woofer on your home theater system. Bass Boost improves your gaming experience by kicking-up the sound level of explosions, gun shots and other deep-bass sound effects, making them even more dramatic.Wired Headphone ConnectionThe X41 transmitter includes a headphone output jack with volume control to connect an optional pair of wired headphones in addition to the wireless X41 headset. This jack outputs the same high-quality Dolby Headphone 7.1 surround sound that&rsquo;s being transmitted to the wireless X41 headset, which allows two people to hear the game sound at the same time.Independent Chat/Game VolumesSeparate volume controls let you adjust the game and chat levels individually, so you can easily balance them and never have to worry about missing a cue from your teammates.Advanced Battery Booster CircuitryThe X41 has a &ldquo;battery booster&rdquo; circuit that squeezes every last bit of power from the batteries and assures high quality sound until they&rsquo;re completely dead. This allows a pair of AAA Alkaline batteries to last for as long as 25 straight hours of game play. You can also buy standard rechargeable batteries in place of Alkaline batteries.Powered By USBThe transmitter is powered by a single USB port on your XBOX, or from a nearby PC or laptop. So there is no need to fuss with a separate AC power adapter.","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Good product... just don't use the microwave","reviewText":"Sorry for the silly review title, but read on and you'll understand. And no, I didn't put my X41s in the microwave.My girlfriend has been complaining quite a bit over the last few months about my gaming habit. Not how much I play (it really isn't THAT bad), but in how the games sound. She doesn't like the sound of gunfire from Modern Warfare 2, gunfire and zombie splatter in Left for Dead and so on. My house is a ranch style and is relatively small. You can't escape the sound from my surround sound system no matter the room you're in. This left me in a dilemma. Do I stop playing completely? Do I turn it down? Do I start using my TV speakers? Was there another solution?Turns out I looked for the last option, another solution.The first option I found were the Skullcandy offerings. When I began looking there were 2 options from Skullcandy; on ear and over the ear. I don't like on the ear headphones for extended periods and as any gamer will tell you, most gaming sessions, even if you have the best intention of keeping it short, can easily turn into 3+ hour excursions. The on the ear option is readily available. The over the ear option? Sold out in most on-line stores. The 2 headsets were the G.I. 360 and the Lowrider Xbox 360. The Skullcandy headsets only offer stereo output and don't have a chat boost option. Chat boost being a bump in the loudness of the chat you are having with your squad mates while playing in a mission that has tons of action.I then happened upon the Turtle Beach line of headsets.The X31s are stereo only headsets and do NOT require and cannot use the optical outputs. The X31s have analog pass through connections meaning you have to plug them into the red and white cables from the 360 AV cable. The X31 has most all the other options of the X41s (wireless RF, chat enhancement and so on). If you don't want/need 7.1 audio, the X31s, which my father purchased not long after I purchased the X41s, are definitely viable and less costly option you have available.Here is a quick rundown of the specs:Dolby Digital 7.1 supportDolby Prologic IIx supportDigital RF wireless headsetChatBoost - dynamically raises chat volume in areas of a game where game audio can potentially over power the volume of chat dialogBass BoostMic Monitor - your voice feeds back into the headphones so you can hear what you're saying and know if you're speaking too loudDigital and analog input capableTo review the actual product, I'll break it down into several areas.First, the packaging since this will be your first interaction with the headset. Turtle Beach made a decently attractive box for the setup, however there is an issue. We all know and hate the clam shell packaging companies use for antitheft purposes. Unfortunately the exterior box holds one of these evil clam shell designed interiors. It's not easy to open but it's easy to have a mishap and find yourself bleeding after fighting with the packaging.Second is the setup. Setting this up is relatively easy but can be confusing at first and will take 15-30 minutes to ensure proper setup and to become familiar with all of the volume knobs and what needs to be powered on/off. Setup consists of plugging a USB cable into the Xbox 360 then into the back of the white receiver box for power, plug the included optical cable into the AV box on the 360 and the other end into the Digital IN on the white receiver. Plug the included AAA batteries into the headphones. Plug the communicator cable into the 360 controller then into the headset and you're ready to roll. Volume adjustments can be made from the volume knob on the front (this is for using a wired set of headphones; this knob does nothing for the wireless headphones), on the headphones themselves (this controls the wireless headphone's in game audio) and then on the included chat cable (which controls chat volume only). One other thing to note, which is missing from the Skullcandy offerings, is the ability to actually mute communications as you can with the standard communicators.You must power on the white receiver and the headphones. One nice feature on the headphones is that if they sense no game audio they will power themselves down to conserve battery power after a few minutes. If you plan on using these frequently you would be best advised to save money in the long run and purchase some AAA rechargeables and a nice charger. I recommend 4 AAA batteries; 2 for active use and 2 for backups. Swap them around as needed and you'll always have a set of charged batteries.If you just want to listen to the game sound you can move the mic up and out of the way or remove it completely from the headset as it is detachable. One caveat to this headset though is the inability to switch the side of your head the mic is on. Given the design constraints for battery requirements it is understandable but still annoying to not have a choice on which side of your head you want the mic to sit. Even the cheap Microsoft communicator gives you the option for righty or lefty usage.You HAVE to use the digital output (optical output)from the AV cable to enable the Dolby Digital 7.1 audio. This means that if you're using HDMI for video and audio, you may have some problems. If you're not using Microsoft's HDMI offering you will need to modify your old component/composite AV cord to allow you to plug both an HDMI cable and the old gray AV box or you'll have to eat the $50 Microsoft asks for its HDMI cable. This isn't really Turtle Beach's fault per se, though I'm sure an HDMI passthrough could be designed to allow you to use HDMI for all of your audio as well. Perhaps the X42s will offer this?The third part of the review is audio quality. In a word, the audio quality is fantastic. I'm really impressed with the sound Turtle Beach is able to achieve with 2 standard \"professional grade\" type headphones. Other solutions for multichannel audio on the 360 actually have up to 8 different tiny speakers in the headphones. Positional audio is spot on with these headphones and is generally crystal clear. One complaint I read prior to purchasing the headphones and I experience myself is the low level hiss you hear when no game audio is present. Depending on your sensitivity this will either be a non-issue or a deal breaker. It does exist. I don't find it distracting or annoying because generally speaking I have audio coming through the phones which obliterates the low level hiss completely.For chat volume, I've found that it can be hit or miss depending on with whom you play. Louder players can cause you to adjust the volume down and quieter players require you to turn it up. This is the same with the standard Microsoft offering. No one seems to offer an \"auto leveling\" option. One very nice feature to these headphones is the Chat Boost function. This option cannot be changed; it is always on. The nice thing though, is that you won't mind it. What this does is raises the chat volume dynamically based on what's happening in the game. Sometimes you will find that it boosts slightly late, meaning your friend could start talking right as heavy action begins and you'll miss the first few syllables or so. This is a small frustration given with the standard communicator you'd be lucky to only miss out on the first few syllables.The headphones themselves are over the ear, not on the ear, and the material used on the cushioning has been changed from the X4s. The X4s used velvet and were quick to make your ears sweat. The X41s use a fabric mesh that, after using the headset for over 20 hours of game play with a 6+ hour marathon mixed in, not made my ears sweat or uncomfortable yet.Turtle Beach's website has a nice comparison of the changes made to the X4 to create the X41. I cannot provide the link directly here, but if you hit the Turtle Beach site and click on the Ear Force X41 link, along the left hand side you will see a link for X4 vs. X41 Comparison.Those of you wondering about the microwave comment, this section is for you.Issues:To put it simply, if you're using these headphones, try not to operate the microwave. You will get a popping sound in the headphones until the microwave shuts off. I've experienced this both at my house and at my father's house. I'm sure there are microwaves out there that will likely prevent this, but to be on the safe side just don't do it. I don't think it will damage the headphones but the popping noise can be really disquieting and annoying. If your significant other plans on making dinner while you're playing and the plan involves a microwave, maybe it's best to stop and help with the cooking or switch to TV audio temporarily.One issue I experienced and required me to return the first headset, is highly annoying feedback and lack of the ability to actually chat. I was playing COD: MW2 with my father. After an hour or 2 of perfect audio and chat, something happened. I heard a popping sound in the headphones and then I could no longer chat with my father. Then I could hear him complaining that all he was getting was feedback from his headset. What he was hearing was my headset playing his audio into the chat channel so he heard everything he said only greatly amplified. After fussing with the headset I learned that the problem was actually the connection in the headphones. If I moved the communicator cable slightly I would hear a loud pop, similar to the microwave pop and then my father would complain about the feedback. I tried the cable he received with his X31 on my headset and it had the same issue; he tried my cable on his set and it worked perfectly. I returned that set to the store I bought them from and got a replacement set and these work flawlessly.Over all I am happy with my purchase and would buy them again.Pros:wirelessChatBoostYou hear game and chat from both ears, not just one ear per source when using the TV/communicator optionsgood soundgood positional audiocomfortable headestwired headphone compatible for either personal use (if you don't want chat) or split screen partner useremovable mic for times you just want game audioCons:low level hiss when no audio is being playedseveral other Amazon reviews required replacements as did mineMic can only mount on left sideOver all I am extremely pleased with this headset. I'm sure the X42s, if Turtle Beach is working on them, will be another step above this set just as this set is a step up from the X4s. Considering this set debuted, however, we aren't likely to see X42s for the foreseeable future, so in the meantime if you purchase this set you can be pretty confident you are receiving the best game sound/communicator headset available on the 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2010"}

The story and characters jumped from the screen with such life and reality. Although some of the plot points with treasures are more sci-fi these characters are always grounded in reality. The graphics in this game are amazing to this day; I can't wait to see how Uncharted 2 looks. The game play is some of the best 3rd person shooter action I've ever played. Jumping from cliff to cliff is amazing. Then jump behind cover to shoot some bad guys. This is an Indiana Jones genre game, but does better than any Indy game I've ever played. I've beat this game three times, and it never got dull. Simply one of the best games of all time. Every adventure has a beginning and this franchise gets started with a blast.Presentation- This game has an overall great feel to it. The cut scenes draw you in and you really connect to Drake and his plights. The menus are great the music is extraordinary, and the feel of the game has the tone of a million dollar movie.4.5/5Graphics- This is top notch even in today's standards being three years old. Some of the best cut scenes only beaten by Metal Gear Solid 4.5/5Game play- This game has some great 3rd person cover systems along with beautiful cliff jumping. There are some problems with the strength of the enemies though. They tend to take too many hits. Also I would like to hold more than two weapons. I wish it had a ring system like Resistance. The boat scenes are a little annoying, but it is a nice variety. The lack of a health bar is nice; it takes into account hits in a row like Resistance 2 or Call of Duty.4/5Story- The story is engrossing and one of the best adventure stories ever told. The characters come alive and show a reality that few games can reproduce.5/5Lasting Appeal- I've beaten this game three times and I still love it. The characters, treasures, and action are amazing.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"Davidovich53","summary":"Entertaining game held back by some bugs","reviewText":"First and foremost, I won't even compare this game to GTA IV because it's not MEANT to; Volition has come out and said long before the game's release that it's not trying to replace GTA.One of the biggest selling points for me was that I could play as both a man or a woman.  And once I learned that I could visit a plastic surgeon at any time and change my gender back and forth, I was even happier.  I also appreciate the fact that Volition supplied six different voice tracks for the protagonist, each with its own personality and nuance, giving the game a distinctly different feel for each playthrough.  For example, the British actor would read one line as \"hey mate\" when it's supposed to be \"hey man.\"  Little touches like this give the voice tracks their own personalities.  I was struck at how different a cutscene feels when the hero has a different voice and attitude.Pros:-Be male or female (or a freak; be a man with a high, female voice!)-Great VO work, engaging supporting characters with personality-Variety of missions and activities (especially Septic Avenger; spraying sh** on people is hilarious!)-New features such as human shield, cruise control, fine aiming, dual wielding-More customization options (clothing, tatoos, hairstyles)-Excellent GPS is back, plus now you can place \"bookmarks\" on the map as reminders (i.e. during a mission you find a tag spot, and want to remember its location for later)-Stores are now open 24/7, meaning you no longer have to wait around endlessly to buy that one specific shirt you want-Fresh soundtrack with songs you haven't heard in other games-Instantly warp between a store and your wardrobe, making it easier to mix and match your clothes-Some cool easter eggs to be foundCons:-Bugs/glitches from first game are back (such as cars disappearing, NPCs getting stuck in your vehicle)-Idiot homie A.I. (guys, did you know you can walk AROUND obstacles?)-No way to give commands to homies-No auto-lock on or aim assist of any kind, making shootouts harder than they need to be (the option to toggle it on or off would have been nice)-Digital music player from SR 1 has been canned (you can't listen to music when on foot anymore)-Melee fighting system (Brotherhood style, Ronin style, etc) largely feels gimmicky and wasted; outside the \"fight club\" activity, there is no reason whatsoever to use fisticuffs when you could simply shoot your enemies","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"Just like the Wiimote, maybe a little better","reviewText":"I've been playing with the included Sports Champions game for a few days now.  Overall I think the Move is very similar to the Wii remote, only a bit bigger.  The PS EyeToy, which is included in the bundle and needed for the Move to function properly (the EyeToy tracks the position of the sphere on the Move), functions like the sensor bar on the Wii.  Unlike the Wii sensor bar, though, the EyeToy is difficult to position, because its cable is thick and stubborn.  You may need some Scotch tape to make it stand properly, whether on top or in front of your TV.Many people have claimed that the Move is more accurate and precise than the Wiimote, but from playing with the included sports game, I do not get that sense. Okay, maybe a little better than the Wii especially in the ping pong game, but otherwise I feel this is just like the Wii remote. It's actually a little frustrating that you must hold down the T button to move around a menu, but you can get used to that quickly.The Move feels good in either hand, actually better ergonomics than the Wiimote.  The buttons can be a little tricky to reach for people with small hands, but they have good feedback and feel solid and reliable, unlike the Wiimote buttons.In addition to the EyeToy and the Sports Champions game, you get a demo disc which is useful in evaluating whether the first batch of Move games such as Start the Party are any good.In short, I think it's great that the PS3 finally gets a motion-sensing controller.  More game opportunities on the PS3 have been opened up to.  I don't think it's much better than the Wiimote (and probably same vis-a-vis the Kinect), but I'm excited about the reported ways developers are taking advantage of this controller in upcoming hardcore games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Currently, I have my brother's glacier GBAthat still works fine and have the original box & all paperwork. We both loved playing games on theGBA.It is basically a portable version of the SNES, the graphics on some of the games is amazing. My youngerbrother and I kept our GBA's in good shape, I sold mine at our garagesale som years back, I'm nowregretting that I did sell it! Over time my brother played games on his GBA less and less and he just put itin this carrying case Nintendo made and put it in a open drawer where it sat for 16+ years! Several days ago,I found the original box and manuals but no sign of the GBA. My brother surprised me when he said to me.&#34;Wereyou looking for this?&#34; I was very surprised to say the least, the GBA was buried by time and dust in a NintendoGBA case and still works fine today. In my opinion, the GBA was one of Nintendo's finest Gameboy consolesmade. One of the great things I loved about the GBA is that there are no &#34;loading&#34; times, you just slid the gamepak in the slot and you're good to go. The negative thing about the GBA is the amount of alkaline batteries you'llbe buying just to play games. There was an ac adapter-rechargeable combo made for it but these are rare andprobably won't work even if you find one today. In the users manual, Nintendo doesn't recommend you don'tuse rechargeable batteries. I always wondered, why not?? Maybe it's because rechargeable batteries don'tlast as long as alkaline batteries? In the manual, there's no mention as to why a person is advised not to userechargeable batteries. I use those nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries with no problems at all. If youuse those kind of batteries, you'll save yourself a ton of money on batteries alone.Another drawback of the GBA is the design. It's doesn't have a clamshell design, it can get pretty beat up, the screen can get scratched up, as well as the body and while you can still place it in your pocket, it's best to buy aprotective case.to protect it from dings & scatches.If you're a collector or a retro handheld videogame fan, the GBA is a nice little console that you'll enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2014"}

I'm just going to drop the cold hard facts about this game.1. It's a very good sequel to Path of Radiance. If you haven't played part 1 for the NGC, you're gonna want to for the save data. You're gonna need it. Not at the start of the game like most video games but trust me, you're gonna want to have it.2. This isn't a title for the faint of heart. If you can't function under pressure or have fun with a game you can't \"have your way with\", turn back NOW. I repeat, TURN AWAY AND RUN. Radiant Dawn has set the standard. It's a very rewarding game but it's very difficult. It's harder than Path of Radiance without a doubt, and is sure to give Fire Emblem vets a run for their money. This game is SERIOUS brain work but TONS of fun. A master strategy game.3. The graphics suck. Ok well they don't suck lol, but if you were expecting a major upgrade to Path of Radiance you'll be more or less disappointed. It's pretty much the same, except for a SLIGHT improvement in combat and cut scene graphics and camera effects. And when I say slight, I mean it.4. A story line to die for. I won't reveal any spoilers but I'll say one thing. Just when you get upset over buying this game, things are gonna happen that will make your jaw drop. Especially if you played the first one. Radiant Dawn has a way with suspense and surprises. Right after hating you bought it, you're gonna be glad you did. Trust me.5. The controls are great, especially if you still have your old NGC controller, as the gameplay will be exactly the same. I can't speak for the wii remote and nunchuck, cuz once you plug that NGC controller and start, you're not gonna wanna use anything else. It does a good job of keeping the feel of the first one.All in all, the good outweighs the bad by a landslide. The only Con there's gonna be while playing this game is the difficulty, but you can always set it to easy. The only other Con there can be is that the graphics haven't improved much but I doubt the Fire Emblem crowd are the ones who can't enjoy a game unless it's graphics are ridiculously gorgeous. If that's what you want, leave this game alone. If you want good graphics with a fantastic everything else, however, you've come to the right place.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

At the end, the glowingly positive reviews made me snag it. Oddly, I ended up playing the multiplayer dune buggy game more than the actual game, until my stats absurdly reset themselves for some unknown reason.The main game, like a few of the more negative reviews said - is a bit boring. Maybe there is some meat to it, but I started playing it and haven't picked it up again. I was hoping for some fallout mixed with borderlands, like everyone else. Sadly, it's not that. Though combat has some nice touches to it, so far the people have the \"stand around and give you quests\" syndrome. That kind of design I think was cool in an early era, but not nowadays. Especially for a game with so much potential. This really could have been an awesome game. For crying out loud it has the Bethseda badge on it. It should have been an open world quest-ridden adventure. As is stands the greatest thing I've done so far is get a cool shotgun.Yes, there is texture pop-in. Which is really baffling how something like this didn't get fixed. It's really noticeable. You  turn, textures pop in, you turn back, they pop in again. It seems like they should be loaded already but if you look away and look back the tetxures will pop back in! It's really jarring and takes away from the beauty of the game. The thing is the graphics from far away are gorgeous. The mountains look great, canyons are beautiful. It makes you want to epxlore every nook and cranny of this world. Then you realize that you're going on some silly quest to turn on a switch somewhere across the desert, for no realy rhyme or reason other than you're an \"ark person\" who happens to be a bad ass with a gun, for no real explainable reason. There's no real reason that you're on this journey, nothing concrete pushing you forward. You don't really have an overreaching villian. Granted I am probably a little guilty of passing judgement too soon, but in this day in age with so many games out you need to grab me quick or risk losing.I guess the point is moot since they already have my 65 bucks, but I am regretting my impulse purchase. This is definetly a rental, or a pruchase arounmd the 30 or 40 mark, not a full 65 bucks. The online modes are pretty cool, like I said I actually played the road rage game more than the main game until they reset my stats.The bottomline is, don't be fooled by all the hype. While I'm not \"raging\" at the fact I bought it, I surely should have rented it from gamefly or bought it at a discount. That's what you should too. While great, and the tech surely has some potential - just thinking about what Fallout 4 could be has me excited - this is not worth 65 full dollars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2011"}

I used to have DOOM 3 for xbox, never had the pc one. So I figured why not get the HD DOOM BFG Edition to upgrade. They said the graphics were better, sound, and other things along with 7 *new* levels.I was never impressed with the release of doom 3 for xbox so me being a huge doom fan I figure lets give it another go, maybe they fixed a lot of the bugs. Well the result is 50/50 right down the line. Below is the pros and cons.Pros+Doom 3, R.O.E., Lost Missions all rolled into one disc.+HD grahics make this seem like the doom that should have been released years ago on xbox. Very fun feeling going through the game knowing this is what is was \"supposed\" to be like. If they released this one years ago I would have been B L O W N away!! Its very awesome sights and sounds.+They added way more monsters on the screen at one time. Like the old games. (before they couldnt because of frame rate and memory so you would only see mabye 3 demons at a time.) NOw, they flood you would monsters trying to kill you. Which is what doom is all about.+Single Shotgun seems like they upped the power/sound. You get blown back when being hit by it and killing others.+Cheap, 40 bucks.+Full Doom 3 instead of the cut up xbox edition. Feels like a full game now.Cons-The Guns. Same problem with the first xbox release. Terrible terrible gun sounds, feels like your playing with children's toys. Seriously, Id...whats the deal? You have one job and you mess it up?!! Guns Guns Guns built DOOM!! You couldnt have given another 2 mintues on the sound of them? I know you can, *cough* Rage *cough*. How am I supposed to storm hells gate with BB guns??!!-The Levels....Lets face it. Doom 3 is 75 percent dark halls, and 25 percent awesome HELL stages. I get bored playing the same dark hallways, feels the same. If they made the game 75 percent hell I would give it 5 stars.-Too many IMPS, and they are so annoying to fight. Id there are more monsters to choose from than just IMPS.-The game is still dated, no matter how you change this and that. And it feels like it.Final words-If you liked DOOM 3 for xbox, this is better buy it. If you werent happy with doom 3 this isnt going to help change your mind on it. I feel with a few small changes they could have really made the game better but they fell short....again. If your on the fence, really the only difference is the HD look, and more action feel to it. The \"Lost Missons\" is really more of the same. If you have doom 3, its nothing new. Really. Sadly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2012"}

There's single missions in nearly all the MGS games I've spent countless hours on the get everything or at least get everything non lethal and this has that feeling.  I'm three missions in and I think it was totally worth it.

That's part of the fun!Graphics-wise, it looks fantastic if bare at times, plays at a smooth 60fps and there's plentiful objects to keep you busy on repeated mission trials. If you're into One And Done games, go pick up Call of Duty or any number of disposable shooters gathering dust on the discount rack. Ground Zeroes is a fantastic foundation for Phantom Pain and a total riot to play over and over again.  You'll miss a huge portion of the story impact if you never went through Snake Eater or in particular, Peace Walker.  But that's just the incentive to go back and try those in the mean time.The only downsides I can nitpick come down to matters of taste. At this point, even in limited exposure, I'm not into Sutherland as Big Boss. It's a pretty big jump to forget the old campy gruff Snake from David Hayter we all know and jarring to hear Jack Bauer in his place.  Sutherland could grow on me and Hayter could well appear as Solid again, but I'm unconvinced right now. Secondly, while the controls are a lot smoother this time around, I'm a bit miffed they simplified all the movement options from MGS IV. Admittedly it's not as daunting for beginners but there's a bit less personality to Snake for CQC. The only way to look at it is Kojima is keeping things in line with Snake Eater so it's not a huge mishap and has some degree of continuity.Overall, if you're new to Megal Gear Solid and coming from the shooter corner, it's possible this game in particular may not be for you. If what you experience is simply a seemingly short third person shooter after rescuing two people in twenty minutes and don't get it, you're missing a huge chunk of what these games are about - replay is the fun. But if you have put Snake through his paces before and are itching for a sneaky challenge, then there could be a great adventure ahead to play again in Kojimas sandbox until Snake rides again in the Phantom Pain.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

FINAL FANTASY III features graphics that have been reworked and remodeled in 3D while maintaining the mythical FINAL FANTASY look and feel. Format: NINTENDO DS Genre:&nbsp;RPG (VG) Age:&nbsp;662248906133 UPC:&nbsp;662248906133 Manufacturer No:&nbsp;90613","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Classic Cleverly Cleaned Up","reviewText":"I'm lucky enough to have the older Final Fantasy III for the Game Boy to compare with this title, and I have to tell you, Square Enix has done a nice job bringing it over to the Game Boy's powerful cousin the Nintendo DS.  While some DS titles seem to incorporate the stylus just to have an excuse to drag the stylus into the picture, Final Fantasy III DS really does make it easy and fun to use:  drag the stylus around the screen and watch your little character walk along behind it.  Pull the stylus further away and he starts running to catch up.  Where older titles required to you sometimes rub up against the locals in order to be able to get them to talk with the \"A\" button, here a quick tap on the person starts up the dialogue.Those of you more comfortable with the classic controls will be pleased to know that the D-pad and buttons still work exactly the same way they used to if you'd rather use them.If you haven't played Final Fantasy III before, this is probably the friendliest (and best-looking) way to get into it.  If you've never played any Final Fantasy games at all before, I'd also say this title is a good place to start if you just want a glimpse of \"the early years\" without having to go all the way back to the beginning.  The DS makeover is top to bottom, tweaking menus to be a bit more pleasant to the eye, bringing more and brighter colors into the picture, and definitely putting the DS' graphics chip to good use prettying everything up.  Probably the only thing here that doesn't really work is the idea of zooming in and out.  It's a useful tool because some hidden items can be discovered by getting an up-close view--switches, levers, candlesticks that open secret doors, and sparkling spots that hide goodies.  Unfortunately, it isn't always easy to move in and out of with the shoulder button (or tapping the icon).  That said, it doesn't really hinder the gameplay:  it's just a nice idea that doesn't quite gel.If you're familiar with console RPGs, you'll be pleased with how Final Fantasy III handles the little details.  For example, when you're shopping in a store, you'll see cartoons of your characters:  when you're examining an item, each character who can use the item will light up and wave at you.  It's actually quite cute.  It's also easier to tell at a glance if you already own an item, how many you have in your bag or are equipped on a character, and whether a particular item will make things better or worse if you buy it.When it comes to the gameplay, the story is similar to most in that you play a hero who bands together a party and off they go to fight a world-threatening evil and save the day.  It also openly recycles the Final Fantasy I plot of \"four warriors come together to unite the four crystals and restore balance between light and dark.\"  However, there's a new twist in that instead of having a party with many members and you can only take so many out of the box at a time, instead you have four, and YOU get to control what kind of character you want them to be.  If you turn one character into a Monk and it's not useful, they can \"change jobs\" and try their hand as a mage.  There's a short break-in period where they're really limited, and then off they go, leveling through their \"job\" just like they level as a character.  Each character also has their own custom abilities that expand the choices:  you can choose to have your fighter do an attack that rushes in and does a lot more damage, but leaves him more vulnerable to taking damage.  Or you can have your Monk stand and defend, and he'll attack anyone who attacks him, very useful when fighting 3 or more opponents.All in all, this port is FUN to play.  It's somewhat relaxing, it gets easier as you get the hang of it, and the graphical makeover that Square have done makes the entire experience more enjoyable.  Highly recommended for anyone who'd like to play old-school with a newer look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian J. Mcmahon","summary":"Fun, albeit short lived..","reviewText":"This is a fun, easy to play, isometric squad based tactical game. There are some home base management, development, and logistics aspects to the game, but these are minor. I have not played the old XCOM games, so I played this without knowing much about the old versions. What makes this game fun are the turn based decisions during the missions and then the technology and squad development secondarily. No doubt that this game is not for everyone, for some it will be too slow paced, for others it will be too shallow.It is rather short lived and somewhat shallow. It is also rather easy to win. You have to make a lot of bad development decisions to run into serious problems. One thing I did not like was that the starting position for your home base can make such a huge difference. There is a world of difference in the pace of the game if you put the base in Europe vs Africa. In Europe, you will blast through technology development rapidly. In Africa, you will inch your way forward, playing many more missions to get to the same point in the story arc. I don't really think that's a great feature, it's imbalanced.But at it's heart, it still the squad missions that hold the game together. There are a limited number of maps and mission types and they do get repetitive. Some of the missions are push-overs and others require very careful movement and decision making. Unfortunately losing a mission is pretty catastrophic, so I found myself loading from a save a couple of times, but I would say that happened in about 2% of the missions.If you can get the game on sale it is worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2013"}

He no longer a sweet little inocent kid, he's violent and hungry for revenge now.Now although Jak is a good game, it has some minor flaws. The first one is that it lacks variety of weapons. It only has 4: Scatter Gun, Blaster Weapon, Vulcanic Fury, and The Peace Keeper. They are still great weapons, but there could've been more of them. Another flaw is that there is not a lot of levels.

Hill \"CFH\"","summary":"Very Fun Game From Another Age - Recommended!","reviewText":"We played Pirates! back on the old Commodore 64 and it was one of our favorite games of all time, so we were thrilled when we saw that there was a release for the PC. This plays a lot like the original game and is still an exceptionally fun game.The basic goal of the game is to rise as high as possible by building a reputation, wealth, and completing missions for various leaders (governors, priests, etc).Your reputation will be important as you attempt to impress the various governor's daughters (ultimately seeking the hand of one in marriage). Dancing with the daughters is very important and you will need to do it a lot, but it is also the one aspect of the game that I don't like as it does get somewhat repetitive.There are several basic ways to get wealth, but preying on ships of whatever country is at war with yours is one of the fastest. I really enjoy the ship to ship and captain to captain combat that is involved in capturing other ships, but watch out for the pirate hunters that seek you out when you become more famous. You can also gather pieces of treasure maps that will lead to hordes of gold, but that generally takes more time.Like all pirate captains you have to make some tough choices and worry about keeping your crew happy (or you might find yourself on the wrong end of a mutiny).This is an addictive game that can be played over and over but one complaint from my daughter is that you can only be a male in the game.Recommended!CFH","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Some Guy","summary":"Not as scary but still Dead Space, and that's a good thing","reviewText":"Here is yet another review from a huuuuuge fan of the first two games...First and foremost, the overall atmosphere of monsters lurking remains, but that slightly claustrophobic, OMG are they going to get me feeling of constant fright from the first two just isn't there.  Those games were genuinely SCARY, and I'm not a kid.  I suspect it's the addition of a lot of open outdoor areas that takes the scares away, although the surprises keep coming as usual.The story is good and a fine continuation from the 2nd game, and you learn a lot more about how and what the necromorphs (and the bygone aliens on the planet) are and what they are (or were) up to.  There's a good twist in it, too.  Also, wait through the credits and keep the sound up.As for gameplay, they've polished the character movement to perfection.  I've been a huge fan of the over-the-shoulder 3rd/1st-person mix from the start, and still can't see why this hasn't been copied by everyone.  Having your health, stasis, and oxygen guages visible on the back of your suit instead of cluttering the screen is just ingenius.Of course, a big part of 3 is the weapon building aspect.  There are traditional weapons, existing blueprints you can build once you have the parts, and custom builds.  Suffice to say there are countless combinations, helped by the fact that there are several different kinds of basic frames that you build the weapons onto.  Some are one-handed, some two-handed, and the kind of things you can build and the amount of upgrade slots depend on the frame.A good 70% or so through the game, I made a weapon I couldn't give up!  It was a stasis-enhanced SMG-ish gun on top with a statis-enhanced force gun underneath (plus I added the statis amplifier attachment).  Imagine a bunch of necros running at you - with this weapon I could shred limbs away, and if they still got too close, use the force gun.  Since both have stasis, you're slowing them down as you shoot off limbs and then the force gun knocks them back AND leaves them hanging in statis.  So as you go back to the gun (no weapon switching, remember, this is one gun with two weapons!), you pretty much can keep them in perpetual statis while you pick them apart.  Big fun.  And that wasn't the only fun weapon I came up with, but I don't want to dwell too much on the subject.  Let's just say it's worth the time to experiment.  You can always dismantal something that didn't work out as well as you hoped, which gives back all the loot you used to build it (thank you!) so you can reuse it on the next.My only regret is how 3 has toned down the line gun.  It was my favorite weapon from the first two, but here I couldn't get one with a decent fire rate, even with +2 fire rate in all 4 upgrade slots.  Bummer!The enemy AI has changed a bit - along with some new enemy types, they tend to throw more at you at once this time.  Sometimes it was downright annoying.  There are these little necros about the size of a 10-year-old that are very fast and surprisingly hard to kill.  They attack in droves and it's downright hard to fend them off.  A challenge is good, but I think they took them just a little too far.  Also, sometimes it's hard to figure out exactly what they want you to do with a boss monster, although it's hard to explain this properly without spoilers.There's still all the good old fashioned necromorph slaughtering you could want, though, so it's not like this happens every 5 minutes.The graphics are as detailed as you could hope, and the game looks great, as always.  The action sequences and interactive cut scenes are excellent.Deep Space has really moved on from the first game, which is every bit as awesome and clench-your-hands frightning to play as it was several years ago, and the new and reworked elements made for a great game, no question.  If you liked the first two or just like survival horror in general, 3 is just a hair shy of the knockout the first two were.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Don't hesitate, get it and play it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2013"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will.

As a hardcore Final Fantasy fan, I find it hard to start on how disappointing this game is.First of all, the characters. They're lame. The main character is this stupid monkey boy who's part of a theater troupe. That's not very badass! After making the super cool ex SOLDIER Cloud and SeeD in training Squall, what was Squaresoft thinking? Did they not look back at the past final fantasies and get that the protagonist is supposed to be a badass? Losers hanging with this failure of a protagonist include a little kid with no face (who came up with THAT design?), an annoying guy in armor who always jumps up and down, a girl with purple hair (lol, is this an supposed to be an anime?), and another girl that's named after a weapon she doesn't even use, awesome. None of these characters are as awesome as Barret or as hot as Tifa and they all look like they came out of a cartoon, another failure on Squaresoft's part.Next, the story. It's stupid. The only thing I can recall from my boredom is that it involves stealing a princess during a play performance (wtf?) and preventing an airship from blowing up or something like that. The main villain is some fat blue lady. What the hell is that about? While playing this I just sat there wishing Sephiroth would jump into the scene and stab her! I stopped playing after the first disc, where in the end some white haired chick looks down at the dead characters and flies off on a dragon (was that supposed to be a female Sephiroth or what? who cares) The world was boring. It was all castles and medieval crap like that. Hello! Final Fantasies are supposed to take place in futuristic worlds with technology and guns!Lastly, the battle system. What a pile of crap. Only the stupid kid can cast black magic, the girl is the only one who can heal, and the other guys are the only ones who can use real weapons. What kinda system is that? It's like they're each supposed to have a designated role! You're supposed to have 'em learn spells though materia! Oh wait, only REAL Final Fantasies are allowed to have materia, my bad. Also, why do you control four party members? First of all, that makes this game even more confusing and stupid, and second of all, REAL Final Fantasies have only three party members!In conclusion, this game fails to please any Final Fantasy fan due to to Squaresoft's failure to take a look at the franchise's  roots. If Square had looked back and reflected on what made Final Fantasy such a great series to begin with, they would have known this game would be a disappointment to any longtime Final Fantasy fan such as myself.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2009"}

The Thousand Year Door now features the ability to go into the background to work things out, the ability to turn into a paper airplane, a paper boat, a paper roll and flat to get all the Star Sprites and Star Pieces. It features new mini-games, badges, moves and puzzles and doesn't actually focus on any of the happenings from the 1st game, it's a completely new game.The partners aren't original, as they focus on the original partners in Paper Mario but have different uses. Goombario is replaced by Goombella (the two most useless characters in broth games) who `tattle' and headbonk, Koopa is replaced by Koops who can be thrown around in his shell, Bombette is replaced by Bobbery who can blow up walls, Bow is replaced by Vivian who can make you invisible, Parakoopa is replaced Yoshi to carry you across gaps, Sushi was replaced by the paper boat, Watt was replaced by Ms Mowz and while Flurrie is the only original character and replies on wind.The game is much large and uses the power of the Gamecube to its extent.The battles are now watched by an audience that can either help you or can become your enemies, depending on how you act in battle, you can appeal to them for items and generally just show off Stylish moves to impress or to receive Star Power to use your Special Moves.Mario finds out that Princess Peach has been kidnapped by the X-Nauts and has to rescue her from becoming a host for the evil Demon Queen that resides behind the Thousand Year Door. To do this he must use the Magical Map he received from Peach to locate the Crystal Stars that will stop the Demon.I eagerly await the 3rd installment of this series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"A unique Final Fantasy that in some ways is superior to the first","reviewText":"I loved this game. Overall I think I like this game better than the original. It just has so much more in it than the first and gave me everything that I thought the first one was lacking. My video game reviews are always split into 3 categories. Story, Gameplay, Characters with story getting the most weightStory: 9/10The story was great. The story in FFXIII was great to but this one lived up to the first. Many grade this one down below the first but IMO it was just as good. The story follows Serah, the younger sister of Lightning, the hero from the first, as she travels through time with Noel, the last human born at the end of days, to find her sister. Their enemy is a mysterious man named Caius who's goal is to destroy the timeline and stop time and allow Chaos to sweep the world. Along the way they meet up with several of the characters from FFXIII and finally figure out what happened on that fateful day where cocoon fell and was held up by a crystal pillar.This story is really well developed. It is a bit confusing and if you don't stay with it, it can be rather maddening. But all in all this story is great. Very complex, which a lot of people take issue with, but overall it delivers.Gameplay: 10/10This is the real strength of this game. The battle system in the original was really good. In XIII-2 they took it and polished it up and made it better. Overall the battle system is the same but instead of 3 characters, you have two plus a monster. Now the each monster plays a different role (Commando, Ravager, Sentinal, etc) and you have a max of 3 different monsters at your disposal during a fight. To be able to use a specific monster, you must capture it (yes like Pokemon). To capture a monster, you must defeat that type until it gives you it's crystal. Once you have the monster crystal, you can then level up your monster with items, teach it new abilities, and use it in your party. This is a great addition to the gameplay and adds hours of questing and replaying to maximize the monsters you have.The biggest weakness for me in XIII was the lack of sidequests. Really all it had was all the different hunts. While those were fun, there weren't really any that had any depth. XIII-2 fixed that in a big way. TONS of sidequests. But don't think that it is quantity over quality. They range from simple \"go pick up this item and bring it to me\" to \"open up this new world and find out more about a specific character kupo\" to \"go defeat these monsters and get some kick but weapons\". Just a really really great set of sidequests.Characters: 8/10If there is a weakness to this game I suppose it would be the characters. There are two main characters. Serah, the younger sister of Lightning, and Noel, a guy who traveled back in time from the end of days to help Serah.  While both characters were good, they were not great. They were just kind of bland...kind of there. They had distinct personalities, they were developed and had an interesting back story. But, other than their back stories...they just weren't that interesting. However, XIII did do something great with them that a lot of times they do not do with FF's. They gave great back story to each character and developed them very well. The enemy, Caius, was in many ways, just like Noel and Serah. He had an interesting back story, he was developed well for an enemy, but overall, he was just a dark, evil presence that Serah and Noel were battling. Lightning was great but she wasn't in the story enough to be considered a character. Overall these characters were good. But they don't compare to some of FF's greater characters (IMO Auron, Vincent Valentine, Lightning, Cloud, Vivi, Zidane). I'm talking like the characters were a real weakness. They weren't really. They did a good job in the story. It's just a reflection of how great this game is. If I have to pick a weakness, here it is.Overall 9.25/10This game is great and absolutely should be played if you were at all a fan of FFXIII. Many of the complaints of FFXIII were that it was too linear and the sidequests weren't there. Also a lot complained there was a lack of towns and shops and such. Well all of these things were fixed and the good things in FFXIII were improved upon (except for maybe the quality of the characters). Overall, this game should not be skipped for fans of the FF series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

I wasn't sure if I was going to get this one until I saw it had Multiplayer.First of all the single player storyline is great!  Its like you are playing a movie and everything you do effects you in different ways later in the game.  The controls aren't perfect and some of the graphics aren't next gen per se, but they definatly do not take away any of the games' coolness that it adds from every other aspect that is thrown at you.I played Multiplayer for the first time last night, more to test it out for a few minutes than to sit down for 2 hours, but after getting into a game I got so engrosed in what was going on that when I looked up it had been 2 hours!!  The multiplayer alone is worth getting this game!!  The multiplayer is very dynamic in that you don't just hop on and start shooting people in deathmatch (although you can).  There are many other online options and games that allow you to customize how you want to play online, which is different from most games because their online mimics exactly the same game offline.My Scores:Gameplay - 5Audio  - 5Graphics - 4Controls - 3.5Multiplayer - 5!Replay  - 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

The network adapter works with just about any ISP service, including AOL, AT&T; WorldNet, EarthLink, Prodigy/SBC, and Sympatico.

Simply go through the ISP setup process located on the main menu of the startup disc. Your network configuration data will be saved onto your memory card.

Then put the adapter in the hole in the back of the Playstation 2.

If you can't afford that then just take your Cable modem's cable out, and run another Ethernet cable (from the Back of your cable modem) to your PS2's Network Adapter.I would definatley purchase SOCOM: US Navy SEALS, with this because that is, in my opinion, the best game to play online right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2002"}

I didn't feel bad since I still get to keep my Vita copy :) I love cross-buy.This game is made by a new studio.  You'd never guess though since it plays, looks and even feels exactly like the old games - for better and worse.  This team took no risks and followed the classic sly mold exactly.The gameplay is largly the same except every area is now a time period, and you have up to 5 people in your party at any 1 time (one cooper ancestor and one other primary character).  They fixed up a lot of mechanics that didn't always work well in the other games (like swinging on hooks) while adding a few new ones that feel natural and add a bit to each area.In general everyone has more abilities than ever before.  Bently and Murray (and the 5th character) have 5 kinds of darts/bombs/fists each.  Unfortunately you play as those two so little in the game you won't get a chance to really try half of that stuff.  I'd say 75-80% of the game revolves around Sly and his ancestors. Also the 'other character' has maybe.. 2 missions in the whole game that are her own? These characters are part of others missions, and vise versa, but usually if it's a Bently mission you're only Bently until you open a door for a Cooper to go in and do the actual mission.Sly has 5 costumes which are pretty cool, unfortunately only ... 1 of them provides a whole new play style (and it's the last one you acquire) while the other 4 are there entirely to solve puzzles. To the point that you'll tap the costume button, press the action button, and then switch right back to normal Sly.  It's a little disapointing since that was an opportunity to check out some new play styles. There is one boss fight that makes good use of a particular costume though - that was well done.That isn't so bad though since you have the Ancestors.  All of them are a lot of fun to play as, get plenty of missions, and are all very fun to get to know.  They're the highlight of the game for sure. More-so than the other thieves in Sly 3 I would argue.Collectables wise this games added quite a few, You have Cooper Masks now, treasures in every area that aren't just for money and bottles.  You also unlock arcade machines to play more of Bentley's hacking games (there are 3 types in this game) and there is a ping-pong mini game if you want to pass the time.The story is OK and some of the characters made me laugh.  Unfortunately I'd argue the game isn't as well written as previous Sly titles. They went for much more childish humor instead of trying to be witty.  It doens't hurt, but you won't laugh as much.  Some of the bosses personalities are great though and of course the cut-scenes do their best (and are well made as usual).The game took me about 15 hours to platinum? I utilized my PS Vita and a mode called AR Treasure Hunter (or something) to help me find collectables as I progressed.  It's a nice use of the Vita but it's not a game breaker without it... definitely speeds things up though if you don't care for using guides.I guess I took a star off because the game just wasn't as exciting? It was very to-the-books and didn't really surprise the player much. I feel sort of bad for doing it since there is honestly no flaws in how things should function, just the game wasn't built with as much ambition as the original titles feel like they may have been.The ending does open up to a sequel though that I will also pre-order and buy day-one.  It was good enough to get me excited for that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

The settings are beautiful, rich, vibrant, and full of DC lore come to life.  The transitions between fighting areas are over-the-top, inventive, and fun to watch.But that is my problem, I guess: this game is fun to watch.  Not as fun to play.Basically, this game is what Mortal Kombat vs. DC SHOULD have been.The gameplay is straight-up Mortal Kombat.  Nothing new.  Nothing innovative.  Same old MK combat feel with new animations for the DC characters.If you love MK and love DC, buy this game.  If you are looking for more than another MK title with all its familiar pacing and moves, then look elsewhere.  This game does little to progress the fighting genre.  There is nothing else to say then that this is simply another MK game with prettier presentation.Again, the game LOOKS incredible.  But it gets boring and old school pretty quickly.It is definitely NOT worth the price tag right now.  When it drops, I'd recommend you buy it if you have to.  Better yet, rent it.  Or download the limited demo version from XBOX Live, for example.  If you experience what I did, you'll have saved a load of cash.Too bad, really.

Still, it's good to go outside your usual tastes and try something new once in a while? Well, unfortunately, Watch Dogs just didn't do it for me. It was just too simplistic. I felt like all I did was press X when I wasn't dealing with god awful driving controls. I felt the plot was hackneyed and inspid. I didn't care about the characters at all. I just could not get into this thing. The game felt like it really needed to be tweaked considerably before release.Now that doesn't mean it's all bad. I mean, Watch Dogs is not normally the type of game I enjoy playing, so it could just be it was a bad game FOR ME, not you or whoever else reads this. I did really enjoy the graphics and soundtrack. I also felt the core concept of the game was a fantastic one but that the execution was not there. Maybe you'll get more out of this than I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Ryan Pritchard \"thor_oakenfelder\"","summary":"Not as great as I had been told.","reviewText":"Everyone kept telling me that this one was the best FF ever.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Merryjuice \"Bukkake Boy\"","summary":"Great Title, Needs Work on the Community","reviewText":"I love this game for the graphics, paper-thin story, and the goryness it brings to the shooter table.Offline mode has a pretty decent campaign to run through.  It is a bit short, but it becomes a ton of fun as you go deeper into the origin of the spawns, and how the main character ties in to the story overall.  The game leaves a lot of holes for a sequel.  I think it was done that way to focus more on the gameplay, which is incredible.The cover feature has been used in other shooter games, but it is used in great elaboration in this one.  You essentially use only one button for your cover, duck and jump moves, and is a bit awkward to use at first, but as you push through the campaigns, it becomes easier to learn and compete with.  The weapons are the typical FPS type, shotgun, pistol, sniper, grenade launcher, but the chainsaw machine gun will definately win people over in terms of gore factor and the absolute fun of using it on someone.Online is where I think this game lacks the most in consistency.  Playing the campaign online publicly gets you a second player to play cooperatively fast, but most tend to leave if they die repeatedly, forcing you to go back to the title screen rather than going on solo and picking another player up.  People leaving the game are the biggest frustration, and the average stranger never stays more than a few minutes.The versus mode was a big disappointment too.  It is all based on team play, which pits you 4v4.  Most people's games end up going team deathmatch.  Getting into a game is the worst, as you have to quickly join one or watch your slot get filled and have to do a lengthy refresh to find another game.  Other times you join a new game where you must wait for 5-10 even up to 20 minutes before you get enough people to start.  An auto-join queue like in Halo 2 would have been a big help for this game.When you actually do get to start a team deathmatch game, whatever side that is reguarly losing leaves the game.  Some games are \"best of 13\", and when a side is up 6 to 1, the side that only has 1 win leaves.  No one can join in their place, so it leave you sometimes in a 1 on 4 deficit.  It is next to impossible to get a kill in at this point, as all 4 players on the opposing side usually just stick together and zerg (rush) you.Lag was also a problem with this game, as most of the players online during daytime hours in the states are European.  Euro hosts create a significant lag time with the weapons if you're in the states, which gives them the advantage if they are on the opposing side.  I really wish there was an option of turning off overseas matches.  When playing at night I noticed I was significantly better against my opponents, especially those in around the dallas area.If you do have a good group to play with, the game becomes really fun.  I loved the campaign, the online play (when with friends or a good group), and the hopes for a sequel eventually.  I recommend this game to anyone with an xbox, and a little bit of patience for the sagging online community.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun, But Missing What We Expect From Final Fantasy","reviewText":"This game is fun, but it is certainly not a typical \"Final Fantasy\" game.  If that's what you want, do not buy it.  Because throughout much of this game, there isn't that much of a story and not very many interesting characters, either.  It is also pretty short for a \"Final Fantasy\" game (you can beat it in a couple weeks, as opposed to a few months).  But, like I said, it is fun, and it is different.In this game, the land is covered in a dangerous mist called miasma, and towns have crystals to protect them from it.  The crystals need myrrh to keep their power, so crystal caravans must go out and collect myrrh from special trees.  So you choose your characters, up to 8, and go on your way.  There are four races to choose from, male or female, and four variations of each, so there's a nice little selection of characters to choose from.  And the different races have their own strengths and weaknesses.  (I would suggest having only one character in single player, though.  If you use different characters, it takes longer to become strong enough for the final bosses.)So you go to different areas on this world map screen (you have a decent amount of flexibility where you can go), explore the place, fight enemies (the fighting is in real-time, not turn-based), and beat a boss somewhere to find the myrrh tree.  (Keep in mind that you must stay within the protective radius of the crystal chalice to keep from getting hurt by the miasma.  This can be a nuisance, but isn't too bad in single player, where a moogle carries it for you.  I imagine it could be a pain in multiplayer, though, when some unlucky person must carry it around.)Now while this game is fun, a lot of it can feel a bit pointless to me.  Collect myrrh in three locations, finish the year.  Collect myrrh in three locations again, finish the year.  But, several years into the game, bigger things do eventually happen.  You do eventually get to a location that is very important.  There is eventually a pretty decent little chunk of story, but this is all pretty much in the last hour of the game.  I was quite pleased that this game did end up having a satisfactory ending (since it seemed like nothing would ever happen ever), but I wish more happened throughout the game.I wanted to mention that this game has some great music.  And the graphics also look very nice, especially for the GameCube.So in short, this game is quite fun, with some aspects that make it different from other games.  But, you won't find the complicated story and characters like in other \"Final Fantasy\" games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ836","description":"","reviewerName":"Dan Leithauser","summary":"Biased love for Borderlands","reviewText":"Borderlands 2.There are games you play to win.  There are games you play to have fun.  The best games find a balance between what the player wants to do for maximum satisfaction.  Linear games, making you move from point to point without much \"open sandbox\" quality, are all about winning and having fun while on task. Games like the Fallout and Oblivion series are huge sandboxes, letting you do pretty much whatever you want as you accumulate experiences, skills, weapons, shields, etc and moving forward (or not) in some central storyline.  Borderlands and the sequel Borderlands 2 provide a fun experience playing the way you want to play--all while having a rip roaring time. This review is based only on experience with the solo player option as a siren.The original Borderlands presented a world where there was definitely a story line, but that line almost seemed less important than the joys of looting and accumulating weapons, shields, and character driven skill sets.  Borderlands 2 is no different.  Bazillions is a good description of the sheer number of variations of weapons and shields that you can accumulate.  You will find yourself with preferences for certain weapons, whether it be the type of weapon, the \"manufacturer\", the \"effect\", accuracy, the list goes on... in short-- what kind of boom do you want to make?  Part of the fun of Borderlands is finding something you either loot, buy, or stumble upon and finding it to be something you want to keep.  Fascinating to this reviewer is one early and low level weapon that has stuck and is used often up to the current level 17 that chops right through just about everything. (A Torque explosive ammo assault rifle)The story line is about the same as Borderlands. A central threat that involves someone getting to the big loot before you.  Lots of side stories and missions.  The side stories and missions are the ones you should go on at every opportunity.  Those missions help you gain experience and often provide very satisfying toys.  Leveling up as a tank, commando, assassin, or \"siren\" are well balanced affairs coming at the right times, and in the same way as the original Borderlands--resettable so you can try something new.Trying things out, whether it be new weapons, shields, or skills is the name of the game for fun in Borderlands and Borderlands 2.  For this reviewer, \"winning\" is a secondary objective, having all sorts of fun getting there is the primary plan.  The journey is always more rewarding than the conclusion?  Of course, as anyone who played Borderlands that question and the end game \"vault\" will come up.  It was a let down if you think that the end should be the most satisfying part of the game, instead of just part of the game as a whole. The folks at Gearbox got that message and made multiple endings more rewarding.As for overall satisfaction, those familiar and those who loved Borderlands are sure to love Borderlands 2. The story arc is still in place, and you get to meet old friends. It seems that the looting is slightly less rewarding up to about level 14, with fewer rare drops (even with the pre-release \"rare drop\" chance increase relic active). Yes, white, green, and blue are prevalent, but purple and above less so. Overall, value is another indicator of how rare something might be, but not always.  (RE: the Torque assault rifle mentioned earlier). After Level 14, more purple and \"rare\" items started to surface.  As for playing, again, if you played Borderlands you know the drill.  Loot and look everywhere and collect as much as you can trading off as often as you can. Under the right playing conditions you usually never want for cash, but you may want to find that rare iridium and frequent a couple of richer areas to increase your backpack size pretty quickly. It is also possible and fun to make the NPC's fight each other--which you will discover on your own.Maya the Siren may seem under powered at first, but with the first mod of being able to paralyze an enemy and just shoot at them without resistance, this quickly evens the playing field.  Subsequent and judicious skill additions make play balanced and learning while dying a fun -not frustrating- experience.Criticism of game play would include what appears to be an absolute cap on back pack size limiting the collection of more and more things--which is one of the main points of the game.  Another criticism, which was not noticed during Borderlands (1) is the music during certain sequences, particularly during walk throughs or battles in more mechanized areas is distinctly Mass Effect and less original than expected from Borderlands. Additionally, some may be annoyed by some of the available exploits available in killing bosses (notably things do not always chase you, the NPC's, while somewhat more mobile, are still a bit dumb, and finding a defensive position is usually easy if you play that way)-- during single player these things can help move the game forward.The graphics are clean and comic book like--allowing even lower end systems to display detail.  The game runs great and looked good (even at reduced settings) on an ATI Radeon HD4850 (three years old), an Alienware M11X R3 with an Nvidia GT-540M, and the card that just replaced this player's HD4850, the new Nvidia GT-660Ti (at the highest settings)--all on a 23\" screen running at 1920x1080.There are plenty of reviews that go into detail about Borderlands 2.  All that needs to be said is that if you like first person shooters, and even more, FPS with open sand box characteristics, you will love Borderlands.  What are you waiting for?  Start killing, looting, and dealing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2012"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Bond is back, for better or worse","reviewText":"It's been a while since we had a James Bond game (and a good one at that), and Quantum of Solace seems promising enough.  I mean hey, when you're using the Call of Duty 4 engine in a game starring the legendary secret agent, the bar gets set pretty high, and thankfully, Quantum of Solace manages to mostly deliver the goods.  Mostly.  Playing as Bond, the game's story puts together story elements of Casino Royale and the new film, as you take the baddies in this slick looking FPS.  And considering that the game is running on the aforementioned Call of Duty 4 engine, the game looks as slick as you'd expect.  Characters and environments are wonderfully rendered, but underneath all the gloss, there isn't really too much to admire here.  Gunplay is decent at best, while the action itself is nicely stylized, except for some cartoony looking explosions.  However, it isn't long before you see what all the game has to offer, and it isn't long before things start to get repetitive either.  Whether it's missions, to the generic villain looks and animations, the game just doesn't offer much variety.  Also, Quantum of Solace's single-player mode is pretty short; you could finish it in a day.  However, the game does offer some solid multiplayer action that will hold your interest, at least for a while.  Bond star Daniel Craig also provides his voice, and does great work.  All in all, Quantum of Solace is entertaining for a while, and a worthwhile trip for Bond fans, but if you're just looking for a worthwhile FPS, Quantum of Solace won't quite quench your thirst.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

One thing I like, as a parent, is online I can  choose to turn off quizzes that have been rated Mature.  This allows me some control over what my younger boys see, but still allows them the chance to play online.It would be nice if the controllers came with rechargeable batteries and relied on bluetooth technology, but those issues aren't big enough for us to put this game back on our shelf.

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"Noname","summary":"Parents, this review is for you!","reviewText":"Unlike so many electronic devices nowadays, this 3DS comes with a printed manual (thank you, Nintendo!). My child may know how to use this thing, but I want to know what it's capable of (i.e., what I need to be concerned about him accessing) without mucking around.PARENTAL CONTROLSMy primary concern was the recent warning about use of the 3DS on the eyes -- it's not recommended for under age 7 and for not for a prolonged period of time. I wanted to limit my son's use of the 3D element.Nintendo did take that concern into account. It not only allows parents to lock their kids out of the 3D component, they can also control their children's access to the following:- software rating- internet browser- shopping service- sharing images, audio, videos- online interaction- StreetPass- friend registration- DS download playParents control the content with a PIN. If we lose that PIN, we can unlock it using the secret question. If we forget the answer to that question, then we need a master key, which we obtain by calling Nintendo. How easy it is to do that, I don't know. It could be a loophole savvy kids use to work around the controls.FUN EVEN WITHOUT NEW GAMESMy second concern was we weren't buying new games, at least not for awhile. Would this 3DS be any fun without new games?My son says yes. He can play his old Nintendo Lite games on the system, but he hasn't done that yet. He's too busy exploring all the other features:- 3DS Camera: take 3D photos- 3DS Sound: listen to music or record sounds- Mii Maker: create Mii characters from scratch or from photos- AR Games: aim the 3DS camera at the mystery cards and characters pop out. My son aimed his 3DS at one of his cards and played a fishing game, pulling up on his 3DS like a fishing pole. The 3DS is motion sensitive, like holding a Wiimote. Pretty cool.- Face Raiders: place photos of your faces into the characters and play a shooting game.- Activity Log: check play times and use the 3DS as a pedometer.- eShop: we aren't going to use this, but we can download games into the 3DS.FINAL THOUGHTSI don't know about anyone else, but the 3D effect gives me a serious headache. All I see is double, and I tried moving the screen and adjusting the effect. The only time it looks right is when I've got the slider all the way down, meaning the 3D is turned off. I've placed limits on my son's 3D usage, but that hasn't been a problem for him. He has been having a blast with this new toy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

I hope this series goes as far as the Mario series.  The characters are memorable, the gameplay is zany and action packed, and there is always an explosion of colors, rewards, and great sounds going off at all times.  Never boring. The story in this game stands alone in the series, but rewards fans of the past games with many character references.  The game starts with a cutscene of Captain Qwark calling you for help.  After that, the opening level is mind-blowing is so many ways.  Aliens are blowing up buildings while you escape on grind rails, the city is crawling with deathbots piloted  by squishy little aliens out to get you, and you are blasting or smashing everything in sight. The first level is easily playable over and over again and in fact is how I became a fan of ht series in the first place. After playing this first level that is included in the demo for Tools of Destruction on the PSN, I went out to purchase the first game for the PS2 and have been a fan ever since.The game continues with superb level design throughout the game.  There is plenty of variety and nothing ever gets boring. You lay waste to hoards of different enemies ranging from Amoeboid-like fish guys driving war machines, space pirates, and insect-like cragmites to a host of other things that want to tear you up (or blow up and give you bolts). There is a crazy assortment of unique weapons and devices that you obtain throughout the game like in other Ratchet and Clank games, but the standout item is the Groovitron, a discoball that forces anything on the screen to stop in it's tracks and dance dance dance.There has always been a perfect mix of platforming and jumping mixed with LOTS of shooting and blowing things up with a few puzzles to make things interesting.  Now that Ratchet and Clank has moved to the PS3, however, things look amazing.  This entry into the series takes almost everything from the previous games and perfected it.There are a few things that could have been better.  The space battle sequences take you on a linear path rather than allow you to fly around like you could in a couple of the previous installments.  What they have instead is an on-rails shooter in which you can dodge around on screen, but the presentation here is very nice.  They show you a lot of cool environments as you fly around blowing up space pirates and dodging asteroid fields and arcs of flame from a lava planet.I was always a fan of the racing in the first two games and they still did not bring that back after Going Commando.  Up Your Arsenal didn't have any races either, but they game you multiplayer and the vehicles instead, which were good. I also would have liked trophies to be in this game, but the next game in the series includes them.All in all, I recommend this game to everyone.  The cartoon silliness might put off some at first but the mayhem, strange assortment of clever weapons, and constant rewards and fun will seal the deal for almost anyone who gives these games a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2010"}

Plus there really wasn't a whole lot to do in it. But it did look lovely for the time though.Now let's jump to FC3 - and wow! Remove all the previous complaints. There's no incurable disease to annoy you and now there's so much more to do it's incredible. Plus checkpoints can now be taken over and then they become a fast travel point crammed with ammo, guns, side missions and vehicles. It's a great way to get you as a player to explore the map knowing you can jump back to that area at any time once you've offed all the bad guys in the camp.There's a distinct similarity to Assassin's Creed 3 here too (both are Ubisoft titles), with eagle viewpoints in the shape of cunningly designed antenna towers, hunting and crafting, collection items such as plants and chests (thousands and thousands of them) and varied weaponry and map upgrading abilities. The map even shows where certain animals can be found. The leveling structure is also worth a mention as you can enhance your character with helpful skills such as extra health, reload when running, better sneak attacks etc. However the game only lets you upgrade so many before it urges you to complete more main missions first. So no more 'I'm going to do everything possibly before I even tackle the main storyline' issues. Unlike AC3 there's a very short tutorial then you're immediately thrown into free roam so no ridiculous five hour lessons in trapping rabbits here either.Graphically it's lush of course. With weather and night cycles aiding the atmosphere immensely; the first time I was randomly attacked by a crocodile while swimming across a river at night in the rain I nearly shrieked out loud, and given that's it's in first person you really feel connected to the tense on-screen action.It's worth mentioning that since this is a truly free and open game, what you put in and how you play will affect your enjoyment of the game. Myself, I prefer to stealth my way through, sniping people out from a distance. So with that in mind a good rifle with extended scope and silencer is a must. You on the other hand may prefer to simply grenade and LMG your way. The game let's you do both with impunity and it's so ruddy good. Setting fire to a camp and watching the rats come out only to be greeted by trip mines and brass is every bit as satisfying as popping someone's cap off at five hundred yards.So, if you enjoy great free roam open world first person shooters, have lots of time to invest and would rather take things at your own pace than be barked direction orders at (think linear games like COD) then this is the game for you.I can't think of a better way to spend a few hours this holiday season than roaming around the amazing world of Far Cry 3 and would recommend you join me!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"James L.

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Nice improvement, still some of the same cons though.","reviewText":"I decided to go with the new PS3 slim and didnt even realize it was out yet, it really did creep in under the radar and i thought it was just a rumor, including the 299 dollar price tag. Well i decided heck why not, got my 80 gig big ole finger print scratch ridden version and took it to gamestop where i got 150 bucks towards this one. Sweet. One of the major reasons i like this version so well is that when someone said, hey bring over your PS3 i no longer have to cringe and worry about it getting smudged and scratched to death. Also it weighs about the same but has a cheaper plastic feel, is that bad? No not really but here are the pros and cons, pretty much same as the old version.^ProsNice new, plastic, graphite type texture.Doesnt show finger prints, or scratches nearly as bad, although the sides and disc tray area are still shiney.The new power buttons are cool, not touch sensitive anymore.Better 1.3 HDMI output, colors arent as dull on some games now.More power efficient. U can actually use your PS2 slim plug if u lose yours.120gb, with the new 299$ price tag. Will it improve sales, mmm doubtful, still lots of PS3 haters out there.Same great blu-ray player-best on the market.Has a new music intro when you start up the system, (nothing major though).ConsSTILL no backwards compatibility.(Just PS1 games)No stand yet for it to be put upright, but really i like it better setting down.Does run very very hot compared to the bigger models, time will tell if it becomes an issue.Even though the new casing is nice it does feel cheap(er), great power on eject buttons feel the same.Actually thats about it, still the same system all PS3 owners know and love just smaller, a lower price, bigger drive, better HDMI output, and takes less power to run. So if you want one get it, but be fast from what i've heard these versions are to see how well it sells, but dont quote me on that, supposedly if they dont sell well, the regular 80 gig will remain, and the 160gb will stay at 399. Thats the rumor. So if your tired of lugging around the big ole boy to your friends house, get this one, its not really a lot lighter but it is thinner and less bulky. Also as i said no prints and scratches to worry about. I just wouldnt be setting anything on it, or letting it get stepped on or hit by your kids. So is the PS3 slim worth it, yep sure is, same great play, less filling.PS-The smaller the system the harder it is to cool, especially a system with 7 cell processing engines. So hopefully whatever is inside will do the trick, and i trust in sony way more than XBOX. See ya.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2009"}

The graphics may appear to be cartoony but they don't seem like it.  They do a good job at teaching you how to control Knack when you start off.My only complaint so far is that the controls are really basic.  For the most part X and square are all you need to hit.  I know you can gather crystals and use your powers but it still mostly comes down to the two buttons.  It is kind of easy to die on Normal difficulty.  When you die it brings you back to the last checkpoint, so I find myself repeating often.  It makes the game more challenging but it will get frustrating for someone who just wants to lightly play through the game.So my roommate played with me last night, you just hit a button and spawn a silver metal looking copy of player 1.  Player 2 is not shown in any cut scenes, does not collect trophies and has infinite respawns.  The camera stays focused on player 1 regardless of where player 2 is.  This has led to a lot of times player 2 getting lost off the screen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

The graphics, however, are convuluted. Yes, the cel-shading aspect has its' merit. But, it really adds very little to the game. You tend to 'look-around' the cartoon graphics after the first 5 or 6 levels. The, it just feels like every other FPS with a shiny new wrapper. Not that that's all bad, though. After the openning sequence you begin to realize that, not only does David Duchovney star in this game, so does ADAM WEST (you know,the original BATMAN!). There are even more surprises that i think a gamer would rather discover on his/her own. Now, back to the graphics. This program runs on the UNREAL engine. That gives it framerate goodness. But, due to the new approach i guess, this is a CPU HOG! Never mind the minimum requirements on the box, you really do need the recommended specs here. The sounds are from fair to very good. Musically this is very nice. But, the sound effect overlays sound like they were done in a tin can. But, be warned, if you have a small child (like myself) you are not allowed ( as the law says you ARE ) to make even one working backup of this game. Ubisoft seems to think that noone has the right to do this. EVERYONE has the LEGAL right to do this. They spend 10s' of thousands of dollars creating a 'special' copy protection that disallows anyone a working backup. Unreasonable. Other than having to keep my discs on top of the refrigerator, this game is good fun, with a nice dash of hollywood. As the ending seems to tell us, there will be a sequel. One word of advice, UBISOFT, cut out the incredible overflow of BLURRY sequences. In cel-shading those sequences become headache inducing after a short while. And, there are occasions where this concept is way overdone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2003"}

This is the ultimate episode where Anakin finally turns to the dark side and embraces his new personae as Darth Vader.The translation into a game was done with the full cooperation of the Star Wars people, and there are many integrations of video clips into the storyline. I've seen this done VERY well with other games, so that you feel you're an integral part of the storyline. Unfortunately, with the XBox engine, this just doesn't work as well in this game. When you switch from the movie back into gameplay, the characters suddenly look very wooden and blocky. I don't think you'd have that reaction at all if 1) they didn't try to make it a seamless situation or 2) they'd done a better job with in game graphics.The movement of the characters during fighting is relatively smooth, with the saber attacks, spins, jumps and so on. The problem here is that much of what you're doing is repetitive. Oh look, another wave of droids to slaughter. It often comes down to button mashing, which is a shame because in an RPG like manner you get to build up your character's strengths to customize him.I also have to comment that the dialogue gets very inane, very quickly. I realize they can't \"fix\" Anakin to make him more pleasant - but it's like water torture to hear his snotty voice snapping back at Kenobi constantly.It was very nice of them to have two player gameplay, something which is missing from a lot of games. But on the other hand, why don't they have an XBox Live component? With so many people who play on Live - but don't have nearby friends to play in the house - it's a real shame. I know many people who are home taking care of kids or for other reasons can't have someone else \"in\" their house, and Live is an important aspect of their free time fun.Finally, there were situations in the game where you hit a \"puzzle to be solved\" and you were given quick instructions about what button to press - but if you missed those for some reason, you were doomed to death so that you could go back and replay up to that area and hear the instructions again. That just makes no sense in a modern game.Great potential here - but numerous flaws that really should have been spotted easily during beta testing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2007"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Bearcat","summary":"Excellent Game...one of the best for the PS3.","reviewText":"This will probably end up being the best shooter on the PS3 this year.  The game runs smooth as butter with great graphics.  The single player part of the game is very good with a great story.  You should try to pick up the first Resistance game if you can as it's a good lead in.  The story draws you in and is very gripping.  Even if you don't like online multiplayer I recommend this title for the great single player.Now onto the online multiplayer.  This game is rock solid online.  You have both co-op and versus options.  You can have up to 60 players online at one time broken down in squads of 8 players.  Amazing.  This runs with no lag.  It is not just a free for all either as your squad can get specific objectives, etc.  The versus is the typical high quality play that I experienced with the first Resistance game.  One thing that may interest others. I found the multiplayer was not the super-fast twitch shooting type, ala COD4 and other \"run and gun\" games.  It's rare that you will spawn and just get cut down in a few seconds.  I think this is due to intelligent spawn points that can vary.  The classes you can play add a great amount of strategy to the game.  The medic is especially useful.The co-op game is truly co-op meaning that if you just try to run ahead and gun down everything in your path you aren't going to last long.  You truly have to work as a team in order to get through the co-op which is refreshing.Overall I highly recommend this game if you are into FPS shooters.  This is a high quality game that has superior single player and online components.  If you like shooters you really should pick up this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001CLYL1K","reviewerName":"Hamster Army","summary":"Excellent Little Game From the Masters of FPS Action","reviewText":"I have become such a big fan of Raven Software over the years, that I trust anything they put out, and that started with the original Soldier Of Fortune in 2000 and soon after, the classic Jedi Outcast game that to this day is one of the best FPS action games ever made, for any platform. And I'm now re-discovering some of their more recent games over the last 5 years and enjoying Wolfenstein, The Wolverine, and soon Singularity-Reloaded.Wolfenstein falls in-line with Raven's previous quality and ability to combine everything that makes a fun, involving, accessible game so good by faithfully recreating the dark WWII alternate universe of sorts that has Nazi's toying with ancient mystical powers and creating virtual super soldiers and weapons.  But of course you've got BJ Blaskowitz, who stops them before they go too far, and keeps their evil plots and devices in hidden fortresses and the black market street hoods of Germany, before they're able to be used on Allied troops.While the story and characters can get a little muddy at times, the premise is quite clear, but the game moves along quickly as you are able to visit black market upgrade shops and if you want, complete missions in the order you choose, but the game still maintains a sort of linear action sequence regardless, so that you don't get lost or confused.The best part of the game is the action it involves; plenty of explosions, great WWII guns, upgrades, fairly intelligent enemies, intense combat, decent graphics, good lighting, and the game adds a dimension via the ability to go into a special mode that allows you to operate in a different dimension and allows you to slow down time, walk through certain walls, increase your damage and shield yourself, depending on the circumstances you are facing.  Tight alley ways to larger environments, both indoor and outside, give you some variety and tactical situations that keep the game fun and interesting as well.This is another under-appreciated gem of a game from Raven, and if you are a fan of action FPS games, especially those from the earlier part of the decade, Wolfenstein satisfies.  For $12 now, you can't go wrong.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

Guberlal","summary":"Let it Reign","reviewText":"I have been eagerly anticipating this game amongst the slew of vampire games that have fallen short. BloodRayne takes on a &quot;The Matrix&quot; feel in combat with a full range of controls and perspectives. It's not an all-original concept, but it exceeds the current line-up well.Controls:Surprisingly smooth and easy to master attacks. The feeding element is one of the best eye-candy visuals as well as a necessity. The game takes a limited use of the XBOX's controller or full use, whichever you prefer to set it to in the options menu.Gameplay:An exhilerating rush from the very beginning, whether you start in training or dive right into the game. This isn't the typical &quot;this is the right way, that is not&quot; world as you'll find many places to explore, feed, and test those quick reflexes of yours. It's creepy, gothic, and intense. I remember being 45 minutes into the game and still at the beginning. It's a long game and rightfully so. The story can be found on the product description, so I don't feel the need to relay it again.Visual:Let's be honest. I love my XBOX, PS2, and when I had the GameCube, I loved that too (if only for 2 games.) No matter what the reviews state, the graphics are basically the same on all the systems it's designed for. Unless you have &quot;Only on XBOX&quot; and so forth, these were designed for multiple platforms and the only &quot;tweaks&quot; were its ports. That's a sad thing because it doesn't use the full harness of the XBOX's power. Many of you will disagree, but if you have multiple systems, rent them at your local video store and find out. I haven't found much difference in any multi-platform designed game so far.Visuals II:With that out of the way, it is visually stunning. BloodRayne is gorgeous and her movements, cutscenes, and animation are enough to distract you from the task at hand. The opening intro scene is confusing on purpose, however, it propells the story about to unfold. That said, the intro draws you into the game and glued to your seat for the hours of gameplay ahead. The backgrounds are a pre-rendered sort in some areas and the water you encounter isn't impressive (multi-platform game.) There are a lot of stunning other eye-poppers like breaking through walls, busting up chairs and tables, or shredding bedsheets and pillows (yes, you can do all that.) Blood Rage and the slo-motion battles are an interesting visual twist sure to delight the legion of vampire game fans.Sound:Here is where the XBOX struts its superiority. Not because of the game, but the hardware.Pros:Because of the XBOX's hardware and massive hard drive, loading times, frame rates, sound, and saving is easier. To reiterarte, the graphics aren't any better than the other platforms, but who cares, right?BloodRayne's voice-over's are more convincing than most games have been to recent date. As for the character herself, there aren't too many words to describe her when you're left speechless.Interesting storyline, control, and gameplay.Cons:A ported, multi-platform game lacking the advantage of using the full power of the XBOX. Examples: &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; for PS2 pushed the limits of the machine, as did &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.&quot; Another example: &quot;Halo,&quot; which used the full strength of the XBOX and &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot; (One of the most visually and all-around impressive titles I have ever seen on a console.)All in all...this is a hot title which may remind some, because of the Louisiana part, of Shadow Man: Second Coming. Albeit, a better game through and through.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2002"}

While Skyrim and Fallout developers are aiming high and trying to create a great huge open world, their games (especially Skyrim) are failing at some very basic levels.*******************************PROS**********************************************************Huge Open World: Bravo to developers on this. Truly remarkable. Can go where ever you want and start any quest (main or side) you want.Decent graphics: Not much to say here. The game and environments look great.Powers, Shouts and Weapons: Had fun using them. Finding them through various quests was nice.Enemies: For a huge game there is decent variety of enemies if you consider, dragons, humans, deads and animals.*******************************CONS**********************************************************Game Ending Glitches: This is the reason I took two stars off and wanted to take off more. I read so many wiki details to go around a game ending glitch. It practically took me 5-7 hours to go around the glitch and ended up losing a lot of progress. You cannot have glitch in the main quest. Just cannot.Side quest glitches: Hated them. Small items I don't mind giving up. But due to a glitch I had to give up two huge side quests. Horrible just horrible.Other glitches: Some important NPCs randomly dying (I would go back to the save point when they are alive, play it 100 different ways, and they still die by slipping into the ground. WTH??)Redundancy: I know the game can last over 100 hrs, but do yourself a favor and don't spend 100hrs on it. You can get much better experience playing something else instead.Similar looking dragons: The dragons have small variety but I think they could have done much better job with them.Redundancy: The game can get really redundant. I know it is over 100hrs (or can be), but I personally felt bored after a while.*******************************VERDICT**********************************************************I played skyrim a lot (40-50hr), I only enjoyed may be middle 10 hours and my biggest regret was not being able to finish the story properly and be able to access some quests even though I bought the 360 version.

Wind","summary":"It's not GTA in the old west..!","reviewText":"Red Dead Redemption is not \"GTA in the old west.\" Actually, it's a lot more like Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, set in the fictional old west of spaghetti westerns.What strikes you at first is the scope of the game. There's so much space, and so many things to do! Seriously, you could skip the single player and just hang around in the game world, and you'd have enough to keep you busy for a very long time.The animation is fluid and beautiful. The characters are well acted by their voice actors, and well illustrated by the game designers. It's simply remarkable how beautiful the world looks. Sunsets are stunning. Starry nights are gorgeous. Playing this game is like taking a vacation to the frontier.If you rush through the single player game, you won't appreciate all the game has to offer, but you'll still be heartily satisfied by what's included. If you stray from the single player path, or jump into the free-roaming multiplayer game, you'll find it's hard to get bored. Hours melt away when you're playing RDR, and that's the best compliment I can give a game.You are absolutely missing out if you don't have online access though. From new missions and DLC to the rich multiplayer modes, this game is made better with an Internet connection.If anything really stands out in this game, it's how alive the world is. There are all manner of animals running around and flying through the skies, and you can interact with all of them. The birds are really there, and you can shoot them, pluck their feathers, and sell them. From snakes and rabbits, to wolves and cougars, to hawks, owls, and crows... The world is full of creatures.My only complaint about the game is that it's easy to offend NPCs and end up on the WANTED list, with a bounty on your head. Just yesterday I ended up wanted because my horse was slow to stop and ran into a lawman, who took that as \"assaulting a lawman\" and opened fire on me. Why didn't the fool just get out of the way? It wasn't my fault! It was my horse!That aside, this game is one of the games I'd say is worth your $60 to buy as a new release. There's no doubt you'll be able to grab this in a year or two for $29 in the Platinum Hits collection, but you're doing yourself a disservice if you hold off playing this that long.The old west genre has been suitably represented here, finally. Earlier games like GUN, Red Dead Revolver, and Call of Juarez were OK, but failed to really provide an immersive or aesthetically-pleasing experience. Red Dead Redemption belongs in the same category as movies like \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" as MUST-OWN western media.The soundtrack is good, but does get repetitive. I almost wish they'd gotten Clint Bajakian, who scored LucasArts' \"Outlaws\", to contribute some music. As it is, after a while I turned down the music because I just thought the game \"felt\" better without a constant score.Bottom Line: If you ever enjoyed Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and are a fan of the movie westerns, then you owe it to yourself to grab Red Dead Redemption. It's one of the best sandbox games ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

So, with reading a shockingly minimal amount of the hype surrounding this game, I pre-ordered and purchased it.  I brought it home, and after a brief system update, I was utterly blown away by this incredible creation Nintendo made.Super Mario Galaxy is, without a doubt, the greatest game on the Wii, the greatest in the Mario series, and quite possibly the best action platformer ever made.  Everything from the graphics to the mostly orchestrated music to the actual gameplay itself is virtually perfect.The 3D Mario games began with Super Mario 64 and continued with Super Mario Sunshine.  However, those two games featured busy levels with several missions each...all within the same area (finding stars to move on to new worlds).  While that provided incentive to keep playing each level over and over again, it got redundant because nothing was different.  It was more like playing an RPG sometimes.  What I love about Galaxy is that each level (or galaxy) has three separate and distinct levels, so you're not doing the same thing again and again.  Because of this, the game doesn't drag or get tedious...it just keeps getting better.  And with 40 vastly different galaxies and a possibility of finding 120 stars, this is more like a 3D Super Mario World, complete with new power-ups and suits for Mario to use.The graphics...oh my goodness the graphics!  I had already succumbed to the thought that the Wii will never measure up graphically with the other next-gen systems.  But with Metroid Prime 3, and now this game, it's clear that we're starting to see what this console is capable of!  The textures are flawless, the water effects are incredible, and there is no slowdown, flicker or drag at all.  Moreover, the galaxies are detailed and colorful, making this the prettiest game you'll ever see!  The music is the best of the series.  Most of it is fully orchestrated, and it's nice to hear familiar tunes sound so much bigger and expansive.  The controls are fun, though not as focused on motion sensing as other games.  However, this is not needed in this game, and I'm glad that eloquent control schemes aren't forced on us simply for the sake of showing off (see Lair for PS3!).  But the parts that do take advantage of the Wii remote are fun, quirky and extremely enjoyable!Simply put, this is a must-own title.  I simply can't remember the last time I was addicted to a game like I am now.  I played for hours on the first sitting and had to rip myself away from it to get some sleep!  If you have a Wii, you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you pass this one up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2007"}

Exploring the depths of space, Super Mario Galaxy braves a new frontier and also returns to many familiar settings.As per usual, the game centers around rescuing Princess Peach from the grip of Bowser, who uses a spaceship to steal Peach's entire castle. Mario, attempting to defend her, is flung into space, where he encounters the Luma, friendly star-shaped creatures. The Luma take him to their \"mama\", Rosalina, who operates a space station / observatory. Bowser has stolen the Grand Stars that power the station, and they must be retrieved to chase after him.The space station is the central hub of the game. The player arrives after receiving a Grand Star, which is used to power the first doorway. This doorway leads to several different \"galaxies\" - collections of floating planetoids - with more being accessible the more stars are collected. Each collection of galaxies ends in one of Bowser's bases, where a full-strength Grand Star is hidden. Much like Mario 64 and Sunshine, each galaxy represents a stage, and there are different objectives to go after (with a selection screen to determine which one you want to go after). The galaxies themselves consist of small planetoids with their own gravity; this can be disorienting at first, as you are essentially running across a sphere that is holding you down, instead of across a flat plain. You can jump up and you'll just fall back inwards to the planet, though the camera is usually above the planetoid and not right behind you (which is also a bit confusing). You must jump from planet to planet using the Luma's star launchers, which are usually unlocked through some deed on the various planetoids. There are a wide variety of galaxies, ranging from the \"main\" galaxies - with story events and multiple stars - to the \"bonus\" galaxies that tend to only have one star but are given in a minigame or similar test (for example, the Manta Ray surfing games that use the Wii remote to steer and boost).The gameplay itself, apart from the planetoids, is similar to earlier 3d Mario games. Mario jumps and hops the same as other games, though his melee attacks are replaced by a spinning attack. Mario can still fall into \"pits\", though due to the gravity this usually means the planetoid's exposed core or a black hole. Another big difference is that the player also uses the Wii remote's cursor to collect Star Bits - little colored pieces of stars that can be used to shoot enemies or feed the Lumas. Many parts require a certain amount of star bits to feed a hungry Luma so that he transforms into a new planetoid or even a galaxy. Furthermore, collecting 50 star bits gets you a level up (this is also true for coins, which normally restore health). Mario has some new powerups, too; in addition to old standards like fireballs and flight, Mario now also has a Bee Mushroom (which allows him to fly and climb on certain walls), a Spring Mushroom (which gives him more jumping power in exchange for some reductions to other abilities), and a Boo Mushroom (which turns him into a Boo, the series' famous ghosts, and pass through walls). Finally, a co-op mode is available where one player takes the role of the cursor, collecting star bits and shooting them at enemies, as well as several other boosts that can be given to the first player that make the game easier (for example, stunning enemies and giving Mario a jump boost).The graphics are the bright, colorful, rounded graphics familiar to Mario fans, though they are smoother and brighter with the Wii's technology. The levels are varied, but tend to be fairly bright and cheery. The music is similarly cheerful, with a HUGE amount of callbacks to old games, with recognizable songs from the original Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 3, and Super Mario World. Sound effects are often of a musical nature, providing a sort of active symphony as you fight bosses or enemies.As a whole, this game seems much more like a return to the classic days of Mario gaming. With an abundance of references to old games and a lot of new elements as well, Super Mario Galaxy is well suited to continuing the tradition that the Mario games have upheld.10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

Not only are the graphics better than anything possible in 1982, but our contemporary acceptability of violence and nudity in video games, keeps this game true to the style and flavor of the Conan series.The graphics aren't incredible for a next gen system, but the game play makes up for it. THQ did there best to make Conan look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, without getting in trouble for stealing his likeness. The voice is very different from Arnold's voice, but at least it kind of looks like him in the game (which is a big deal to me).Like god of war, you hack and slash your way through weak enemies, solve puzzles and fight giant boss characters. The violence is allot of fun. You can cut off limbs, throw people through spikes, and set villages and people on fire. There is allot of weapons to choose from and different fighting styles depending on what weapon/weapons you have; you can also unlock more moves with gained experience points.I would say this game is a buy. The graphics are not as impressive as other similar PS3 titles, like Dante's Inferno. However, I grew up playing 8 bit Nintendo in the 80's, so they are good enough for me.

Fun to use.","reviewText":"I've had the Sharp Shooter for a while now but never took the time to calibrate it and learn how to use it properly. I finally decided to play Kill Zone 3 which is compatible with it. Wow I've been missing out. KZ3 is an awesome game so far and the Sharp Shooter takes it to another level.For $20 it's a steal. The Sharp Shooter is well made and not cheap. It is plastic but has a nice solid feel to it. The button layout is well thought out and not difficult to get used to. You can tell they experimented until they got it right. The Motion and Nav controllers fit really well and snap right in. The adjustable stock is nice. It also has pump action integrated into the front handle.Calibration of the Move controller takes a little time to get to your sweet spot but this doesn't have much to do with the Sharp Shooter itself. Mainly you're trying to get the targeting reticule to line up with the sights. There are plenty of resources online to help you get it right.Now on to the fun! As I said the gameplay is taken to another level with the Sharp Shooter. Pulling the trigger feels much more natural than pushing a button on the Dualshock. To melee attack you thrust the Sharp Shooter forward. Everything is pretty much within reach of your fingertips. It can get tiring holding the thing up for a while but that just adds to the realism. I'm sure in actual combat an assault rifle can get heavy real fast. In a FPS this is as close as you can get to that experience I suppose. You can't sit while playing and get the same feel. If you are going to sit you might as well use the Dualshock. I actually used a 2x2 mat for the one knee shooting position which worked well and felt natural. A good alternative to standing the whole time if you get tired.The only gripe I have is you can get disoriented at times when using this peripheral because wherever you turn the barrel is where you will look or turn. If you point it at the ground you will see the ground. It would have been nice if they added some type of sighting cancellation where you can look around normally with the Nav controller instead of the weapon.I based this on my experience with KZ3 but there are a number of games that can be used with the Sharp Shooter including Resistance 3, Socom 4, Dead Space Extraction and Resident Evil 5 among others.Bottom line:If you want a fun experience that adds a sense of realism and want to get the most out of your Move system buy this. At $20 you can't go wrong. I paid $32 on sale about six months ago and feel it was worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2012"}

What happened? Something got cut and ended up on the cutting room floor. what...to sell to us as DLC or something? Lame.Otherwise this is the same ole same ole.

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"Finally, the next generation of games!","reviewText":"We've have been hearing a lot lately about the next generation of games.  Finally a game comes out that really feels like the next generation of games.  If you have played the original Silent Hill you will remember that the games isn't as much &quot;shock&quot; value as the Resident Evil series, meaning that it relies less on the jump out and startle you then RE does.  Silent Hill develops a feeling of dread, with errie music, cryptic characters and dark visuals.Well I am glad to say that this one is no different, except the fact that it's done with superb graphical quality.  The game opens with a brief opening sequence, then control is given to the player.  When you first get control of James your first reaction may be, &quot;this is the game?&quot;  Meaning that you may be stunned to see that the graphics are really that good in just the normal part of the game.But graphics don't make a game right?  Right, this is more than just a graphic wonder for the PS2.  It's also your own personl horror movie.  The game has a grainy look to it, kind of like an 8mm film I have been told.  With music that sets you on edge with the feeling that something is going to happen, even if it doesn't.  The lighting effects are not to be matched by any game, as least any that I have played so far.  But it's where Silent Hill combines all it's fine qualities together that make it a great game.  It succeeds where the original succeeded, it has the ability to draw you in and give you a feeling of dread.  But that won't keep you away, it also succeeds in being fun at the same time.If you did not play the original Silent Hill I would still recommend this to people who enjoy the Resident Evil type games, you would be hard pressed to find one that is better.Parents be advised, this is a very graphic and distrubing game (hence the &quot;M&quot; rating it received), please do not buy it for your children.So are we finally seeing the next generation of games?  I think so.  If this game is an indication of games to come, then I believe I will be a happy gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2001"}

Your radio man  became a midnight snack for the T.rex, so it's up to you and your two remaining teammates to explore a  dino-infested research station, rescue the scientist, call for a helicopter retrieval, and escape with your lives.  Along the way you'll uncover the grizzly remains of those who got in the dinosaurs' way, and you'll unravel  the mystery of how a top-secret energy research project turned into a Jurassic nightmare.And about those dinosaurs: they're all over the island. One instant you'll be walking along a second-story  balcony, admiring the view, the next instant you'll be dodging a T.rex as it smashes its huge maw through  the concrete walls. Velociraptors chase you down blood-spattered corridors, flying reptiles circle the  outdoor areas, and your only weapons are your pistol, whatever else you can salvage, a dwindling supply of  ammunition, and your wits.Packed with clever puzzles and heart-pounding surprises, all superbly presented with realistic graphics and  horror-movie camera angles,Dino Crisisis a triumph of survival-horror gaming.--Mike  FehlauerPros:Great sound effects and musicWell-integrated, varied, and clever puzzlesAwe-inspiring, terrifying dinosaursBranching story line improves replay valueCons:Doors impervious to explosives","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"Please use DDK T disks to unlock title of review","reviewText":"As my first forray into the world of survival horror, I was very curious to see how this game would hold up in this age of Playstation 2s and Halo.  I am pleased to say that this is a pretty fun game that has its strenghts and weaknesses.You play as a secret agent named Regina.  Your mission is to infiltrate Ibis island to find a mysterious scientest named Dr. Kirk.  Upon landing on the island, it quickly becomes obvious that there is something very wrong with the island.  Then it becomes a quest to survive the evil reptillian menace.Many, many people have complained about how dino crisis should be called puzzle crisis.  It is true that there is an unusual amount of puzzles in the game that you must solve to advance.  They range from simple (switch the batteries) to the moderatly difficult (move the crates with a crane) to the quite difficult (Rotate electronic chips to divert power).  There are also a mamoth amount of keys that you must get (Around 50).  There are also DDK locks that you have to dechiper to unlock doors (Hence the title of this review).  Most of these puzzles can be solved moderatly easily, if you really think about it.  Overall, I'd say that the game is a 50/50 mix of puzzles and dinosaur action.As for the fighting part of the game, you get a total of three weapons, (Shotgun, handgun, and grenade gun) to exterminate raptors, pteradons, etc.  Some people might be turned off at the idea of only 3 weapons, but I dont find it a problem.  Combat is handled in the RE control scheme, which works pretty well.  As with a lot of survival horror games, you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo, which is not unlimited (Except in 1 case).  Fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult, but mastered.  Overall, I'd give the combat a BThere are some things to really like about Dino Crisis.  At certian points during the game, you have to make decisions aka \"Choose your own adventure\" style (Do you investigate the underground area, or go save a comrade?).  This adds a nice touch of replay value.  The graphics are pretty good (By PS1 standards).  The best part of the game however, is the T-rex.  The T-rex provides the most exciting elements in the game, and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush.  Likewise, the 4 possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through, although there are a few things I am curious about.  For example, (Spoiler!!!) how can a T-rex swim 30 miles an hour in water?  That dosent make much sense. (End Spoiler)The weak points of the game are mostly the puzzles.  There are a bit too many of them, and not enough dino battles.  Also, the devlopers throw puzzles at you when you least suspect it, and when you dont want them.  While racing to a heliport for example, a big race against time with tense dramatic music, the game tosses a box pushing puzzle that you have to solve to advance.  Another time, you have to solve 2 big puzzles in the span of 10 minnutes, where you have to power an elevator, then move cranes when they are only 3 minnutes apart.  Also, the unlockable mini-game you earn if you beat the game in under 5 hours, is dissapointing (At least to me).  The element of strategy is unwelcome, I just want to blast dinosaurs, and not worry about ammo, and Why isint the T-rex included?overall, I think that Dino Crisis is a fun game, and a good start to the world of Survival horror.  I recomend picking it up if you find it for uner $$$ .The good:good graphicsgood dino actiongood storyChoose your own adventure style branchesThe T-rex4 cool endingsThe not so good:a bit too many puzzlessome really difficult puzzlesnot enough dino actionmediocre mini game (See above)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2003"}

Not simply because Bioware built a fairly good storyline behind their amazing graphics engine (again, dated, but still relevant) - but more importantly, because Bioware included a powerful dungeon creation tool with the program.  Now users could finally take a game and design endless additional games/maps for it without having to start from scratch.  This ensured that gamers and Bioware continued to play and buy this title.  Even with the release of NWN2, NWN still owns a fairly sizeable market share of the &#34;post market&#34; adventure maps - all of which are free to download and play alone or with friends.Some of the most fascinating aspects that gamers developed with this engine include &#34;MMO&#34; like features into an engine that wasn't intended to be persistent.  Imagine the level of planning and development that an average user (okay, they are a bit smarter than average) had to do in order to turn this load, play, quit game into a persistent world.  Want to craft?  There are maps that include that.  Want to dungeon raid - there are maps that do that too.  Anything seemed possible with this wonderful game produced by a company that knows D&D.;If you haven't tried NWN or NWN2, recommend you check it out.  The scripted story alone is worth the price of admission.  Yes, there are more advanced games out today - but none with so many features at such a great cost.

I do throughly enjoy this game, im a big fan of the original star wars trilogy and I wish i was a jedi.  There are not many games out there that truly give you that feeling of actually being a jedi.  Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy were the games to go to in the past if you were craving some midichlorians. There were all types of mods that would allow you to dismember all those poor misguided stormtroopers.  Now that Force Unleashed is out i feel it has taken up the jedi torch for the most part.  The graphics are amazing for being a 360 game, even with hardware that is 4 years old it still holds up to PC quality graphics of today.  I was particularly impressed with the Raxis Prime garbage planet level, the background is breathtaking.  The force powers in this game far surpass anything of the past including Jedi Outcast.  Force gripping and pushing enemy troopers off cliffs or just throwing them into other stormtroopers never gets old.  The force lightning effects a fan-flippin-tastic!  These powers truly give you a sense of raw sith power!  The soundtrack has all the classic star wars instrumentals as well as those familiar lightsaber and blaster sound effects, they sound good as usual.  Im not too crazy about the storyline really, i feel it started off promising then tapered off as it progressed.  I wasn't sure if i'd get to battle Vader or the Emperor as i knew they were going to live regardless.  Either way i was sure that a lowly apprentice wouldn't be able to take on either one of the true masters of the sith and make it out in one piece, but of course i was proved wrong......i guess.  My biggest gripe about this game is the lightsaber.  It just feels too weak, i know from watching the movies that when a jedi or sith slices something with that energy beam someone always seems to lose a limb.  In unleashed, everyone seems to be lightsaber resistant so it almost feels like im swinging a lead pipe around. This saber doesn't slice, its a blunt object.

{"product_name":"B004CD9X2C","description":"","reviewerName":"Lars Kingbeard","summary":"sublime insanity","reviewText":"Alice is the sort of game that should have garnered widespread approbation instead of the largely middling and negative reviews it has accrued so far, a fact which speaks to the myopia and general immaturity of the gaming press, most of whom seem to have difficulty in appreciating original or creative concepts and are much more comfortable dealing with the cliched, the ordinary, and the predictable.The art design in Alice is probably its strongest point, and is among the best I have seen in a game. The characters are whimsical and dark, like the strangely hobbling mechanical monstrosity that spews soot and bears the cracked visage of a porcelain doll, the madly scrabbling one-eyed teapot sprouting a forest of mechanical legs or the several characters that come straight from the original John Tenniel illustrations to Lewis Carrol's classic work, such as the mock turtle, the Duchess (who appears in turn to have been based on a DaVinci caricature), and a truly frightening rendition of the jabberwocky, with glowing orbs and the gaping maw of a catfish. The environments are no less compelling, from the grim and dingy backstreets of industrial England, to the myriad landscapes of wonderland itself. The kaleidescopic hills and vales of wonderland's outskirts quickly give way to a barren wasteland littered with the cracked remnants of cyclopean plates and cups, deeper still, beyond fonts of slow burning black tar lies a diabolic clockworks under a leaden green sky, in which huge conglomerate forms of black steel hover like bestial moths, trailing titan forks and kettles, limned by a deep red fire.The platforming controls well and is fun, particularly since this unique brand of gameplay has been seldom seen in recent years. The levels are huge and intricate, with many secrets to find and collectibles and power-ups to unlock. The emphasis is on exploration and platforming, but the combat is well integrated to break up the pace and create a fluid and satisfying experience. Each enemy has particular weakpoints that require Alice to exploit specific strategies to take them out, making the combat much more involved than your typical hack n slash. The game is fairly challenging, and it is quite rewarding once you have mastered the controls to pull off a sweet series of death defying leaps with Alice's triple jump, or to hop nimbly between moving platforms that become visible momentarily when Alice's shrink vision is employed.If your idea of a good game is one that involves stultifying realism, empty action, and hollywood cliches then odds are that you will not like this game. If your tastes go beyond that to the appreciation of literature, art, and above all imagination then this game should prove to be quite satisfactory. Overall 10/10, the most fun I've had with a game in a long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2011"}

I'm a veteran of FPS game in general and this is definitely one of the best I have played. I've put in about 20+ hours solo in the main game but have not touched the DLC yet so I cannot comment on either multiplayer or the expansions from experience.Awesome FeaturesRandomly Generated Guns:Basically there are the 8 basic types of weapons (pistols, SMG, revolvers, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and alien weapons) and 5 or so randomly chosen parts on each weapon. This is GREAT because each configuration adds to the weapon visually and in purpose e.g. not having a buttstock on an assault rifle causes the accuracy to go down.RPG Style Skill Trees:With each of the four classes you get 3 branches in their skill tree. It is very similar to MMORPGS like WOW where you can spec your characters to play certain ways. My first play-through I chose the berserker character who I am specing to basically be an all melee character. This shows the unique flexibility of the gameplay, there isn't another FPS game out there where you can play as a melee class and be more effective than someone with a gun.Awesome Reasons to BuyStyle:Borderlands is a fully cell shaded game with plenty of humor and baddassness to satisfy the core as well as casual. It is very lowbrow and violent though so if you are easily offended by toilet humor and foul language and get sick when enemies chunk you may not like the game. If not, then you'll love it. The arcade/MMO style visual queues add a lot to the game play too.Replayability:Unlimited! Similar to Diablo you can play through the game multiple times keeping your level and the enemies will scale with you (also the weapons). Since there are 4 characters you'll want to try out all of their different styles. And with your current character you'll definitely want to play through several times until you hit the level cap (69 get this version and downloaded the DLC), to max out your skills, and get better weapons.Controls:They're tight. I really have nothing more to say about it. Standard FPS (grenades, aim, shoot, look).Pace:So far the pace of the game is perfect. I haven't heard/read much about this, but it is one of those things that will kill a game if it is bad and if it's good you will never hear about it. I'm level 35 and have never wished that I had more quests (or had to farm for XP like some RPGs). In the beginning it's a little hard going when you hit some of the boss characters, but once you pick up your skills and get some upgraded guns it quickly becomes less frustrating and more of an experience to fight them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

This one didn't disappoint. Taking place years after the events of the second game, Max is now a body guard to a very wealthy family based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Max is not as sharp as he used to be, tremendous amounts of physical and mental trauma had taken it's toll. He has turned haggard and spends his spare time washing down pills with whiskey. Max's downward spiral and steady paycheck are disrupted however when the kidnapping of his boss's wife sets off a chain of very bloody events which sets him against drug gangs, armed vigilantes, and a very corrupt branch of the Sao Paulo police.As far as I'm concerned, Max Payne has always been a single player experience but the multilayer was very fun and enjoyable. Though it still doesn't put up much of a fight against other multiplayer heavy hitters like Battlefield 3 or Call of Duty. If that's all you care about then you may want to skip over Max Payne or wait for it's price to drop a bit. The single-player on the other hand is great. While it is essentially only a shooting gallery with not much else to offer, this is not a bad thing because the game is designed pretty well.The voice acting is top-notch with James McCaffrey reprising his role as Max again. Visually the game looks great and the action plenty with a good soundtrack that meshes perfectly when the bullets start flying. Enemies are tough too, especially on the harder difficulties. These guys aren't pushovers they'll do what they can to make you bleed. Bullet-time makes a return and is a key part of the game play as you will probably use it as often as possible. Another neat touch is that the player is rewarded with a pretty satisfying slow-mo kill cam after every major gun fight.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2013"}

Not much else to say about the game without giving it away, I do feel that it was a little short but that could be because there wasn't a learning curve like the last one.  Otherwise, I liked it a lot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2012"}

It's a rhythm game with some fun songs to play along with.The plot is the silly part. Secret agents watch for trouble - babysitters trying to calm down kids, little girls missing their daddies - and jump in to help out. The way they help is by dancing along to the music.  This is like finding a \"plot\" for tetris. Just ignore it :)The real fun is the actual gameplay. You have a song playing in the background - the 19 different tracks include songs like YMCA, Material Girl, You're the Inspiration, La La, Sk8ter Boi, Let's Dance and much more. There's a good mix to please most players. Now you tap along with the song on circles on the screen.Let's say you're playing Material Girl. They might show 4 circles in a row for you to tap along with the song. A larger circle will show around each circle, closing in on it and matching it right when you're supposed to tap it. Sometimes you slide along a line. Sometimes you double tap. The taps make drum beats and cymbals, so it really does sound like you're playing along with the song. The \"closing circles\" are really easy to see and understand and draw your eyes along.In between verses, the top screen shows you manga-like scenes of the \"story\" you are following. So in one story, a weathergirl is trying to get rainy clouds to go away so she can have a picnic with her son. The scenes show her getting help from people in blowing away the clouds. Depending on how well you do in your playing, you get different endings - so you really have incentive to do your best and to replay.There are two levels of difficulty, and on each level you get a rating of how well you did. You can easily go back and replay levels to get the highest rating in each one.You might think that 19 songs aren't a lot, but really, you don't play a song just once. That would be like listening to a song just once on the radio or on your MP3 player! You listen to and play them repeatedly because it's fun to hear the song and fun to play along.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2006"}

I felt like I should have been done with it at the 40-50 hour mark.- Battle system takes some time to get used to.  There is a lot of menus to manage such as provisions and spells- Too many optional side quests (errands and what not).  The game starts to become more like a job and I often needed to consult YouTube videos to determine what to do and where to go.  I didn't feel like reading the Wizard's Compendium either to find the answers.- Grinding and farming is a major aspect of the game.  If you are not at a high enough level, you will often have trouble beating the bosses.  Repetitive battles can fatigue the player...you often run into or encounter the same enemies over and over.I wanted to give this game 3 stars because there is way too much grinding involved.

{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Assassin's Creed Continues To Evolve...And Impress","reviewText":"First things first -If you haven't played the first Assassin's Creed and subsequent releases (or at LEAST starting with II, and going forward) - go no further.  Do yourself a service and start with II as a bare minimum and work yourself forward to this, the 3rd in the Ezio Auditore trilogy.  Otherwise, you'll be completely lost.For those of you familiar with the story, you're going to find Ezio Auditore in his twilight years on a quest to find Altair's legendary, yet quite well-protected, library.  The Templars have caught wind of it and Ezio is also trying to find his way in to thwart their attempts at worldwide control.  This is hardly a spoiler as you're quickly brought into this within minutes of beginning to play Ezio - no further spoilers here.From the standpoint of playing all of the previous Assassin's Creed entries, how does this one fare?  Well, I finally played it tonight and I must say that it is really quite remarkable. There's a major change in the way that combat is handled - you select a primary and then a secondary weapon so that you can enter a sword fight and then throw knives at will, for example (no longer do you have to constantly \"weapon wheel\" between sword and throwing knives constantly). Graphic engine has been updated and it's quite smooth; I don't find it stuttering nearly as often as it used to. Even the story itself has been given a facelift - now there's more of a cohesive, unified story rather than a series of seemingly disjointed events culminating in your goal in the first place of killing \"x\" person because he did \"y\". \"Eagle vision\" also has some significant improvements, some subtle and some not. For example, in addition to identifying enemies, you'll actually see faint red lines indicating a guard's patrol route. This enhances the formulation of tactics. In other cases, where smoke bombs are even more effective at obscuring your enemies' ability to attack you, \"eagle vision\" will actually allow you to pierce the cloud and attack your enemies at will.  In addition, you will be collecting materials to craft a variety of different bombs (lethal and non-lethal). The animations of Ezio kill moves are superb and some of his abilities show that Ezio, in his twilight years, is deadlier than ever.  The music, as always, is very well-done and the voice acting is even better than usual. The beginning of the game reminds me of Matrix Revolutions, but I do mean this in a good way.The environments are breathtakingly beautiful.  The game has departed from Italy and finds itself in Constantinople, once the true crossroads of the world between Europe and Asia when the United States was still a mere 264 years away from declaring its own independence.  Ezio finds himself with new equipment (the hook blade is fun opening a variety of attacks as well as an ability to zip line around your environment - fantastic!), friends (including a romantic interest), and actually enters into the conflict politically - it's no longer a mere Templar/Assassin conflict.  There are layers to appreciate here as Ezio makes an ally and as I am starting to delve into it, I truly appreciate what Ubisoft has created here.If there is one thing that I have to complain about, it's the mode where you have to defend your own Assassin's Keeps in addition to creating them for those of you familiar with Brotherhood.  It becomes a \"tower defense\" game at this point...and I don't mean that in a flattering way.  It's one thing that Ubisoft could have omitted (or seriously improved upon) without impacting the story whatsoever.  It comes off as a silly gimmick that didn't appear to have been given a significant amount of thought in terms of how it flows with the rest of the interlocking parts.  This is an oprhan 301st piece in a 300-piece puzzle; it doesn't fit and, quite honestly, you don't really need it to complete the experience.I haven't had a chance to explore multiplayer too much, but what I've seen so far seems to indicate that Ubisoft has taken the best parts of Brotherhood and have added both modes and additional customization not seen before.  I'm more into the story then the multiplayer, but Revelations has shown me enough to convince me to give it a try...later.  Assassin's Creed is still, first and foremost, about continuing a quite fascinating story.  And the final chapter to the overall story arc (with Ezio's presumably ending here, if rumors are believed) is to come in yet a single year, although how Ubisoft plans to bring this epic to a conclusion in the absence of such a strong character like Ezio has my curiosity piqued.Despite the fault of \"tower defense\", everything else is so vastly improved that I still have to give it a solid 4.75 stars (5 stars on the Amazon scale - don't think it deserves a 4).  Enough said - get it and enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4","reviewText":"When Resident Evil 4 was released back in 2005, it was exactly what Capcom's beloved survival horror series needed: a kick in the tail. Completely overhauling the series' archaic controls and trite puzzles, Resident Evil 4 ended up being one of the absolute best action games to ever see the light of day. Now Resident Evil 5 is finally here, and from a technical standpoint, the game is a sight to behold. These may be in fact the best graphics to be seen in any game on the market today, with beautifully rendered visuals that are simply eye-popping. The core mechanics from Resident Evil 4 remain intact here, as you play as RE1 hero Chris Redfield and new character Sheva; both of whom are investigating the African nation of Kijuju, and eventually are faced with hordes of infected villagers, mutants, monsters, and other nasties, including good 'ol Wesker. The game is loaded with enough balanced moments of action and tension, and having a partner only makes things even better. Seriously, adding a partner opens up some new dimensions to the gameplay that helped make RE4 so good, using teamwork to take down the baddies and watch each other's backs as well, which simply just makes the game more fun. The only true flaws of Resident Evil 5 lie in its online capabilities. Online co-op has it's share of problems, including not being able to exchange weapons with a teammate, as well as having to wait for the host to restart from a previous checkpoint or get to a new one before jumping into the action. Still, flaws aside, Resident Evil 5 is a sheer blast of an action game and a more than worthy follow-up to Resident Evil 4. It isn't perfect and doesn't leave the lasting impression that RE4 did, but it remains a stunning technical achievement that delivers the goods, and with the promise that Capcom will be re-vitalizing the series once again in the next installment, the best may very well be yet to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2009"}

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Robert Jenkins \"video geek #1\"","summary":"Excellent update of some classic titles!","reviewText":"I am another of those who remembers when the original Final Fantasy was released for the original NES back in 1990.  I played it and thought that it was a great game, though there were a few aspects of the game mechanics that were annoying, such as the fact that you could only buy one item at a time from various shops, so if you wanted to buy, for example, 99 potions, you had to sit there and buy them one at a time.  This has been fixed now to where you can specify the number of items you wish to purchase, so only one transaction is necessary.  Other enhancements to the game include a bestiary, item list, an improved world map, an artwork gallery, and much improved graphics and music, with some fairly nice spell effects.  The item storage system is also improved, allowing you to hold on to more items than could be previously carried.  Anyone who has played the old version of Final Fantasy doubtless remembers having to dump some fairly good weapons and armor just to make room for other items found in dungeons.  That is a thing of the past now, and the game is much better for it.  The new version also does a good job of informing the player when a weapon or piece of armor has special properties, such as magic spells, allowing the player to make the best use of the weapons available to them.Of course, all the graphical and mechanical improvements in the world won't save a boring game.  The translation from the original Japanese is improved, so some of the things various characters say make more sense than they did before.  Many of the place names in the game have been changed, and a lot of the monsters have been renamed.The storyline of the game is passable, although certainly nowhere near as rich or complex as the later Final Fantasy installments.  That's to be expected, considering that this was originally an 8-bit cartridge game.  You start out with four characters, and you assign them names and job classes at the start of the game, and that will be your party throughout the game.  Again, it was fine for its time, though someone who has played the newer Final Fantasies and not this one may find this somewhat of a disappointment.As for Final Fantasy 2, I had never played this one before, since it was never domestically released in the USA.  So, I really can't comment on its improvements from the original version.  However, it is on a par graphically and soundwise with the updated Final Fantasy 1, so I imagine that is is also much improved from the old NES version.  The system for character improvement and magic improvement is much different from the first game.  Essentially, it is a system whereby the more a character uses a certain weapon or magic type, the better that character gets at that action.  So, your characters specialize over time.  A very interesting system, and one which allows for a greater amount of freedom in character creation and growth than in the original Final Fantasy.All in all, I would say that these games are very well-done remakes of some classic NES titles.  If you have fond memories of the original versions, I guarantee you will enjoy these updates.  If you are interested in seeing where the Final Fantasy series got its start, I highly recommend this collection.  Happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2003"}

God of War 3 was coming right around the corner, and this collection was the perfect way to get me ready to go for the upcoming PS3 release.The gameplay of the God of War series is always brutally efficient.  You control Kratos, the God of War, on a quest that fluctuates from rage to redemption and revenge.  The entire experience is engineered to allow fast and brutal combat sequences, to allow the player to express his rage against countless hordes of twisted monsters.  Right from the get-go you'll feel like a total war machine, stringing together combos and taking enemies out left and right.  There's a learning curve here for some of the tougher bad guys in the game, but Kratos has plenty of weapons and techniques at his disposal to overcome these challenges.One of the highlights of the God of War series is always the boss battles.  Huge, epic, and brutal - Kratos will have to pull out every trick in the book to take down these monsters.  Most boss battles end with a sequence of button presses that you need to execute as they pop up on the screen, while Kratos performs a crazy finishing blow on the boss.  These sequences are always completely over the top, and puts a satisfying end onto every boss battle.In summary, you're getting a ton of content here for a budget price.  If you haven't played either of these games yet, and they appeal to you at all, then pick them up ASAP.  Please note that these games are NOT for the weak of heart or for kids.  The action is over the top and very brutal, with tons of blood and gore.  There are also some pretty heavily sexual situations, including nudity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Chris A.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Dev","summary":"Best Space Horror Ever","reviewText":"Simply put I loved the original Dead Space and thus when Dead Space 2 came out it was a day 1 purchase for me. After finishing the game (~14h) and playing multiplayer for couple of hours this is what I thought.***********PROS************A SURVIVAL HORROR: While Dead Space 2 is slightly deviating from Dead Space 1 in terms of it is being more cinematic (more dramatic cut scenes, more depiction Isaac as a character etc.), Dead Space 2 is still a survival horror. You will have to be careful of your surroundings, you will have to be careful about conserving your ammo and you will have to have to use different items you gain in the game very wisely to get through the game on normal or harder modes. So unlike games like Resident Evil, which has moved to purely action/adventure, Dead Space 2 is still a survival horror.ATTENTION TO DETAIL CREATING SPACE ENVIRONMENT: One of the reasons I loved Dead Space 1 and now Dead Space 2, is it is horror in space. In Dead Space 1 you are surviving in a space ship abandoned in Space and in this game you are doing similar in a city in space that is going through similar terror. While you may find these two settings very similar, there are some aspects that truly distinguish Dead Space 2 from 1. One of them being taking place in a city, you will have much greater variety in environment compared to Dead Space 1 and everything is designed so craftily that it actually feels like you are in the futuristic city in space. I truly want to give you examples, but it is hard to do it in words and without spoiling the gameplay experience for you, so just take my words for it.UNEXPECTED SURPRISES: This is probably the best aspect of the game and makes it actually a horror. There are so many parts in the game (and I mean so many) where you won't see things coming and I am not just talking about enemies popping out of closet, but some really good stuff. I truly wish I could tell you, but I truly don't want to ruin the game for you.BETTER IN SPACE GAMEPLAY: Like last game, you will have zero gravity and Oxygen less space areas, but in this game there will be a variety of things you will be doing in Iron-man like space suit. I simply loved it, especially the parts that are highly cinematic.VARIETY IN ENEMIES: Just like Dead Space 1, there is plenty of variety in enemies. While a lot of enemies will be similar to Dead Space 1, there are some very unique new enemies. Having variety of enemies truly prevents the game from being redundant and keep things exciting.VARIETY IN DEATHS: This is a strange pro to list, but play the game and even if you are a good player try dying with the hands of different enemies and different environmental hazards. The number of brutal ways you can die in this game will surprise you. I personally loved it.VARIETY IN WEAPONS: Again most of the weapons you get are from Dead Space 1 (which are great), but then you will get also some new different type of weapons. The best part of these weapons is they have alternate fire. So this makes using them very strategic. The best thing that has been about Dead Space series is it is not simply about going around and shooting enemies. Rather, it has been about strategically fighting off the enemies. There are parts in this game you will get hordes and hordes of enemies coming at you. If you simply try to get them by just using one weapon, they will punish you. On the other hand, if you strategically use your weapons' fire and alternate fire, you will be able to survive through the terror and move forward.PLENTY OF UPGRADABLES: Just like previous Dead Space you can upgrade your suit, your rig, your weapons etc. In this game though you can get different types of suits. I personally have loved this addition. This truly adds an RPG element and promotes you to conserve even more so you can by nodes to upgrade as many weapons as possible.AWESOME BEGINNING: Usually in my reviews I only consider gameplay etc. as pros and cons., but the beginning gameplay for this game is so unique that I have to put it down as pro. Unfortunately I can't tell you more without spoiling so play and find it out.TWISTS IN THE STORY: There are few twists that you may be able to predict, but others I guarantee you won't see coming, especially in the end. Every crazy thing you may read or see has some sort of meaning. Unfortunately another thing I can't describe more without spoiling.NO ASTROIDS: Yes this is another thing I wouldn't usually list as pro., but asteroids in Dead Space 1 annoyed me so much that I am so happy they don't have them in Dead Space 2 or anything of similar nature.BONUS GAME: As of now (02/2011) If you buy this game for PS3 form Amazon, you will get Dead Space Extraction for PS3 move for free. I can't say for the future though.MULTIPLAYER: While I am not into multiplayers these days, I still loved the the multiplayer for this game, especially the part where you can play nacromorph. This truly adds great replay value to the game.MANY DIFFICULTY MODES: There are 3 difficulty modes above normal. So if you are a completionist, this game will take you a while and provide you hours and hours of entertainment.************CONS.*****************LACK OF GOOD BOSSES: Don't get me wrong there are some good bosses in this game who will kill you in some of the most brutal ways possible; however, I had better expectations for them. Especially for the last boss. Kind of disappointed.INVENTORY: Dead Space 1 and 2 are the games where you truly have to conserve the ammos and items and for that your inventory space is very important. Just like Dead Space 1, in this game there are levels where you will go long sequences without seeing a store where you can rearrange items in your inventory. During these long sequences you will acquire quite a few god/silver/bronze semiconductors (huge chunks of credits) and schematics for new items and they will occupy huge part of your inventory which should be used for ammos and health. I personally found it annoying. They should have separate space or should not take any space in your inventory at all.************CONCLUSION*************Pros for this game clearly outweigh the Cons. If you are a Dead Space fan or like horror games, this game is a must. So do yourself justice and buy and play it at your earliest opportunity. I give it 9.5/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}

Knowing its track record, I was a little apprehensive when I found out that 'Legacy' was in production.  However, most of the still-shots in the game's advertising ended-up looking pretty good, so eventually this wound-up being a title on my \"buy\" list.I'm about three-quarters of the way through it now and I can say honestly that I don't regret having picked it up.  There's more \"good\" here then \"bad\", no question about it.  In terms of the games graphics, in my opinion, I thought it was a real beauty.  I thought the ships in the various fleets were beautifully designed and the damage animations were all terrific.  I'll touch on the actual explosions later.The voice acting was all top-notch.  Bethesda managed to get most of the grade-A talent (Bakula/ Shatner/ Stewart/ etc) to come back and reprise their roles for the game.  With Trek having been off the radar for a while now, it was a real treat getting to hear some of these guys back in the saddle again.  Furthermore, the sound F/X and background score were  average.  Nothing that stands out, but I wouldn't say either detracted from the game's play at all.The story-line, while it's (admittedly) not going to win any awards, was competent enough to accomplish the task of tying the three generations of The Enterprise together without being ridiculous.  If it was a cross-over then was done on television, I'd probably have watched and enjoyed it.  It is pretty short though.  I'd say the game-play clocks-in at about six to eight hours at the most.  On the `ensign' level (easy), you can probably finish this REALLY quickly.Although the game does get a thumbs-up from me, it does suffer from a few HUGE issues and several annoying minor ones.  The worst, for me, was the inability to command the other vessels in your fleet.  Other then a basic \"form-up\" command, if you want these ships to do anything more complex, you have to take command of them yourself and pilot them manually.  I was stunned at the lack of basic \"guard this\", \"escort that\", and \"stay\" directions.  To illustrate, there's a mission in the beginning of the game where the goal is to protect a small convoy of medical transports.  Stupidly, of course, they all go shooting off in different directions.  In order to accomplish the task of making sure those transports survive, you have to take control of one of your ships and send it off blindly in one direction while you go in another.  The hope is if that vessel bumps into something, seemingly on the transport's route, you can jump over quickly and take care of the obstacle.I've read several criticisms of the maneuverability of the ships themselves.  I didn't have that big of an issue with this.  These are big, lumbering vessels that pilot like ... big, lumbering vessels.  For the most part, I was of the thinking that they shouldn't be able just turn on a dime.  Because it's space (a 360 degree environment) it's true that the camera controls can become a little tricky, but no worse then a lot of other games out there.  Where my issue came in was the control of the ships themselves.  First, the button-layout is pretty awkward and there aren't any other combinations that might make it easier.  This is something that the PC version may have as an advantage.  Using a keyboard and a mouse would probably go a long way toward making this a bit easier.  The other issue that drove me stone-crazy was the speed-controls.  There's 'Stop/ Impulse/ and Warp' ... that's it.  Although the option exists to divert your ship's power around, there's no degree of anything and no 'reverse'.  For the life of me, I can't figure out how this was overlooked.  There's one or two missions whose degree-of-difficulty is increased ten-fold, just because I wasn't able to back-up or fine-tune my acceleration.Although I do like the graphics, I would have loved it if the \"explosion\" animations were a little cleaner.  Anything I destroy seems to just fall apart into varying-shaped polygons with a light-effect behind it.  There's no real \"effect.\"  If there's one thing that I know Star trek fans absolutely love it's a good sense of scale.  These ships are big.  We want them to look big, control big, and (most importantly) blow-up big.  Sadly, it just doesn't deliever.Another odd thing about the controls, you have the option of 'self-destructing' your ship.  This is strange because if you do this with the Enterprise, it's 'game-over.' The Enterprise (or the \"lead\" vessel) always has to survive; having said that, to even make \"self-destruct\" an option is pretty ridiculous.  For the remaining fleet, if your ship is damaged badly enough, that ship will blow up and be destroyed.  If I'm to the point where I'm considering blowing the thing myself, what's the difference if I pull the trigger or if it's destroyed?  Either way, the thing blows and I'm down a vessel to command.  Who pulls the final trigger doesn't seem to have any strategic advantage one way or the other.Not so much a criticism, but a missed opportunity, might have been the ability to customize some of the different models of ships you can purchase.  Being able to adjust the speed/ shields/ or weapons systems would have been a cool way to increase the games replay value.  As it stands now, it's a take-it-or-leave-it situation with each model and class.  There was something else I wanted to put on the wish-list of features, and admittedly this is probably a double-edged sword since the controls are tricky, but I'd have loved to have been able to \"ram\" another ship.  As it is, if you're going to collide with an object, you're just bumped around whatever the obstacle is.  It would have been outrageously cool to be out of torpedoes, low on phaser-power, and diverted power to the shields and just smashed whatever was in your way.Lastly, unless I'm REALLY missing something, you can only have one save file for the game!  As it stands now, for example, if I want to load up the game I'm playing, I start right where I left off.  Doesn't sound like a big deal right?  It's aggravating as hell though, for a 360 owner who wants to replay a previous mission for a gaming-achievement they may have missed.  Again, unless I'm COMPLETELY overlooking something, the only time you have the ability to replay a certain part of the game is immediately after you finish it.I know this sounds like a lot, so I do feel obligated to (again) point-out that, over-all, I did like it.  This is certainly the cream-of the-crop so far for its home gaming run.  At around fifteen-dollars, if you're looking for something different to give you a break from playing GTA IV, Star Trek: Legacy is capable of adequately filling the void.Note: I believe a free-demo is still available on xBox Live.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2008"}

If you're playing a game like Final Fantasy, where you want to save every 1/2 hr to hour just in case you get yourself stuck and need to go back to build up your characters, you use up memory card space quickly. Believe me, I'd much rather spend a few extra dollars on memory card space, vs wasting weeks of frustrating time having to replay entire games to get past a difficult boss.It's also critical, if you have more than one gamer in the family, to have separate memory cards. I can't tell you how many people email me at my gaming sites, wondering if they can \"recover\" lost save data because someone else accidentially overwrote or erased their save game. If it's a game you just started playing it's not so bad - but if you had been building your characters up over months, and had just about solved the entire epic game, it can be heart wrenching.These memory cards work for all PS2 games. If you get yourself a PS3, then you definitely will want to also get the PS2 - PS3 memory adapter. This little unit lets you plug your PS2 card into it, then a USB connector plugs into the PS3 so that the save games all read right into your PS3. Now you can play all your PS2 games on your PS3 without having to start from scratch. Note that your PS3 does NOT natively let you \"stick the PS2 memory card into it\". There is no slot on the PS3 for the PS2 card.Also, for games that you play for multiple weeks, I definitely recommend having a memory card backup of your current save games. Memory cards get lost, they get \"borrowed\" by accident, they do lose data occasionally if you step on them or drop them in the snow. Just like you back up your computer's hard drive occasionally, back up those important game save files. It only takes a few minutes and can save you months of replaying.Well recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}

I picked up a used copy last week and haven't been able to put it down since then! Lucky for me another good friend just bought it as well so we played the whole Story Mode all the way through on Co-Op, and I must say it was a jolly good time!It's just more fun with a friend, it's not bad playing by yourself either, but I think most players will have a much better time in Co-Op . This mode really helps cut down on busy work during missions and it's always better to have someone to share in the game's silliness.Not many downsides to the game, except maybe playing by yourself, har har! Some of the quests are a bit drab but they are exactly what you might expect: fetch quests, rescue missions, & locating survivors. The boss fights are very fun though, pitting you against insane human survivors and each one requiring a different strategy. Really it's all about building insane weapons and vehicles and obliterating zombies in ridiculous ways. Over all the gameplay is very solid and offers a good deal of variety while rewarding player who explore the city (hidden goodies everywhere). The graphics/resolution are above average, nothing that will blow your mind except when the game renders (literally) thousands of zombies on screen at once.A fun game for any X1 owners out there, and now that there's been a price drop it's worth picking up. Great humor and gore, the laughs and the blood will flow!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

Things are a lot different this time around though. I downloaded the demo for Grid from the PS3 store first of all. 983Mb, so it took a while, but once it was installed and I was able to start playing - wow. The next day I went out and traded GT5 Prologue at my local games store and bought the full version of Grid. Why? Because Grid is exciting to play.How can this be? It doesn't run at 60Hz. It doesn't run in 1080p (it's a 720p game). The graphics aren't as clean. The physics isn't as accurate. Surely GT5 Prologue ought to be head and shoulders above Grid?In the computer graphics world, there's a concept called The Uncanny Valley - it's when CGI becomes so real that humans no longer accept it as being real any more. GT 5 Prologue has crossed the Uncanny Valley. Grid hasn't and it's so much better for it. The graphics are grubbier, dirtier and rougher - more like the real world. That's not to say they're worse. Not by any stretch of the imagination. In fact the detail on the cars and tracks in Grid is every bit as complex as that in GT 5 Prologue. Pause a replay or look around the cars in the garage - the detail goes as far as manufacturer logos on the wheel rims and brake calipers.The single big-ticket item for me though is that Grid has solved the two biggest problems with GT 5 Prologue. Grid has car damage, and it's AI for the other drivers is stunning. First the car damage - it's incremental. Starting with scratched paint, bent wings and cracked windows. Keep up the reckless driving and bumpers will work loose and windows will pop out. Keep going and you can bend just about every part of the car. It all affects the car handling too - not extremely, but it is noticable. Steering can pull to one side or the other, acceleration can be dulled, brakes can lose their efficiency. Cracked radiators, bent air intakes - all affect the performance of your car. It's more arcade than simulation, but frankly it's so much better for it. Best of all, like Forza and other racers, when something drops off a car, it's persistent - it stays on the track creating a hazard for competitors behind. Same goes for tyre walls - whack into one of those and the tyres will fly all over the place, scattering into the crowd and track. Oh - and the crowd - 3D people that cheer and chant, and if you smack the wall right next to them, jump back. A nice touch.On to the AI front, a breath of fresh air from the awful GT 5 Prologue disaster. Drivers jostle for position all over the track. They will get aggressive with you if you get aggressive with them. They make mistakes, often spinning out or crashing into each other or trackside objects. Fabulous. Love it.You can whip up a paint job for your team from some basic choices of patterns and colours. It's got nowhere near the amount of tunability and customisation that some racers do but really - do you need it? There's plenty of variety in Grid to give you a custom look to your team. On top of that, the more you race, the more sponsors become available to you, so you can stuff sponsor stickers all over your ride to make more money when you race.Other graphics touches are nice - the tyre smoke effects, dirt and sparks from the odd hard landing or excursion into the grass. Realtime reflections and shadows from everything. It's all gravy but it's all brilliant.There are a raft of racing events to choose from - Pro Stock, Touring Cars, Destruction Derby, Open-wheel, Drift, Pro Togue - the list goes on. There's a large choice of tracks and a reasonable good choice of cars to choose from. Most tracks have a couple of different versions with forward and reverse options coming up later in the game.The in-race music is patchy - it only seems to exist in a couple of races and I'm not sure why. Nobody in the Codemasters support forums seems to know why either but it's not a biggie. When racing there are plenty of ambient sound effects going on around you, even if the engine sounds are all a bit samey.The replay facility is exciting to watch but it is a little limited. You can only focus on your car and you can't rotate the camera around, and there's no save facility. There are 5 or 6 predetermined camera choices including TV-style coverage which is nice, and the ability to slow the action down to ultra-slow-motion is really a nice addition. Grid also comes with a flashback feature. If you cock something up in a race, you can watch an instant replay and then choose the point in the replay from which you want a do-over. You'd think that would make it easy to win the races but in reality it doesn't. You only get between 2 to 6 chances in a race depending on your difficulty level. Each time you use one, you lose potential cash and reputation from your end-of-race winnings. The more cash you have, the more cars you can buy. The more reputation you earn, the more you can demand for racing for other teams. Yes - you have your own team, but you can also race for others as a sort of 'gun for hire'. Once you've progressed far enough you can also hire a second driver to drive a second car for you, doubling the chances of making money. As you work your way through the game your reputation level also unlocks more licence classes to race in - 10 in all, split 3 ways between US-, Euro- and Japanese-Racing once you've won your way through the basic licence.Grid's online mode is also a lot better than GT 5 Prologue's too. It's intuitive and easy to use, and doesn't seem to really care about how your internet connection is set up. There is not a lot of noticable lag which makes for a nice, smooth racing environment. You can opt to join an existing lobby on the internet, or set up one of your own and wait for others to come to you. If you set up your own lobby, you can set a couple of different options, like damage levels and whether or not the race employs 'catch up' to keep the racers closer together. The only thing that marrs the online play is that you'll inevitably get one or two idiots who, once they've realised they're not at the front, will turn around and race the wrong way around to try to crash into everyone else. But I guess that's the motor racing equivalent of the 5 year old Korean kid who knows every glitch in first person shooters and appears to be able to snipe you from across the map.Most importantly though, Grid is exciting to play. Properly exciting - enough to annoy you when you lose a race and make you want to run it over again to try to improve your ranking. It has plenty of eye-candy, plenty of replayability and plenty of variety. And that is why, for the time being, Grid trumps GT 5 Prologue in every category. Sure GT5P is a \"preview\" or \"expensive demo\" but if Polyphony don't learn from what Codemasters have done with Grid, the full version of GT5 will falter and ultimately fail. Grid doesn't fail - it wins comprehensively. Download the demo and I bet you'll end up buying the full game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2008"}

Sarcastic, witty, sly, and sometimes dark humorous jokes? Well, take out the first three attributes. She's pretty pissed that you killed her in the first game.Light spoilers, but I've only completed chapters 1-3.The credits song in Portal 1 is light, fluffy, and fun to listen to. She's not even angry at you for killing her. Well, she found out she's got a nifty black-box quick-save feature that saves the last two minutes of her life. Yes, those two minutes, those last two where you blew her to pieces. Those two minutes have been looping in her system for about a hundred years. It explains why she's pissed. Either that, or it's because her entire facility has gone to crap.I'm guessing it's the combination of the two. You absolutely can't play this game without playing the first game. It'll make no sense because of the continual references to the first game. Companion cubes, what you did to her, the strange psychotic writings on the wall, make a comeback. She makes jokes about the past too and her actions are reminiscent of the first game. In short. You'll be missing out big time if you don't play the first game.The puzzles are great, unlike Portal one however, the game really just... throws you into it. Portal 1 eases you into the game step-by-step, but Portal two really seems streamlined for the veterans of the portal shooting device. Do not be discouraged however, Portal 2 is not insanely harder than the first one (from what I've seen thus far). However, there are barely any instructions on what to do. And if there are, they are in \"scientific\" terms. GLaDOS has lost her quirky touch of explaining things simply (i.e. speedy thing goes in, speedy thing goes out). She's a bitter robot.If you haven't played Portal before, I highly recommend you play the first one. Portal 2 feels a lot darker than the first one and it isn't as \"player friendly.\" If you enjoy puzzle games, Portal 2 is great, but don't expect the same experience as Portal fans will receive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"justsomeguy","summary":"Easy-ish, short, good-looking fun.","reviewText":"Singularity is a decent game.

It's been done before, but this game does it with some style, and while looking pretty good too.The \"hook\" with Singularity is that early on in the game (well kinda early), you get a hold of this glove thing that lets you mess with time.

So, you can't like, slow time throughout the universe of the game, just specific items and objects.  But it's kinda fun. These time abilities are used to solve very simple puzzles.  Not many puzzles just like a handful, really.  Most of the game is running around killing stuff.The game is pretty linear.  Doors shut behind you and you plug onwards.  There's no real open-feel to the game.  Maybe a few secret areas.  But for the most part you continue on a set path.

How about stress in a game...","reviewText":"Before anyone trolls me or tries to correct me, this is my opinion for the game. I will start by saying that I played this for about an hour. I have a stressful job to begin with. This game is the epitome of stress. It's chaotic and ultraviolent. It starts off a little slow... But the transition is quick. It goes from slow to full throttle in about 5 seconds, and stays at full throttle for the rest of the game. It's like driving a nice scenic route on the California coastline, but at 200 mph. So you miss the scenery, you miss the immersion, you just hold on for the hell of holding on.It could have been more immersive. But the immersion is lost immediately. There are carnival games you can play and people to talk to in the first bit of the game. First bit being the first five minutes. However as soon as you pass through a certain gate, the mayhem begins.The enemy AI is erratic at best. You're under attack from quite literally everyone. Police. Firemen. Gun turrets. Religious Zealots. And everyone has a gun. Why you're under attack is silly. You're the Anti-Christ. You get a pistol and shot gun and everyone else has either an assault rifle or a flame thrower. You're basically screwed from the get go.There is no map. So you don't know where you're supposed to go. There is no sort of radar so the enemies have the upper hand no matter what. They outgun you in strength and numbers and you have no idea where they are. I get that some people may be into that sort of thing, but frankly I found it to be stressful and frustrating at best.The controls are janky as all hell. You aim your gun by clicking the joystick you move with. So you either aim by accident or move while you're trying to aim. There are no sights on your guns either. So you basically shoot from the hip even if you aim.Apparently you have psychic powers but using them is usually the result of pressing the wrong button thus using up the psychic powers and not having them available when you need them. I kept pressing the button that usually used for aiming (in EVERY OTHER FPS) only to find out that I've used up my psychic powers and now I can't hack that gun turret that's shooting me in the back.They gaming itself was so shallow that I didn't even care about the story. So don't ask.So I know a lot of people might read this and say that I suck at the game. In my opinion this game was just poorly designed. I played the first two Bioshocks. They were ok. They weren't great, but they were passable. This just pissed me off. I'm sure if this game came out 15 years ago, or for that matter 10 years ago, it'd be a great game and a classic at that.

{"product_name":"B003O6EB70","description":"","reviewerName":"The Martyr","summary":"Constants and Variables","reviewText":"Bioshock: Infinite rips you straight from Rapture and shoots you right in the sky.Having played the previous two Bioshock games I was skeptical on just how good this game could be. I mean, seriously, first Rapture now a city in the sky? All of my doubts were silenced.The graphics are simply THE best of all the Bioshock games, hands down. That being said as far as the design on actual people, at times, there is a lot to be desired. The level design is astonishing, I remember my breath being taken away whilst in the first area of Columbia. The voice acting is stupendous, with voice actors like Jennifer Hale, Mass Effect series and Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic series, and Kimberly Brooks, Mass Effect series. KOTOR fans you are in for a treat because Hale's character sounds oddly like Bastila. This game really took new, innovative combat and ran with it. There is a true variety of weapons and upgrades to said weapons are a great addition. The flawless integration of Elizabeth in combat is utterly brilliant. Elizabeth becomes so useful you begin to miss her when she's not around. The only area of disappointment of combat were the vigors. In previous Bioshock titles, it felt much more satisfactory to use them. (Yes I'm fully aware they are plasmids in the first 2 games.) What happened to the variety and originals of the first games? The vigors are available are useful but some are lacking. Majorly.I quite enjoyed the game play. The buying, looting, upgrading were satisfying to me. Something about working so hard to garner money then using it to make my gun more powerful, well, it was quintessentially bad ass.However, the real winner is the story. Compelling, uplifting, heart-breaking, anger inducing, thrilling, and chilling... Infinite's story can be all that; at once. Just like in the game's skylines there are many twists and turns. Every character is equally amazing. Pretty soon Elizabeth with have you falling in love with her, you truly begin to care about her. All I wanted was for her and I to go to Paris. I cannot mention characters without mention the Luteces. Those two made me smile every time their theme music began to play, they definitely were my favorites of the game.In many ways, Bioshock: Infinite is a departure from previous titles. But in many ways, it is the same. Constants and variables. Bioshock fans will NOT be disappointed. Within the game there were many homage's to Rapture, even returning to it briefly.I can say with all confidence that Infinite is game of the year material.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

Mizov","summary":"Fallout 3 + Left 4 Dead = Dead Island","reviewText":"My title is the best combination for describing the overall look and feel of the game. You have an expansive world that you can wander around and explore... and you have zombies. The island itself is beautiful, with a number of scenic vistas and some pretty good detail in the areas that have things to interact with. The story itself is essentially every zombie trope you can think of, so I won't even bother to go into it. If you're buying a game like this for the story, well, don't.There are a lot of mixed reviews for the game so far and I can definitely understand why. Some things in the game are straight up glitchy. Whether a character model freezes (though it makes the zombies significantly easier to kill) or you get stuck trying to jump out from behind some bushes, there are a few things that shouldn't have passed out of the beta for the game. The character models are also a little dated. They're nice from a distance but up close they remind me of Half Life 2 (and that game is a few years old!). My guess would be that they were trying to capitalize on the success of that trailer from April, but hey, for the most part, the game is good.I also wish I was able to go into more buildings and explore - I like taking everything that isn't nailed down. Fallout 3 was the same way when you came upon a random settlement, but the game worlds don't even compare in terms of size - so while it was okay not to go in every building in Fallout, it's not okay when there are only 20 bungalows near the beach.I've spent about 20 hours on the game thus far and I'm not close to finished, I enjoy wandering around, looking for collectibles and screwing around too much to progress the story very fast. There are a lot of things to find and side quests to perform to keep me entertained for quite awhile. If you're looking for a very fast paced game, I'd say skip this and go for a FPS (that and the fact that bullets are rarer than gold on this island).Killing zombies is always a blast, and turning on analog fight controls and giving a zombie a good side swipe to the head is a pretty fulfilling experience, haha. I wish there was more variety to the weapons, and I'd like the option to go a little gun crazy once in awhile. One quest reward was thirty bullets, that's how rare they are.At any rate, I'd say this is a game worth picking up if you'd like to have a weird melding of games. You like to explore, you like to kill zombies, but Dead Rising is too cartooney and Left 4 Dead is too frantic. That's really the target audience.PROS:Beautiful sceneryLots to exploreZombie killing mayhemCONS:Character models are blocky (like Half Life 2)Lack of gunsSome glitches, but nothing game breaking","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"MW3 is great fun but it is showing its age","reviewText":"I enjoyed finishing the Modern Warfare story a great deal.  As a shooter this is a solid title that delivers the goods with a lot of variety in weapons and levels.  The FPS is broken up by cutscenes and some in-vehicle combat and both are done well.Where MW3 starts to suffer is in the long-running storyline.  I just don't think it has held up over time.  After COD4, then MW2, and now MW3 I felt that the characters I was controlling just weren't making the story progress as quickly as I wanted it to and none of the progress I made was having a lasting effect.  When I finished MW3 I felt done and I'm not interested in carrying the story any further.If I had to point out the games other shortcomings I would mention that I'm tired of every cutscene ending with my character getting knocked unconscious.  My man must have some serious brain-damage after all these knockouts, crashes and crazy explosions.  Also, the game isn't bringing anything new the table.  It is a solid FPS-shooter but that is all.  It felt like more MW2 and not a stand alone title - I would have appreciated more character development, strategy, or something to make it feel different.  Others have already mentioned that the graphics are getting old but that isn't a concern to me as the game still looks amazing.In the end, if you have been wanting more after finishing up MW2 then this is your ticket.  If you, like me, finished MW2 and moved on then I would suggest renting MW3 to finish the campaign and try out some of the multiplayer gimmicks and then finding a more interesting title.Before I end this I can't do a COD review and not mention the multiplayer because that is what a lot of people are buying this for.  The multiplayer is just like MW2.  I mean, nearly exactly like it.  Some new guns, new killstreak rewards and some new game types, but nothing that I felt revolutionized COD multiplayer.  For most that is probably enough, but after a few hours of LIVE play I was bored.  If you were owning at MW2 then you'll tear it up in MW3 and live it.  If you get tired of being mowed down constantly by another player's killstreaks then the multiplayer won't be fun for you.FINAL VERDICT - MW3 is a solid 4-star game (and one of the champions of straight-up FPS) but fails to bring anything new to the table.  If you enjoy the kind of multiplayer that COD4/MW2/Black Ops deliver then you'll want to grab the next in the series to keep up with your online friends and enjoy all the latest maps and gadgets, but if you don't want to play this on LIVE then rent it for the 4 or 5 hours of campaign and return it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"When playing Crysis 3, I couldn't help but feel reminscent about Halo: Combat Evolved","reviewText":"Crysis series single player is what the Halo series should have turned into. In fact, playing the Crysis series for the first time was a lot like what playing Combat Evolved was like for the first time: original story, awesome open set-pieces, refined and fluid gameplay, and solid state-of-the-art graphics. Crysis 3 gives more of the same.Story is nothing substantial.  It is fairly short (depending how you play the game). Took me probably about 8 hours. Graphics are of course the best of the system. They don&#8217;t seem nearly as impressive as 2&#8217;s however. The set-pieces vary, but some in the latter stages of the game are more impressive than a few early on. In this game, the bigger ones seemed to be the better ones.The weapon&#8217;s look and feel are still the best of any FPS. There are plenty of decent weapons that vary greatly. All pack quite the punch and all are fun to use.  Probably the biggest addition is the bow. The bow makes the game significantly better moreso than I could have imagined. It is fun to use a weapon that doesn&#8217;t take up suit energy so it really enhances the stealth aspect of the game.Stealth has the same pitfalls as Far Cry 3. As a game that is supposed to have a huge stealth element, it isn&#8217;t always user-friendly. The stealth kills are temperamental perhaps as much as 2&#8217;s was, which significantly hampers the fun of the stealth especially if you are trying to flawlessly pass a level. This can actually get pretty frustrating. The other thing is over vigilant enemies. When out of cloaking mode, it will feel as if you are covered in fluorescent orange paint with a &#8220;Shoot Me&#8221; sign hanging 20 feet above your head. You could be in the bushes and an unaware enemy hundreds of yards away could start shooting at you. This makes stealth more binary than in most similar games. Overall the gameplay is still my favorite among stealth games. It allows for &#8220;quick&#8221; on the fly stealth and satisfying quick stealth-to-firefight (and vice versa) modes of fighting.A few other minor complaints are that the vehicle driving is a chore. The controls are way too tight and the PS3 framerate didn&#8217;t seem to handle the speed that well. The suit upgrades are not very good this time around. I actually found the first set of upgrades the most useful.Crysis 3 will could easily warrant another playthrough, but nothing else . It needs a better multiplayer to dethrone its competitors.  When accounting for the total value, I give it only 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Having a blast, its not Warcraft, and that's good!!","reviewText":"I've played my share of MMO's... Star Wars Galaxies, Star Trek, World of Warcraft, City of Villains and a number of others. I was very skeptical about this game after the Star Wars Galaxies travesty. But I had faith in Bioware and I'm glad I gave it a shot.The game is a lot of fun and worth pointing out that this is geared towards the folks that don't have 20 or more hours a week to pour into a single game. Now I'm a hard core gamer, but I don't want to spend THAT much time into one title to get any fun out of it. I play a lot of console games and didn't want an MMO that required countless hours just to finish up a character, ala W.O.W. This game really fits the bill nicely, and I love ALL of the classes, and yes I've played them all.The nice thing about the game is that you really enjoy the story and the process itself. In most MMO's, you just spend your time grinding up your toon so you can get to the end game and start your raids and getting the \"best\" gear--so you can go on more raids. This game takes a different approach and one that I really like. Its not quite as engrossing as Knights of the Old Republic, but its as close as anyone has gotten.The addition of companions is what makes this game shine. Its not always easy to find the time to play when your buddies are one, and this gives you a very nice alternative. The companions are well thought out and the voice acting is great.EVERYTHING is voiced over, which sets this apart from every other game on the market.There are a few minor complaints. First, the level of customization for your character's appearance is pretty poor. Add to that the fact that the empire races look way cooler, even when their is a republic version. For example, the Zabrak is available on both the Republic and Empire side. But they look totally lame on the Republic side and aren't given the same appearance options. All the good ones are reserved for the Empire side. The character models for the male characters are somewhat odd. They have these smaller guys, no problem, then this huge mountain of muscle, who's like a foot or more taller than the smaller guys, then the last model is this big fat, blocky looking thing. Where is a happy medium here? A guy that is in good shape but isn't necessarily 7 feet tall? Overall not a big deal, but worth mentioning.They also did a very poor job on the ships. What? This is Star Wars!!! Yes, while each class has his/her own ship, some of them are just lame. They all look good enough on the inside, which is what really matters, but considering the incredible bounty of ships they have to chose from, they really could have done a better job on some of them.Space combat, although somewhat limited, is actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Bioware as stated that they are going to expand on space combat in a \"very significant way,\" and I'm looking forward to that as well.Game play is fast, fun, and feels like Star Wars. The character animations and abilities are very well done and allow you to develop very different types of characters for your chosen style of play. Want to be a healer, tank, damager? They have a way to accomplish this with virtually all characters. So its not like--if you want to be a DPS god, you have to be one specific class. Very good variety.The economy is very limited right now. You don't start learning your skills until level 10, the problem is that by then you are way behind. You need to take some time out so you can level your skills up enough so you can make things that are useful to you. The problem is that to get these materials, you need to spend money to send your companions out of missions to get them. If you don't want to pay, you can go into the world to collect them yourself. The problem is that in order to collect a given metal, for example, you may be on a level 20-25 world, but its only giving you materials that can be made to create items for level 10-15 level characters. So what good is that? Also, since the game is so new, most folks aren't taking the time to develop the economy and build anything to sell, as they are spending their time leveling their characters. Most of the items you will see for sale are for higher level charaters, so lower level toons are often left out in the cold for most of this stuff.There is a great deal of running around in the game, and you dont' even get spring until level 14, and trust me by then you're going to be seriously irritated with all of the running around.Bioware has done nothing less than an incredible job in patching the game quickly and their response to the community has been amazing. I've had to call them once for a customer service problem and was stunned at how well they did. I called after hours, very late at night. My call was answered in less than 60 seconds and the gentleman who helped me solved my problem in less than 15 seconds. He almost seemed upset when I told them there was nothing else I needed help with! Hopefully they will keep up with the momentum and dedication to the game, because right now they are doing fantastic.I didn't play for the first month, so I can't comment on the launch. But I can say I've never experienced ANY server queues or lag of any kind--ever. I have had a few disconnections but even those are very rare and I've always been able to log back in immediately. All in all it is incredibly smooth for being so new into its life.

With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?KEY FEATURES:Not Just Another Hero&ndash; Brink&rsquo;s advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character &ndash; allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique. As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you&rsquo;ll have even more opportunities for customization.Two Sides to Every Story&ndash; Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players.Blurring the Lines&ndash; Take your unique character online at any time you choose!

The PSN crash last spring doomed this game, well that and the lackluster gameplay.You can only start a game with those who are your level or higher, so lower level players can't be addedto your session until they search for you.  I think a little more gore would've made this a more enjoyablekilling experience; there's not much realism, and you just feel like you're knocking down sterile, lifeless bots.The framerate's decent, only hiccuping occassionally.  The environments are flush with color, but lacking in definition.There's not alot of value (light/darkness) gradation, so when you walk into a dark corner, it seems really messed up.There are alot of ways to play in the world of Brink, but you may become frustrated when you're unable to accomplishyour goals.  I don't think I'll ever pass a couple levels, because they're so hard.  If I were playing with people online,it may be possible, but the AI is designed to dominate during certain points.  It really is useless to have a customizablecharacter, since this is a 1st person game, and I haven't seen a soul online in weeks.  Despite the gaming community's gripeswith this garbage game, I would how ever recommend Brink to those who like to mix things up.  There's a short varietyof guns to choose from, but once you see the best one and know your personal preference (rifle, smg, pistol or shotty),there's no need to use the others, unless you want to handicap yourself.  I was suprised to learn that weapon attachmentsare ONLY earned after completing challenge courses.  In summary, the designers of Brink chose to concentrate on character,skill and weapon customization instead of creating bad-ass gameplay (a real mistake).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}

This game is awesome on so many levels, it nearly defys description.  Not quite a platformer, not quite an RPG, dont call it a cinematic game, not a stealth game- it really belongs in a class by itself.  Yeah! I suppose you could call it an &quot;art house game&quot; if that can even come close enough.Beyond Good and Evil will consume you with its quirky sense of humor, towering intrigue and likable characters.  Hillys is a world that is fleshed out so completely that I want someone to send me a travel brochure so that I can book a trip on the next plane.  That is after the whole alien-invasion thing can be cleared up.This game is more suited to more mature players- not because of its subject matter- just based on its gameplay mechanics.  While not a true platformer, you are required to find objects and collect pearls and take pictures in order to advance the story.  Unlike a platformer you must sneak around, avoid detection, infiltrate government compounds and expose dirty little secrets about the Alpha Sections- the supposed protectors of Hillys.Oh, and you have to do all this whilst taking pictures of EVERY species of organism that inhabits your wonderful planet.  See, you dont get paid unless you take the pictures and send them to the science center.Without the money, how will you ever be able to customize your hovercraft and buy life restoring snacks and upgrades to your special attack and sensors to help you find even more goodies and animals?  See, photography really is profitable.And that camera of yours comes in handy to expose said government lies and provide proof that the Alpha sections really are up to no good...just shoot the photo, send it back to the IRIS network (secret underground association) and then the govenor will help you out as well...man!  More plot twists than a James Bond movie...This game is a wonderful addition to any library, but be prepared to spend some quality time with this bad boy...the story gets pretty deep and convoluded quite early on, and it only gets more twisty as you progress.  While the difficulty level is not off the scale, younger players will become frustrated quite quickly by the learning curve and objectives required...no hop-n-boping allowed through this game.I would suggest that anyone who liked Metal Gear Solid, Ico, and Jak II should pick up this game.  Like the above mentioned titles, this game spans many genres and does a wonderful job at holding its own.  Great game and definatley worth the money spent for it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"Much better than expected","reviewText":"I am a long time Splinter Cell fan, and in fact a fan of the entire stealth genre of games. So, when I first heard that there was a new one coming out, I was giddy with anticipation! As more and more info became available, including screenshots and game footage, my excitement began turning to a sense of dread. The game series I loved, was looking less and less like the game series I loved.The game appeared to be less stealth oriented, and more run'n'gun oriented. If I wanted to play Modern Warfare, I would play modern warfare. Still, despite my reservations, I ordered the game and gave it a shot, expecting to hate the game to pieces. That never happened. I loved the game, and the new direction it took!Yes, there is more emphasis on mowing enemies down in a hail of gunfire, but in most cases, that's optional. You can play the game a variety of ways: Ghost(silent and stealthy), Panther (Attack from the shadows like a ninja), or Assault(Pretty sure you can figure this one out). So, for the most part, you chose how you want to play things.I say &#34;for the most part&#34; because there are a few missions in the game, that require to to mow down your enemies, and in fact completely switches to a Call of Duty style FPS shooter. They are quick missions though, and not overly annoying.So, while I went into this game fully prepared to toss it to the side and never touch it again, instead I ended up playing it non-stop and completely enjoying the entire experience, Including online play(And I hate online gaming). Would I recommend it to other Splinter Cell fans who were hesitant with the game? Yes! In fact, I would recommend it to most gamers, since it has a very high replay value, and can adjust to your particular gameplay style.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}

Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"M. Warren \"gamer\"","summary":"Way beyond virtual dogs and cooking minigames","reviewText":"Another killer exclusive on the DS, Castlevania Dawn Of Sorrow impresses with great visuals, great tunes (crank up the score!), and alot more.  I would give a shoutout to Konami for not making another gimmicky game that is fun for about 2 weeks, then fall flat.  This game has more than enough to keep you busy for a while.  It's a great game for the DS, and works very well on the DS as well.  The magic seal mechanic is great, and with two screens, the top screen never has been more unique.  You can finally see the map or stats right there!  That may not sound like a very cool asset, but for the people who have been playing Castlevania since ever will find that so useful.  Since Castlevania's dungeons are easy to get lost in, it's alot easier to get around and the fact that you can see what exactly the stats are without pasuing is a great thing.  And besides, the lower screen is no longer flawed by anything taking up the beautiful scenery.I'll first start with the graphics.  One of the designers said that they chose to stick with the 2-D graphics because they felt that the DS is a great portable for expressing 2-D visuals.  The DS is WAY more powerful than the GBA, so with the power of the DS, they were able to create a lush, colorful, and eye intruging adventure.  Castlevania never looked so good.  Simply some of the best graphics I have seen on the system (for 2-D, anyway).  3-D visuals just wouldn't do justice, expecially with the blurry, stark, and blocky Castlevania game for PS1 (please excuse my lack for a name).Like I mentioned before, the sound is simply an audiogasm (grow up).  Great, and I mean GREAT, music for a handheld.  This game has a great soundtrack, and it's a soundtrack that I really enjoy along with Lumines and Sonic The Hedgehog.  Can't say much else.  The sound effects are good too.  Everything so far is sharp, and the presentation delivers.Castlevania has been renowed for it's presentation, but also because the game is very fun and addicting.  It's just fun to explore the castle and kill the many enemies around.  The enemies are not run of the mill, and the bosses are a sight to see. A stone hulk with a giant arm and laser beam eye, a massive floating suit of armor, and a puppet master that attacks with magic instead of attacks.  IT's creepy stuff, but the bossea re unique (the puppet master does not look anything that you porbally imagined before).  The core gameplay itself is snazzy.  Addicting hack n' slash and fast tactics, marred with totally awesome weapons and lot's of other gameplay goodies.  Addicting as a game on the console, Castlevania has enough fun with it to last you for at least a month.  It's solid, simple, but fun gameplay, littered with traps and a healthy dose of pure, jumping and sliding action.Any cons?  The fact that you can't save anywhere is annoying like Darth Kommisar said.  A thing that kind of wasn't cool is that there wasn't any real touch screen features besides the magic seal, but it's not so bad, because the game is so solid enough, and the two screens alone are very great.  IT's also a 100 new game in the series, so it will be a whole new game.  Cons or not?  You decide.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"A blast in single player and even more so online","reviewText":"Sam Fisher is back in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, the latest entry in the Splinter Cell series. First off, we'll just put it out there that Michael Ironside no longer voices main character Sam Fisher, a detail that will undoubtedly be disappointing to those who have been with the series since the beginning. It's a little jarring to hear this new actor in the role, Eric Johnson, as he comes off as a younger sounding Fisher, vaguely channeling Ironside. In all honesty, as sad as I am that Ironside is no longer voicing the role, Johnson does a good enough job that it's not a game breaker. In fact, this game is probably the best one in the series.Blacklist comes spread across two discs with the main single player campaign spread out over both and an installable HD texture pack that comes loaded on the second disc. The gameplay feels like a marriage of the best bits of the first few games in the series and the more action oriented stylings of Splinter Cell: Conviction, the last entry in the series. Stealth based gameplay is once again put in the forefront but you can still pull off the same cover switching and tag/execute moves that were introduced in Conviction. This is easily the best controlling game of them all and everything that Sam can do becomes second nature fairly quickly. It's a bit complicated but becomes very intuitive once you get it down. The graphics are pretty good but nothing mind blowing, which is interesting considering that the game comes with the aforementioned HD texture pack. The story is typical techies and anti-terrorist fare that gets confusing and overly familiar (especially if you've played any other Tom Clancy game) but the nerve wracking gameplay and scenarios more than make up for any shortcomings in the game's story.The multiplayer portion marks the return of Spies Vs. Mercs, which initially made its debut in Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow and would appear again in Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. It's easily the best feature of the game and makes for some intense player matches. What it essentially boils down to is a high tech game of rock, paper, scissors. Spies try to hack terminals and have a whole arsenal of gadgets and items at their disposal. The Mercs job is to stop them using their own gadgets and items as countermeasures to whatever the spies are using and vice versa. Blacklist mode ups the classic count of players from 2v2 to 4v4. You can still play in a classic format which is closer to the original way it played but in Blacklist mode, you have four spies duking it out with four mercs in what can only be described as mayhem mixed with scrambling around trying to pass itself off as coordinated stealth. It's a blast to play and the better you get at it, the more fun it becomes. It requires constant communication between teammates and when you get a room going where everyone is playing for keeps, you get multiplayer goodness that is a welcome departure from your typical first person shooter online madness. There's a high level of customization when it comes to tricking out your spies or mercs and making them perfect becomes an engaging affair. Some may say that hardcore gaming barely exists but Spies vs. Mercs is here to prove that it's not gone entirely.If you're a fan of Splinter Cell, rest assured that Ubisoft has done right by you. You get not just a solid single player experience but a phenomenal multiplayer one as well and a ton of replay value for your hard earned money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"MOGA Mobile Gaming System for Android 2.3+","description":"","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"Fun device that has its uses, but with limitations.","reviewText":"Your first question is likely going to be, \"Does this thing really work?\" and the answer is yes, it does work if you jump through some hoops. I'll explain those below.Your second question might possibly be, \"Can I use this with my iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad?\" and the answer, as far as I can tell, is no. Right now MOGA doesn't make an app that supports this device in iOS, but they have said they'd like to see it happen some day.And the most important question, \"Does it make games better?\" gets a solid Yes, with a few minor caveats.MOGA's Mobile Gaming System is well-designed in terms of hardware. The buttons are decent and responsive, the control pad is solid, and the whole thing feels pretty good in your hands. It folds down to a compact size and can be stored in the included bag. Is it convenient to carry around all the time? No, not in the slightest. Even compacted it's still a good-sized hunk of plastic in your pocket.My initial problem with the MOGA is that, out of the box, they require you to load up their application and acquire your games through their portal, MOGA Pivot. This is not an ideal situation. I can see that they were thinking of making themselves some sort of miniature Steam-like client for games, but it's just an awkward way to do things. Yes, it will detect existing games, but it kind of sucks to have to go through Pivot to start other games. It also means that you are encouraged to make future purchases through Pivot, which no doubt gives MOGA a piece of the action.But never fear! The Android community is on it! As others here have pointed out, an enterprising developer has released the MOGA Universal Driver. With this handy app, you can unlock the MOGA and use it with other games. Once you do this, the potential of the MOGA explodes.When unlocked, you're released from MOGA Pivot prison and can use the MOGA with your existing games. Emulators shine when being controlled by the MOGA. Platformers are a whole different game when you have a control cross and buttons. Even some driving games are better, since you can combine touch screen, gyroscope, and MOGA's buttons to get the exact control scheme you need.My recommendation is to grab one if you're a frequent Android gamer, and just toss it in your backpack, glove compartment, or wherever. Have it around for when you really want to play a game that requires real controls. If you're not a heavy gamer, this might be more than you'd care to mess with. If you're an emulator fan, the MOGA is almost a must-have accessory, though.I'm giving the MOGA Mobile Gaming System for Android 2.3+ a total of three stars. That's four stars for the general build quality, shape, and function of the device, but minus one star for the limited out-of-the-box experience and the requirement to use a proprietary gaming portal. I would have docked it two stars, but the existence of MOGA Universal Driver kind of makes up for the shortcomings.I would love it if the MOGA came with a control cross/D-pad, but alas, it doesn't. Still, for a compact controller, it does the job once you jump through a couple hoops.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles.

Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"God of War: Chains of Olympus.........","reviewText":"Sad but true, I've never played God of War before. I've heard so much about the game and, considering it has David Jaffe's involvement in its' history, you'd think I'd have already played it. Alas, I haven't. Yet, I see the commercial on tv for this game and hear rantin' & ravin' from my friends about the game, I decide to get the PSP installment. Man (or Woman, whatever the case may be..;)), I was missing out on this for this long?? This game blew me away. It's exciting, addictive and challenging. God of War: Chains of Olympus is simply put 'the best looking title' on the system, bar none, yet. I've never seen graphics look quite this good on the system. Honestly. If graphics can get any better than this on the PSP, I'll be amazed. The environments were simply breathtaking, nothing like I've seen before. Course, Ready At Dawn made Daxter visually appealing for its' time.For an action game, this game truly delivers. Especially where the story is concerned. Makes me wish some developers would make portable versions of some of my favorite games(like Shadowman, Bloodrayne, Legacy of Kain or Devil May Cry).There's plenty of bonus content in the game that makes playing through a few times more appealing but I have a problem with the game's length. It is just too short for this kind of game. I managed to get through it in a little over 8 hours. It is, however, a portable game so I have to take that into account. Memory restrictions and whatnot, withstanding, it should be understood.God of War: Chains of Olympus is a remarkable achievement on the PSP. It's a 'must-have' purchase for all owners of a PSP. This game just goes to prove that Ready At Dawn is a force to be reckoned with in the handheld world. I'm expecting great things from this bunch on their next game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2008"}

Graphics are good, music is good, and stage building is fun. On the other hand, some characters I liked were switched out for worse/weaker versions of them (Mewtwo was switched for Lucario who isn't nearly as good) or some characters got straight up screwed (Zelda/Sheik is no longer a 'medium weight' and therefore cannot take as much damage and sheik's attacks got WAY weaker though Zelda's got a bit better). I also don't like how some characters were taken out completely and never heard from again (Roy for example) and some of the stages as well (Castlevania stage and others). I can't say I don't like it but... they could have definitely included more and kept a few things they changed the same instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2014"}

I was already familiar with ESPN NHL 2K5 (which is an easy five stars), so I figured, can't go wrong here, right?Well, for the most part, nope. This game is, for the most part, great. Graphics are great, gameplay is fun and addicting, creating players for different teams is just as infectious as it is in every other sports/skating game I have, and it's fun to put it on \"Rookie\" mode and just walk all over the other team. (I won 101-0 last night!) The little details are really neat; before my Philadelphia game, a little cutscene of some Eagles fans at a tailgate party showed an RV with authentic looking Pennsylvania tags on it! Also, the computer recognizes some names (mine included), and if it does, the announcers will address you by name. Cool feature. The learning curve is pretty easy, and it's great for what it is, a simple, fun football game for the PS2. (The celebrity challenge feature is neat too... The Crib is interesting but I could do without it.)But, there's also a few issues... one word: FREEZING. The game freezes when I play with my favorite team, the Philadelphia Eagles, with the roster on. I found a way around this bug - don't load the roster. But still, I wish I could play with my created players. Also, when I create a team, and go into a game with them, if I try to go into the \"Substitutions\" menu, BAM! It freezes. Quite irratating.Another couple of issues: the commentators get really annoying after a while. They always seem to be in favor of the other team. When they get a few yards on you, they praise them and put you down. When you throw a 60-yard completion, they brush it off as luck. Grrr... also, let's not forget the challenges. Oh, the challenges. Sometimes, when you play against the computer, the other team challenges a play. This is really annoying because it ALWAYS goes in their favor. Another thing I could easily do without: two minute warnings. Last, but not least, just like real life, the refs make quite a few stupid calls. Last night I got called for pass interference... I replayed the play five times and there was NO, I repeat, NO pass interference!But, overall, this is still a really good, addicting football game, for a great price. Trust me, the great gameplay outweighs the cons here!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Katie \"Dark Musashi\"","summary":"Absolutely Breathtaking","reviewText":"If you loved Ocarina of Time as much as I did, this will make you happy.The graphics are gorgeous. The scenery is amazing. Everything looks beautiful, and the best part is it still feels like a Zelda game. They decided to revert back to the N64 Ocarina of Time/Majora's Mask style graphics (but much cleaner, of course) rather than the cell shaded Wind Waker. I like the realistic character design much more for Zelda than the cartoonish one from the other recent games.You can also get Twilight Princess on Gamecube, but the Wii version has some extra benefits. One such benefit is the interactivity. When you go fishing, you use the motion sensitive controller to cast the line into the water and reel the fish back. This makes it a lot more fun than the somewhat tedious sit-there-and-wait-to-press-A fishing game in Ocarina of Time. I'm glad they revamped the fishing and brought it back. Also, it is much more integrated in the gameplay than the last fishing minigame in a Zelda game (which was, of course, in Ocarina of Time). You use fish in sidequests and for other purposes.As far as the control, it feels very natural. You use one Wii-Mote and one Nunchuck together for it. You control Link's movement and targeting with the left hand and you use the right hand to move your fairy around with the motion sensor, and to supplement the left hand with looking around, that action button, and other functions. It's hard to explain without trying it yourself, but trust me, the controls are great.You start out the game with your horse, Epona. You also get the option to name both Link and Epona when you start your file, although I'm not sure if this will have any effect other than what NPC's in the game call you. Sometimes games use naming for codes (\"If you enter your name as ___, ___ will happen\" type things) but somehow I doubt it for this game. Anyway, the controls for Epona are great too. Just like Ocarina of Time, you can press A to speed her up and jump over fences. She is very beautiful and detailed too. When you make turns, you can see Link pull in the reins. You use Epona for many minigames as well as just getting around. In the beginnig of the game, for example, you use her to herd goats into a shed. It's a lot of fun, and horseback riding is another feature I'm glad they brough back.Also, don't worry if you saw Link with the weird goatherder outfit in all of the previews - he does get his original outfit later on. The dungeons are AWESOME. It's rated Teen, but Zelda games have never included inappropriate content in my opinion. You do kill monsters, but there is no realistic blood or gore, or suggestive themes. The rating says \"Animated Blood, Fantasy Violence\". Trust me, it's fine for kids. The action is all \"hero against evil\" type action. This game is a total blast, and both new and old-school Zelda fans will love it. Even if you've never played a Zelda game, try this one - it'll get you hooked.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

I like it!","reviewText":"Well, at first I was kinda wondering WTF. Where the heck did this game come from?! Environments and story line/plot is different. I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it. However, after about an hour of involvement, I finally got the 'gist'... and it's a lot of fun!!! Secret? Read: STEALTH!!! I've not finished the game, yet, and from what I've read, how you 'play' the game determines some end sequence. I probably 'killed' more than I should have instead of accomplishing more stealth progression, but then again that means high replay value. The 'Victorian' Steam Punk angle is pretty cool... and, of course, the game becomes more challenging the farther one progresses. And, thankfully, the 'Save' points are many and you can also save at any point on your own. Kind of refreshing, truth be told - instead of the typical 'alien' enemies. Also, the AI is VERY good! If you expose yourself even slightly, you WILL be noticed and 'dealt' with! For me, this is the kind of FPS I like to pop in and out of. Graphics very good, smooth controls on PC... sound also very good (note, I haven't used the word 'excellent'). For the price, and the game (which has been very under-rated)... and for those who enjoy FPSers... highly recommend!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2014"}

Berk","summary":"Pokemon soars into the next generation!","reviewText":"For longtime Pok&eacute;mon players the series&#8217; debut on the 3DS is like a dream come true.  This is in almost every way the Pok&eacute;mon game my 12 year old self was waiting for.The most important change is that Pok&eacute;mon are rendered in full 3D models, finally moving away from the series&#8217; traditional sprites.  Battles immediately remind me of Pok&eacute;mon Stadium on the N64 only shrunk to the palm of your hand (not to mention the superior graphics).I had the pleasure of visiting France the Summer before Pok&eacute;mon X/Y came out so immediately I was able to appreciate the Kalos Region&#8217;s design.  This new cultural aesthetic really feels like a breath of fresh air.A small, but appealing feature is the ability to customize your character&#8217;s in-game appearance through skin color, hair, and clothes.  This may seem like no big deal, but ever since I first played Pok&eacute;mon Blue I&#8217;ve wished I could edit the appearance of my sprite.  Game Freak has finally brought that feature and we can only hope they give us more choices in future titles.If Pok&eacute;mon X/Y has one weakness it has to be the story.  I know, I know, no one really plays these games for the story, but this game&#8217;s antagonists, Team Flair, really are a step down in quality.  While the teams have always been Saturday morning cartoon villains at least they threatened the protagonists.  Team Flair comes across as a group of incompetents rather than a group dead-set on changing the course of history.The game&#8217;s single-player campaign is also ridiculously easy.  A beefed up Exp. Share makes level grinding a thing of the past and more often than not you walk into every gym and Team Flair battle with a team that towers over the competition.  In short, I understand Game Freak wanting to cut back the hours typically spent on grinding, but if this device is going to become a mainstay in the series they&#8217;re going to have to level up the boss battles.Another thing that will bother veteran players is the lack of post-game content.  Once you&#8217;ve beaten the Kalos Region Pok&eacute;mon League there really isn&#8217;t much to do other than continue filling your Pok&eacute;dex.Those small problems aside, Pok&eacute;mon&#8217;s leap into the 3DS is a spectacular success sure to entertain old and new fans alike with its 3D recreation of the creatures we know and love.  For that it receives my highest recommendation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2014"}
