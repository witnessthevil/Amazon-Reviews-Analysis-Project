{"product_name":"B0050SVGU0","description":"Mario Party 9","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"The Last Wii Party","reviewText":"There is no doubt about what Nintendo is doing, pulling the plug soon on the Nintendo Wii, and putting its focus on the upcoming Wii U system. But when it has came down to mini-games, Mario and friends have always shown to be strong and fun for everyone. But it has been awhile since we've seen a Mario Party game come out. The last one came out was back in 2007 with Mario Party 8. It delivered the challenges and fun gamers expected from the franchise, and a mini-game buffet that was enjoyable. Yet, we haven't seen much of that from the Wii while other titles like Wii Party and Fortune Street tried to deliver. Yet, they haven't hit the home run that gamers have hoped for. Now, Nintendo has given the Wii one last party to throw and it is definitely worth money.Mario Party 9 for the Nintendo Wii brings the back to basics action longtime fans have hoped for from beginning to end with Mario Party, with a few new twists to the mix. The game features over 80 different mini-game challenges including boss battles and surprises that make a few new elements worth their while. The mini-games range from battles with foes like Lakitu and Bowser Jr. to mini-game challenges that will shake you from chopping wood in half like a lumberjack with the Wii-mote, to bowling for goombas, trying to score a perfect strike, all the way to scoring the most points for a pizza by hurling (throwing) toppings onto it. The boss battles are also exciting here from trying to shoot shells at cheep-cheeps to trying to make a strong roll without Bowser trying to knock you off the perch as you roll through his block party.There are also a few new elements to the game ranging from new characters like Kamek (Magikoopa) and Shyguy making their debuts on Mario Party, as well as a few board game elements here. One of them is that there are also a few boards like that range from the Donkey Kong Jungle Ruins, to Boo's Hanuted House, Koopa Beach where you could soak up the sun, while trying to capture mini-stars. The other big twist in Mario Party 9 is on the board, everyone will be moving at the same time when one player rolls and takes control of a party vehicle, challenging you to bigger excitement and even more challenging gameplay. The controls in the game are smooth with each and every game that test you in a whole new of gameplay. Overall, re-introducing new fans of Mario Party to a new generation of gameplay while for die hards re-challenging you into the fun. While I do honestly wish that there could've been online multiplayer action put into Mario Party, but overall it remains as strong and classic as you could honestly imagine with the fun.All in all, Mario Party 9 is definitely the last good buy for the Nintendo Wii, ending a 6 year run of innovation that Nintendo started, and changing the way we play video games by motion and fun for all ages. I have always loved Mario Party games from beginning to end, because they have brought out the fun of virtual board games for all to love since the first one came out on the Nintendo 64 in 1998. If you have been a longtime gamer of the Mario Party games, I absolutely recommend Mario Party 9. Even if you haven't yet played a mini-game challenge like Mario Party, than I definitely suggest you give this one last roll of the Wii dice.Graphics: B+Sound: B 1/2+Control: B+Fun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001YHX4B0","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"One Of The Best Action/Adventure Games EVER","reviewText":"So that you know a little about where this reviewer is coming from, let me say that action/adventure games are my sweet-spot when it comes to gaming, with the God Of War trilogy being my favorites. At least, until possibly now, with the introduction of BAYONETTA. There is quite a lot to say about BAYONETTA because it's a very highly detailed, intricate, and variably complex game (more on that statement in a moment), so I'll get right to it....THE GOOD :As I just mentioned, there is a LOT to Bayonetta. Proof of this is the 400-page plus Collector's Edition Strategy Guide that can be purchased for this game, and if you intend to go deep on it, it's a very worthwhile investment to make. However, if your intent is not to `go deep' on this game, it's built for that too. That's one of the great things about BAYONETTA - it lets you determine how much you want to get out of it and you can play to those levels of interest or not. I guess the first tangible thing that should be noted about BAYONETTA is the unbelievably intricate, complex, smooth and tight combat system the game employs. With any variety of melee or ranged weapons you can strap to both your hands and feet, the ability to slow time down with well-executed dodges, the absolutely STAGGERING number of combination attacks that can be performed and the items you can employ to assist you in your battles, the game truly has an imposing and almost endless number of combinations that can be employed to defeat your various enemies. And it's absolutely fantastic. After you've played through the game once (it takes about that long to REALLY get the feel of everything available to you and how to use it), then you start to get an idea of what this game can be. The designers made this game so that once you have mastered the controls, fighting styles, weapons, items, etc., that the act of doing battle becomes like an artistic ballet of death for your opponents. It's truly something to behold! Beyond  the centerpiece of this game, which would be the combat system, BAYONETTA, has some other impressive strengths. Not the least of which is the graphics and design. The levels, scenery and especially the design of the enemies is absolutely stunning. In the case of the enemies, which, in this game, are angels and angelic hierarchy, they are truly a wonder to behold. These are not your `humans w/ halos and wings' angels. These are truly wondrous, regal, spectacularly designed `heavenly creatures' that come in all shapes and sizes. Honestly, these are the most creative and interesting visual interpretations of angels I think I've ever seen. Truly fantastic! Equally as fantastic is the design of the main character herself. Speaking purely as a gamer-geek / fanboy (and just a guy in general ;-), it's hard not to like a hot, sexy, tightly wardrobed heroine whose clothes go flying off every time she executes certain types of attacks. The easily offended need not worry as there's no nudity in the game, but the game does have plenty of sexual innuendo, both tongue-in-cheek and not. Additionally, the game allows you to unlock (among many other weapons, characters and items) additional costumes for Bayonetta, some of which are quite revealing. Beyond the things I've already mentioned, there are other things to like about BAYONETTA, such as the fact that the game throws different methods of play at you instead of sticking with the formula and combat system you're used to using. There are entire verses that play like the old Afterburner game, there are shooting gallery sections at the end of each Chapter and other asundry methods and such thrown in. Additionally, there are other fun things you can do with the game like farm halos ( halos are the games currency and you'll need a LOT of them - read : millions - to buy things!) practice your moves on the load screens and use cheat codes to bypass unlocking some of the harder items, weapons and characters. There are many other positive things to mention about this game, however, like anything else, BAYONETTA is not without its' shortcomings, which brings me to .....THE BAD:Honestly, there wasn't much that I didn't like about BAYONETTA, and with the exception of one thing, all my beefs are rather menial. The one big thing that rubbed me the wrong way w/ this game (and I realize this is purely a personal thing) was that the enemies are angels and you spend the entire game brutally destroying them and other heavenly beings. Not exactly my cup of tea as it runs directly against my own religious proclivities, but I will admit that it is a rather unique approach (how often do you see the angels / heaven as the bad guys?). Beyond that one major gripe, there were a few minor things I thought could have been done better. For instance, you can assign certain items to your D-pad for easy access during gameplay, but you can only assign items to 3 of the 4 positions. That's a FAIL. Especially considering how unforgiving this game can be in terms of scoring. And speaking of that, this game is pretty difficult when it comes to scoring (if you even care about something like that in this type of a game - I really didn't)! Every item you use, every hit you take, every time you die GREATLY impacts your overall score for a chapter. And considering how difficult some of the fights in this game can be, it makes you wonder why scoring is set-up like it is, let alone in the game at all. Then again, it adds yet another dimension to your gameplay and, as I mentioned before, you can choose to play to that or not. So I guess that's a matter of perspective. Some other things that were less than stellar with BAYONETTA were the absolutely, ludicrous, inane and stupid plot and the long cut-scenes. However, it should be noted that you have the ability to quickly bypass the cut-scenes if you desire, so that's something of a plus, even though it's a good idea to watch them all on your first playthrough. Additionally, the game is unapologetically girly in certain regards (flowers underfoot when you run, butterfly wings when you jump, dance & jazz soundtrack) but nothing that bothered me personally. All in all it was kind of a decent change of pace from the testosterone fueled world video games normally exist in, but it's worth mentioning if that's not your cup of tea. Really didn't bother me at all though......As one last item of interest, I read a good number of reviews that must have come out around the time this game was released that stated that the load times for this game on the PS3 were painfully long and a lot of people were having problems with that. A patch to fix this has since been released and I have found there to be none of the problems that others were mentioning with the load times.THE BOTTOM LINE: If you're into action/adventure games like God Of War, Devil May Cry, Dante's Inferno, etc. than this game is an absolute, undeniable must-have for you. This game is very much the perfection of its' genre. And even though I'm WAY into the God Of War trilogy and I'd say those are my all time favorites, I can honestly say this game plays better than the first 2 of those (though not quite as good as the 3rd) and I almost like it better. Almost. But I just can't bring myself to say I like a game I've called unapologetically girly in certain regards and one in which you destroy angels throughout, `my favorite'. It's very close though - that's how truly excellent this game is!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2010"}

That being said, it is surprising that there was not an original Zelda for the Wii (Twilight Princess was a port) until the end of the console's lifespan. Like most fans of the series, I preordered the collector's edition, picking it up on launch day. Was it worth my $80? Well, sort of...Skyward Sword is, plotwise, the earliest known entry in the series. It starts like most Zelda games, with Link having no idea he is meant to be a hero - he's just that blonde guy. This time around, the hub of the game is Skyloft, a floating island in the sky, as well as its many smaller surrounding islands. Link is training to be a knight of Skyloft, and is close friends with Princess Zelda. It is this close relationship that breathes new life into the storyline of this game. Link has close relationships with multiple character's in the game, and it's great to see him some emotions other than neutrality. For the first time, you can pick Link's response to various people in the game in more than just a \"yes\" or \"no\" fashion. You can be sweet, or neutral, or friendly, or in some cases downright rude. Eventually Princess Zelda gets kidnapped (naturally!), and Link sets forth to rescue her - not because she is the princess and not just because it was requested of him, but because she is his friend and he cares.The graphics in Skyward Sword are pretty, but I feel they could have been done better. I has a cell shaded look, but isn't quite as cutesy as Wind Waker. Though Nintendo claims this art style allowed for them to place emphasis on enemy attack patterns and weak spots, I feel it is just their way of masking the fact that the Wii could only do so much.Gameplay is a little bit out of the norm for a Zelda game. Rather that is a good or bad thing is up for debate, but I found it to be a bad design decision. Rather than 1 largely connected overworld and 8 large dungeons, the overworld itself is full of minidungeons leading up to bigger dungeons. This seems cool in concept, but it makes the game feel very linear. The game makes heavy use a Wiimotion+ technology, and although I thought I'd never ever say this, motion control is the coolest part of this game. You can literally wield Link's sword! He will mimic your every action with the sword. Enemies have been designed around this concept, and as a result are kind of like little mini-puzzles. Certain enemies may need to be flipped, or hit from a particular direction, etc. For example, Deku-baba's have been redesigned so that they can open their mouths multiples ways. In order to defeat them, you must cut through their throat by swinging in the direction their mouths open. It adds a certain depth to the combat that the Zelda series has been missing. Other items using the motion controls use it very well also. for example, you can now roll bombs like bowling balls if you want, and the bow and arrow is aimed by \"pulling back the arrow\" while holding the wiimote vertically like a bow. The downside to all these cool combat features is that the game has become very combat focused (it even gives you 5 hearts in the beginning rather than the traditional 3). Perhaps some people enjoy that, but to me the Zelda series has always been about exploration and environmental puzzles. There are much fewer of those, and much more combat challenges.The linear minidungeon structure I mentioned earlier is primarily on the surface of Hyrule. While in Skyloft, you have the aforementioned floating islands to explore. This is done by flying on your loftwing, a giant bird that knights of Skyloft bond with at a very young age. On these many islands are various interesting characters and side quests to occupy your time. Much like the seas in Wind Waker, however, it just isn't quite the same as roaming Hyrule field. Unfortunately, you cannot fly at night time. If you try to fly at night, knights will stop you and tell you to stay on land until sunrise, claiming it is dangerous. While this makes the world seem a little more alive, and with laws in place, I can see no technical or gameplay reasoning behind nighttime flight not being allowed. Flight controls are simple, and work well aside from the fact that they can get tiring on your wrist. From the main island of Skyloft, there are many shops filled with even more interesting characters. Included in these is an item upgrade shop. When you kill enemies, they may drop spoils. These spoils along with rupees can be spent to upgrade your items - most importantly your shield. It's a neat system that I'd love to see return.This is the first Zelda game to feature a soundtrack fully recorded by a live orchestra. The problem is that, shockingly, the sound track isn't that memorable.This is very odd for a series that has long been known for and widely praised for its amazing soundtracks. Speaking of, if you bought the collectors edition, you received a 25th anniversary Zelda soundtrack CD and a Golden, tri-force themed Wiimotion+ controller(you also received the soundtrack CD if you bought a first-run copy of the game). The CD contains orchestrated recordings of various songs, as well as medleys of songs from various Zelda games. I love the CD and listen to it fairly often. The controller was also a nice edition, especially for those like me who did not already have a Wiimotion+ controller. Not to mention the huge box just looks cool on my shelf.Skyward Sword does a lot of things right while simultaneously doing a lot of things wrong. The interesting characters and their very eccentric personalities breathe new life into the land of Hyrule (and Skyloft), and the combat is well planned and fun. However, much what is the essence of Zelda itself was sacrificed for some of the new features. I had a good time on this adventure, and it one I will likely go on again someday. Even a mediocre Zelda game is still above the par of most other games out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

When the Gamecube was first announced it seemed that it would be a fierce competitor to the Xbox and the PS2. It had a nice variety of exclusive titles and sported a lower price than both other systems. Sadly over time, the majority of the exclusive titles went multiplatform.The Gamecube uses minidiscs instead of standard CD sized discs. This has its pros and cons. It gives GC games a faster loading time than the PS2 and Xbox but it prevents CDs and DVDs from being loaded into the tray. Minidiscs only hold 1.5gb of data while a standard DVD holds 4.9gb. This makes multiplatform games harder to put on the Cube since most games are around 3.5gb and the smaller size forces developers to cut out certain parts of a game in order to put it on the Cube. Now you know why you're seeing so many games that come out on both PS2 and Xbox but not the Cube. The choice to go with minidiscs ended up biting Nintendo in the butt just like their wild decision to use cartriges for the N64.As for the control design, the Cube's controller is pretty good. It looks awkward but is actually more comfortable than the Xbox controller. However, when it comes to controllers Sony has dominated that territory with its more simple, yet effective design.As for online gaming there isn't anything available other than Phantasy Star Online. A couple of years ago Nintendo stated that gamers didn't care about playing games online. They have since retracted that statement and ironically the Nintendo Revolution is expected to have online capabilities.As far as graphics go, the Gamecube has the edge over the PS2. The Gamecube is capable of Dreamcast quality rendering which the PS2 doesn't have and has 640x480 resolution like the Xbox and Dreamcast.The games department is where the Gamecube fails miserably. The Gamecube has a smaller library than the Xbox (even though they were launched around the same date) and the PS2's library trumps both systems. If you like lots of great fighting games, sports games, action games, or RPGs then look elsewhere. One can argue that there are some but for the past couple of years a lot of multiplatform games have just been passing over the Cube. Nintendo develops a fair amount of games itself for the system but the majority of the games are the same franchises that were around for the original NES in the 80s. Nintendo continually focuses on making Mario/Pokemon and other kiddie games for the Cube and continually ignores the tastes of adult gamers over the age of 18. Developers like Capcom, Sega, Square, and Namco have realized that the system sells poorly outside of Japan and are more reluctant to release exclusive titles for the Cube. As a result, many former Gamecube exclusives have jumped over to the Xbox and PS2. Over the past year the number of games being released on the Cube has dropped significantly. I hate to say it but it seems as if the system is already dying out and Nintendo's next-gen console isn't even close to being released yet.While it has better graphical capability than the PS2 and is more affordable than both other systems, the Gamecube has been crippled by its poor game library. I came up on the NES and SNES but with 2 failed systems in a row, I have to say that I will not purchase another Nintedo console. What really disappoints me is the fact that Nintendo just turned its back on the gamers who came up in the 80s and 90s (who made the NES/SNES sucessful) and continues to cater to the younger crowd.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Classic GameFan1991","summary":"Sheer Difficulty Ruins this One","reviewText":"I loved the Shinobi series, and its games were amazing thus far, but this one doesn't really live up to its predecessors, and on top of that, its difficulty can rip a metal grinder into shreds. I liked the fact that the main character spoke in Japanese, but anyways, to the important part here... Most enemies are exaggeratedly hard to defeat, and not even the original arcade Shinobi from 1987 was *this* punishing when it came to defeating enemies, and that is saying a lot, since I actually like the original Shinobi arcade game and the Revenge of Shinobi Sega Genesis installment. While I don't mind a bit of challenge, I definitely don't find being ripped to shred every time I play the game in seconds with that obnoxious game over screen my idea of fun.

COD 2 didn't even have artillery strikes, so you were in full control.  here?  not so much.  especially when you consider.... the GRENADES.  my god, the grenades.  they never end.  everyone gets one grenade, and you can even get 3 with a perk.  since they can be cooked now, you won't be able to avoid many of them, and you will have to dodge many more.  don't get me wrong - cooked grenades are overall a GOOD thing and far preferable to the retarded uncooked nades of COD 2, but this many grenades on maps this small is a BAD thing.  the ability to \"throw back\" grenades is mostly a crock - since most are cooked, you're almost certain to die trying to do that, so people don't even try it.  why didn't the designers think about this??another weakness - no room for snipers.  in past COD games, plenty of people would snipe.  in COD 4?  hardly anyone, because it's not worth it.  it's far too hard to kill anyone with a single-shot sniper rifle - hit them in the chest, and they LIVE!  and guess what?  since there's no health meter, your shot just did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  hooray!  it's far too hard to get a headshot because you have to get a more precise headshot than past COD games, plus sprint is enabled so people just run around.as if getting constantly naded, bombed and choppered weren't bad enough, there's also stun and flashbang grenades.  don't get me wrong - just like shooting through walls, it's very fun to DO TO OTHERS, but not so fun when it happens to you.  it's just another element of the game to make you feel like you're getting digitally raped!i'm amazed the creators didn't make BIGGER MAPS, as many servers have up to 15 people per team!!!  one map in particular, \"shipment,\" is so tiny it's just absolutely unforgivable.also - what the hell happened to capture the flag?????  now we get \"sabotage,\" which is cool, but quite hard to keep up with what the hell is going on.  every 2 seconds someone gets killed and drops the bomb - a voice announcer keeps telling you \"they set up the bomb\" or \"they dropped the bomb\" but everything moves so fast, it's impossible to keep up with.  that announcer needs to go!!!!!!  in addition, the target location changes every time, and you have to keep looking at your map to know where to go - this game totally revolves around following a map.  not very fun.speaking of the map, the radar thing sucks.  the idea was that when a player gets 3 kills in a row, they can enable radar which shows their team the enemy's position on the map - this makes it a lot easier to kill because you know where everyone is.  this is a pretty good idea, except RADAR IS ALWAYS ENABLED, so how the hell can you call it a \"perk\"?  it's one of those ideas that is good in theory, but bad in execution.  how realistic is a war where you know where every enemy is??  not very.speaking of radar, there is a \"hardcore\" mode that some servers use that cuts out radar and your map, and your weapons display.  however, this is even more frustrating because it doesn't show you what weapons, grenades and special weapon you have.  what the hell??  that's not \"hardcore\" - that's stupid.anyway COD 4 is overall a wonderful FPS game and one of the best ever created SO FAR...  yet still i've played COD 2 just to get away from all its frustrations.  i'm sure just like COD 2, they won't make any additional maps, so we're just stuck with the tiny maps, blowing each other to hell all over the place.  it's a great game - but it's sad it could have been so much better.  the custom designed weapons is a great feature, but unfortunately you can't design weapons while playing a game, and you only get 5 slots.  i would have liked an on-the-fly custom weapon design feature.one more thing - if you like a particular game type, it's hard to find a server that only playes your game type.  many servers have a rotation of search and destroy (which i hate) and domination and sabotage (which i like).  there's no way to \"weed out\" these servers in the server browser.also nightvision is ugly as hell and nobody uses it.  i don't know why they included that crap.  my final verdict:  play COD 4, but stay away from servers with more than around 7 people per team.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"This is how you do HD upgrades right","reviewText":"IcoThe Good: Nice HD upgrade, clever level and puzzle design, leading Yorda around is a great mechanicThe Bad: Janky animations and mechanics, Yorda's AI is really dumb, not much of a story, can be beaten in 4 hours, too much backtrackingIco is probably one of the most forgotten games in history. Being one of the first graphical powerhouses for the PS2, it proved that you don't need a complex story and characters to have a good game. All you know is that you are a boy named Ico who is trying to save a girl named Yorda from her evil mother queen and escape from the castle. You enter as a captured prisoner because you have horns. You then escape and find Yorda along the way. What made Ico such a big deal was that you led her around manually by holding R1. This forced you to become attached to her, and they rarely spoke.This game was way ahead of its time. That's probably why people passed it by for Jak & Daxter and other PS2 games at the time. The game consists of some pretty cleverly designed puzzles that involve pulling switches, climbing, cutting ropes, and swinging on chains. You also push and pull the occasional block. The level design is really well done, but there were a few obscure puzzles like jumping off of a chain to knock a bridge down. This is completely against the game's mechanics so you would never know to do this. Leading Yorda around sounds annoying, but it prevents you from having to rely on the already shoddy AI. The game mechanics work well enough in design but they are sloppy and frustrating to deal with.When you jump Ico tends to clip into ledges and ladders making you have to slightly adjust him until he latches on. If you press the analog stick just slightly and jump he will jump 20 feet causing you to jump off ledges or fall down to your death. There's just so much bad collision detection and the animations are janky and not well done. When you drag Yorda around her arm looks like a flopping noodle that can go through her body. I know this was originally designed for PS1 before the game jumped ship to PS2...but still. There are other mechanics like setting your sword down to pick up a giant stick, light it on fire, then set off a bomb. Some times you have to toss these before they blow you up. Fun game mechanics and all but they repeated through the entire game making you be grateful for the short length (just about 4 hours).A lot of times I didn't know where to go because the middle of the game has two areas that are identical, but just slightly different. The constant backtracking can confuse you requiring a walkthrough. There are no boss battles to speak of except the final boss, but the combat is so frustrating and annoying. Ico swings his sword around aimlessly and you can't move while doing so. The AI jumps away as soon as you run after it so if you get stuck in a three hit combo you get knocked down and Yorda gets dragged away. You can't die in this game during combat, but if Yorda gets dragged underground you're done. You can pull her out of the hole, but some times a shadow creature will hit you and knock you back then you have to suffer the long animation of getting up. A lot of games had these animations (The Mark of Kri) and I don't know why. It breaks the fluidity of everything. Once you get the hidden mace in the game combat is really easy, but you still get annoyed by the creatures constantly backing up when you approach.The graphics look great with the new HD upgrade, but even back then they were amazing. A lot of textures have been slightly upscaled and some bloom and HDR has been added for better lighting. You can still notice the game's age during up close shots of areas. Textures are muddy and so blurry they don't even look like what they are representing. The main thing is that you can pan the camera around more now that the resolution has been bumped up making navigation easier. This is how you do HD upgrades right.Overall, Ico is a great game, but the dated mechanics really show their age. If you can look past all this you are in for a great, albeit short, game but don't expect engaging characters or a complex story. There are 4 cut scenes in the whole game, but this is about the journey and not the story.Shadow of the ColossusThe Good: Fantastic graphics, slaying each colossus is exhilarating, beautiful atmosphere and visuals, touching endingThe Bad: Not much story, pretty short, frustrating controls and game mechanicsI have been wanting to review this game forever, and now I have the chance. I played this back in 2005 when it first came out and it was just unreal. SotC still has some of the best graphics to grace the PS2, it almost looked next-gen at the time. Of course it suffered from massive slowdown, but now we can play it with some extra graphical effects and at 60FPS. There's not much of a story here, there never is with Famito Ueda's games. You are a boy named  Wander who brings a girl to a temple, a cursed land, and vows to destroy all 16 colossi in order to bring her back to life. The game has one of the most touching endings I can remember.The game is very basic, you just head to each colossus and slay it. There is a huge open world, but it is very barren and void of life, but that's the away it is supposed to be. You feel very alone and helpless in this land of brown and gray. You have two weapons, a sword and a bow. You can hold the sword up to the light to guide you to the next colossus which really isn't that hard. Once you find it you have to figure out how to get on top of it and that's the tricky part. Each colossus is completely different. Some are tall, some are fat, some are the size of a lion. These lumbering beasts will attack, but you need to find their weak spots. One colossus has weak spots on the bottom of its feet. When it walks you need to use your bow and shoot it. It then falls over and you can jump up and grab its fur and start climbing. Some aren't so easy, in fact there are no hints on how to get on top of these beasts. One tricky water serpent requires you to swim over him and then his tail will come out of the water so you can grab it.The best part is when  you get on these things. Each colossus is like a level in itself. You can to climb around and hold the R1 button to stay on. They will try to shake you and your window to actually stab the glowing weak spots is really small. You have a stamina meter and when it depletes you let go and fall back down. This can be really frustrating if getting on top of the colossus is already frustrating or a long fiasco. As you slay these monsters your stamina and health increase, but you still need to watch out. The worst part about the game are the God awful controls. They just suck and the game mechanics are sluggish and unresponsive. If it weren't for this the game would be perfect. Wander's animations are a bit jerky and when the colossi shake you and your stamina is dropping you just want to charge your stab and kill it, but sure enough you get shaken again right as you start to charge. Wander flops around and it just feels sluggish. When you try walking on the colossus Wander will fall and tumble, some times right down to the ground. I almost threw my controller several times because of this. You will mainly die because of the mechanics, not your skills.Let's talk about your horse. Aggro is a main character, but I felt like I was driving a Mac truck. He won't move if you push the stick forward, instead you have to mash X and it takes forever for his momentum to get going. You can only tap the stick left and right to steer him, but he moves too quickly and runs right into walls, which he then stops on a dime and turns completely around. Maneuvering through tight areas is a serious pain. The horse controls are just terrible. This is probably the only bad part about the game, there is nothing else like this game out there. The colossi themselves look fantastic and are just gigantic. You really feel helpless and wonder how you are going to take this thing down. It all adds to the foreboding atmosphere of the game, the loneliness and helplessness that you feel throughout.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"D. VASQUEZ","summary":"great game and certainly much better than some are indicating","reviewText":"I played the original dragon age, and the awakening expansion, and as everyone else i agree it was great very enjoyable. Now having played the sequel i can say with certainty that this was just as great, just a different flavor, and a very welcome one at that.I'll go into detail with each category and then i'll address some not so positive reviews out there, among them the 8.5 IGN review, which i disagree with.GRAPHICSThe game has great graphics, they are a wonder to see overall. One of the best aspects of the visuals is how they designed Kirkwall, it just seems like a huge city, and considerably awe inspiring, specially when you visit special areas like the Keep, the Chantry, among other places, they produce a feeling of grandeur, as if you're actually going into someplace important, like the lord of the rings white city for example. You see many guards everywhere, they've done this in such a way that you can just stand there watching, feeling as if you're in Queen Elizabeth's castle or something. Another positive graphics wise is that the game is much more fluid than the original, i'm amazed to say it even ran smoother for me than the original, that's something to commend.STORYNow here is where some of the negatives are being produced by some people, and where i disagree with most. People feel like the story is lackluster just because there isn't a huge threat that is the focus of the entire game and that you have to defeat, as opposed to some, i believe this is a huge bonus. I mean how many times have we seen the same huge threat approach in a fantasy game?, and particularly with dragon age, by the time i was done with awakening, i was so tired of the darkspawn threat, i honestly didn't want to see it again. In the original even, i found myself enjoying the political struggles very much, even more so than the actual threat, well here you see a much higher dose than that, as the game goes through different periods of time in the city of kirkwall, and how you fare within the political struggles that plague it, this is done very well, and after you finish the game, you get a feeling of growth and development in terms of character and story, your main char and companions are certainly different than that first day when you stepped into the city. Again i cannot stress how effectively this was done. Of course i was hoping for a different ending to be honest, but it doesn't really hurt the overall story.CHARACTERSThere are plenty of interesting characters here, as in the original, and also there are some which you wouldn't mind killing, as all RPG's will always have, it balances itself out very well overall.GAMEPLAYThe fighting mechanics have been considerably revised, the pace is much faster now, and animations are much much better, whether you are a fighter or a mage, you will see a lot of character specific animations that will make crushing people a lot more enjoyable. Traveling between areas is a breeze. Leveling system is also great, makes much more sense than the first DAO, there are some things that have been removed, like dual wielding for warriors which has caused some stir in some fans, overall i believe despite some modifications, the general fighting mechanics are excellent, and i enjoyed them very much.DRMNot much to go into here, DRM sucks, but i want this review to be focused on the story so that is what i'm basing my score on, DRM is more of a general info for you people out there who hate it as much as i do.Again going into what some people are criticizing, i think the major complaint is the lack of a \"darkspawn threat\" kind of story, and to that i say, it just gets old after a time, Bioware wanted to do something different instead of beating the same dead horse they already beat with awakening, and i believe they succeeded at that. Also in the IGN review i mentioned there is talk about how everything is happening only in the city and how the lore of DA is big enough that they should've used more locations, this in fact is not so, there are many events that happen outside of the city, even a journey into the deep roads which most of you may remember from the first game. There are many locations that are explored outside of the city, but i have to say i wouldn't have minded if they were only in the city, cause it is really a gem to be enjoyed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2011"}

And its even harder to join with a friend - the 'play with friends' menu is completely broken. It's been days and every time i try to join a game I get the error 'the ea servers cannot be reached' (all other games work flawlessly). Also, the singleplayer AI is absolutely awful, and the game is so scripted that it's almost annoying. So, if you're looking for a good multiplayer, go elsewhere because the multiplayer doesn't even work. And when you do get to join a game, the play is pretty shallow and the progression/rewards are laughable compared to other games. If you want a good singleplayer, go elsewhere too.

Pick Your Destiny? Yeah Right...","reviewText":"When I first got this game, my impression was that you had many choices to take and once you choose them, you have no way to turn back, making it more realistic since a lot of things in life work in a similar fashion.However, this game isn't at all what I thought. It's a great first time play and I was pretty addicted to it until I realized a few things:1. You can simply master all of the melee attributes and magic abilities. So doesn't matter which you chose, you can just end up mastering both and messing with both a sword and be a full master at magic as well. So what's the real choice in choosing when your character can be everything, there's no real choice, eventually almost everyone will have a character that is pretty much the same...2. Marriage is a joke at best. They all act pretty much the same and there's no real reward to it....not much of a plus to the game.3. The game makes you think there's a lot of different paths to choose from but they all come back to the same point and the paths are not very far from each other, almost to the point of saying it is almost insignificant.4. Bad guy or good guy? Pay the homeless guy and you become a good guy extremely fast, just like that....so don't let them fool you with that little gimmic.This is a neat game so it'll take a few rentals until you can finish it. Just buy it and sell it back if you want. Online gaming for this is a joke as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2009"}

It works perfect. Slightly lighter than the wireless controllers, but he never has to change batteries, and the responsiveness of the controller never fails over some wireless connectivity issues between the controller and console. Although there is a cord, it is a decent length and more reliable than the wireless controllers we've gone through over the past few years. I do recommend buying some velcro straps and making sure that you follow the contour of the cable when wrapping it up and storing it. Many times people roll the cords however which pulls on the connections and damages the ends. Thats why most wired devices fail. If you take care of it better than that, the controller should last you a very long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Kang","summary":"Lies and deception of freedom","reviewText":"--Some minor spoilers in the review ahead--Yes, the title suggest comtempt and perhaps anger, yet I give this game a 4, a rather high rating.  Odd?  Perhaps.Regardless of the little unexplainable 'nerfing' of the jedi (lightsabers are just another melee weapon), I've had fun playing this game.  To finish takes around 20 odd hours.  I've now played thru it twice.  Yep 40 hours gone and never to have back.  Regrets?  Some.Why?  Well, I now realize how woefully linear the game is.  The choice they give, the apparent freedom to do what you want is all a facade.  No matter how high your skill, there are some doors that you can't pick, some people you can't pursuade, and some NPC whom you cannot kill.  The game gently pushes you this direction and that.  When you go back to replay the game, you try your best to see if there is another route that can be taken.  None.  Play the game once, and you can see and do all there is.  There isn't any place unlocked by the choices you make, and no special dialogue unavailable because of how dark or how light your alignement is.t's quite silly, some of this restriction.  Take, for example, Calo Nord.  The bounty hunter you meet early on.  When you try and fight him when you see him at the Cantina, you're dead.  one shot from his blaster, no matter how high your VP (I cheated and had 600vp and 40armor when I tested), and you die.  But later on, when you have to meet and fight him, he is an easy target.  Yes, yes...I know the story was written for Calo Nord to come after you later in the game...but still.Hmm...I never meant for this review to be so negative.  But I'm just disappointed that a potentially GREAT game turned out to be just a good game.  I did enjoy the twist in the story that you find out near the end.ps - I enjoyed the dark alignment ending more then the pitiful light side ending.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2003"}

The single player campaign is fun, long, and lets you play with up to three buddies, which is always a big plus for me. Even the competitive multiplayer is pretty fun, and I don't typicall enjoy that too much.The big complaint I have about the game is the standalone coop mode, which they really could have made better. In other Tom Clancy games, you were able to utilize Persistent Character Creation, but not in this case. You have to take the weapons they give you at the start of each round, and you don't get to change your character or customize loadouts in this game mode, only in competitive multiplayer. But what really bothers me about it, is that you have to \"defend\" a location that really limits your mobility and just cuts down on the fun. They have implemented it poorly. If they had removed that requirement to defend a fixed location, it would be so much more fun.

Most games suffer from trying to take the PC/Mouse controls and set them up on a system controller.  Or suffer from the limited graphic capability on systems.  (Or are like Starcraft on the N64, one of the very worst PC to console ports of all time, and the last time Blizzard tried to do this).I'm happy to report, Diablo III bucks this trend in a BIG way, and is a must-purchase for RPG and loot fans.Controls can't get much simplier then what Blizzard accomplished on the PS3.  Move with the left stick.  Look around with the right.  Attack buttons are mapped to the face buttons on the controller.  No gaming mouse required!  You'll get into the flow of battle and wonder how you ever survived using a gaming mouse or keyboard; it's that intuative.Naturally, the graphics do take a hit, but it still looks better than you would expect a port has any right to.Another thing you will notice is the Inventory interface is a little clunky, but that's a minor gripe.If by some chance you've never played any Diablo games, it's a very simple concept.  Slash and hack anything that gets in your way.  Mix in a little magic.  Grab the loot that drops at random.  Rinse and repeat.The bottom line is this game has at least 30-50 hours (or more) of gameplay and if they release the PC expansion as DLC you can take another 5-10 onto it as well.As I stated in the open, most PC to console conversions are poor or worst, a complete abomination of the game.  Diablo III is neither of those, and if you're the type who love Borderlands for the loot, you will adore Diablo III as well.The grades:Presentation: 8Graphics: 8Controls: 9U/I: 7Replability: 10Overall: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Christopher M. Shatto","summary":"Fun at first, then just drudgery","reviewText":"Dante's Inferno is a loose adaptation of the first part of the epic Italian poem The Divine Comedy. In this re-imagining of Dante Alighieri's descent into Hell, Dante is no poet. Instead, Dante is a warrior and a damned soul. After joining the crusades under the banner of King Richard Dante finds himself doomed to Hell for his sins. Worse, his murdered love Beatrice has promised herself to the devil as a result of Dante's sins.The game starts out strong with incredible artwork that paints a disturbing picture of the realm of the damned. Dante climbs walls of damned souls, battles unbaptized infants, and rides the ferryman Charon across Styx.The battles on the way play out almost exactly like God of War, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Chaining a string of light and heavy attacks together you tear through the minions of hell in a sickenly satisfying manner. By collecting souls you can purchase upgrades for Dante's attacks and by absolving enemies of their sins or punishing them instead you can gain levels in holy or unholy which allow you to purchase even more advanced attacks and skills. Graphic cinematic kills are achieved through your standard quick-time sequences (press this button, now that button, now the other button).You can also upgrade Dante's weapons by collecting hidden relics, interact with historical and literary damned souls, and follow your guide, Virgil, as he helps Dante toward his final goal: Beatrice.The problem is that the game, while strong at the start, peters out awfully quick. By the lust level the game just becomes an exercise in frustration. Annoying jumping \"puzzles\" and unclear objectives, complicated by a fixed camera that often obscures key parts of the environment or focuses on irrelevant pieces of it, become the norm. Swinging from weird, fleshy ropes is fun the first time or two, but after you've fallen off the same one for the dozenth time because you can't see where you're supposed to go gets old pretty quick.Worse, puzzles later in the game serve little point beyond being artificial obstacles to slow your progress. For the most part, they involve moving an object somewhere on the screen, pulling a lever, seeing what happens and making a note of it so that after you die for your failure you can do it right the next time.Battles, particularly boss battles, function the same way. You go in, get beat to death while making notes of what to do next time, then do it. They also become particularly frustrating later in the game as it begins throwing large numbers of enemies at you and then expecting you to not only deal with them, but also quickly move to new parts of the screen to interact with levers and other objects. It's not difficult, it's just cheesy.Overall, Dante is an \"okay\" game. If you haven't played God of War you probably won't be too disappointed; but, since, mechanically, Dante is little more than an unapologetic God of War pretender, and a mediocre one at that, veterans of that superior series will probably just find Dante ultimately an annoying and pointless game after the first two hours or so. In that case, maybe just rent it, play through the Lust level, then hit Youtube to see the rest of the game and save yourself the trouble.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"ChomskyKnows \"ChomskyKnows\"","summary":"One of the best games for original xbox","reviewText":"This is probably in most xboxers top 5 somewhere below Halo. Excellent new engine now used in next gen games from ID and others (Prey, Quake4). Game looks gorgeous.Weaknesses are thin story (though this franchise never had or needed one in the past), no offline co-op, no wide open spaces as with original Doom games (though they may be trying to give a clausterphobic feel), not enough Hell levels (but the game is enormously long). But these aren't enough to keep it out of 5 star territory. I'd give it 4.8/4.9 if possible. The flashlight thing people make a big deal about didn't bother me as much as others - they are obviously trying to increase the scare factor by doing this.Very good job by the folks that started the FPS gaming innovation, ID.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2007"}

Moreover, by setting up a GOG account and simply entering your game's serial number you are also entitled to a digital backup of the Enhanced Edition for FREE (that is a 15.6GB download, plus 2.8GB for all the extras). Why all this? Because these guys truly respect their customers. And yes, the game is DRM-free and the patch contains all the DLCs! However, if you do not yet own this masterpiece of a game, please read on._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________In 2007 a small Eastern European game developer (CD PROJEKT)...teaches BIOWARE how to use their own Aurora engine. The originalWitcherwas the game thatNeverwinter Nightshad promised to be. Two years later BIOWARE picks up the glove and comes back with a strong response, the masterpieceDragon Age: Origins. Unfortunately, its 2011 sequel does not live up to expectations. And this is all the opening the perfect sequel needed to come in and, once more, steal the show.THIS IS HOW TO MAKE A cRPG SEQUEL!Although there may be Xbox and PS3 versions of this game later on, this is a game designed from start to finish for the PC. In an age when 5-6 years old consoles set the standard this is very important. From the brand new engine to the very last script line, everything that could be worked on was and everything that could be improved shows improvement.  The story is now even deeper; the graphics are several notches higher; character development has been both streamlined and more balanced; equipping Geralt is now more detailed whereas loot is abundant.It is possible (although not necessary) to import your character from the first WITCHER. If, like me, you liked the original game, you will simply love the sequel.LOOK AT THE SKY: IT IS THE WITCHING HOUR - EVERY HOUR!The graphics are simply A-MA-ZING! I like the way the rock formations catch the moving shadows and how the wind stirs up dust. I like the subtle movement of the grass and the exploding colors of the wild flowers. I like the textures of the clothes, the shine of the armor and the glint of the swords. I like the way the sun gets in your eyes and the way rays of light play with the tree foliage.What is also important, these graphics and dynamic lighting are achieved even on medium-built systems (Minimum specs: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2GHz/AMD 2.5GHz, nVidia 8800/ATI 3850, 1GB of RAM for WinXP/ 2GB for WinVISTA&7).Even more impressively, the game is set in a day/night cycle, and this is reflected not only on the levels of ambient light but also on the activities of the surrounding world.THE WORLD AROUND YOU COMES TRULY ALIVERemember how in most RolePlaying games approaching a Non-Playing Character (NPC) usually means he or she would utter any one of a small number of preset phrases? After a while, you have heard them all and it got very predictable. Well, prepare to be surprised. Again and again.This is a world you will truly be immersed into. A world that wakes up, goes to work, gossips, bickers and barters, and unwinds in the tavern. Walk the same streets at night and they are eerily empty. And that is without taking into account the ever changing weather!The immersion is so total for yet two other reasons: not only is the world fully open from the very beginning (no blocked areas or closed bridges!) but there are no loading delays between areas (only between chapters).THE LIFE OF A WITCHER IS NEVER BORINGGeralt is a real warlock, combining a mix of sword fighting with potions and spells. These are the three main character developing trees, Swordmaster, Alchemist or Mage. Sword moves, potion ingredients and spells can be combined - and all choices are meticulously balanced.With the original WITCHER it took me a while to master the timed sword-strokes - but it was really satisfying after that. In the sequel, sword-fighting has been simplified to the classic mod - and that is one of the gripes I have with this game. The other is the short dialogue options. I like my cRPGs wordy.Now, the story is far from being linear. Choices matter and choosing a path will bifurcate the story, most of the times irrevocably. And the story in WITCHER 2 is as important as the fighting.What I also appreciated was the return of consequences. Those of you who have played BALDUR's GATE Saga know that bashing or picking the lock of a chest was a punishable offense if anyone saw you. In contrast, in DA-O you could rob the town blind and (quite unrealistically) the NPCs could not care less. Well, in this game, your character better behave or face the ever vigilant guards.ADJUSTED TO OUR ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF BINDINGMost retail versions of the game came with a simple disc-check, implemented by SecuROM. If you own FALLOUT 3, for example, you have experienced the same thing. Compared to the customer-abusing schemes out there (UBISOFT's and 2K GAMES' ears should be burning at this point) I found this solution not ideal but palatable. However, it gets better, much better.The game is now DRM-FREE because all traces of SecuROM have been patched out by the developers themselves from day one. They chose to face ATARI's lawsuits in order to show their customers respect. Now only the STEAM version has DRM.THE WITCHER 2 gets full marks in my books in this aspect as well!Just for listening to its customers and doing this CD PROJEKT earned a permanent place of honor in gaming history.A FINAL SPELLI have only praises for this magnificent sequel to a great game. It was one of the rare cases when I pre-ordered a game before I knew anything about it and was rewarded with a game that exceeded my highest expectations.  I do have some advice for the game developers though.First, keep showing the same respect to your customers and you will see that gamers know how to repay this with equal respect and loyalty. And finally, when the mega-publishers show up at your door with their mesmerizing bags of money, try to remember what happened to so many great game developing groups in the past that did not resist to temptation.The game will get a complete overhaul in April when the Enhanced edition will be released. However, because CD PROJEKT is a gamer's company (and not some greedy multinational), as owners of the original edition we will be able to download the Enhanced edition Patch from the official website - for free. As are all the DLCs by the way!WITH MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

No easy way to get the lint off of it.* Have to buy vertical stand if you want to stand it up on end.* Cannot play MP3 or import CDs (i.e., no music player other than Music Unlimited) -- can be fixed with update* Forced to use Music Unlimited from Sony* Limited apps (Hulu, Crackle, Netflix, Amazon Video and, of course, Sony's store)* No Pandora, Amazon Cloud or any other music apps* Average launch titles* Downloading from the Playstation store is hit or miss. It especially doesn't work correctly when using Netflix.  When downloading fails, it just leaves it to manually retry.* Quirky interface is quirky* Hard to tell exactly how to get a game installed on the hard drive. For example, putting a game disk into the drive lets you start the game almost immediately. After launching the game, a notification pops up to say that the installer is ready. I'm already playing and it's not installed? No, it's saying that an update is ready to be installed, but that's not clear at all. As I said, quirky.  The interface on the PSVita is so much more clear than the PS4 interface.* Store icon is not like all the rest, making it easy to overlook it as an icon* Limited launch titles* Won't play PS3, PS2 or PS1 games* Doesn't have Bluetooth profiles for Headset or Stereo Speakers, only Keyboard profile. So, you can't use your phone's BT Headset or a Bose Soundlink Mini* No Facebook or Twitter app, even though you can do this via Browser and you can share to these sites via the Share button.* No Email app* Browser app is not full screen by default and offers no pinch zoom via the controller* Couldn't find a way to use a home media server to stream music through the PS4* Controller has very limited battery life (like 4-6 hours total) compared to an Xbox 360 controller that can last for days. Buy a couple of controllers or leave it constantly charging while playing.OverallI actually paid for my PS4 by trading in an iPad 3 that I was no longer using. That means I bought it at Gamestop, not Amazon. While I like the PS4's game graphics, that's pretty much where it ends for features. The console is, for now, bare bones basic. Sony will ratchet up the features with subsequent OS updates, but for now there's not much there to jump for joy over.Unless there's some specific game you really must play on the PS4, it's probably worth waiting to purchase until Sony releases some major OS improvements, more console apps are are released, the store is better stocked, it supports a home media server, you can import music and the downloads work flawlessly. There's nothing like having to manually restart a failed download over and over multiple times.For what it does now, it does it well. For what it doesn't do, it just seems so far behind where it should have been. I really would like to give it 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding it up to 4 only because it doesn't deserve 3 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

Each of Spyro's dragon friends has fallen victim to the nefarious Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals. Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills.

The small kingdom of Dalmasca was one such neighbor, and it is here that our tale begins. \nIn a fight for freedom, fallen royalty and unlikely allies must struggle to liberate their homeland.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Well, here goes...","reviewText":"I'll use the old cliche: RPG's have been hand in hand with Final Fantasy. In fact, there's even best-of lists devoted to non-Final Fantasy games. As such, it's hard to believe we haven't had a proper entry in the series since 2001 with Final Fantasy X. Yeah we had the online XI but really, who actually can afford all those fees and everything just to play the game? The twelth game in the series had a frustratingly long gestation period with numerous delays, people walking out as well as doubts about whether the game would actually be good. Must be tough for those who doubted the game. I don't know whether people will regard this as one of the series best but as it stands, this is probably the best RPG available right now.Story: Taking place in the world of Ivalice, the Archadian Empire has taken over the kingdom of Dalmasca, placing it under their rule. The story centers around a group of people who are caught up in political intrigue and mystery as well as the protection of Princess Ashe, the heir to the throne. As for this story, you might not respond in the way you did to Cloud and Aeris or Locke and Celes but the characters are endearing and the plot is definately the maturest they've done since VIII but what hurts the story is development. You can tell the emphasis was on the story as opposed to the characters so while they all go on this mission, there's really no personal interest in each other as a group. I will say though that I quite like Ashe's character and Balthier is the kind of sly cool guy we all wish we could be.Graphics: When X came out, the graphics quite frankly stunned me. They still do. Here, they stun but the novelty as worn off since they're not new but boy do they impress. The demo and intro movie are just gorgeous and the in-game cinematics are handled well. This is also probably one of the most fully-realized worlds I've seen. Everything here looks like it has a story to tell or a history and it's very easy to get immersed in. My one knock is that on my widescreen TV, there's actually space that's not used since it's for subtitles and the like and let's face it, with a story like this, you kinda need subtitles.Sound/Music: Done now by Hitoshi Sakimoto of Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, I find his music well composed and arranged and he's great at using an orchestra but his problem is melodies, or shall we say, lack of them. Revisiting the soundtrack independent of the game made me appreciate some tracks more (the Esper Battle theme is power by definition really) but some tracks go through a few changes that while fine in the game, they're so overwritten it hurts the replayability. As for the voice acting, it's hit and miss. Sure characters like Basch and Balthier and especially Ashe work though she sounds slightly older, but then we have whiny Vaan(show you bad it is, Tidus to me outdoes this guy) and Fran has the most peculiar accent. Ultimately though their voices don't take you out of the game, they're just not as well cast in certain roles.Gameplay: The straw that might break the camel's back for some people. It used to be that you'd roam the field and whoosh! be met with battle music and the fight than a separate screen for your spoils such as EXP and Gil. Not here. The enemies appear on the field and you just walk right up to them and fight them right there. It's still ATB based so if you pick a command, a bar fills and once it fills, that command is issued. Exp and LP (license points) pop up above your enemy so you don't go to a separate screen. Only problem with this is that sometimes enemies overwhelm you and the EXP jumps rather considerably as you level up. In the first few enemy-infested levels you traverse, your requirements for levelling up can easily jump 300 exp and when each individual enemy has maybe 10 or so, that's a lot of fighting, and your Cure and whatnot don't come fast enough. The camera can cause problems, especially in dungeons where you went left instead of turning right.Like every single game since probably V, the game introduces a gameplay system on how to level and manage your characters. From the Materia system to Junctioning to the Sphere Grid, every game has had a different approach and it's the same thing here. The License board is essentially a re-worked Sphere Grid. Beating enemies in battle nets you License points which can be used to \"buy\" licenses, such as the ability to equip certain equipment or spells or enhancements such as increased potency of potions and spells or simply raising your strength and increasing your HP. However, just because you bought that license doesn't mean you can use it. Certain things like spells and skills have to be bought as well so buying the Cure license doesn't mean you can cast it, you have to buy it first. To be honest, this works better than X's system because unlike that system where you had to level up your health, strength, defense etc, individually, your traditional levelling up does it for you while the licenses are merely bonuses. However, there's no thieves/white mages-type thing here so you can actually make characters all equip bows if you wanted which takes away a bit of their uniqueness.The other addition is the Gambit system. Basically these are \"if commands\" which state that if a certain condition is there, an action is performed by your character. For example: if a character falls below a certain health percentage, your character or an ally will automatically perform Cure. If there's a fire-based enemy, you can have your ally automatically cast Blizzard. You can also set order preference so curing and health management take priority over attacking for example. Some say that it later makes the battles easier but personally it makes it funner and considering that they're all controllable, it's fun to not have to worry about them.Money has been changed as well. Enemies no longer carry vast amounts of Gil in their pocket, but instead they carry treasures. They can carry furs, stones and such and then those are sold in the market. Also you can take on various bounties where you hunt down a creature. It works in theory as well as just simple common sense(how is it that a bat carries Gil and what for anyway?), you don't get as much money as you should, especially considering you have to buy spells as well as techniques, weaponry, protective garments as well as supplies. As for the difficulty? It can get quite hairy. One early boss encounter pitted me up against at least 6 enemies, 2 of which were the main enemies and boy did they pack a wallop, finished me in 2 minutes flat. Party management and levelling are a must if you're to survive.I don't think there even is a Final Fantasy that's absolutely perfect but it's probably still going to be one of the more impressive RPG's you've played and XII is no different.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2006"}

The gameplay is fun and rather addictive, and the game has decent graphics for the NES. The musical score is excellent, from the bold tune on the start screen to the crazy out of whack theme of the Mad Reapers. However, the thing that both makes Kid Icarus fun and completly irratating is the challenge. It is beyond brutal. Level 1 did not even give me a chance... dozens of snakes came at me before I could even lift a finger. After snakes came Mad Reapers, which are  game overs in the form of blue pixels. They get worked up if they see you and chase you while they summon little mini reapers. Soon I am riding on a typical NES game platform, and Nintendo actually had the nerve to place those Reapers in the path! It only gets worse... dungeons full of sharp blades, random enemies falling from the sky, a slippery block of ice that is a little too easy to fall off of.

Something had been missing, despite Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance being great they just weren't as great as Symphony of the Night. I've come to the conclusion that I like swords better than whips. In Aria of Sorrow you play as Soma, a young man summoned inside of a solar eclipse where Dracula's Castle is being kept. He finds that he has the ability to absorb souls, but he doesn't understand why he has this power, all he knows is that he wants to find a way to escape the castle. It's the first Castlevania to take place in the future, rather than the past, and nearly sates my insatiable thirst for a modern times Castlevania. Aria of Sorrow plays much more like Symphony of the Night as the main character uses swords rather than a whip, which is nice. I never thought that killing monsters with a whip was possible anyway.The story could use a little work, as with all Castlevania there's only enough to keep you playing, not much more, but what's there is interesting. This game has spectacular graphics, looking pretty close to Metroid Fusion in quality.In all honesty though the music is still lacking. While better than Harmony of dissonance its not quite on par with Symphony of the Night or even Circle of the moon. Most of the tunes are forgettable, which is sad because Castlevania has always been, in part, about the music. The good news is that the music isn't unbearable like HOD was.

Since games like Brain Age came out for the system, gamers young and old have been so welcomed into what makes Nintendo so influential with great video games. They haven't been just for kids anymore, but for learning for adults too. Not just with cooking (Personal Trainer: Cooking) or learning new skills, but with fun altogether. While there just haven't been many strong games lately for the NIntendo DS or DSi, it has shown to be a good time using the system as a teaching tool by learning new traits and new skills. That can be shown with a simple paint, a brush, and good idea going through your mind.Art Academy for the Nintendo DS, takes the idea of just simply painting and relaxing away a lot of stress, by creating some really clever paintings using the simple pencil & brush system. You can easily learn new tricks from adding depth to your painting with shadowing, landscapes like mountains, to learning how to paint your favorite flowers and fruits. The gameplay is simple, as you use your stylus to paint and sketch drawings to any style you like. There is also a great treat for Nintendo DSi owners, as you also can use your own samples. By the use of the Nintendo DSi camers, you can take snapshots of places, and people to make your own sample pictures to get inspiration to paint your own pictures. While the graphics aren't anything over the top, it delivers more like a nice teaching tool, by letting you paint and put your mind at work. The control with the pencils from hard & soft tips, to creating your paints by the color wheel. While the music is also theraputic at times, it isn't anything to rave about. Just the simplicity of getting away from life and troubles, to help calmly making your own sketches from lanscapes and flowers.All in all while Art Academy isn't going to bring in new gamers to the Nintendo DS, it is a nice escape from everyday life, and how you can put your mind at work by making your own paintings and sketches. It is a nice buy for anyone who owns Brain Age or Big Brain Academy, who wants to expand their horizons, and just relax all their personal troubles away by creating your own masterpieces. For its price and what it is worth, it is a great addition to your Nintendo DS library.Graphics: B-Sound: B 1/2-Control: BFun & Enjoyment: B-Overall: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2010"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

If you have not heard of this game yet, you need to come out from under that rock. Almost everyone loved theoriginal game. The sequel had a huge name to live up to, and I feel they did an amazing job on Halo 2. The Multi-Player gameplay will have you playing for an extremely long time. Single player features a unique, deep story to play through. Halo 2 takes everything that was good in the original Halo and improved on it.Graphics- 9/10The graphics are probably the best that the X-Box could handle. Reflections, lighting, and glare all have been extremely improved upon in this game. Master Chief has breath-taking reflections on his armor and visor. The guns all also have a nice shine to them.All animations and characters are well done. A new race, named the Brutes, has been created, and brings a nice sense of freshness to battles. The Brutes can battle with guns like everything else, but can also charge at you. Nice animation is done on their part. Elite, Humans, and Flood characters are equally well designed.Level design is a little bit of a let down. The previous Halo had a problem with having repetitive levels. Halo 2 continues this trend to a lesser degree. While some levels are constantly unique, some still have repeating areas. This can cause you to be turned around and lost easy. Luckily, this is not as much of a problem as in the first game.I only have two other problems. The Energy Sword you can wield should have made areas like up more. The glows a bright blue, but never illuminates the ground or surroundings. My second problem is the way the graphics work. As you get closer to something, details you see will increase. This sounds nice, but you will notice many weird graphical sequences where the graphics shift from ugly to beautiful to ugly again. Sometimes the graphics will not change at all and you will be left with a very ugly view.Story- 9/10The story for the original Halo was amazing. This game is much deeper, and has a more intricate storyline. Some people will enjoy this; others will shun the complicated ideas in this game. I loved the storyline and its ideals based on Natural Selection, Racial Wars, and Mankind as a whole.This game is broken into two parts. In one, you play as Master Chief. Chief has just learned that Earth is being attacked the Covenant, the same alien scum you took on in the first game. Your mission is to stop the covenant. Soon you learn of another Halo that could potentially be used by the Covenant, based on some outrageous religious-like claims. I like how Covenant follows whatever their prophets tell them without question. It really should let people look at themselves and maybe make decisions on their own and not just based on what a \"higher knowledge\" tells them.In the second portion of the game, you play as The Arbiter. He is of the Elite race of the Covenant. He is being held responsible for the destruction of the original Halo and has been sentenced to death. The Prophets have a better idea for him though. He will work for them in tracking down heretics and stopping \"the demon,\" who happens to be Master Chief. I actually enjoyed this side of the story better. The Arbiter works off his debt, but slowly learns the truth about Halo. There is also a ton of tension between the Elite and Brute races, which both work under the Covenant. This leads to the Elite's being undermined and often pushed to the side for the superior Brute Class. This reveals a lot about our own society in how we push away those who we feel are weaker.Master Chief and Arbiter will meet eventually in the story. To me, not many people will understand the depth of the story. If you can though, there is a lot to get. I hope reading this review will help you understand it a bit better. People may also have a problem with the ending, or lack thereof.Sound- 10/10Halo has always been known for its phenomenal sound production. The music, or absence of music, has been a strong point in the series. Whenever you are traveling a large area with not much going on, music will usually not exist. Traveling a small area with an enormous conflict will feature a thunderous musical score that you will love. No matter what though, the score will not distract you from the gameplay.Voice Over is also great. Every main character in the game has a unique voice. Chief and Arbiter bring depth to the story with their voices. Grunts and Human Soldiers often bring a humor in their voice.Weapon and Vehicle sounds are all perfect. Usually the addition of weapons will lead to some having similar sounds; this game does not though. Each vehicle also sounds exceptionally well.Gameplay- 10/10Many people say that the Halo series never really brought anything new to the table. I completely agree with them. This series did take everything that was good in other games and placed it in this one, thus creating one of the best first person shooters on the market today. Halo 2 expands on the idea of the first Halo with more weapons, better levels, more vehicles, and more customization.In single player, you will play as both Master Chief and the Arbiter. You usually play a chapter of the game then switch to the other. Master Chief plays like a normal character. You usually find yourself shooting through walls of smart enemies. Arbiter is different though. You usually begin with an Energy Sword, and you can turn invisible for a certain amount of time. This allows you to become a stealth-like character at times. If you do not like being stealthy though, you can always pick up a gun and begin killing everything. If you find yourself in trouble, you can quickly turn invisible and escape the battle.Enemies range from Elites, Brutes, Flood, Human Characters, and more. It just depends on how far along you are and whom you are playing as at the moment. The Flood will run at you like maniacs and try to overwhelm you. Elite and Humans characters hide behind objects and try to stay smart. Brutes are very hard to kill and can go bezerk, charging at you to hurt you. There are other ranks of enemies such as Flood mixtures and a giant Covenant monster, whose name eludes me right now. They all have their weaknesses and strengths. Therefore, the game stays fresh the entire play.Halo 2 also features some new vehicles. Favorites like the Scorpion Tank, Warthog, and Ghost all return. New vehicles include the Wrath, Spectre, and a new version of the Warthog. The Wrath is a Covenant Tank that you saw a lot in the original game but never could ride in. This time you can. They sport an angled weapon that shoots blue plasma. The Spectre is the Covenant version Warthog. It shoots plasma from its turret. The new version of the Warthog shoots mortars instead of machine gun ammo. Did I mention that you could jack all of these vehicles?Multi-Player has always been this games biggest aspect. If you have three or more friends available to you, this game will last you a long time. You can connect X-Boxes and have some epic battles. Levels like Beaver Creek and Coagulation are remakes of some of the first game's best levels. Lockout and Zanzibar are just two of the awesome new levels to play on in the game. I suggest buying theMultiplayer Map Packfor even more great levels.This game allows you to edit your Multi-Player characters in detail. You choose between Master Chief and the Arbiter. You can apply multiple different colors to your characters. You can change your looking speed and controls. You can even create your own unique logo.Difficulty- 10/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)There are four different difficulty levels to choose from. Easy allows you to plow through enemy after enemy with little difficulty. Normal is good for those on their first try. Hard will have you dying a lot and feeling satisfied with yourself. Legendary mode will have you slamming your television into the wall out of anger. Maybe you are good enough for that to be necessary though. If that is not enough then you can Log ontoXbox Liveand be killed by the masters of this game.Overall- 10/10This is one of my favorite games. I personally prefer the Single Payer in the first Halo, but I enjoy the Multi-player in this game far more. Still, this game has a very solid Single player experience. The graphics are nice, despite having some repetitive levels here and there. If you own an X-Box, you need to own this game. This game also is compatible withXbox 360 Console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2008"}

Brothers in Arms proved to be a more authentic and smarter shooter and won fans of the genre over.Gearbox painstakingly recreated Carentan and many parts of France where the 101st Airborne Division landed on D-Day. The game also uses squad tactics and realism unlike any other WWII shooter out there. You will notice when you play how well the guns feel when you shoot them, and how you can't nail an enemy from 100 feet away with a Thompson. You have to flank the enemy or you die. It's that simple and that difficult. Red circles will appear above enemy squads. You can issue commands to your squads to suppress them. Their circle will turn grey and then it is safe to move up and find cover around the area to flank them. It sounds simple, but it's not. Your squadmates can die and so can you if you aren't careful. You have to watch out for MG fire which will kill you in an instant, and some times even tanks.This realism and authenticity can't be done without good AI and BiA delivers and is even impressive today. The only issue I had with AI were with tanks. Some times they wouldn't go around each other or go the other way to follow a command. The game also requires a lot of patience. Some times even trial and error. You can't just rush every enemy like in Call of Duty and save the day. You can order squads to rush and attack while your other squad suppresses, then you can charge in with them to kill them all. You can also order squads a set positions that you want so you have total control. It feels good and is a key part to the game. Without mastering this you won't get very far.You also can't just use an M1 Garand and snipe an enemy's head while he's in cover. It just doesn't work that way, you also can't kill an MG unless you flank them. This isn't Medal of Honor. This gave a great feeling of realism, but it was also very difficult. I died quite often because I chose a wrong tactic or I flanked the wrong way. Some times my impatience got in the way as well. I even found different weapons to help certain situations. When I finally got the Springfield sniper rifle it was like a weapon from God. After all the inaccurate weapons that couldn't hit crap this thing made life easier, but only for a few levels at the end.When it comes to looks, BiA looks great even to this day. The lighting looks real, the grass flows, the models and textures are pretty high-res (for back then) you will be impressed. The game holds up and is still better than a lot of shooters today. My main concern is that the game feels the same throughout. I just went around killing everything and maybe planted a few charges. I could mount an MG some times, ride the back of a tank, but overall there wasn't much variety in the game which I find the biggest issue.What's here is one of the most authentic shooters around and fans of the genre won't be disappointed at all. The game looks great, has smart AI, and  tells a sad story of Baker Company and the 101st Airborne.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Meng John Lee","summary":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven","reviewText":"I have played part 1 and 2.

Still, I wasn't blown away, but the battle graphics, and the overworld graphics were amazing. It didn't quite have the charm of Zelda- Link To The Past, but considering the size of this game and its release date, the graphics were very good.Music- 10/10 Okay, this is where this game shines. Without a doubt, this game has the best music I have ever heard in an RPG. Every SNES FF title had great music (including 5, which was originally only released in Japan, but can be picked up with FF Anthology), and this game started that trend. The battle music is amazing, literally. But it doesn't stop there, the boss music is even better. In fact, I am willing to say that FF2/4 has the best boss music ever out of ANY video game. You will have it stuck in your head for years. In fact, Super Mario RPG for SNES has a hidden boss that has the same music theme as FF2/4. I think FF Mystic Quest was my first FF game, but FF2 was the first one to really get me into the series, and the music sure helped.Gameplay- 10/10 the battle system is flawless, and the level-up to gain magic system is one of my favorites. I just love battling in order to gain abilities, it just feels so old-school. All in all, all of the gameplay elements are flawless, and the story is great. You also get to go to the moon in this game, which is very fun, and not many RPGs offer something like that. Although this game is also available on FF Chronicles, I would recommend buying the SNES version, even if it has translation issues. I think the SNES version is better because it loads faster (mainly on the saving and loading data screens), it has a more old-school feeling, and just because it's SNES. SNES is the greatest system ever and I think every game originally for the SNES is 10 times better for its original system, even if it costs 20 more dollars, but it is well worth it.Overall- 10/10 This is a pretty old game (okay, it's very old), but it is one of the greatest games ever made. Overall, FF3/6 is slightly more enjoyable, and is a little better, but FF4 is still in my top three for greatest FF games, and probably in my top ten for greatest games ever. It is well worth the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2005"}

New career mode with Go Pro theme compliments the same elements that have made THPS a phenomenon.  Claw your way up through the amateur ranks to prove yourself in the professional world of skateboarding.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Harsh expectations ruin this one for me","reviewText":"I'll admit it right here and now; throughout my college career, and on into my first several years in the workplace, I was a Tony Hawk NUT. In my mind, Neversoft could do no wrong as long as they kept pumping out new stages, new challenges and new hidden characters. The series never grew old for me, so the thought of revamping it never really entered my head. If it ain't broke, don't spend the time and energy fixing it, right?Well, Neversoft gave it a try anyway. And, in the process of reinventing the wheel, they've managed to lose a little bit of the magic that so captivated me during the first three games in the series. It's not a bad game, but it's not really up to the level I've come to expect from a game bearing Tony Hawk's name.The heart and soul of Tony Hawk IV is now found in its \"free skate\" career mode. Where previous incarnations would allow skaters to choose between free skate (in which you weren't given the opportunity to complete any goals) or the timed challenge mode, here they're merged into a single system. It's only when you initiate a conversation with one of the game's many non-playable characters that you're granted your goals, one piece at a time. Say goodbye to those days of nailing a high score, pro score and sick score all in one run.. in THPS4, you've got to hit them each with a completely separate run and launch point. Where the series once thrived on its cool, inventive and excitingly fresh goals, the objectives in the newest update often leave a player scratching his or her head. Because I'm not 100% fluent in skate-lingo, I often found myself relying on online guides, just to figure out what the game was asking me to do. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, goals are no longer a pleasant surprise. They're a chore.Veterans will be pleased to note the magnificent control system has remained intact through yet another game. There isn't a more efficient way to control a virtual skateboard than this. Grinding, ollying, lipping, grabbing, kicking.. it's all become almost a second language to me by now. And, with the seamless integration of several new abilities, the system just keeps growing. Players can now transfer from one side of a lip to the other by pressing the \"R2\" button, an addition which aids midair maneuvering immeasurably. It's also now possible to continue a combo out of a big grab trick, which is a big help in obtaining those sick scores. There's a reason the controls THPS1 established have been imitated with such regularity by the competition; they're impossible to top.The music for this collection is one of the greatest in the series. You'll hear cuts from GoldFinger, Biz Markie, Avail, AC/DC, The Cult, Run DMC, The Bouncing Souls, Flogging Molly, Less Than Jake and more, all in crystal clear cd-quality. They even continued the old school trend established with the Ramones in THPS3, including \"Anarchy in the UK\" by the Sex Pistols. A couple of the hardcore rap tracks really aren't my cup of tea, but thanks some expert coding in the options screen, I'm given the opportunity to remove any track I desire from the active rotation. I don't think words can describe the amount of agony that option has saved me.Ever since the third game of their run proved it was possible, gamers had been chomping at the bit to get Tony Hawk 4 onto the internet for competitive online play. And, while it's not the online-friendly kind of game that Unreal Tournament or NBA 2k3 is, Tony Hawk still holds his own as a multiplayer entity in design. In function, unfortunately... well, let's just say a few rotten apples ruined the bunch. I picked up my copy of Tony Hawk 4 a few weeks after its release, plugged in and went immediately to the online option. It took me about fifteen minutes to run into my first opponent using a GameShark or other unspecified hack to beat the system. Put simply, the spirit of online competition has been rendered almost null and void. If you're no good, there's no fun in playing online, as even the \"newbie\" rooms are filled with players using the 'perfect balance' or 'perfect manual' hack. If you're honestly good, there's no fun in playing online, as you'll be constantly accused of being a cheat. It's a stupid way to watch the community swirl around the toilet bowl, but it's happening all the same.Possibly the most notable new feature in the series is the addition of a unique \"pro challenge\" for each non-hidden character. What really makes this section stand out, in my opinion, is the fact that these wildly imaginative challenges all relate directly to the real skater behind the pixelized representation. For instance, Bam Margera's pro challenge involves reliving a few moments from his work on the MTV program \"Jackass.\" Eric Koston asks you to grind a ridiculous distance. It's a really cool idea, and helps each skater to emerge as an individual, complete with unique strengths and weaknesses. Even cooler, once you've actually completed the challenge, you unlock a video extra of your skater actually landing the trick you just performed. All in all, it's a great way to wrap up the game.What it all boils down to is this; when I reached 100% completion in Tony Hawk 4, I put the game in its case and filed it away into my library of games. Chances are, I won't touch it again for years. I'd much rather throw in any of the first three games, despite the improvements made in many areas of THPS4, just because the goals are so unfulfilling. Neversoft tried to give us something revolutionary, and in so doing left their classic formula partially behind. In the end it's undeserving of the legendary name which adorns its case.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00D3RBZHY","description":"Welcome to Redview County, where a street-racing rivalry between cops and racers never stops as both sides compete in an all-out war to take over the social, local and national media and earn the best cars, mods and technology. Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Need for Speed Rivals:  The gauntlet is laid down for DriveClub and The Crew for the #1 racer on PS4","reviewText":"Need for Speed:  Rivals takes parts from the most successful NFS games of the past generation (Hot Pursuit and Most Wanted) and molds them into an exhilarating, challenging, fun racing game.The major knock on NFS:  Hot Pursuit was that you were restricted to the events; in other words, no \"free driving\" around the map.  Outside of that, the games handling was tight and especially online, you had to work as a team to win.The major knock on NFS:  Most Wanted was the multiplayer playlist; much like Burnout Paradise, everyone had to \"meet\" in a specific spot for an event to start.Need For Speed Rivals fixes both of these issues in a big way.You'll start out going through training as either a cop or racer; it's basically your \"training wheels\" in the game.  But once you go through those (it'll take you about 20-25 minutes tops), you're let loose to go down the Driver or Cop trails, and you can jump back and forth at ease.Instead of basic \"race here, time trial here\" you're given a playlist, which consists of a few objectives.  Once you complete a list, you get special items, such as cars, upgrades, etc.  Pretty standard fare.And so here's the first major improvement from NFS:  Hot Pursuit, it's a true open world.  You can drive where you want, CHALLENGE who you want, there are no rules.  Outside of, if you're a racer and get busted, you lose all your SpeedPoints (which serve as money in this game) that are not banked in your hideout, and if you're a cop and wreck, same result.  So it adds an element of danger and penalty for just going all willy-nilly which is largely absent from most other racing games.  This is a MAJOR plus and step forward for the series.Now, the line truly is blurred between single player and multiplayer, which was the problem with NFS:  Most Wanted, as in terms of starting events, you were largely at the mercy of everyone meeting up.  Not so in NFS:  Rivals.  You could literally jump in with your friend in an cop event, working together to take down the racers, and go right back to your game, so single player to multiplayer to singleplayer.  Things they do can sign things off your playlist.  It truly is incredible and you can't really explain it in words, you have to experience it for yourself!Obviously, this game has seen a massive graphical upgrade, and everything looks awesome.  You'll be hard pressed to simply keep your eyes on the road vs. looking at all the scenery!  The game runs butter smooth, no dips in the framerate to be had, no matter if your friends are out in the game or if you're on your own.  The controls are pretty much how you remember them, and Easydrive is beyond awesome, you can choose events, mark places (like your hideout) on your GPS, and I think it's a better interface than Most Wanted.The bottom line is until at least March or April of 2014, this will be the only racing game on the PS4.  And it's set a very high bar for others to get to.  If you need a racer to get you by until then, NFS:  Rivals is a worthy successor and a good start for EA on the PS4.  Does it break a ton of new ground?  Probably not.  However, it shows that they are learning from their mistakes and improving their product (Goodbye, NFS:  The Run!)  Buy with confidence!UPDATE #1(11/15/2013)There has been reports (and I experienced it once) of spotty online connection with the AllDrive service.  I was in an event and got \"booted\" out while the game searched for another host.  This will mean you'll have to start the event over.If you consider that with any system launch that sometimes games will have issues, and are OK with that, it's not a deal breaker by any means.  There's only a couple missions (like one that requires you to accumulate 100,000 SP) that it would be a real pain to have to do over, but again, I've put well north of 12 hours into this game already and it's only happened once, I was able to run two 15-30 minute streams to UStream/Twitch using the \"share\" button with no issues.UPDATE #2 (11/19/2013)Apparently, people are getting a little bent on the \"open world\" definition people are applying to this game.In the most general sense:NFS:  The Run & NFS:  Hot Pursuit were NOT open world.  They were set routes that you could only choose and race on, 100% linear.Burnout Paradise, NFS: Most Wanted and NFS: Rivals ARE open world.  Maybe the content is not the same across all 3 titles, but you can still drive freely to anywhere and almost any place on the maps.Take this game for what it is:  An attempt by EA to captialize on the push-back of Drive Club to March 2014 to have the first 4 months of launch all to themselves as a racing game, and that while some will feel it has flaws, I've played every NFS that has trophies on the PS3, and I've enjoyed this more at least as much as HP, if not a little bit more to this point.  I'm not a shill for EA (go ahead and read my review for NFS:  The Run if you think so), and this review is simply my opinion.  If you want a racing game on the PS4, it's the only one in town.  If you want an arcade racer, for sure, it's the only one on the horizon.  If you're more of a sim racer, then Drive Club might be more your speed and you should wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Aside from causing mass casualties and destruction, Cole was imbued with strange powers--specifically, to be able to absorb and control electric energy and use it at his disposal. The bomb has also created a sickness that prompts the government to quarantine Empire City indefinitely. With riots and lawlessness in the streets, Cole decides to use his new powers to clean up the streets and find out who was behind his framing him for a terrorist. How me plans on achieving those goals is up to the player.GRAPHICS/SOUND:The graphics are on par with what was being released during that year, if not maybe a little rough here and there. Empire City looks  the absolute same regardless of what part of the map you are in; generic skyline, building structure, etc. Using Cole's super powers is pretty cool to look at, but that's really it, as far as what stands out. The music and overall sound of the game is pretty solid, although the dialog is very cliche and hokey throughout. I find this terribly annoying in some games, and InFamous is no exception: putting effort into making the main character look good (graphics-wise), then obviously half-assing it for every other NPC in the game, whether or not they are part of the plot. I can understand when it's done for NPC's that are there to simply populate the game, but the actual characters that Cole interacts with on a regular basis look horrible, sound lame, and their movements are clunky and robotic. If I were to guess, I'd say that whatever code was used for their movements was taken straight out of the first Resident Evil.GAMEPLAY:For me, this is where the game really suffers, and I apologize in advance if I start going off on a tangent. Character movement of Cole is very rigid and non-organic, and the horrible camera function just exacerbates the issue; often swooping around during mid-jump and throwing off your perspective. Scaling buildings is extremely frustrating and not nearly as fluid and &#34;organic&#34; as the makers claim it is. Oftentimes when I would try to climb something like an electric post or jump onto a ladder against a wall, the character would constantly jump right past it  over and over again until I had to position the character RIGHT IN FRONT of what I was trying to climb and finally he would interact with it appropriately. Cole needlessly climbs things that you didn't need him to climb, which causes a lot of headache when you're being shot at by a mounted machine gun and instead of hopping down to get behind cover, your character wants to skip from mailbox to mailbox, right in the firing line. Oh and that reminds me: if there is one thing that Cole is good at, it's dying. Even when leveled up completely, Cole loses health and dies with some serious regularity when being shot at, which is odd for a character that can jump off a 30 story building without a scratch. Oh yes, and despite him essentially being a living electric conduit with voltage running through his entire body, being too close to one of your own ELECTRIC &#34;grenades&#34; results in death. Death always results in you being transported back to a single re-spawn point in the map until you unlock more medical centers, where you will just spawn to the one closest to where you died.Other than the above mentioned shortcomings, the gameplay is pretty basic: open-world map where you can choose various missions to take part in and complete. As you finish some missions, you will be rewarded with new power-ups for your special skills. Other missions you complete with make the zone the job was in &#34;safe&#34; and no more enemies will pop up there. Mission types break down into 3 categories: Good, Neutral, and Bad--pretty self explanatory. A lot of like Fable before it and many other titles since, InFAMOUS allows you to choose missions and/or make decisions that determine your moral compass, and how other characters perceive you. Some power-ups are only available for a really &#34;Good&#34; character, and likewise for anyone who dedicates themselves to being a right prick to pretty much everyone. Aside from balancing out your goodness/evilness, the missions are a bit repetitive at times.REPLAY VALUE:If you're like me, I always like to play as the good guy on the first run, then be an outright tyrant the second time around. Unfortunately, the hang-ups on gameplay are something that can be quite tiring, so I would give this a moderate/low replay value.OVERALL:Video games have improved so drastically over the last few years that some just get left in the dust compared to others. InFAMOUS is a title that gathered enough momentum to warrant two more games under it's umbrella, so obviously it's not the total failure I may have made it out to be. Like my disclaimer states, I critiqued this game based on my present standards because very few video games could be considered &#34;timeless&#34;, and InFAMOUS to me, isn't one of them. It's not a great game, but it's not unplayable either. If you want to play the sequel and Second Son (which looks amazing), then it stands to reason that the plots would make more sense and the feel would be more genuine if you start from game one. Another thing worth noting is that I experienced absolutely ZERO glitches, which is a bragging right that a lot of the bigger and more successful game companies have NEVER had.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2014"}

I've noticed that I can't play the game for more than 2 hours at a time because the game becomes very repetitive and linear more than half of the time and i just become very bored. The action in the game is very fun, and the deadly finishes are a fun guilty pleasure that will satisfy anybody that loves blood and guts. The musical score is EPIC to say the least and the voice acting is believeable. The graphics are AMAZINGLY realistic but there are times the textures in some area still look like it belongs on the PS2, however its a beautiful  game to say the least.

New visual effects include ambient occlusion, dynamic shadows, improved character lighting, the ability to render hundreds of on-screen characters simultaneously, improved water physics, additional blood and bullet decals, advanced destructible environments, new weather effects, and the introduction of fluid objects.Immersive, Gripping StoryTaking place six months after the end of the first game,Gears of War 2returns the cast of characters of the original, including Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago, as well as several newcomers.Novelist and comic book writer Joshua Ortega, who assisted with the writing, has created a story that is big on character development and personality. With a new in-game conversational camera system and multiple story arcs, the story is presented in a gripping cinematic style where characters gain an emotional depth that matches their realistic graphical representation.More Characters, Upgraded Vehicles, Badder WeaponsThose who were impressed by the originalGears of Warwill be in for a real treat. New characters such as Tai Kaliso, weapons like the burst pistol, and huge vehicles like the COG Centaur tank will give players a whole new dimension and scope of gameplay in both single-player and multi-player modes.Multiplayer Action with Xbox LIVE!Gears of War 2features a multiplayer mode that allows up to 10 simultaneous players for outstanding multiplayer fun. Taking full advantage of the Xbox LIVE service, which boasts 10 million gamers,Gears of War 2features both competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. Setting up games is simple with LIVE, and you have the ability to drop in and out of co-operative campaigns at any time.Everything you loved about multiplayer in the original is back, including the classic death matches, but with this sequel there is an added emphasis on teamwork. New multiplayer game modes will require better coordination in order to win. The game also features voice support, so you can communicate with other players around the world -- whether you're on the same team or trash talking!Gears of War 2won several awards at E3 2008, where it was first presented, including Overall Best Shooting Game and Overall Best Graphics Technology of E3 2008 from IGN, as well as Best Action Game of E3 2008 from the Game Critics Awards.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A Worthy Sequel","reviewText":"Gears of War 2 is exactly what you'd expect in a sequel to the best selling and well received, Gears of War. G2 is bigger, better and offers a slew of new options over the first.Many gamers will instantly gravitate toward how the game looks - and Gears 2 doesn't disappoint. While graphically very similar to the first, the environments in Gears 2 span a more diverse setting. Everything from Locust caverns to snowy forests and to the last human bastion - the city of Jacinto. Graphics retain their gritty, yet somehow polished look - something that Unreal Engine 3 can render beautifully.Gamers familiar with the original Gears game will be right at home with the gameplay. A few minor tweaks have been made, but largely the cover system remains intact. I was pleased to discover that AI controlled characters - mainly Cole & Baird are a bit more useful in G2 and can actually be handy in a firefight. Both now retain the ability to revive an injured player.The story picks up almost immediately after the first games conclusion. I highly recommend anyone who is considering purchasing G2 to play the original game and get caught up with the story. For a shooter I would consider the story of Gears to be excellent. I've read a lot of reviews with players citing a certain \"corniness\" to the story. That might be true in certain cut-scenes but overall the story remains great and adds to the experience. All told my first run through the game took about 12-13 hours.New weapons to the game include utterly devastating heavy weapons - The Mortar and The Mulcher. The mortar is an indirect fire weapon that will carve a swath of destruction through entire swarms of enemies. While the Mulcher is a flesh rendering chain gun that'll take down legions in it's own right. Both are a bit slow to fire and reload but once they do watch out! G2 features other new weapons though none quite as cool as the heavy weapons, though they're still fun to use.One of my favorite new features is 'Horde Mode'. Essentially it's multi-player maps that feature a constant wave of ever increasing amounts of enemies assaulting the player and up to 4 friends. It's an absolute blast to play and might distract players from finishing the campaign.All told I am obviously extremely pleased with Gears of War 2. I highly recommend this game to fans of the original or shooter fans in general.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

The mixture of a camera along with the motion device allows for incredible precision that we haven't seen before in the video game market. The moment I took the controller out of the box I could tell it was a solid device, and that Sony didn't cut corners in creating the technology. Not only is it comfortable in the hand, but the glowing sphere on top utilizes a beautiful LED that is used to track the controller.So what's so special about this device? Well, there are a few things really.1. Games. The PlayStation platform has arguably the strongest current library, and the Move is being marketed as an optional device. What does this mean? Some of the biggest upcoming blockbusters including but not limited to SOCOM 4 and Killzone 3 will be compatible with this wonderful device.2. HD graphics. We've seen motion devices before but not on a machine that has the most powerful hardware on the market. This allows for both immersion through control and immersion through the visible spectrum.3. Affordability. The device is at a really great price point which makes it very affordable for just about everyone. Just this bundle alone turns the already amazing PlayStation 3 and turns it into a two-headed juggernaut.4. Flexibility. While the PlayStation Move is a fantastic device, the Eye camera is too. The mixture of both devices allows for some amazing and well-rounded experiences.Overall, I recommend the PlayStation Move to all PS3 owners out there. The ability to play blockbuster titles with the DualShock 3 or Move means you'll be getting extra juice out of every game you buy. As far as Sports Champions goes, it's a surprisingly solid game. There's tons to unlock and all six sports are legitimate. Table tennis has continued to blow my mind and I play it everyday for the enjoyment it encompasses.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2010"}

An open-world First Person Shooter set in the next Great War.","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"IT'S HIGH-OCTANE AND YET IT STILL KNOCKS","reviewText":"I think re-reading Orwell's 1984 right about now would be a great idea. Because in a true Orwellian fashion FRONTLINES:FUEL OF WAR envisions yet a...newer world order where the US and the EU (Western Coalition, aka \"Oceania\"?) face off Russia and China (Red Star Alliance, aka \"Eastasia\"?). It is set in (the no so near I hope) future so new weapons and front-line tactical technology are employed.This is a fast-paced First Person Shooter built around capturing points and getting territory rewards. It bears great similarities to BATTLEFIELD, yet I felt more like playing COMPANY OF HEROES from a FPS perspective. Various objectives are to be completed in order for the entire battlefield territory to be captured.The graphics are good, although, not exceptional: CoD4 is much more impressive. The sound was nothing to complain about: your usual battlefield whizzing bullets, staccato automatics and loud explosions.I really liked the feature which allows soldier and weapons customization - which, in an RPG twist, can get upgraded (up to level 3) as the game progresses. This is a game with a lot going for it. Unfortunately, the story does not end here.The first star was withheld because of the short duration. FPS games keep getting shorter and shorter but 6-7 hours is way too short even for an expansion, let alone a standalone game! At this rate, in a couple of years, games will not run longer than a movie and will cost ten times a movie ticket.The second star was withheld because of the weak Single player campaign. The missions were rudimentary designed and, even if there are challenging moments, it was painfully obvious that FRONTLINES is a game designed mainly as a multiplayer. Now, this is a risky way to set up a game since it depends on the number of onLine participants. If UT3 failed to attract a crowd, I cannot see FRONTLINES fairing any better. By the way, if THQ wants to boost onLine participation, they should offer more than the 8 maps currently available.All in all, FRONTLINES is a good game that will leave Single player gamers with a mild unsatisfied aftertaste, whereas multiplayer gamers will enjoy more, provided they find enough companions to make it interesting.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2008"}

Daneker","summary":"Where are my feet???","reviewText":"There's a lot to like about half-life 2. I tried playing half-life, but honestly, the frustration on the PC got out-of-hand. The issue wasn't the PC, the computer is far more powerful than need be, but the issue was with the character moving like he's on roller skates. Yes, I mean it. When I play Oblivion or Bioshock the screen looks and the movement feels like walking or  running, when you play a Half-Life game, it's like gliding.I would be okay with the \"gliding\" movement, but when you have to make some careful jumps, or you can fall off an edge you can't \"feel\" your feet. I know it sounds weird but the character in Half-Life is just an arm with a gun mounted to a unicycle. So my issue with both games is that it doesn't feel like human movement, it's too slick and fast. When you get close up on an enemy and try to center on it the slightest touch to the joy-stick sends your site right past.Now, why do I like HL2?Well, for one, the PS3 control is easier to use for this game than \"WASD\" config on the keyboard. When playing the PC version I feel like every key stroke just moves the character too fast and too far and there's no way to slow him down.Also, I like the PS3 has all five games on one disk, that's lovely, and the quick-save is a must-have.The graphics look lovely through my 42\" Bravia 3LCD via HDMI 1.3 and the 7.1 LPCM sound is fairly intense, though some extra rear ambiance would have added to the experience. A warning, if you have your PS3 plugged into a receiver that does not process LPCM, you will likely get a 2.1 mix for sound. (suggestion, the new STR DG720 Sony is $299.00, excellent 7.1 LPCM playback!)Overall the one thing I can't get around, no feet! I got stuck between to pipes and had to go back to the last save point, when I look down, no feet? WHERE'S the REST OF ME??? Really, all this work into the game and there's no dude holding the damn gun. When you walk along a narrow ledge or pipe, he just glides, you look down, no feet, no body, nothing.So my issue with Half-Life 1 & 2 all episodes is that the guy has no feet. It doesn't matter if your one a pipe, the dirt or concrete he moves exactly the same, like a wheel on a flat surface. To me, in a game like this control is everything to gameplay and when I feel like the character  can't be controlled gameplay is diminished.Also, a not to game developers: Could you please let us program the controller like we can the Keyboard and Mouse? Really? Please? I want to be able to look with the right and move with the left, but all the left axis does is strafe left and right, not turn. I hate this!!! I don't need it to strafe! I want to be able to turn and look separately and not use to sticks just to move!All and all, an okay game, but I think enough issues to say that it could have been so much better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2008"}

I would recommend it for kids age 9-15.  I think anyone older than that would get too easily bored with it.  It's definitely more fun than studying a dictionary or textbook, but not fun enough to hold onto your attention for very long, especially not the wayBrain Agedoes.  There are six games you can play to increase your vocabulary:1. Missing Letter - Screen displays an incomplete word and you must write in the missing letter.  I found this incredibly easy, especially since anyone with a decent vocabulary will have at least a good guess as to what letter is missing. I could see this being a decent game for younger kids, but it still seemed pretty easy and dull.2. Word Shuffle - You are given 4 words and 4 definitions and must match the correct one with each.  This is a much better game since it seems more useful, and some of the definitions can be tricky since they are similar.  My only complaint is that the interface on the DS is a little hard to get used to, and I think they could have done better on this one.  Maybe drawing a line to the correct definition?3. Pasta Letters - There is a bowl of soup filled with letters and a definition in the top screen.  You use letters in the bowl of soup to spell out a word that matches that definition.  This seemed pointless to me.  It would have been more efficient to have you just write out the word, but I guess the \"fun\" part is to wade around in the soup and find the letters.  I guess you have to have a balance of fun and education, and maybe this would appeal to kids, but it was just an extra step I didn't need.4. Safecracker - Almost the same as Pasta Letters, except you have a safe and have to move the dial around to spell out the word that matches the definition.5. Split Decision - Another variant of matching the word to the definition.  You can also match a definition to the word, but doing it this way is almost too easy.6. Block Letters - A chalkboard is presented with words on it and in the next screen, you must select the correct letters from a group to form those words.  The good part of this game is that the letter pool you use to spell out the words doesn't immediately contain all of the letters you will need, so you have to know in advance how to spell the word, and where to put the order of the letters.  Although this seems like a simple game, it is probably oneFinally, the game gives you a score when you're done to indicate how good your vocabulary is, just like Brain Age.  Ultimately, I think this is a decent game for kids, but I'm not sure how many will really stick with it.  It could be good for adults who have a weak vocabulary.  Where I think the game will really excel though, are with the foreign language editions such asMy Spanish CoachandMy French Coach","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2008"}

I decided not to pick up the game right away, but instead later acquired it from a trading post on credit.I sat down a couple of times to play this after I got it...played maybe 4 hours or so into it, and in the end it just really didn't do much for me.  The graphics didn't seem as good as I felt they should have by this point, really a bit closer to the 1st game.  Furthermore, as most people that know me understand, I'm not really a hardcore gamer...I'm really more of a casual player and play on easy & casual modes mostly.  I started the game on easy and after playing into it a little ways I started getting frustrated at some of it...not that it's anything I couldn't handle at the time, but it was enough for me to realize that it was going to be a real b**** later on in the game.  I don't think I'd ever sworn or gotten so pissed off at a game as I did at the end of the first Darksiders game, and I really didn't care to go through that again, so I made the decision to trade it in toward a different game.Now, I'm not trying to say that anybody shouldn't play this game, because I'm sure many of you would probably wind up really loving this game...and so far it seems there are many people that already do, judging by most of the reviews I've seen on here.  For all of the hardcore action/adventure games out there who love a good challenge and whatnot, I'm sure this game will inevitably provide that for you, assuming of course you're not bothered by the fact that the graphics aren't entirely top notch...they're good, don't get me wrong, but not quite what I was hoping for in a game that had the kind of hype this one did.

If you are in the market for a great, affordably-priced filter for your WII U game pad, give this a try!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

Forget well constructed plot lines, you will won't know what is going on for half the game. Once I did piece together the story though, it is quite deep with a very sad message to it. Basically a creature named Skull Kid had been picked on and abandoned his whole life and decides to gets revenge by crashing the moon into Clock Town using a powerful and dangerous magic mask. I felt bad for him even if he did turn Link into a Deku. The gameplay is also different from the beloved Ocarina of Time. You only have 3 days before Skull Kid destroys the town, and by 3 days Nintendo means 1 hour. I personally find my myself better at playing it if I know a moon will fall on my head if I don't get things done in time. Along with the ominous time limit you also have a ton of masks at your disposal. Need to get into a palace filled with Deku people? Put on the Deku mask and you will literary become a Deku. Want to explode? Just put on the dangerous bomb mask, press the button, and watch as Link blows up. The masks a new level to gameplay. Majora's Mask isn't as serious a game as Ocarina of Time, but with the surprisingly deep (and weird) plot, unique gameplay, and creepy outdated cutscenes (the clip of Link being eaten by a Deku gave me nightmares), why not give it a try?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

Underrated","reviewText":"GremDUDE PSN ID here with another review. Haven't done one in a while but since I finished this game twice(once XBox and once PS3) I felt I was overdue to recommend this game to people who have not gave it a shot. I highly recommend this game. Graphics are very unique with that shaky camera technique which sets this game apart from any other shooter title out there. The campaign is fun single player due to very good AI of your co-op computer partner and even more fun with a real live person. Please play with a headset though if you play this online!! Why people want to play a cooperative game without a headset is a complete mystery to me but that is an issue with the PSN network that may be solved someday if SOny decides to pack a headset with the PS3(probably never happen but I can hope can't I?)THis game hit all the major points to make a third person shooter fun. The first Kane and Lynch game had a horrendous cover system which has been nearly perfected with Dog Days. Cover works like Gears of War. Press a button and you are locked into cover. Simply pull back on the stick or hit X again and you are out of cover. There are a few areas where the cover doesn't let you aim but I only saw this happen in one area. Overall the cover works flawlessly for most of the game. Blind fire is implemented very well for the most part as well.Guns feel good(with the exception of all SMGs which are completely useless.) YOu have the usual assortment of assault rifles, sniper rifles, pistols and shotguns. All work well and get the job done nicely. Never a shortage of ammo is a nice touch to. You always have two guns in your inventory with this game. Never carry a pistol or SMG unless nothing else is available.Checkpoints are(for the most part) well spaced and sensibly placed. Unlike the first Kane and Lynch, this game saves at every checkpoint so you will not have to restart an entire chapter if you quit which is nice. There are a nice variety of locals throughout Shanghai to fight through including trainyards, warehouse, office building and the streets.The best game to compare this to is Army of Two the Fortieth Day. THis game is better than that piece of crap in practically every way. I do not recommend that game unless you are into S&M.; This game will rarely have you cursing out the developers of cheap deaths and terrible check points like that game will.Now for the negatives. Load times are quite long(on the Xbox and the PS3 loadtimes are both way too long.) THe good thing is that if you die, the load times are pretty much non-existent which is a relief.The other annoyance is the co-op partner revive system,. This game encourages flanking in order to take out the enemy. That being said, you are not likely to be standing right next to your partner at all times. If you are down but not dead, you have to mash the Square button for about 6 to 10 seconds until your partner comes to revive you. First off, why the button mashing? Secondly, why only 6 t0 10 seconds? Most likely, your partner is going to be on the other side of the map upstairs or downstairs from your position. There is almost no way your partner will get there in time to revive you!!! Very dumb and the only really annoying part of the game.Despite this, I game this game 5 stars due to its split screen and online co-op play, cool graphics, and pure fun factor. THere is really no game which provides as good a cooperative play experience as this one. RIght now the price is right too so pick this one up!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007RNWUC4","description":"An epic clash between man and machine Available exclusively for the Wii system, the Xenoblade Chronicles game combines science fiction and fantasy into an unforgettable open-world adventure. Players will discover expansive environments and deep character customization options as they delve into an epic conflict between the Homs (humans) and Mechons (robots) and uncover the secret of the ancient Monado blade. With richly detailed role-playing elements, Xenoblade Chronicles offers an extraordinary experience for veteran gamers and genre newcomers alike.","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"AN IMPERIAL GAME!","reviewText":"XENOBLADE: CHRONICLES (aka: MONADO: BEGINING OF THE WORLD) is one of those great games that (for some unfathomable reason) Nintendo had initially decided not to market outside Japan. It has been available, fully translated, since August in Europe (where my copy came from). This used not to be true for the US. Luckily, Nintendo North America (at last!) yielded to the pressure of the fans and announced the release of the game.THE MUSIC WILL ENCHANT YOUR SOULThis is the first thing that hits your senses. The music of Xenoblade reminded me of playing Final Fantasy VII years ago and being mesmerized by its music. The Prelude I can still remember. In Xenoblade, the music will range from atmospheric to epic rock, and all the shades and colors in between.It will be a familiar companion while you travel and a strengthening presence when you do battle, greatly enhancing the overall experience. Every map has its own theme (most with day and night variations) and you will catch yourself humming them long after having turned your console off.Sometimes the importance of the music in a game is underestimated and the focus remains on the graphics. Xenoblade is a perfect example of how essential music is in order to achieve a total immersive gaming experience.LIVE AND BREATH IN A GORGEOUS ANIME WORLDNow, all of us who decided to go with the Nintendo Wii, we knew that it was not the most graphically powerful console. Its strengths lie elsewhere. Having said that, Xenoblade is the most beautiful and graphically detailed game on the Wii. Ever.Set on two ancient biomechanical Titans frozen in mid-battle centuries ago, the world is simply enormous. There are about 20 maps, almost every map is huge and it is all open to exploration. Because there are only few and short loading times, you are practically flowing from one into the next as in a continuous world. And exploring the endless and open Xenoblade world is not only fun to do but also very rewarding.The grass moves around your feet, birds sweep over your head, clouds roll by day, the galaxy scintillates at night and the whole world comes alive around you. In the heat of the battle the hits and special moves will be accompanied by impressive anime graphical events. Up close the characters may not be that detailed but the characters, their weapons and the environments have all been designed with great artistry. When the limitations of the Wii are reached you probably will not notice it either. Xenoblade has far better graphics than all the other notable Wii JRPG, such as The Legend of Zelda, Okami or Rune Factory: Frontier. My Wii had never produced such a visually advanced game!THE STORY DRAWS YOU IN AND NEVER LETS GOAs any seasoned RPGer would tell you, the story is equally important to the graphics and the music, if not more so. And Xenoblade excels in this aspect as well. A tad clich&eacute;d at times, the story advances with beautifully made cinematic sequences and it manages to feel both reassuringly familiar and surprisingly fresh.The human colonists (the Homs) are living on one of the frozen titans, Bionis, and are attacked by mechanical life-forms (the Mechons) who occupy the other. So, after the initial battle, it is up to Shulk, your hero, the young survivor from Colony 6 and the new bearer of Monado, together with (up to 3 of) his companions to save their world.You bond with your companions by the choices you make - and this affects their abilities. Your choices also affect both the conversation options with Non-Playing Characters (NPCs) and the quests becoming available to you. In fact, everyone and their sister seems to have a quest for you. Conveniently, you do not have to go back to them once completed.Xenoblade will enchant you with its sound vistas and ensnare you with its story.WIELD THE BLADE THAT SEES INTO THE FUTUREAs with any true RPG, there is leveling up, looting, crafting, bartering and re-equipping your character as well as his companions. Interestingly, the custom appearance you chose for them will not be lost during the cinematic scenes. If you enjoy earning achievements, Xenoblade has you covered. The game allows you to save almost anywhere but it also autosaves at nicely spaced Landmarks - and dying will only take you back to the last one encountered (without any XP or loot penalties).The battle system is real-time but both the distance to their enemy and your relative position are factored in (hint: for such an oversized sword, backstabbing strangely pays off). Monado has powers that are unleashed after building up normal attacks. The legendary sword also allows you to glimpse into the future in order to avert enemy blows. Moreover, your hero and his companions have special abilities, called Arts (that need to recharge before they can be reused).The enemies, especially the bosses, will focus on the character inflicting the most damage to it - and this allows for flanking maneuvers by the rest of your party. Most battles are not that hard however some of the bosses will tax your understanding of the game mechanics.Equally important is that is not a one-ride-pony. Once the game is completed you can restart the entire story with your high level character to complete and explore everything you missed the previous time around.Xenoblade-Chronicles gives you the option to experience it either dubbed in (in the UK version, British accented and not lip-synched) English or in (partially) subtitled original Japanese. After I had clocked in about half a dozen hours in the game I decided to restart it and opted to keep the original Japanese instead. After all, this is a JRPG and it feels much more authentic.A classic masterpiece, not to be missed.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000ID61","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"\"If I Go Down, I'm Taking You with Me!\"  (by Laura)","reviewText":"*The title is a quote from the final boss, Andross*A more accurate rating for this game, overall, is really 4.5 stars; but, of course, Amazon won't let you grade in \"half stars.\"  A true masterpiece, Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64, and perhaps even all time.  I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I'm normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing!  Analyzing its features step by step, it's pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn't be loved:Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating!  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing!  Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate.  You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes!  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what's happening.Characters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game!  Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of \"the tough guy with a secretly caring heart.\"  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy.  Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense).  Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can't help but feel a degree of liking for each of them.  Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy's, \"It's Quiet . . . too quiet.\" is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game.  You often can't help but think, \"I shouldn't be laughing at this,\" but you'll laugh anyway.  It's just that kind of game.  The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them).  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn't particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it.  Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you're newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you.  If someone gets shot down, you'll miss him.  Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful.  The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air.  Though many stages take either a purely generic \"spacial\" theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive.  In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the \"wavy\" effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works!  The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can \"warp\" to.  Though it probably looks like you've taken a medication or something else you shouldn't have, you can't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it's dependent upon your actions in the levels.Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it's easy or hard to master).  The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn.  This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you'll pretty much have them down!  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I'm usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they're pretty tough if you don't know how to handle them right).  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one!  In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there's no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there's no password feature either.  You'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason.  While it's not a deal breaker, this game isn't for the busy person who's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit.  If you want to experience the true value of this game, you'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it.  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, \"This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!\"Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department!  It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding.  The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well.  I can't describe any of this justly, though; you'll have to listen for yourself!Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn't reared their ugly heads.  Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers.  Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths!  The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever!  Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it's at now.  A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}

The game has some historical accuracy; with regards to the events occurring around the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath.As  with most games there were good and not so good features...let me explainThe Pros:1.)The game was fun to play; the battles certainly are gut wrenching and tend to sweep you up emotionally into them.2.)Good maps, with clear cut instructions as to what needs to be done to complete a mission.3.)Easy to program your units to build troops, vehicles and armored units etc.4.)Many advanced abilities are available to choose from, by spending your Experience Points, (earned in battles) for upgrades.5.)Easy, anytime game saves.6.)Interesting cut movie scenes before and after each mission.The Cons:1.)During the chaos of battle, I found it very difficult to accurately control some units; either getting them to go where I wanted them to go AND/OR do what I wanted them to do. Because there were often multiple units (represented by icons) close together it was sometimes hard to accurately click on the appropriate icon with the CORRECT mouse button. Probably the worst example of this was to try to get a manned artillery cannon pointed the right way and then get them to fire on a specific target. (while all hell was breaking loose and you needed that cannon  in a hurry).2.)A limited total number of units (units encompass personnel + buildings +  vehicles) at any one time, in any given mission. I seemed to be forever at my unit limits with no way of producing a set of tanks  to help my buildings or troops that were being ravaged by German Panther and Tiger tanks. (In other words. I had to let many  troops die in order to free up 'space' to make some heavy armor units).3.)However, the most frustrating thing to me was the spontaneous regeneration of German armor or troops in an area you just spent a half hour clearing. (and of course you won these battles by the skin of your teeth with barely any troops or armor left).4.)The tutorial, while it gives the bare basics of game play; has very little in-depth instruction.5.)The computer AI running the enemy could do anything, anywhere and all at once; where as you, the gamer, can only act in one place, on one unit at a time. Hardly seems fair.6.)Picking an upgrade (by spending your hard earned Exp. Points) seemed a trial and error affair; what worked well in one mission, may be of limited  use or even useless in another (often, with the end result being restarting level to try to find something more useful).A decent RTS war game, that had great potential, but, I felt, just fell short. I  found myself continually frustrated by my inadequate, one click of the mouse button at a time response, compared to the all encompassing AI that ran the enemy. 3  Stars.R. NicholsonP.S. As an alternative RTS World War II game, I would suggest \"War Front\". Although not as historically accurate as CoH, (it also had some 'what if' scenarios thrown in as well), but it at least had a set-up that allowed the 'gamer' more control over the production and deployment of his troops, buildings and armor.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2007"}

Not exactly the preferred way of playing, but that's how it went, and it skewed my view of the game.The second one takes the concerns and doubts I had and dashed them, leaving me with a fantastic game that has me hungry for more. My one caveat is that this game rewards co-op, with more enemies and more loot being available with more players (it scales!). Unfortunately, it also punishes solo runs, as many of the skills and mechanics just aren't worth using if you're not on a team.There is a pretty good scaling system, where you feel like a badass for about 30 minutes before finding a new enemy type that can completely bring you back down to earth. Then you work your ass off for a few hours and are rewarded with a new gun that makes you feel like a badass for about 30 minutes before finding... well, you get the idea.The formula is obvious, but it works, because of the varying strategies necessary to defeat certain enemies and the difference in locales (snow, deserts, mountains, etc).

Here is our review of how it performs compared with our Wii and PS3.First, if you're going for an XBox 360, make sure you're getting a unit with a hard drive, and get a wireless controller. The hard drive lets you download updates for your games, add your own music to soundtracks, save as many save files as you want, and do a number of XBox Live functions. They even now offer tv shows and movies to download. Believe me - you're only getting 20 gig, and it'll fill up quickly! You want to have that hard drive.Most importantly, you can NOT play any old XBox (original) games if you don't have the hard drive. That is because the old games have to be 'converted' by software on the hard drive to be able to play in your new system. Not that not all games play on the 360 - but the most popular ones do.Comparing this to the Wii, it's a different market area. The 360 has much better graphics than the Wii does. That's on purpose - the Wii doesn't support high definition. The Wii's motion-sensing controllers are actually a *ton* of fun for sports and party games, so if you like to play a lot of golf or \"party fun\" types of things, you might swing towards the Wii. If you're more a hard core gamer and love games like FarCry or Prey, it's the 360 that you'll want.The harder comparison is between the XBox 360 and the PS3. Both support high definition graphics. Both have incredible RPGs on them (Fable, Final Fantasy). Both have incredible combat style games on them (Gears of War, Resistance). Both have hard drives for easy game saves, both have wireless controllers which I love. Both play previous-gen games.One way to look at this is that you should get the system that supports the franchises you love. If you are completely addicted to Final Fantasy, go with the PS3. That way you can play all the old FF games and enjoy the new ones. If you are a Halo Head, and play Halo 24 hours a day, then the XBox 360 is your sure bet.But what if you fall in the middle? I can tell you the 360 is really loud - but the PS3 gets really hot. Both seem prone to failure if poorly cared for - but both have worked perfectly fine for us so far. What else would swing your vote?With the huge head start XBox has on the Live feature, I would have to give a nod to the XBox if you are interested in online multiplay. Sure, both the 360 and the PS3 support it - but XBox has had it for years, and many people have built up quite a network. There are tons of people online at all hours of the day or night. It's been tried, tested, and is stable.On the other hand, if you're looking for an all-in-one media center, the PS3 with its 60 gig hard drive has the advantage. It makes it super easy for you to organize your photos, music, and much more right in the system. You don't have to siphon things from your PC or come up against quickly running out of space. I still question why the 360 only has 20 gigs of data - and they fill almost half of it up right away with system files. With Microsoft now offering to let you download high definition movies - at about 5 gig each - that's going to fill up your entire hard drive after only one or two movies. They really need to offer larger hard drives quickly.But until then, if you're an online player, a Halo fan, or just can't get your hands on a PS3 and are tired of playing low-def games, I highly recommend the XBox 360. There are a ton of games on this system that we love, and we actively use it. Even with the Wii and PS3 in the house, there are many games that are great on the XBox 360 and we choose to play them.Let me know if you have any specific questions on this system!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}

Video games are something that everyone should enjoy, not just the people who own the companies that make them. Now I understand that they're going to be over $200 dollars, but anything over $500 is insane. When the playstation 2 and xbox came out they were about $150 dollars, and the games were $50 and under. Sadly, like most people I will have to wait until the prices on the games and the consoles go down. Just to let you know all of that was my opinion, if you can afford the new consoles then go out and buy one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2006"}

{"product_name":"B002ELCUUG","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Casual Gamers Rejoice, Seasoned Gamers Flee","reviewText":"After hearing tons of amazing reviews on LBP and having recently purchased a PS3 I felt obligated to play this game. It's a love it or hate it game for most and the general consensus of reviews had been positive. So from all the \"must buy\" and \"revolutionary\" statements about the game I needed to see it for myself.Gameplay 6 of 10Were I to compare this to any other game in history it would have to be Super Mario World from the SNES. It is quite simply put a platform game. There are various mechanisms used and some advancement in how you go about getting from place to place, but essentially your goal is to reach the end of a level intact. The style is unfortunately the most off-putting portion of the game for me. It's not even that the game looks like a five year old designed it. It's that the general feel of the game is so simplistic, so geared toward average or casual gamers. I suppose I am still on the fringe because I can't relate to this game at all. Despite the fact that some older or hardcore type gamers find it interesting, it was clearly designed with a toddler in mind.You play as a \"Sackboy\" who is on an adventure to somewhere through this Little Big Planet made of sackcloth, cardboard and all manner of toy box items. It is very imaginative and some will definitely consider it cute. What bothers me most about the gameplay are the limited movement options. You can run, jump and grab onto things. That's it. There is literally nothing else your sackboy can do. Jumping takes you maybe the height of sackboy off the ground at best.Levels average out to be around 15-20 minutes each by the end of the game, depending on how difficulty and your skill level. The planet is shaped like Earth, with all our continents and countries have 4-6 levels each. So far I'd been in Central America, Japan and Europe I believe. This mostly determines the artistic style of the level and a few of the gadgets you'll use.What you are trying to do is pick up these bubbles throughout each level. Some contain nothing (like coins from Mario) and others contain stickers and objects for decorations. And you try to get the high score for that level which you can compare with your friends and what not. These stickers can be used to decorate your box or user created levels as well as programmed levels. I did not bother with the level creator, because I wasn't that impressed with the main game and I'm not very imaginative myself.Difficulty 8 of 10 (10 being hardest)As many have explained, this game could not be conquered by a mere child. And I agree with the sentiment. The reason is not just because it's challenging. And this killed most of the fun for me. After playing for a few days I found myself losing interest rather quickly as the mechanics have a lot to be desired. For example when you grab onto things you have to let go to jump and opposed to jumping as you let go. Also, when you press the jump button it not's actually programmed to jump the same every time. It is the worst part of the mechanics. There is no sprint, no double jump and really no special ability at all. These are all almost obligatory in a platforming game. And in a sense, by making it more simplistic they made the game harder to complete as well. This seems counter-intuitive.Graphics 9 of 10The visuals in LBP are really impressive in many ways. It appears that someone dumped a toy box out and put the pieces in this game. But the shading and light and reflections really bring the brilliance of the colors to life. Graphics are definitely the crowning achievement for LBP in my opinion. They still look good compared to current games; maybe not mind blowing but very good nonetheless.Level Design 7 of 10I'd say the levels are definitely inventive and provide a continuous change of scenery. It can be fun for a while. And I'm sure there are some hardcore gamers that even liked this game. But once again, the game really takes a step or two back in complexity. The levels are essentially 2D with a few inches of depth, like hiding spots for the stickers. What I believe this game was really designed to do is hide a basic 2D platform game under the guise of a supposedly revolutionary 3D game which appeals to a large audience because the learning curve is so flat.Incentives and Fun Factor 5 of 10This is ultimately the reason I decided to get rid of this game. It offers no reason for me to replay it and the fun becomes boredom by the end. At best it is mildly entertaining to press the action button over and over. At worst it will frustrate the living daylights out of you. Stickers and decorating my cardboard box are the incentive? I'm sorry but that is easily the lamest idea of extras I've ever heard of. Outfits are really the only redeeming factor in the incentive dept. which are various in type and number. Such things as an Elizabethan outfit or the Solid Snake outfit are fun to wear but still have that persona of a toy box.ConclusionI can see how people are drawn to this game, but if you strip away the graphics and the level creator what are you really left with? In essence, this is IMHO Super Mario Brothers 3. In fact, it's less complex than even that. What needs to be considered is the reason why it's rated so high. One needs to really take into account the type of people reviewing this with critical acclaim. I challenge you as a potential buyer to go through the reviews and find three reviews that are a.) longer than a single paragraph (or sentence!) b.) says anything about the controls c.) from a person that has reviewed a single other game. I believe the main problem is that when a new genre is created or an old one is re-imagined people automatically tout it as amazing because they want a break from FPS games. But if you take a closer look, it's really not that impressive. There are far better platform games - Ratchet and Clank for example. I would recommend that if the artistic quality intrigues you then you should definitely rent it. But otherwise, this is a casual gamer's dream game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Mike Harris","summary":"This is not Simple Simon who eats pies, this is Simon the Knight!!","reviewText":"This game is very hard, but very fun at the same time!

The one thing I do want to say is that there is quite a bit to have in this set-up. First you have Portal, which is a game based a simple premise. You are a test subject, promised thewonder of freedom and cake, and you get to move forward by completing tasks. The first few tasks are simply ones that teach you how to do things, and the nexyt ones are ones you get you use the Portal gun on.The gun is a device that allows you to fire an orange and blue circle onto solid object. One alows you to ente,r one to exit, and they allow you to go around normal things. This allows you to get involved in new tests, to do interesting things, and to keep it all keeping on. The entrance and exit are not slaves to gravity, to speed, or to general laws. So, running or faling into a hole means that you leave doing that same thing. That sometimes means being flung, bouncing through the holes, and doing all sorts of other stuff thatis limited only  by the user's imagination.If it has a downside it is this: some of the stuff is not easily done. It is an easy game, ending in 8 hours max (and that's going slow), and the song at the end will make you laugh and possibly make you port it to an I-Pod (I jhad to because it stil makes me smile). you get a lot of comedy, a lot of fuin, and it is all worthwhile. This is a solid 5 with the note that you want more (and more is coming in 2011).Half-Life 2 picks up with Gordan Freeman after the Black Mesa incident. It places you on a train in a mysterious place called City 17, where a force called the Combine is taking over. Here you do all sorts of stuff, going through the city with people you know from earlier games in the hope of liberating everyone.Good luck with that.The controls are easy, things go from first person, and you can sprint fast. The only flaw is perhaps jumping, where you barely clear anything unless you get a nice condition. Still, this isn't really a downside. you have a gravity gun (you can pick up stuff and use it as a weapon, plus you can shock the living crap out fof stuff), a crowbar, a submachine gun, a pulse rifle, a shotgun, a magnum pistol, a regular pistol, grenades, and a powerbow and sometimes the rocket launcher. Each has an up and a down, and you can get really good with anything. You also have some ammo that allows for some amazing stuff, giving you some cool extras on you guns.The combine have a lot of stuff to throw back. Thye have people, things that make \"zombies\" out of them, machies, camerbots, floating devices with bblades, floating gunships, and so much more. They also own the world and, well, the world is a weird wreck. This leads to 12 - 15 hours of play AND it has a lot of exploring area. It is a sexy game, too, and really gets a 5.Episode 1 picks up after this and it is the same in a lot of ways. It has all of this and a little more, with the storyline going on. It ends rather suddenly, too, and has around 4 hours of playtime. I say 4 for it, but a solid 5 when added to the whole.Episode 2 is bigger in scale and it involves saving someone as well as the world. Gordon gets a little love crush in these games and, wel, you get used to it. This is a great thing here because I actually wanted to save the girl. It is the same in a lot of respects, has some amazing shootouts, and has an ending that leaves you feeling - odd. It is solidly a 5 in my book and adds around 6 - 8 hours of play.and team fortress - i am not a player in this respect so another reviewer must go here.Five games at this cost - why would you aviod it? i love this set; I recently started playing it ahgain and, in the years after i beat it, it hasn't lost a thing. You need to get it if you don't and love it. One note, however. i hgad a copy and it simply stopped playing. I could do anything with any other game but, with this one, I had to replace it. After i did so, it was like nothing happened. So, that can happen. Still, I have heard this with other games and it isn't a game-related thing in and of itself. 5 out of 5 - sexy stuff. You will love it long time,","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2010"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

However, FC2 has absolutely nothing to do with the first game in any way, shape, or form.  The location is different, the story is different, the characters are different, and the style of gameplay is different.  The cover art even looks like it was inspired by a Grand Theft Auto game.  This makes sense, as FC2 is the first Far Cry game to truly be a real open-world sandbox where you can freely explore the entire environment and take on tasks and missions at your leisure.  In reality, there are several problems that rear their heads as the game progresses, but ultimately there's a lot more good than bad and FC2 proves itself a worthy successor to Crytek's original.FC2 takes place in an unknown African country that's been torn apart by years of internal power struggles and civil war.  Two dominant factions have ultimately emerged: The United Front of Liberation and Labor (UFLL) and the African People's Revolutionaries (APR).  A notorious, but elusive arms dealer known only as \"The Jackal\" has been supplying weapons to both sides, thereby prolonging the conflict.  Thousands of people have died and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.  Your ultimate goal is to track down and assassinate the Jackal by any means necessary.  However, as the story continues, this straightforward objective becomes distorted, as an enemy may become your ultimate ally and your \"friends\" probably shouldn't be trusted so easily.You won't get far in FC2 without currency, which comes in the form of solid diamonds.  There are exactly 1000 diamonds in the entire game, and are used to buy stuff like new weapons, upgrade manuals, and increased ammo holsters.  The diamonds can be acquired through different means, either by doing main missions for the two factions, performing assassinations of key people for an outside party, or tracking down 221 briefcases randomly scattered throughout the massive environment by using a built-in tracker on your GPS.  Before you can actually buy items from the weapon shops, you have to first unlock them by performing side missions for the shop owner where you destroy a rival convoy.  After doing so, new items and equipment will then become available.What makes FC2 stand out from all the other FC games is its strict emphasis on hardcore realism.  The health system is unique compared to other games.  If a segment of the health bar is partially drained, it will fully recover after a few seconds provided you don't take further damage.  However, if the segment drains completely, you'll be forced to inject yourself with a medical syringe, which will instantly restore all health segments to 100%.  You can only carry a limited number of syringes, so if you run dry, you're screwed.  This means that stealth becomes your most valuable asset.  The bad news is that you don't get any feedback at all on just how visible you are to enemies.  The best you can do is stay crouched in tall grass and underbrush, travel only at night, use suppressed weapons, and buy the Camo Suit upgrade from the store, which supposedly makes it even harder for enemies to spot you.  Enemies will continuously respawn in the world whenever you leave a certain area.  Also, you can't track or mark enemies at all; you just have to watch the environment carefully to manually find where they are.  Luckily, you have a monocular that can be used to mark key items like ammo piles, medicine cabinets, and sniper/RPG positions.  These places show up on a magical map that you pull out and look at in real time, instead of going to a pause menu.  The map can also be used to find your way around the environment more accurately, as there's a severe lack of street signs or recognizable landmarks.Given this set-up, the combat in FC2 supports the gritty realism the game strives for.  There are many different weapons you can ultimately unlock, including assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols, machine pistols, grenade launchers, IEDs, heavy machine guns, and other unique and unusual weapons.  They are classifed into three categories: Primary, Secondary, and Special, with your machete filling up a permanent fourth slot.  Given that you can't have two weapons from the same category, it becomes a strategic challenge to build the best loadout possible so you can be successful in a wide variety of combat situations.  For instance, a sniper rifle allows for long-range kills, a heavy machine gun provides powerful close-range firepower with a massive ammo box, and a suppressed pistol allows silent kills that don't reveal your exact position to enemies.  The myriad of weapon combinations keep the combat new and refreshing instead of stale and tedious.As amazing and immersive as FC2 is, there are some design issues that can really test people's patience, and their impact is felt with full force on the hardest difficulty setting, Infamous.  It is, without a doubt, the most grueling and unforgiving setting out of all the Far Cry games.  The biggest issue is not that the crosshair option is disabled, forcing you to aim down the sight to have any hope of actually hitting anything, or that enemies are ungodly accurate, or that they can dish out overwhelming damage, or even that some of them have superhuman senses and can detect you in tall undergrowth at nighttime while you're wearing a camo suit.  No, it's actually the fact that your carrying capacity is next to nothing.  Initially, you're only able to carry one or two spare pieces of ammunition and only three medicine syringes.  Upgrading as much as possible can increase the medkit size to five, but for other weapons, you're only given one extra piece of ammo.  It's even worse when you're using weapons from categories that enemies never use, as you can't automatically gain extra ammo by picking up weapons from their dead bodies.  Later in the game, enemy vehicles use heavy machine guns and grenade launchers, which completely rip you to shreds and can even instantly kill you with one hit.  It doesn't help matters any that the weapons all eventually degrade with extended use, which leads to frequent jams, misfires, and even the weapon just breaking apart in your hands.  Since you can't mix weapons from different classifications, you can't create the magic loadout that will allow you to effectively take on both vehicles and infantry at the same time with larger ammo reserves.  Also, the machete is completely useless for the most part, since you can't silently kill someone with it.  It's only good for cutting down environmental obstacles and finishing off enemies who are severely wounded.  Basically, all this comes down to trying to avoid contact with enemies as much as possible and only engaging them when it's required as part of an objective.  Luckily, there's no achievement for completing FC2 on Infamous difficulty, and the game can actually be more well-balanced on some of the lower difficulty settings.The production values in FC2 are absolutely amazing.  The graphics, powered by the Dunia Engine (another proprietary Ubisoft engine) are photo-realistic, just like an actual movie.  It's a wide collage of several diverse and different types of African landscapes, including sandy deserts, swampy rivers, overgrown jungles, rocky mountains, and vast savannahs.  The texture quality is immaculate and the draw distance is breathtaking, especially when you're soaring high above on a paraglider.  There's also a dynamic weather system in place, with a full day-and-night cycle that showcases enthralling lighting effects, as well as some occasional rainstorms.  The audio is just as spectacular.  Gunfire sounds loud and menacing, explosions are big and meaty, and additional ambience like animal noises, rushing water, and wind blowing through the foliage just immerses you entirely.FC2 is not a game you can figure out completely in just a few minutes.  You have to take the time and really know what it's all about before you can fully appreciate it.  Its steadfast allegiance to gritty realism and total freedom in regards to tactical combat immediately distinguishes it from other linear, restrictive FPSs with regenerating health.  Yes, Infamous difficulty is relentlessly unforgiving, but you're not forced to use it if you don't want to.

{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","summary":"Still a broken mess several months later","reviewText":"I purchased this game on launch day and went through the crazy nightmare that was trying to connect to a server. I didn't let the bad press keep me from giving the game a shot and I waited. I waited for several days, then several weeks, and then eventually at the 1 month mark I decided to give it a rest and try again several months later. I reinstalled the game just yesterday and though I can connect to a server now, the broken gameplay elements from day 1 are still present and make the game pretty much unplayable in my eyes.Traffic is still managed incredibly poorly, and I've literally had to build non-continuous streets to ensure the maximum number of right turns are available, since 4-way intersections pretty much clog up traffic to horrid levels. Even with public transportation systems built in and bus stops all over the place it is just a nightmare just trying to help sims get around town. And I don't know who decided not to build subway stations, which would've significantly alleviated the traffic problems. The entire education system is broken still, with my nuclear power plants having meltdowns despite having an entire university with nearly every department available for my city. I don't know what system is managing the flow of workers, but I keep getting un-skilled workers flooding my job market while my own city just falls apart.I even built a city using just cheat codes because I just wanted to build a cool city that was really-high tech to bypass the mess of problems I was having in building something the old fashioned way - and even then everything doesn't work. I can't even hire workers for my power plant to get anything to run so I just keep hemorrhaging money as I desperately try to figure out what's wrong. I even built a neighboring city with the sole purpose of providing power, and that STILL doesn't fix the issue.Also, the city size as many have noted is just incredibly tiny. There is no way you can build a bustling metropolis unless you invest heavily in time and energy into many smaller cities just to support the 1-2 big ones and continuously invest and upgrade. While that was one of the fun parts I was looking forward to doing in sim city, the fact that they force me to struggle just to manage even the most basic tasks ruins the experience almost entirely. Simply put, you will very likely get incredibly frustrated and angry just trying to play the game because of how fundamentally broken it as and because you're just not having fun. It's not the good kind of challenge where you're interested and want to find a way to accomplish the goal. This game is more an exercise in futility as you struggle to get even the most basic tasks to work.If you are looking for a fun way to build a city and have a good time watching it grow...pick up one of the earlier sim city games. Avoid this title and send the message to EA and Maxis that we won't stand for a game that cannot run properly several months into its release. There's a reason that nearly every person I know that bought this game asked for a refund and got it with no questions asked. Please save yourself the trouble and try out any of the other fantastic games available today that are worth your time.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Cannot Add More to Already Well Reviewed Game","reviewText":"As the title of my review states, not much can be added about a game that has received internet wide reviews praising the fun and addicting gameplay that is Batman Arkham City.So, I will write this, assuming you only get you reviews from Amazon, or maybe you buy games very rarely. Maybe you are a parent debating whether to get this for the kids.Batman Arkham City is a depiction of Batman and Batman's world very similar to the re-imagined version created shown in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. The best way to describe the style of this game is as if the very excellent Batman cartoon series from the 90s were taken and made to appear realistic, rough, and jaded. Voice acting is excellent and many of the voices will be recognized by the Batman fans. The cutscenes are animated so well, they would make a good feature film on their own.The concept of Arkham City is non-linear gameplay where Batman has the ability to roam a large portion of the city. Very close comparison could be Assassin's Creed. As most Batman stories, this takes place during the night time. This works out extremely well because you will be surround by many light sources and various shades of dark which makes it look great. Neon lighted signs, crumbling apartment buildings, dark alley ways, steam coming from the sewers all make for a great atmosphere which you just want to explore instead of going towards your goal immediately. The city is occupied or fought over by various factions of villains, gangs, and individuals. There is plenty to do.Batman Arkham City is rated T for Teen. In case you were wondering, there is plenty of violence but of course we do not see gore and blood much, even though it is there. Some very violent content is either suggested or happens behind the scenes. Some thugs say very vulgar things. You can hear some usage of four letter words but rarely, but there is still a lot of bad language. So if you want your kids to avoid that kind of content, keep that in mind. There is not too much sexuality, except the suggestive conversations and tight body suits.Technically this game runs really well on the Xbox 360. It is not 60 frames per second, but solid 30 frames without any slow down in crowded areas or when viewing large vistas of the city. Textures look great. All sharp and well shaded.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"Dexter \"Dexypoo\"","summary":"I love this game (Update)","reviewText":"So here is an updated review. I have had the game since it came out and I absolutely love it. I have started to get the hang of the technical aspects of the game and I can now play it on normal difficulty and win most of the time. I used to have a pretty hard time on the easy setting. As you progress and the game gets easier you definitely should consider stepping up the difficulty because it will force you to fight smarter and use more techniques.I completely understand why this game is getting mixed reviews. It takes a while to get the hang of. I honestly wouldn't have had the patience to learn the controls if I wasn't an MMA fan. That is part of the reason I don't really like playing other sports titles like Madden.The overall gameplay is fun and exciting with a somewhat steep learning curve, however if you start out on easy and move up you can work your way into the game without feeling too lost. The game is a bit lacking what it comes to things to do other than career mode. I feel like there should be different types of career modes and game modes to relive past big fight moments. Also the challenges in this game are more like tutorials and lack any sort of real challenge or reason to even go through them. The career mode can also get boring when you have to go through the ultimate fighter fights every time you start a new career. Those are kinda boring and annoying. The training in between fights is also boring and doesn't really give you enough rewards to make you choose to not skip through them. I see what they were going for but the implementation is just off.I feel like the game is fun when it counts though, which is when it comes to the fighting. The next iteration of this game will hopefully have more things to do, and challenges to complete, but overall I have been playing this game non-stop and I really like it a lot. It comes down to if you are willing to spend time learning the controls or not. Once you learn them it is fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2014"}

Roman","summary":"You want a new take on an old story? You got it!","reviewText":"During the last console generation, a game for the Xbox came out called Panzer Dragoon Orta. It featured great art direction, some of the best graphics on the system, an incredible soundtrack, and an enjoyable story. The game did miserably sales-wise, and as a result, barely gets mentioned when people make lists for the best Xbox games. Enslaved reminds me a lot of that- it became a bargain title after just a few months, and despite having a good fan base, it sold so poorly that any plans for a sequel were scrapped pretty quickly. It's a shame too, because Enslaved is one of the best gaming experiences I've had this generation. I tried out the demo last year when it first hit the PSN and was hooked immediately. Right off the bat, they show you how the game is with combat and platforming. Other games took up my time, so I didn't get to buy the game until just a few months ago, but after just completing it a few minutes ago, I can honestly say that I wouldn't have felt ripped off if I had paid the original retail price. The only thing that keeps it back from 5 stars? A lack of polish.Enslaved takes place in North America, 150 years from now, after the world has been devastated by war, and very few people and animals have survived. The world is overrun with robots called Mechs, and the few humans that remain are being captured and put into slavery. You play as Monkey, a musclebound man stuck on a slave ship that's starting to fall apart in the sky. A young girl named Trip is on the ship as well, and she's headed right for the last escape pod. Monkey makes it to the pod, but once it lands/crashes, he's rendered unconscious. When he wakes up, it turns out that Trip has enslaved him with a crown that puts Monkey in quite a situation. If Trip dies, he dies. If he's about to hurt her or strays too far, she can stop him dead in his tracks. Trip need his help to get back to her home safely. She's rigged the crown so that they can communicate directly with one another, and created a cool little dragonfly scanner that lets her help Monkey know what dangers there are in any given area. It's going to be a long journey for the both of them, and it's not just because of the Mechs either.First things first, I LOVE the setting of this game. So many games and movies these days have a desolate, dead look for the post-apocalyptic world, which, while it makes sense a lot of the time, gets boring fast. How sick are you of seeing greys and browns over and over again? Enslaved's world is lush with tons of life to be seen. Beautiful forests and jungles, waterfalls, blue skies, everything. Why? Because even though most life was cleared out, nature started to take over again. Buildings are covered with plants growing around and through them, and it looks great. Roads ripped apart, creating canyons where water runs through...it's all very appealing, and there were many times when I'd stop what I was doing just to wander around and enjoy the scenery. Monkey and Trip are a great duo to follow along too, and the voice work and animations on both are a home run. Trip might have a sad story, but the writers knew when to put in some good humor, which was apparent in the first chapter when Monkey's cussing Trip out from the outside of the escape pod and she can't hear anything. But with all of this good stuff, the game really shines with the platforming aspect. Monkey lives up to his name, flipping around and leaping great distances to get where he needs to go. It's not a difficult part of the game at all, but man is it fun. There were a good number of scenes where I got into it, worrying about if the next thing Monkey held onto was going to break, or if I was going to escape from a trap in time. All you do is move the stick in the direction you need to go (as long as there's an object you can hold onto there), press the X button, and Monkey's there. There's no misguided jumps or falling because of bad camera angles, and it feels nice not fighting with the camera. Combat is sadly a little simple. Square and triangle give you regular and heavy attacks, and as you upgrade your abilities with Tech Orbs, you can get a few new moves too. Monkey attacks with his fists sometimes, but his main weapon is his cool staff that obliterates everything in his way. I was glad to see him using some real bo moves and nothing flashy like in a lot of other action games where your character is flying all over the place. X makes Monkey roll to evade, and you can also put up a shield to block attacks for a short time.But wait, there's more! Monkey can even shoot bolts of plasma from his staff when you need to do some long range attacks, which is usually the case during parts of the game where you're taking cover from enemy fire. At first I thought this part would get dull, and was tacked-on, but it's a key part of the game that goes on until the end. I'm sure by now you're also wondering if Trip is yet another helpless character you're stuck protecting (think ICO). Well, she is and she isn't. Trip's smart enough to stay out of things that she can't handle, and even has a neat decoy that she can display for a brief time, distracting enemies so Monkey can get hurry through an area or sneak up on a machine gun and disable it. Still, there are other times when enemies can attack her, and you'll need to be quick to save her before it's all over. It doesn't happen much though, so she shouldn't be getting on anyone's nerves. Add to the fun gameplay a very memorable soundtrack and fantastic character models and facial animations, and you've got one of the best games that went under everyone's radar....except for a few things. Enslaved is very glitchy, with lots of little problems. There were times when the audio would cut out for a few seconds, then come back at a super high speed. Some visuals in levels would magically pop in and out, some parts of levels wouldn't proceed as they should and I'd have to restart from the last checkpoint, and you can get stuck in some spots later on, requiring you to restart then too. Load times are a little slow too, but the only time loading screens show up is between chapters and when you die. Apparently there's a patch for the game, but I can't confirm this or what it does since I can't go online with my ps3 at the moment. So if you start up the game, and Monkey vanishes from a short cutscene in the first chapter, don't think it's a special power of his or anything.I could go on about more that I loved about the game, but I feel like I'm gushing enough as it is. The little issues take down the score a notch, but if it had more polish, Enslaved would easily be in my top 10 favorite games, right up there with Panzer Dragoon Orta. At the price the game's going for now, there's no reason why you shouldn't give it a shot.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

The Super Travel Case is constructed of a durable rubber shell, double zipper enclosure and a heavy-duty bag clip.

The PSP is securely held by locking the center flap; a super design feature that provides maximum interior space. It also has a huge additional slot for storing up to 4 UMD disks or other small accessories such as headphones. The Super Travel Case is the quintessential accessory for storing all of your PSP's bare necessities","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"Super*b* Travel Case","reviewText":"The best feature about this case is easily the low price.  As of this writing you can pick up this case for under $10, which is impressive since this case has a rigid shell and therefore better protects your PSP from the rigors of mobile gaming.  Fortunately, in spite of the hard shell, the case remains sleek and slim.  It will consume only slightly more space in your bag than the PSP itself.The case closes with a heavy duty zipper and features a carabiner hook, which is handy for securing the case to your bag, belt loop, etc.  Apart from the hook, the outside of the case is matte black, smooth and simple, devoid of logos, patterns or textures.  The average observer might not recognize this as a PSP case.  Personally I would consider this a bonus since you probably don't want your PSP to grow legs and walk away on you.The interior of the case holds the PSP quite snugly.  The device will actually sort of pop in and out of the case.  This is generally a good thing except for an exposed rivet inside the case.  If left alone this might wind up scratching a small corner of your PSP.  It's a simple remedy, though, as I just popped in a small piece of Dr. Scholls pad.Apart from the PSP you won't fit much inside the case.  The centre flap has padding on the PSP side to keep your screen protected.  (Although I still recommend investing in ascreen overlay).  The upper side of the flap includes two fitted web slots for UMDs.The upper lid of the case has only a small elastic web.  There is a little give to it so you can easily fit a couple more UMDs and a USB charge cable but don't plan on bringing your wall charger or AV cables.  Memory sticks should be able to squeak in as well but pay care when opening and closing the case so as not to let them fall out.On the whole I doubt you'll be able to find a better case or a better price.  If you plan to take your PSP with you frequently, I highly recommend keeping it safe with this case.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

Using games to tell a compelling story has much become a norm, and the developers did a good job too.Game QualityIf you have watched the preview, you can tell that it has excellent cinematics.  The graphics and the animation of the entire game is one of the best I've seen.  In fact, it is much better than \"Uncharted 2\" in many respects.  The voice-acting of Lara Croft is top-notch and I was blown away by her animation.  She is the younger Lara Croft with a well-deserved innocent look.  Her animation is very fluid that at times I feel like watching a live action hero in a movie.  The environment and surroundings are very impressive as well.  The interaction between Lara and her surroundings was wery well done.  For example, Lara will react to fire if you walk too close to it.  Lara will try to shield her eyes if she stands too close to an explosion.Game Play (updated)The game is very linear.  You play as Lara going through the entire movie.  While you can wander around the path, but most of the time you need to complete each objective as programmed.  The controls are well laid out and very responsive.  Lara will automatically hide behind rocks when she gets close to them, unlike Drake in Uncharted.  If you push the left button away from the rocks, Lara will automatically move away without hesitation.  Another well programmed control is the use of the bow.  If you draw the bow too early, Lara will lose her strenght and let go of the arrow - so you need to time your bow before each shot.The bow is an excellent weapon, but it doesn't do one-shot-one-kill.  You need to aim at the critical area to be able to kill with one arrow.  Arrows are available throughout the game, so there is no worry that you may run out of arrows.  There is no auto-aim.  Controlling the guns and bow are quite challenging.The only negative side of the controls is the quick-time-events.  I understand the need for them at times in the game, but they should be kept to minimal.The game was made following the food steps of Batman (Arkhum series).  There are a lot of side-quests that Lara can explore.  When you start playing the game, it will not tell you what side-quests are available.  Most of the time I discovered them by accident.  If you play the side-quests and the main game at the same time, it may take hours to finish the game.  On the base camps, you can easily jump around the map to complete the side-quests.Upgrades (updated)Lara hunts and uses her survival skills to stay alive.  The upgrade system is well planned and easy to use.  To update skills and weapons, Lara needs to collect \"salvage\" throughout the game and dead bodies.  You have to upgrade progressively.  By half game, I was able to updrade most of my weapons.  The bow was especially cool.  The bow now is multi-function and very powerful.  Because there is no auto-lock, getting one-shot-one-kill is still difficult.NOT FOR KIDS (updated)For all parents, please make sure your kids are not getting this game.  This game is definitely aimed for die-hard fan and for adults only.  There are a alot of bloods and a lot of corpse.  I played half-way of the game and there are at least 4 gruesome scenes that I had to go through.  In one level, there are almost naked dead corpse everywhere.  Almost all of them were dismembered.  In another level, Lara had to jump into a sea of blood with corpses lying around.Complete Game (updated March 19, 2013)I completed the run through of the game in about 12 hours.  So far I completed 76% of the game.  I can say I enjoyed the game very much.  While the game has its gore and blood in several chapters, I will have to say that it does add to the story line.  There are several big bosses to battle and neither of them pose any serious challenges.  To beat the big bosses, all you need are plenty of ammo and duck and evade.  After playing the game I will have to give kudos to the developer.  The graphics are top notch.  For one, you can definitely see Lara's appearance showing her being tired and worn out, especially her clothing.  Her tank tops started to shred to pieces mid-game (no nudity).  At the end of the game, she is able to hold herself up.Another great progression is how the character progression of Lara - it helps define Lara from an innocent woman to a confident killer.  The last boss finally put the two hand guns on Lara where she is able to wield them confidently (the iconic Lara and her two guns).Finally, I tried the multi-player.  While I can say that it is fun for the first few minutes, I can say that this addition is unnecessary.  The maps are not extensive and gameplay is lacking.  The entire multi-player wasn't designed as well as some of the multi-players out there.  The graphics are not desirable.  In several occasions I see glitches and missing pixels.All-in-all I enjoy the game.  The replay value is low because once you finish the game, it is unlikely you would replay it.  I may want to try it on a much harder dificulty setting, but the outcome is the same.  The only replay value is if you want to collect all the items and complete 100% of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

Now, if you use your 360 HD for only game saves, of course, 20gb will last forever; game saves run from a few k to 1mb or 2. Just like the original XBOX HD 8gb, I think was plenty of room for just game saves. (That's all I ever used mine for except for a few favorite CD's I ripped to it).But, with the 360, in my case, though I have a big pile of games, that's not all I use it for. You will find that if you use marketplace at all-downloading demos (from 700mb to over 1gb apiece) trailers, episodes of NCIS you missed, multiplayer map packs, (Halo 3's will be HUGE, I heard);etc, like I do, that 20gb fills up quick; I only had 2gb left. So, I finally decided to spend the money, picked up the drive and read the instructions for file transfer (very easy, in my case with a full drive took about 2 hours, make the connections, and let it do its thing. Now I have all of my files from before,  a bunch of new demos (I keep them for awhile while deciding to spend the money on the games or not), the content it comes loaded with-videos, and a bunch of Arcade trial games;and I still have 100gb free. To me, worth it! If you're a light user of the 360 and just use the HD for game saves though, save your money.My complaint is, MS should have given us the 120gb to begin with. But then, they couldn't make that extra $170 bucks off us, I guess. One last thing--the transfer supposedly works only once, and only from the smaller drive to the larger. Your 20gb will be wiped of content, but still has the 360 OS on it; if you attach it it will boot up, so bascially you'll have a spare drive, but will have to recover your gamertag, and re download everything, if you use it again.Summary: Worth it, and highly reocommended, if you're a heavy downloader, like me. If you don't go on line much, or don't use marketplace, you can pass.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"It is a very good game if you don't think of it as a sequel to Mario 64.","reviewText":"Most of Mario's games follow the same pattern. Bowser kidnaps poor Princess Peach, and then you collect stars until you've got enough to get to the final level. It's not I don't like that formula, but Mario Sunshine put such a unique twist on it. The game opens with Mario, Peach, and a bunch of Toads flying to a tropical island. A tour guide video comes on and IN FULL VOICEOVER says \"Welcome to the sun drenched tropical paradise of Isle Delfino! We are pleased to welcome you to our beautiful home!\" Once Mario lands it turns out that Bowser's son put on a Mario disquise and covered the island in pollution. The real Mario gets thrown in jail and is tasked with cleaning up the island. I liked the intro way better then \"Dear Mario, I baked a cake for you\". The gameplay was just as different as the opening. It still had the open world style that Mario 64 had, but it was often more focused. Normally you spray all of the gunk in your path with your handy dandy water hose, but a lot of the levels also had more puzzle elements. To knock over the giant Wiggler caterpillar you had to spray these weeds that shot a patch of land into the sky. Some levels had a platforming area where you had to just get to the end of the level. Super Mario Sunshine has a ton of variety with a beautiful beach theme. It was a nice change of pace. If you want an innovative Mario 64 sequel though, get Super Mario Galaxy. Super Mario Sunshine is a completely different idea, but it is a very fun game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}

Undoubtingly, the experiments worked beyond expectations. Mario Superstar Baseball, delivered a fun and entertaing home run with baseball madness that was fun & had some excellent minigames. But what really exploded was Super Mario Strikers, a wild and outrageous soccer game that really brought out so many kicks into the game. It really was a delightful treat for gamers everywhere, that a sequel had to be made for a second goal, and it was worth the wait.Mario Strikers Charged for the Nintendo Wii is the thried Wii title to endure with competing against gamers online through Nintendo's Wi-Fi connection, and the game delivers. The game follows in suit well and brings even more fun that Super Mario Strikers left over. The gameplay includes returning characters Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi, as well as a couple of new playable captains like Bowser, and Diddy Kong. You can also even use your Mii's you've created as captains, as you did before from Mario Party 8. The game includes new arenas that really work beautifully with the Mario experience, ranging from the traditional, to arenas where whomps drop down on you. The control here is a bit different here in the game, as you use the nunchuck controls to move your captain and crew, and you use the Wii remote to block, pass and shoot your soccer balls to score.There also is a new feature added to the game, a mega strike, where you could shoot as many as six goals at a single time at the goal. There are also new offensive tatics from the players. Wario could let out a foul odor to cause your opponents to hold their breath while your in control for the ball, and Mario could turn into a giant with his new moves. The graphics look wonderful and the gameplay is even more addictive than ever before, but the controls here take a bit to get used to, but once you complete the Strikers 101 training, you'll be able to get the gameplay down easily. There are also a few new characters  and trophies that are added to unlock for extra gameplay for exhibition competetions, including Petey Piranha from Super Mario Sunshine, who is making his attempts to score his kicks, but you'd have to unlock certain trophies in the tournaments.All in all, while there are other great games coming out that have much more hype like Metroid Prime 3: Corruption for the Wii, Mario Strikers Charged is worth the wait for sports fans everywhere. If you've loved the Gamecube edition, than you are really going to get your kicks here.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Disney and Square make a cute couple","reviewText":"I have been looking forward to this game all year. I was the first person in the mall when it opened to buy it. Needless to say it was well worth the wait. Those who say this game is terrible because it has Disney characters in it are just plain ignorant. Let me tell you something, this game is HARD! This game is a lot harder than Final Fantasy 9 and 10. The first thing gamers will notice is the unique control system which takes a few hours to get used to. The lock on system works great in battles. This is a complete change from anything ever done in Final Fantasy games. Fights occur without going to a separate fighting stage. Gamers have to be smart and fast in order to win some of the harder battles. In order to use an item, summon, ect, one must do it while battling. The enemy wont stop and wait while you figure out what you want to do. This system is fun but frustrating. I prefer the old style turn based fights. The WORST part about this game is the controls. Forget about the camera. The controls are terrible. There are times when you have to jump from one platform to another. The jumping controls are so bad you will fall most of the time. It is VERY difficult to simply jump on a box. Sora seems to float in the air and you have no idea where he will land. Very bad. The graphics are flawless. They are Disney perfect. They could not get any better. Well, except for the Gummi whip which you use to fly to different worlds. The graphics, control, sound are so bad that they simply do not belong in this wonderful game. Not to mention that the Gummi flights are just down right boring. The sound is great but it could use improvement. I thought there would be a lot more voice acting in this game like Final Fantasy X but I was wrong. Most of the game is reading. Which is fine but I was looking forward to hearing those wonderful Disney voices. The music is great but levels like Wonderland isn't so good when you've heard the same tune 50 billion times. The storyline is great. It's not as good as Final Fantasy storylines but it's the best it could be for Disney. Bottom line,...I dare you to play this game on the hardest level, collect all the secrets, beat it in under 30 hours and TRY NOT to enjoy it.

New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Racing to Victory... On Cruise Control","reviewText":"Every time Nintendo releases a new game you can always bet on them bringing over their core franchises.  The one that seems to ruffle the most feathers and delight the most is always Mario Kart.  The gameplay is often fun, simple and it's easy for just about anyone to pick up.  It's also a series that has what can be considered a tried and true formula.  Mario Kart has retained its familiar formula for two decades now and it's not going to stop here.  If you've liked Mario Kart previously there's no reason not to really give the game a try.As you'd expect, Mario Kart 7 is pretty easy to slip into.  There are 32 courses in total and at least 16 of them are retro courses drawn from other Mario Kart releases.  Most of them are pretty well designed, and those who love the older courses will be pleased to find some of the classics here.  Some of them have changes to compliment some of Mario Kart 7's new mechanics.  Each race has eight racers.  There are also a ton of items to find and use as you race.If there's one thing Mario Kart has always been criticized for and praised for it's the different assortment of items.  Some familiar items that have been in Mario Kart forever return such as the mushrooms, stars and bananas.  Some of the more recent items return as well such as the bullet bill.  There are three new power ups to behold in Mario Kart 7.  The first is the fire flower which will let your hurl fireballs at your opponents for a certain amount of time.  There is also the Tanooki Leaf that gives you the Tanooki Tail to whack your enemies and finally there's the Lucky 7 which gives you seven power ups at once that you can use.  Of the three new items the Lucky 7 is the most amusing of the batch.  The fire flower seems as though it should've been a part of Mario Kart all along.  The Tanooki Tail, however, is by far the least amusing of the new items here.There is some degree of luck when it comes to winning, but there's more of a feeling that you're in control than the Wii variation where you could easily be bombarded with several items at once just seconds before the finish line.  Here, that isn't likely to happen.  You'll still find yourself hit by an item, but you won't find yourself bombarded too often in such a short period of time.  The balancing here is better to the point that there is still a little luck, but your skill is actually important here as well.There has been a lot made about the new addition to the vehicles.  The glider and the propeller.  One allows you to fly while the other allows you to traverse the water.  For the most part, these additions don't really add much to the experience.  It's amusing the first couple of times you do them, but you'll feel much more at home with your wheels planted firmly on the ground.  They're not entirely useless.  Gliding can, for example, give you an edge in some races.  It's going underwater that more or less feels no different from being on the surface.  So while they're certainly welcome additions, it doesn't really do a whole lot to enhance the experience.You'll more or less experience much of what Mario Kart 7 has to offer within a couple of hours.  Certainly there are 32 courses but you'll breeze through all of them rather quickly.  You'll also unlock drivers and a mirror mode and different parts to your Kart.  If anything the multiplayer is what is more likely to keep you coming back to Mario Kart 7.  You can play locally with friends or online and both actually work out just fine.  You can also get into coin battles and the balloon battles, which is pretty standard for Mario Kart now (and also much more fun with friends).  There's also a Mario Kart channel just like there is for the Wii.Visually, Mario Kart 7 is by far the best looking game the 3DS has at this point.  There's a lot of detail put into it and it just looks smooth.  The 3D also works out rather well, but chances are you won't actually need it to enjoy the game.  It really gives players a sense of what's around the corner for the 3DS.The only thing that really keeps Mario Kart 7 down is that it really isn't any different from the previous Mario Kart.  Things have been slightly reworked and tweaked but there isn't much offered here that other Mario Kart games aren't already going to provide for you.  The new courses are great but usually that's all you get.  Aside from that, the experience of Mario Kart 7 isn't really all that different from the previous ones.  It's not necessarily a bad thing.  It means those who've loved Mario Kart don't have much reason not to try it.  It makes for a decent game, but it sometimes walks a fine line between improving the series and becoming stale.  Regardless, the game is still good on its own and worth a look.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}

HL2 is a 3+ year old PC game and has better graphics on a mid-range PC.This game was awesome to play though, controls are intuitive and it does have next-gen console graphics.

There is one company, however, named Nintendo, and it created Donkey Kong Country. Donkey Kong Country was a game that proved that you don't need CD-based technology to make games with flashy graphics. You just need to put in effort to fit it to your console.DKC's graphics were incredible on the Super Nintendo. The game almost looked like the characters came from a CGI movie. At least, at its time. Even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements.The sounds and music were memorable. Even when you defeat a Kremling (alligator enemy), his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time. As for the music, well, you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of Kongo Jungle and the King K. Rool boss battle.The game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels. Once you go to a level, you're gonna be expecting barrel-blasting, Kremling-smashing, animal-romping fun! There is a lot to do in Donkey Kong Country. As a platformer, it doesn't disappoint with its gameplay. You can even ride atop an Animal Buddy, like a rhino or an ostrich. Rhinos can knock everybody out of its way, while the Ostrich guides you safely across the level. It can also float in the air like Racoon Mario in Super Mario Bros 3. The entire game is a bunch of fun.The multiplayer is pretty cool, too. While you can't REALLY play co-op like in the new DKC game that's out on Wii, your friend can cover in for you if you die. One player plays as Donkey Kong, and the other plays as Diddy Kong. Once one player is participating in the action, the other player can't really do anything. But if that one player dies or presses Select, then it's time for the second player to play. You can also compete against each other.To save, you must reach Candy's Save Point. Personally, I wish they added a save anytime kind of feature. But that is a minor complaint.Overall, this is a really great Super NES gem. It's worth the money. Even if you don't have a Super Nintendo, it's also out for Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color. Oh, and Wii Virtual Console too....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

But it was only $[...], so I figured I couldn't go wrong.I was soooo surprised!!! It takes a bit to get used to the controls, but they are totally manageable once you get in the groove.The action is way over the top and enjoyable; the destructible environments are an added plus, esp since some of the set pieces are downright beautiful graphic-wise. The casino/penthouse levels esp. stand out. The barrage feature is great, basically a feature that allows you to blow the living crap out of everything you see. From the parking garage shoot-out to the helicopter-shooting-at-the-boats sequence, this is one game that def. keeps the pulse racing.  The bullet time is fun, and the different stunts you can perform while blowing stuff to hell are a nice addition.The voice acting is pretty amazing(Mr. Fat is just great.....'You talk, I'll smoke....), not to mention the SOUND!

K \"Esco\"","summary":"One Word Sum Up: Incredible","reviewText":"After playing all the US released predecessors to this title, I saw the commercials and got actually mixed feelings, feeling it would be hard core, but not as epic.  Boy, was I WRONG!The gameplay matches that of Final Fantasy VI (FFIII in the US), but the controller for the playstation adds a new stability element to control.  The battle system is very simple any [person] can win random battles with the clean interface.  Also, the Materia System (magic system) is very user freindly and gives the character's powers that you can almost feel you now posess yourself.To add to this interactive realism is the greatest graphics before Resident Evil 2.  The pre-rendered backgrounds are more artistic than most entire games are, the battles are cool with cool monsters and amazing spell effects, and the Cinematics, ..., well, just WOW!To continue this interacive movie/addition to life itself is yet another great soundtrack composed by gamemusic god Nobuo Uematsu (bigger than any other composer name).  The music arranges from mysical to energetic, from simple to epic, and from peaceful to apacalyptic.  &quot;Aeris&quot;, &quot;Cid&quot;, &quot;The World&quot;, &quot;Jenova&quot; and &quot;The One Winged Angel&quot; (the last battle theme) are the best tracks in the game, and some of the finest tracks ever devised.To complete this circle, Squaresoft gave this game a storyline of true epic preportions.  While I did tear several times in earlier Final Fantasy titles, I never really CRIED, but when the big plot twist at the end of CD 1 occurs, I still ball my eyes out.  Never before has emotion and narrative been combined so well into one epic.  When done with the game (and watching the stunning ending that's beyond description), I felt like I just finished a novel, one in which was beyond the puny use of words could elaborate.  I was in awe, and I think anyone who pays attention to this game would be too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2000"}

A living, breathing city world interacts around you as you carry out missions for different gangs, run from the Police, and ultimately try to stay alive.  By harnessing the power of Playstation 2, this game displays amazing graphics, and supports a high frame rate, allowing minimal slow down during game play.  And like I mentioned, you can choose to carry out missions for various organizations, or you can wander the streets in an breath taking gaming experience.  The game also includes several mini games inluding \"Vigilante\" in which you use your (stolen) Police Cruiser to chase down specified criminals in a certain amount of time, simply amazing.  But remember, this game is rated \"Mature\" meaning it includes sexual content, graphic language and extreme violence, if you have younger kids this many not be for them, but this is of course your call.

Make sure you've got a lot of energy for this one!Ignore the plot, it really doesn't matter. The key is that you have to win 3 out of 4 mini-games, go through a boss level, then do another 3 out of 4 mini-games to progress, and so on. Each of the mini-games is different, and many are quite inventive. There are the classic \"marble in maze\" games where you tilt the controller to guide the marble. There are drawing puzzles where you have to trace, with the controller, lines on the screen. There are shooting games where you're \"run along a rail\" and all you do is point and shoot. You're shooting plungers, so this is very kid-friendly.There are numerous in-jokes in this game. For example, on one of the shooting levels, some of the rabbits that come after you are wearing the three-green-light Splinter Cell headsets. There are a set of music games where you move to the beat along with \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\" and other pop songs.There's a few costumes to unlock and a few songs for your \"jukebox\", but the game is really about getting all of the mini-games unlocked so you can play them in standalone mode by yourself or with others. That really turns this into a great party game, especially with some of the humor involved.While this is clearly aimed at kids with its non-violence and cute humor, many of the younger set will find themselves frustrated with the gameplay. The \"bunnies in the outhouse\" stands out as a mission that requires a lot of work to get through, as you have to both shake the nunchuck wildly and point carefully with the controller. It does best if you have a friend to help you out.Many of the games here require so much arm movement that you can easily wear yourself out if you have to replay them too many times. The restriction on playing this all day long might not be others who want the tv - it might be that your arms give out even though you want to keep playing!I suppose in one way that helps to ensure that kids don't play it for hours on end. Their arms won't last that long :) But that being said, I do feel a few games here are just too tough for their target audience. They'll need mom or dad to help out to get through those levels. Which is fine if mom and dad are the caring, game playing types - but could be really frustrating if they are told to just get through it on their own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2006"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47JE","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Take that Balance Board out of the closet","reviewText":"If you're like me, you got the Wii Fit, used it a few times, and put it in the closet once the novelty wore off.The best thing to happen to the Wii Fit was a little something called EA Sports Active. It was released by Electronic Arts a few months ago, and they raised the bar for what a fitness title should look like. The influence of EA Sports Active on Nintendo's Wii Fit Plus is very apparent, and the Nintendo folks did a great job of taking Wii Fit to the next level.The first thing to note is that Wii Fit Plus is not a \"sequel\" to the original Wii Fit, but rather it contains all the content of the original Wii Fit and adds a number of improvements. In other words, if you don't have Wii Fit already, you can skip it, buy Wii Fit Plus with the Balance Board. If you already have Wii Fit, you can buy the Wii Fit Plus game only.For those with the old Wii Fit, the conversion of your old profile data to the new is quick and seamless. It just takes a couple seconds and voila, all of your old weight data and workout data is available in Wii Fit Plus.The first improvement, clearly influenced by EA Sports Active, is that instead of choosing individual strength and yoga exercises ad-hoc, you can choose from a number of pre-configured workout routines. \"My Wii Fit Plus\" is a virtual locker room, where your animated balance board (as chipper and encouraging as ever) walks you through the process of choosing a workout routine based on any number of specific goals, ranging from better health to improving specific parts of your body.The activities are still broken out by category: Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics, and Balance Games. All of these are identical to the old Wii Fit, except that there there are a 6 new Yoga and Strength training exercises which add some more variety and challenge to those categories.But here's the part of the review I'm sure you've been waiting for. The biggest improvement in Wii Fit Plus is the addition of 15 \"Training Plus\" activities.Perfect 10 (Workout intensity: 2 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): A game that tests your math skills as much as your flexibility. Numbers will appear on giant mushroom, and you bump your hips to hit the numbers that add (or subtract) to 10 or 15 or 20. You won't be losing huge amounts of weight from this one, but it's a great way to test your mind and body coordination and this is one you'll play over and over again to try to beat your high score.Island Cycling (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): This is a game that uses the Balance Board (you step on the board with your left and right foot to simulate bicycle pedalling) and the Wiimote (which you use to steer). The game itself looks a lot like the cycling game on Wii Sports Resort, except you move your feet instead of your hands. Unlike that game, this game isn't timed; rather, you need to cycle around a large island collecting flags. The island is beautifully designed with amazing details. This is definitely one you can spend a lot of time on and not even realize you were exercising.Rhythm Kung-Fu (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the first game that put a huge smile on my face. Using your Wiimote, the Nunchuk, and the Balance Board, you have to strike different \"kung fu\" poses in rhythm to delightfully cheesy kung-fu movie music. It's essentially a game of \"Simon Says\", where you mimic the moves of a groups of Miis standing behind you (and if you have family or friend Miis on your system, you'll see some familiar faces).Driving Range (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): Sure, golf has been done in Wii Sports, in Wii Sports Resort, and in games like Tiger Woods PGA Tour. Wii Fit Plus brings something a little different to the table, though. You position the Balance Board vertically, and swing your Wii-mote like a golf club. There's a \"swing analyzer\" which is surprisingly good not just for casual video game golfers but also for real golfers to analyze their form. It measures the straightness of your swing, your weight distribution, and gives a pretty good indication of how far your drive will go.Segway Circuit (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): In a clever co-branding deal, Nintendo teamed up with the folks at Segway for this game. In it, you ride a Segway around the island trying to pop balloons that are being put up around the island by pesky moles. Like a real Segway, you lean forward to move forward and you lean back to go back, steering with the Wii-mote.Bird's-Eye Bull's-Eye, a.k.a. Flying Chicken (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the one you probably heard about, and it (along with Obstacle Course) is the winner. Your Mii dons a chicken outfit and has to fly from target to target. How do you fly? By flapping your arms. You can either flap your arms with your hands extended, or do a \"chicken dance\" type movement by bending your elbows. Either way, the Balance Board will amazingly detect how strongly, quickly, or slowly you're flapping. Like a real bird, you flap faster to get better control, and you flap slower to soar great distances. You control where you're moving by leaning on the Balance Board.Snowball Fight (Workout intensity: 2 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This one is just plain fun. You use the Wii-mote to shoot snowballs at an invading army of Miis (again, if you have custom Miis stored on your system you'll see some familiar faces), and duck left and right to hide behind a barricade to avoid getting hit yourself with snowballs.Obstacle Course (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This is the game I was most looking forward too, and I was not disappointed. You run in place on the Balance Board to make your character move forward and you straighten your knees to make him jump. In the process, you'll be navigating around huge swinging wrecking balls, moving sidewalks, and falling logs.Tilt City (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): I admit, I'm not so crazy about these \"tilt\" games, maybe because I'm just not very coordinated. This is a game where you need to tilt the Wii-mote and shift your weight on the balance board in a coordinated fashion to steer colored balls into the right container.Rhythm Parade (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 5 of 5): This was another one to put a huge smile on my face. You're basically a drum major, marching in place to the sound of a beat. Like rhythm games like Helix and Samba Di Amigo, you move your Wii-mote and Nunchuk to match on-screen cues. The better you match, the bigger your marching band becomes (and again, you'll see familiar faces join in the band if you have custom Miis).Big Top Juggling (Workout intensity: 3 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): No, this one won't really teach you how to juggle, but once you're done you'll have the same satisfaction as if you did know how. It's a game where you have to stay balanced on a giant ball (using your feet on the Balance Board), while at the same time keeping 1, 2, or 3 balls in the the air by flicking your Wii-mote and Nunchuk.Skateboard Arena (Workout intensity: 4 of 5, Fun 4 of 5): This seems like a pretty fair representation of riding a skateboard. You position the Balance Board vertically and stand on it like a skateboard. You can build speed by pushing off your back foot. You steer by moving your body back and forth, and you can jump by straightening your knees. You go through a series of exercises just like a real skateboarder, from jumping on ramps to riding on rails to doing tricks on half-pipes.Table Tilt Plus (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): This one is a lot like those labyrinth games where you're trying to steer a ball around holes (in this case, you're trying to get balls into holes).Balance Bubble Plus (Workout intensity: 1 of 5, Fun 2 of 5): Same sentiments as I wrote above. This is an improved version of the old Wii Fit Balance game where you're floating in a bubble trying to navigate your way through a maze.Basic Run Plus (Workout intensity: 5 of 5, Fun 3 of 5): This is a variation of the jogging game in the Aerobic games section of Wii Fit Plus. Like that game, you control this one by running in place on the Balance Board, and you're treated to a lot of great scenery and new paths to explore on Wii Fit Island. An added feature is that at the end of the game, you'll be quizzed on things you saw, which is added to your final score, which surprisingly makes the run a lot more interesting, as you make sure to carefully observe every little detail as you're running.Other improvements:1) The use of METs and report of calories burned. What does METs stand for? METs (which stands for Metabolic EquivalenTs) is a standard way to measure energy expenditure. One annoyance with the old Wii Fit was that whether you did an exercise that used no energy like a stretching exercise or one that expended vast amounts of energy like Super Hula Hoop, your progress was marked by the time spent or \"Fit Credits\" that didn't mean anything in the real world. With Wii Fit Plus, METs are used in conjunction with your body weight and the time spent to calculate the number of calories burned. There's even a neat little function in My Wii Fit Plus where you can see the number of calories you've burned in terms of food (you can even choose the type and amount of food you want to burn off and set it as a goal).2) Balance Board improvements. With the old Wii Fit, each time you started a new routine, you'd need to wait for the Balance Board to calibrate. I suppose this was intended in the case where multiple people would be sharing the Balance Board, but it got annoying very fast. Wii Fit Plus is a bit more intelligent, in that it'll sense whether the weight has changed and give the option to recalibrate only if it has. I've experienced a number of \"false positives\" in which it thought my weight changed when it didn't, but that's just a minor annoyance compared to the old way. I was actually a bit puzzled as to why the Wii MotionPlus wasn't used in this game, but with the improvements to the Balance Board they really weren't necessary.3) The ability to measure a child or pet. This is a gimmick, of course, but a totally fun one if you have the aforementioned child or pet to measure. :)Overall, Wii Fit Plus is a winner. To Nintendo's credit, they weren't content just to rest on their laurels, but they came up with improvements that truly breathed new life into the Wii Fit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Incredible piece of hardware","reviewText":"The PlayStation 3 is in my opinion the best multimedia center created to date. Most people recognize it for being able to play games, but it is also capable of playing CD, DVD, and the highly-acclaimed HD Blu-Ray format.When it comes to gaming, there is no comparison. The PS3 receives all of the large multi-platform titles such as Batman: Arkham Asylum, Modern Warfare 2 and Street Fighter IV, and also gets arguably the best collection of exclusive games on the market including Killzone, Little Big Planet and Uncharted. The PS3 is a very convenient piece of hardware and requires no extra fees after purchase, and is also very reliable. An online PSN account for the PS3 is free, and allows you to create an online profile which can earn trophies from games, add friends and also download tons of content from the PlayStation Store.The media side of the PS3 is remarkable stuff. The Blu-Ray format is in my honest opinion and underrated format. While HDTV's aren't in everyone's home, the difference between an HDTV and SDTV is huge. Blu-Ray takes full advantage of the HD format and also allows for up to 50GB of storage.This new model of the PS3 is more effective than its predecessor. Not only does it consume less power, but it is about 33% smaller and 33% lighter. It's genuinely an electronic and hardware masterpiece, and the fact that such power can be crammed into such a small unit speaks volumes about the ingenuity of the human mind.To summarize, the PS3 is a great piece of hardware that is multi-dimensional, future-proof, powerful, and is now at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

It was only one map in the warzone theme which is unpredictable in that it has you doing deathmatch, hacking, interrogations.Now that I have the full game I cannot stop playing the graphics and sound are incredible easily the best of Vita, Ipad, and Shield that I've seen. It plays so closely to killzone 3 you almost think you are playing it.I recently got into the single player and it is long with a full storyline(est.over 10 hours) (easy, medium, hard) and it says after your done you can replay again with different objectives another 2 times.I particularly like how the money earned, stats earned, valor cards earned is actually working across single player and multi-player which i think is amazing and should be in the big console release games lol.Anyway I cannot believe how amazing this is, easily a system selling game to buy a vita for, you will not regret judging by how everyone's giving perfect 5 star reviews.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

Jerky graphics, loss of leaning (my prized feature), lame story. FEAR original had a decent (if sometimes incoherent) story with great cut scenes and a creepy factor.FEAR Original AI was brilliant!! Their reaction to the flashlight, grenades, your movement and they would hide and sneak up it was amazing.  Equally amazing is that ALL OF THAT IS MISSING HERE!PROSSierra made lots of money selling out to Vivendi or Warner Bros or whoever is responsible for this steaming pileCONS-Went out of my way to buy it and waited in anticipation-A SLAP in the face of the PC gamers that made this famous-Clearly a console game with console graphics and action-Console jerky mouse movement (think 10 year old on Ritalin)-WHERE IS THE LEANING????? Oh yea ran out of CONSOLE buttons I guess-AI is STOOOOOOPID and I mean dumb as a box of rocks. On normal difficulty, I can mow then down all day.-Poor level design (horrible to be honest)-TOTALLY linear although they attempt to convince you that there are other ways to go-Creepy factor has been replaced by weak attempt and flashes of Alma-Completely lacks the original dark feel and story-Lame dialogue ripe with foul language for no reason.  In the original game when the guys would yell F*** or S*** or otherwise, it had a place and increased the realism.  They sounded shocked. This just feels like an onslaught of pointless cussing to make little boys giggle.- Grenades (a fave) are useless as their concussive damage is nil. You drop a grenade in the middle of 3 guys, they run to the wall, BOOM....nothing.- I could go on but hopefully I have convinced you to wait until $19.99All in all this is a major disappointment and I mean MAJOR for one of my favorite game franchises.

If you do you'll be missing out on alot.  Dante may spout some lame lines here and there (he's young in this so it's excusable) but the storyline overall is one of the best ever written.  It was like playing a movie instead of a game and I became to wrapped up in the story to the point where no matter how diffcult it became I had to move on to find out what will happen next.  I'm not kidding, the plot and character developement is better than you'll find in most movies.**tips for those still having trouble**There is a cheat code that unlocks everything including different Dante outfits.  Find that code (at any cheat site) and after you enter it pick the Dante outfit with the purplish smokey arua around him.  If you play with that one you will have unlimited Devil Trigger which will help you out a lot.  I don't think I would have made it without it.  Also when I nearly completed the game I went back and replayed mission 2.  It's somewhat changed since last time I played including a Boss fight added in (The Scythe wielding Raven thing) and more demons to kill.  It was really fun and it allowed me to stock up on more orbs faster especially since it adds Rank and Boss points.

I also should add I'm a huge sci-fi shooter fan (since the Halo days, or at least the beginning of Halo days since Halo 4 is right around the corner), so Gears of War 3 is right down my alley, and yet I didn't leave the game after I beat it with the same sense of awe and wonder I felt after Halo 1-3.  Gears 3 is certainly good, one of the best looking games on the Xbox 360 and the ending boss and cutscene really cemented my appreciation for this title, but the gameplay and controls felt clunky, almost as if they were themselves grinding away and heavily burdened like the characters' suits.  The charging/run feature was odd to me, since you hunker down in a crouch and the screen becomes slightly warped - and there doesn't seem to be an exact direction except in a very general sense when you try to run one way or the other.  The voice acting is atrocious most of the time, save for the always amazing Claudia Black (who has a somewhat limited role in comparison to that of her Chloe counterpart in Uncharted 2).  The story itself is equally typical save-the-world-from-infestation schlock and unique, and -as I previously mentioned- the ending left me with appreciation, but, again, not in the same way other sci-fi shooters have (under-appreciated Lost Planet 2, one of my faves of 2010, included).  Overall, I recommend picking up a copy of Gears of War 3 as obviously it's a good game that diehard Gears fans love, but for a newbie like me perhaps a Gears 4 will merit whether I love it or leave it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2012"}

Despite the new look and outstanding visuals, Resident Evil Code: Veronica hasn't really offered anything new, and instead delivers more of the same RE gameplay.The story is very awkward. As the game progresses, Code: Veronica's storyline begins to lack the cool plot twists and startling mysteries found in the last Resident Evils. RE:CV relied on too much puzzle-solving to drive the story. There aren't any interwinding plots like before. Instead, the story reveals a weak cast of characters. This includes transvestites and unnecessary characters who have nothing to do with the main plot and RE storyline.As you might expect, the graphics are mind-blowing. Its the best-looking Resident Evil yet. Gone are the pre-rendered backgrounds and still perspectives of the old games. Code: Veronica's sound is good, but has some bad voice-acting.What's disappointing is that the dodge feature from RE3: Nemesis has been removed and the auto-aiming is so annoying, causing you to aim at unwanted targets and wasting ammunition. RE:CV's puzzle-solving, box-pushing, and switch-pressing, which will eventually become tedious especially to experienced Resident Evil players.Resident Evil Code: Veronica pales in comparison to the other Resident Evil games in almost every area. Once you forget about the awesome graphics, you're left with nothing but same Resident Evil we've been playing all along.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2000"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Dr. BT","summary":"#1 Game of All Times!!","reviewText":"Fun, Exciting, Great gameplay mechanics, Graphics, Sounds, Lots of Cool Weapons, Funny, I am waiting on Ratchet and Clank 4 already.

After two successful expansion packs, developer Chris Sawyer waited well over a year to launch Rollercoaster Tycoon 2.  The sequel is based on a no brainer...&quot;Build it and they will come&quot;.  Seeing that the first game and its expansions still sell well, Infogrames already has a large base of built in fans looking for more of the same, but will these fans love '2', and will this attract new fans?  Time will tell.Overall, the look and feel of the game remains relatively the same.  A 3D isometric overhead view allows players to build a theme park from scratch and carry it through pre-defined scenarios.  These scenarios have conditions such as have a park rating of X by year Y or have X guests by year Y or build N coasters of type T with an excitement factor of X.The game ships with about 25 scenarios that are grouped in categories of difficulty: easy, advanced, expert, and Real Parks.  The website RollercoasterTyccon2.com promises to have future downloadable scenarios, and one major enhancement over the original game is the inclusion of a scenario editor.  Players can now create their own parks/games and trade among friends.  You can control all variables from size of park, weather, rides available for research and more.The 'Real Parks' are actual Six Flag parks from around the world that are pretty close to real world counterparts.  You can choose to just manage them or alter them at will.Game enhancements:1) Park sizes can be double that of the original game and it supports a much higher screen resolution rate.2) Scenery: All the original scenery from the RCT and its expansions are present as well as new ones including: Pirate, Scary, Medieval, Gears, Wild West, Giant Gardens and more.  There are also more fences, water themes, roofs and walls and the ability to stack scenery makes it much easier to create buildings.3) New rides: Well obviously there are more coasters but also other attractions as well on top of all the originals.4) Coaster and ride options: There seems to be much more customizations available for coasters including new car types, special banks, queue line options, supports, signs &amp; banners, special track types and more.5) New shops and stalls: Again, all the originals and more including sun glass hut, ATM's, First Aid station, more food choices.6) More music options.  Many more styles of music can accompany your rides.7) Coaster construction: Tool here has been revamped and now you can make/test/save/see coasters better than ever.Now not everything is perfect in this game:1) Graphics: Even though the screen resolution and park size has increased, the view is still the same as is the graphics engine.  While there is more 'eye-candy' per-se, the overall look is still cartoony and has some 'jaggy' issues.  Not to mention that hills, waters, mountains still look slightly un-natural as it did in the original.2) Lack of scenarios that ship.  There are only 3 easy scenarios, a handful of advanced, and more expert.  This may prove complex for players who never had the first.  Hopefully new ones will be available from the official website soon.3) No major innovations in game play.  I'd like to see new objectives, or disasters to overcome, or new behaviors of park guests, mechanics, handymen, mascots...still the same.The largest adjustment fans of the original will have to make is getting use to the new construction and customization tools.  While they have been expanded (a large plus), they have also taken on new 'handling' characteristics which is proving somewhat confusing for me.  For old players, it's retraining how to this new interface and sub-menus...lacking in the 1st game.  While this new interface does seem to be much more rich and deep, I truly found it wasn't as intuitive as the RCT 1.  I was looking for information that seemed to be present in the 1st game easily, now I have to dig to sub-menus I'm not familiar with.These were some of the reasons I chose o give it 4 stars instead of 5.  Something's are just better off simple, not overly complex.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2002"}

In the Godfather 2 your already a don who now has to build his criminal empire by taking over. The taking over aspect is the whole gameplay focus from start to finish. And its great you'll have tone of fun intimidating shop owners, beating up rival families and taking over their business as well but it can get repetitive for many players as taking over businesses is mandatory on most of the story progression. But what many players will grow tired of fast is their business being taken over every five minutes and this will be constant throughout the whole game unless you take out the other mob families and their made men.The three cities you'll be in feel small but they make up for this by having plenty of interiors you can go in. The graphics are good and look similar to saints row 2, the brutal executions that were present in the first game are present here but this time there are tons more.Its shorter then the first game story wise but taking over all of the businesses in each of the three cities should take you a while. There's also multiplayer which is a neat idea, the crew members in the singleplayer can be taken online to earn upgrades that they can use in singleplayer;its fun for awhile but the problem is there isn't many people playing this game.The Godfather 2 is a good game but it lacks variety and challenge that the first game had. The game is too easy,short and doesn't let you be a part of the movie. Its The Godfather 2 in name only and its a rent at best just play the first one instead or wait for Mafia 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"A brilliant game, but the ending leaves a sour taste in the mouth.","reviewText":"Mass Effect 3 concludes BioWare's epic trilogy which began five years ago. Long-term players will have guided their version of Commander Shepard (whose gender and abilities can be adjusted by the player) through three games totalling 65-80 hours (depending on what side-missions you played) to reach the grand finale of the story. As a result Mass Effect 3 has more weight than most computer games. Though assembled from some fairly generic ingredients, the Mass Effect universe has become immensely popular, making it the most successful new space opera franchise to appear in any medium since Farscape and the Stargate TV shows in the late 1990s.The game has a similar structure to the first two. You spend most of it on the Normandy with a choice of where to go next. There's a number of main storyline (or 'priority') missions to complete before the final showdown with the Reapers on Earth, but there's also a large number of side-missions to undertake. The mineral-scanning mechanic from the second game has been replaced by a new system where you can scan planets and star systems to search for items of interest and then recover them. Whilst this risks detection by the Reapers, the items you discover can be of immense cumulative value in the war.The game tracks your readiness for the final battle with a new war room installed on the Normandy. From this console you can see how the allies you have made in the main and side-missions are faring against the Reapers, as well as the tangible impact of the items recovered from planets on the war effort. The game measures these factors with a score. How high the score is when you launch the final assault on Earth determines how successful you are and the details of the ending that you get.Mass Effect 3 calls upon the full resources of the storylines and characters established in the first two games (and even some of the spin-off novels) to deliver an immense series of pay-offs. The war between the quarian and the geth is resolved and an opportunity arises to cure the krogans of the genophage disease to win their loyalty (though this might come at losing the support of other races who fought the krogan in prior wars). Whilst Mass Effect 3 has a relatively small pool of characters to take on missions compared to the second game, just about every single major character (and many minor ones) from the series reappears. Some of them don't make it to the end (this is war, after all) and others only have fleeting appearances, but the game does an impressive job in wrapping up almost all of the plot points left dangling from earlier in the series.Something that Mass Effect 3 does well - and easily its greatest achievement - is giving real value and depth to the relationships established over the course of the trilogy. One of the best (and funniest) scenes in the whole trilogy comes when Garrus and Shepard just decide to hang out on a building rooftop and talk the breeze with some drinks to hand. There's a whole bunch of ongoing subplots that are carried out entirely through dialogue, such as Shepard trying to convince a nervous new comm officer that her skills are of worth in the war or EDI attempting to understand human behaviour better. These elements, based on role-playing and characterisation, are handled well by the game. They're not quite as well-written as previously (most of the franchise's better writers, including Drew Karpyshyn who is credited with the best work, bailed before Mass Effect 3, some of them to work on The Old Republic), but still effective. This extends to tons of 'slice of life' conversations going on at the Citadel as refugees search for family members and security officers struggle with the influx of people, adding detail and depth to the struggle.An unfortunate problem is that the game's journal is a rather sorry thing compared to the previous games. It doesn't track your mission progress, which given the sheer number of missions you can have going on becomes rather tiresome. The game also has a number of quest-related glitches that leaves several missions uncompletable after a certain point in the game, but the journal and map both insist they can be finished, resulting in you wandering around confused. It's a tribute to the game's quality that, whilst irritating, these problems only had a minor impact on the enjoyability of the game.Combat, the meat of the game, is mostly unchanged from Mass Effect 2. The biggest change - and problem - is the addition of a combat roll move. In theory this allows you to roll from cover to cover, but it is pretty much totally unnecessary. Unfortunately, BioWare chose to make the 'roll' button the same as 'cover' and 'use', with the result that the game often gets confused about what you are trying to do and has you rolling into the enemy's crossfire when you're actually trying to duck behind one of the many chest-high walls in the game. If you've imported a character from the previous games, you will retain your level which is nice, but means you're so powerful that combat in the game is trivially easy. There's a couple of enemies (most notably the Reaper Banshee) that require more intelligence to deal with, but overall combat is so easy as to be almost perfunctory in the game. This isn't helped by the fact that you have dozens of weapons to choose from, but the original starting weapons are actually all you need to complete the games (with suitable upgrades).The game unfolds with a crisp pace, complete with an effective, doom-laden atmosphere (helped by Clint Mansell's excellent soundtrack). The scale of events is epic with a capital EPIC, and there are multiple individual showdowns, confrontations and battles huge enough to be end-of-game bossfights in other titles. The final scenes on Tuchanka (the krogan homeworld) are brilliant, as is the battle to reclaim Rannoch (the quarian/geth planet). The game also knows when to reward the player and when to punch them in the gut; the loss of several planets (including one major one) to the Reapers with attending death tolls in the billions is dramatically powerful and has major repercussions throughout the game.Events culminate in a massive assault on Earth...which is where things fall apart. The Reapers rather conveniently make a series of embarrassing tactical errors that give you a shot at victory. But during the final confrontation, the game suddenly makes a hard left turn into unexpected weirdness. Remember how the Neo/Architect conversation in The Matrix Reloaded sucked and was universally loathed? BioWare seem to have decided that is a good model on how to end a story. Whilst it undercuts expectations not to have a massive bossfight at the end, that doesn't necessarily make it a good idea. The other problem is that the revelations in this conversation make no sense, and go against what you've just spent three games and 60+ hours learning and experiencing. Thematically, the Mass Effect games are about free choice, cooperation and not letting old arguments derail future chances at peace. The ending throws that out the window and offers you a fairly boring choice of which of three buttons to press (and no matter which one you press, there is immense death and destruction waiting). The games have had their hard knocks, but the ending is downright miserable to the point of making the entire trilogy feel pointless, and totally out of keeping with the tone of the series to date.This has led to the suggestion that the ending of the game is not real and in fact a hallucination. That's entirely possible (the supporting evidence is rather impressive) but, if so, it shows that BioWare has not learned from the mistakes of the creators of Lost and Battlestar Galactica. We shouldn't have to parse the ending. This isn't Twin Peaks, this is an epic space war story, and epic space war stories need endings. Return of the Jedi, for all its faults, had a decent ending. Babylon 5 and Deep Space Nine had decent endings (wobbling only when they brought in mystical events and implausible backstory revelations, but they were relatively minor). BioWare claim they wanted a bittersweet ending, but we've had tons of bittersweet moments in the game up to that point with billions dying, planets burning and major characters biting the dust. Ending the game in a further bloodbath of millions of innocent civilians followed by a nonsensical conversation, a really weird ending cinematic and then a cheesy post-credits sequence straight out of The Big Book Of Overused Cliches That Should Never Be Used Again, Ever is an idiotic move, a failure of the writers, the game designers and the Q&A; testers who should have told their bosses this would never fly (although to be fair they may have done, and been ignored).The fact that the ending to Mass Effect 3 (****, with the ending costing the game a full star) sucks should not overshadow the achievements of the rest of the game. BioWare has pushed the ability of computer games to showcase real emotional relationships rather than just explosions and bullets further than before and some of their decisions were surprisingly brave. But ultimately the ending is cheap, nasty and nonsensical and cannot help but put what has come before in a less flattering light. I didn't feel the ending was bad enough to invalidate the rest of the game or the trilogy, but, whilst I enjoyed the first two games a lot I wasn't as invested in them as some. Those who are much bigger fans of the series may feel much more let down about the ending, and I can fully understand that POV.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

I had both.  And as of today I have the One.  The One does not have the same initial &#34;pop&#34; factor the 360 had over its predecessor.  There are UI issues that need to be solved--particularly around the social aspects of playing with your friends, parties, messaging, etc.  The loss of the ever-present pop-up Xbox 360 guide is, on he surface, a step back.Still, I chose this over the PS4 after going back and forth.  My 360 was far and away my favorite console, next to the PS3 that collected a lot of dust until it was time to play Blu Rays.The controller is a minor evolution.  It's comfortable enough, but doesn't feel as durable as the 360 controller.  After a while I forgot about it.  I wish Kinect wasn't a mandatory purchase, but it is, so it's hooked up and occasionally I'll talk to it.  TV integration?  I didn't bother.  Too many reports of resolution and other video problems, and I'm not sure what value there is in the One sitting between my cable box and the TV.Only game I've played so far is Forza 5.  It looks fabulous.  Not a huge leap over Forza 4, but it does look and play better than ever.  It crashed once in about 3 hours of playing, and the whole XBOX restarted.Setup was easy and the update went without a hitch.  Everything is in working order.  It is whisper quiet and runs mildly warm (not hot, like the early 360s) . . clearly Microsoft wasn't going to make thermal mistakes again.  It's big--but it's next to by A/V reciever so it fits right in.This console, right now, is more about potential.  And that's why I went with Microsoft.  They provided the best user experience by far the last go around, and I'm counting on them to make swift updates to bring back some of the lost 360 conveniences.  I do find it kind of cool that I can &#34;dashboard&#34; out of a game and return to where I left off.  So there's power here, and certainly potential, but they just need to polish off all the rough corners.I'm confident Microsoft will deliver on the promise of the X1 with routine software updates--after all, the 360 went through three MAJOR OS revisions, and the PS3 looks pretty much the same today as it did when it was delivered.  I may certainly end up with at PS4 if there are compelling reasons to add one, but given my overwhelming preference for Xbox 360, xbox live, and the controller, I thought it was the safest move to give Microsoft another chance to deliver.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"S.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Delivers as promised","reviewText":"I was cautiously optimistic while awaiting the release of this newest GTA.  Would Rockstar manage to innovate yet again?  Had the horrendous control scheme been fixed?  Would the graphics be better?  Will the storyline be any good, and the missions interesting?  The answers to those questions might not be a unanimous yes, but the overall package is a blast to play, and in many ways the crown jewel of the GTA series.GRAPHICS: Average to good.  The character models are so dated and jagged that they do sometimes detract from the game, but that is countered somewhat by the gorgeous scenery and landscapes.  There is still noticeable pop-up and fill-in (when scenery in the background just appears after loading from memory), and this game doesn't look as sleek or polished as GTA on the PC or Xbox.  That said, there is a terrific sense of realism, and the graphics never detract from the action.CONTROL: Better, but still very flawed.  It is easier to lock on to a target and switch between targets, but it is still way too jerky and hectic when fighting multiple enemies up close.  Why can't they make the main character move like Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell or a running back in Madden?  The jumping animation is a bit better, and you can now climb fences, but it's still far from fluid.GAMEPLAY: A+.  This is where the game shines.  Beyond the phenomenal storyline (well acted and interesting, though not quite KOTOR), the game is packed to the gills with side quests, tasks and options.  You can \"pimp your ride\", deliver pizza, fly around in a variety of planes, and so on.  The world is alive, and the three cities are so big and interesting, the replay value is amazing.SOUND: Quite good, though it could still be better.  The engine sounds are realistic, the voice acting is great, and the music selection is quite good, as usual.HOW DOES IT RANK?  Here is where I place GTA: SA in the pantheon of next-gen GTA games:1)GTAIII: still my fave because it was so original, and the city had a great feel to it that I haven't found in the later cities.2)GTA-SA: Amazing game, it's the game we all wanted it to be (for the most part).  The graphics engine and control scheme are starting to feel dated, but they keep innovating with the gameplay3)GTA-VC: I just didn't care for Vice City as much.  It was still fun, but the city just didn't hold my interest like the other games.  I didn't like most of the songs on the soundtrack (seems like they were 80's rejects, not 80's hits) and the story was a bit too cliched.

{"product_name":"B0001VGFK2","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Best GTA EVER","reviewText":"Once again Rockstar gives birth to another awesome Grand Theft Auto that far exceeded my every expectation. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is by far, the best GTA in the entire series. I never thought it could get any better than Vice City, being that I am a resident of Florida and know the city of Miami all too well and everyone's hero here is Scarface, but San Andreas has improved the series in gameplay, in story, in character development and some people even agree that the graphics have been improved.After spending five years of reclusive soul searching in Liberty City (New York), Carl, the main character gets a phone call from his brother in San Andreas (California, Los Angeles) informing him that his mother has been killed. He comes home to learn that everything has really gone up in flames. `His Hood,' which has always been a bad place, is now ten times worse than what he remembers the place to be and his street family `The Grooves' have suffered considerable loss trying to fight for what they feel is right. Your brother, forever loyal to the Groove family, has stuck out and fought to the very end, where no limit stands against the opposition of rival gangs and the streets have never been this bad. Nothing is real anymore. Only the brotherhood. And your brother blames you for not keeping it real and sees your staying away for five years as disloyalty to the family.The greatest feature to this game is the sheer size of the new city. The map, once everything is unlocked, is split up in several different counties: three whole cities, all of which are overrun by gangs. The three cities are connected together by incredibly large countryside areas, which long curvy roads zip through, allowing you access to heavily unpopulated woodland and desert. A few isolated towns are stationed here and there throughout the game's rural areas. This mixture of both urban and suburban locations all in one map, I thought, was unique and a pleasure to explore. You got railways which run over it all....I mean, it is BIG. With the fastest car, it would take 15 minutes just to get from one side of the map to the other.This game, unlike the others, had many ways to build yourself up to better your performance. Gyms can be visited to make your character buff and to teach him different fighting styles. You can teach Carl to become a professional underwater swimmer and actually swim under the surface of any given beach or inlet in San Andreas. Can build up his driving skill, his flying skill with planes and jets and helicopters; his shooting skill with multiple guns you collect; you can even build up your respect among your fellow Grooves which will enable you to gang up with them when you are in their district and go all out on a rampage with the help of 10 or 15 gang members. For recreational fun, you can even build relationships with multiple girls and actually take them clubbing. There are shops to modify vehicles you have stolen, improving everything from the engine to the paintjob. Shop for clothing. Rob houses. Pimp women as an optional submission. A lot of new little things.Those are the two new features that stand out the most, and believe me, it changes everything. Especially the grand size of the map and all the work you get in every area. The story missions themselves are more or less the same, but they somehow managed to make them more stylish and intense, especially when you get real deep into the game. It gets really wild. Many movie-like scenes take place right in the middle of the action without stopping gameplay! Other than improving the overall style of missions, it's the same old Grand Theft which we have always known. The only slight difference is that now your man can swim underwater and there are some underwater missions. And some missions encourage you to use stealth to complete your objectives, such as hiding in shadows and taking people out from behind with a knife or a silenced pistol.All Grand Thefts like to take us back to a time period which all of us are familiar with or have experienced ourselves. The 90s was my era and I love this game's interpretation of all the madness. The pirate radio stations all include music from the early 90s, including gangster rap, totally unedited. The insanity level to the missions and the hysterical people you meet and work with throughout this crazy game are all typical characters of the time.  Even some of the local myths of the time period are brought to life in this great game - area 51, aliens, and secret governmental experiments....it's hysterical. You must appreciate the work of the developers for doing their research.The greatest bit of realism that this great game demonstrates comes from an actual event which occurred in the streets of L.A. after the brutal beating of a black man by several police officers. If you lived in L.A. at that time and wish to experience the chaos again in the safe world of a video game, get Grant Theft Auto: San Andreas now.Following the breakthrough game \"Manhunt\" also produced by RockStar, San Andreas also stretches the limits. I cannot wait for the day where there will be no limit to the amount of sex and violence in games - Rockstar and Midway are really the only two companies that put any effort in delivering the goods. It makes great games even greater. This Grand Theft, like all Grand Thefts, are realistic in the sense where the crimes it demonstrates are all well known crimes in the real world and there are people out there that actually do act as nuts as the ones in this game, but realism in the game itself  is filtered and made harmless. The themes are so overly exaggerated; you cannot help but throw back your head and laugh as it exposes to you every insane aspect of the USA in the 1990s. Extremely fun to play. Every cuss word in the book is used on a regular basis throughout the game and the sexual themes are more obvious than ever. This is a good thing. Keep it up ROCKSTAR.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"Next generation MMORPG (and this time it really is)","reviewText":"Things I hate in MMORPGs and how GW2 addresses it:*** Problem 1: Too much \"single player\" experience.  The \"MM\" is for \"massively multiplayer\" and in many other games, I might as well be playing by myself offline.Solution: Virtually everything you do in this game is an \"event\".  You run into a small village and it's under attack by bandits.  Some players are already there fighting the bandits and you'll see a progress meter for how the fight is going (the bandits may have their own goal, and they may be winning).  You don't have to find a \"quest giver\" or join anyone's group or anything like that -- just start fighting bandits.  The goal is shared by everyone in the area.  Everywhere you go, you'll find this sort of thing going on so you're constantly around other people who are sharing a progress meter with you.  (Rewards are contribution based, similar to 'rift events' in Rift or 'public quests' in Warhammer, so you aren't directly competing with anyone.  It doesn't matter who hit the bandit first or who got the finishing blow, so long as you did something...hit the bandits, heal other players, throw buffs around, whatever.)There are still true soloable (instanced) storyline quests specific for your race/class and there are single-group (instanced) dungeons but the bulk of the PvE game is built around these open world, open participation events.*** Problem 2: I can't play with my friends because we aren't the same level.Solution: If I'm level 60 and you're level 15, I can go back into your area and play with you.  I will get temporarily de-leveled so that the area is still a challenge for me.*** Problem 3: \"The Quest Sync Game\" / I still can't play with my friends.  I have quests F,G,H and I.  You have quests A,H and J.  I can't share quest F with you because you have to complete A-E first, which I already did and can't do again.  We can do H together but I can't do J with you until I finish quest I.  We get in sync and now you need to log off for a while and my other friend logs on and \"The Quest Sync Game\" starts all over again.  It's ridiculous.Solution: The game being built around \"events\" rather than quest lines solved this problem too.  You actually don't have a quest log.  You sort of get something like that but it's really just telling you where to GO.  You don't need to complete A in order to do B.  You can always do B.  You can complete B and go back later and do it again if you really want to.  You can skip B and go straight to H if you want.  You can't skip forward beyond your level (as far as I know) but you don't need to follow some linear quest system, either.  Therefore there is no \"quest sync game\".  I log in, I ask where you are, I go there, I join in, no problem.*** Problem 4: \"LFM, need tank\".  No tank?  Well you can't play the game then.  You're a healer?  Sorry, we're full up on healers and can't use you and in fact you'd ruin the group.  (I *still* can't play with my friends!  Oh wait and now the group is full.)Solution: Some games address this by letting you switch roles to one degree or another.  GW2 solves it by simply destroying the entire concept of the \"holy trinity\" -- tank/healer/dps.  The first big thing they did to destroy it was they removed \"taunting\".  You CAN spec your character to be tank-like, able to take a beating, but there is no taunt mechanic so you can't simply stand there and get beat on.  The other big thing they did was to remove the concept of the \"dedicated healer\".  You can spec your character to be more heal-like, but you'll never come close to what the dedicated single-target healers of other games can do.The result is a far more dynamic combat system.  No more eating chips and watching TV while mashing \"3\" over and over during a dungeon fight.  You need to be focused on the battle because nobody can hold agro, you are responsible for your own survival and while every class has options for defense and self-healing, you need to pay attention to do it.  Some people may actually not like this (many bad gamers will feel disenfranchised) but to me this makes it more of a \"fun action game\" and less of a \"mild distraction while watching TV\".*** Problem 5: \"The wolves!  They are attacking!  We shall all die if you do not slay 20 of them!\"  (Player looks around, there are 8 wolves standing around doing nothing, which is all they ever do.  After slaying 20 of them, there are still 8 wolves, still standing around doing nothing.  And every quest is a slight variation of this, until you get the idea that the game world's inhabitants are just paranoid crazy people because there's never any actual, apparent threat to any of them.  Even the \"vile orcs\" just sit around in their camps and do nothing until you attack them, apparently for no reason.)Solution: Events, which, again, is this game's version of questing, are dynamic -- if the guy says wolves are going to attack and kill everyone, they really are going to attack and kill everyone.  You can fail events because the wolves might actually win.  The wolves, may in fact, stick around afterwards, spawning a new event to \"clear out the wolves that ate all those nice people\".  The game feels much more realistic and alive when you aren't just killing idle things standing in a field apparently minding their own business.*** Problem 6: \"...and enter ye into this land of war and strife where you will, um, play mostly by yourself and actually the war ended right before the year that this game is set in.\"  (Two different MMORPGs with \"Star Wars\" in the name, neither of them actually included a \"war\".  They might as well have been called \"Star Big Game Hunter\" because you kill more wildlife than enemies.)Solution: \"World vs World vs World\", usually just called \"WvW\".  This is similar to the \"RvR\" of Dark Age of Camelot fame.  There's a big war going on.  You don't have to participate in it but you really should give it a shot.  There are castles to be attacked and defended.  Siege engines to build, operate and destroy.  Items of power to be stolen and defended.  It's big, it's epic, it's basically everything we thought Warhammer was going to be.  And WvW was 100% operational in beta so this isn't more smoke and mirrors.  It's there.  It works.  It's pretty awesome.  You should try it.  (Be sure to figure out how to buy, build and use an arrow cart or ballista too.  Protip.)*** Problem 7: I want to PvP (possibly with my friends...you know, THAT old problem) but I can't because I'm not the right level / don't have the right gear.Solution: WvW solves this problem by letting you in as soon as you finish the tutorial, if you want, and temporarily boosting your level to 80.  You won't get free skills or gear or anything, you still need to level up (which you can do in WvW itself), but what skills you DO have will hit as if you were level 80 and you'll have level 80 hit points too.  It works well and I spent most of my time in WvW, enjoying it even when I rolled a new character and went back in at level 2.\"Structured PvP\" (\"sPvP\", aka \"battlegrounds\", instanced PvP, which is totally separate from WvW) goes a step further by temporarily boosting you to level 80, giving you all skills, talents AND gear.  You can focus on your build and on your teamwork and combat technique rather than fussing over who-has-the-bigger-sword.  There are tournaments and you can earn items that have the same stats as the regular stuff, but with unique appearances.  It's all about the fun of combat rather than the grind of leveling.  Some may not like this, but I think most PvP players are pleasantly surprised at how little they miss \"the grind\" portion of PvP.-----Sorry for the long review, I guess, but I really wanted to spell out why GW2 is not like other MMORPGs, \"and this time we mean it\".Guild Wars 2 is the first real, new MMORPG we've had since WOW came out.  STO, SWTOR, WAR, Rift, AOC, LOTRO, etc, were all members of the same generation, in my opinion, being basically copies of WOW in a new setting.GW2 is the next generation, and from what I've seen so far, my conclusion is \"it's about time\".P.S.There is no subscription fee.  GW2's financial model is based on selling you expansions later, plus a cash store that sells various unnecessary frills (additional character slots, tophats, uniforms, additional bag slots, etc).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

At first I had trouble aiming since I had no idea my aim was moving because of my Vita movement.  The story wasn't the best in the series, but was entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.  I really loved how they implemented the camera into the game.  Was a lot of fun trying to find the spots to take pictures.My only two negative remarks on the game was all the pointless rubbing to clean artifacts and maps.  And I didn't like the two boss fights how they were action events.  I was also disppointed with the final boss fight in Uncharted 3 because of the same reason.Overall this is a great game and really shows off the power of the Vita.

You can explore the upper-class suburbs of Rockford Hills, the beautiful Vespucci Beach, or the sticks of Blaine County.  While you are exploring, there is always something interesting to do along the way, such as stopping robbery or other such things.The narrative is exciting and well written and the missions now with the added element of being able to switch characters bring even more fun to the game.The game mechanics are better, the graphics are better and possibly some of the best in a game out there today but like most games not without bugs at times and freezing gameplay.

I was afraid it would be a very bad game, when I watched trailers, and I deleted it numerous times from wishlist. But when I finally got it and played the first mission, I realized that all this time I was mistaken. Trailer did no justice to the game. It has incredibly fun gameplay and great, original story. I played the whole game withing two days. The world within the game is beautiful, characters are good. I expect to see bulletsorm 2 in upcoming future. Because the game and story can not just end here. Nor do I wish there to be an end on this epic game. The game is fun.I would call this game to be different from the rest. It's a good different side about it. You have to try the game for yourself. But there goes the mature content. Note that game is full of it. And sometimes I couldn't contain at the dialog of my team mates and just burst out laughing.Loading:And the loading is so extremely fast, like 1, 2 and barely 3 and it's loaded. For such an amazing graphics, it's the fastest game to load. And before I bought the game, I was afraid it would be slow on my computer.Bugs:As for bugs. I haven't patched the game at all. And I encountered 4 bugs in-game. In the end where it stuck on the sound of killing me and blood splashes. And when the game ended it gave me another round, this time without a bug. And another thing I experienced in a few games, is when your teammate bot is stuck somewhere or the door closes before them and they can't follow you. So they respawn in another point. I like that. A very few times I got stuck myself and killed in fact. But then again, what game does not have bugs? The whole game was playable. And none of those bugs really affected fun or playability or didn't even get annoying.A bit of a spoiler:I am glad my favorite character(Trishka) survived in the end. Hope to see her in the next game and unharmed. She was the only character I liked, and only when I thought she died, I lost all fun in game. I didn't feel that for other members. So she is cool. And as said above, I want her in next games.To other reviewers:Stop whining around and complaining about windows live or steam or whatever other stuff you don't like in games. Windows live does not review the game itself. So and steam, for example. So if you don't like it, don't buy it, don't review it. It's clearly said on the box: Windows Live. You should NOT rate the game 1 star because of windows live.If you're having trouble writing down the code from the game to activate it, then I have no other suggestion for you, but to play tetris or something else that does not require you to use your brain. Really how hard can it be to install a game?! And if it does not install, blame it on the game, not on yourself.

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Taylor C.

{"product_name":"B001D7798A","description":"Cryostasis: The Arctic Circle, 1968. Alexander Nesterov is a meteorologist sent to uncover the mystery of the abandoned ice-breaker ship, North Wind. This steel beast once fought for its country, but during a dangerous mission it drifted into an ice trap that slowly froze to death every living thing on board. A routine investigation quickly turns into a battle for survival against both the freezing elements and the terrifying evil that inhabits the lost ship.  Cryostasis takes players on a terrifying trip into the unknown as they explore the dark, frozen, claustrophobic corridors and unlock the shocking secrets of the North Wind.","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A fun, offbeat game","reviewText":"Cryostasis is a great example of a game that probably wouldn't be made by a larger, big-name developer, as it defies tropes left and right. It's a survival-horror game with fast-paced combo-driven melee combat. It's a first-person action game with largely bloodless, realistic violence (see the teen rating). And, while it wears all the trappings of a cold-war sci fi game like STALKER, it's actually pretty deeply rooted in fantasy. Your own character has magic psychic powers, the enemies you face (former members of a marooned ship's crew) are strongly implied to have been transformed into monsters by the sheer power of their own apathy, and as you use your psychic link to the past to undo more and more of the harm you encounter, things get- well that would be a spoiler. Suffice to say this game's big bad is the polar opposite of sci-fi, and while the game itself is unbearably grimdark in places the ending is actually remarkably happy.The challenge to Cryostasis is that not all of the game really works. There are some moments of genuine horror- when you travel into the past of one doomed sailor you must paddle a raft through a lightless flooded hold, with monsters crawling from the icy water to kill you at all turns. As you turn to look for the enemy, your raft's meager floodlight casts a dim yellow glow across the facades of rusted metal and eerie lapping water. It's super spooky- yet moments later, in a second flashback, the same crewman must navigate below the water in a ponderous diving suit a la the Abyss. This segment should be even scarier, yet the tension is completely gone. Similarly, while being rushed down by monsters in the present is scary at first, combat quickly becomes a matter of performing the pattern of attacks and dodges that each enemy requires to beat.Still, a lot of thought obviously went into the compelling plot of Ctyostasis, and it's definitely different from what usually passes as horror. I would recommend it to fans of games like Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth or Undying, although it is more linear and less action-oriented than both.PROS- Good graphics, especially the water which is quite realistic. Tight art style makes otherwise samey locations interesting to look at.- Eerie compelling narrative that makes a surprisingly small-scale story very involving- Genuinely spookyCONS- Leans heavily on the PhysX middleware system so ATI users will have a plainer experience- After a while, the different rooms in the ship start looking kind of the same- Combat is sort of flat- As other reviewers have noted, requirements far exceed what you actually get visually","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2012"}

Yes I do feel these aspects are an important part of the buying experience, but they could change at any point and time. As of it's release, the price is a little steep, but it is a quality piece of equipment, made to last for years to come. The shipping was fast and flawless.This Logitech wireless gaming controller is awesome for those with PS2/PS3's. It works flawlessly and is said that it will reach up to 30 feet. I haven't needed to test it out that far (my living room is not that big), but I have moved it around to different locations to see if it would still work just as well, and it has. I would say the farthest I have tested it would be about 15 feet away, and it worked as well as it did 5 feet away. The wireless feature is a huge plus for us since we have several dogs in the house who love to run in front of the TV over and over and get wrapped up in any controller cords that might be hanging down. We have already lost one gaming system to dogs getting wrapped up in a controller and pulling the whole system onto the floor.One of the best features is the good adjustability of both the drums and cymbals. In our home, we have a variety of different aged video game players, ranging from 8 years old to 30 years old. This is an invaluable feature since kids aren't the same size as adults. Because this unit lets you adjust all the positions, it allows you to bring them in closer or farther away. This makes for a much more enjoyable sitting position for each person who plays. No one has to reach way out and no one feels like they are cramped into a small spot. Every drum and cymbal can be placed wherever you like, so that it is set up to just your perfect position.I would not say this unit is completely silent. You can hear someone playing it from another room. If you play the games on the expert levels, you can definitely hear the sound of the drum sticks thumping. But for us this was not an issue, as we have the volume of the TV up loud as well and the music drowns out any sounds of the controller.The stainless steel kick pedal has a very sturdy feel, which is good when you have everyone stepping on it for hours a day. It has lasted very well and worked perfectly. However, unless you have the TV volume up plenty loud as your playing the game, the pedal can be a bit noisy. It may not be something that those who are playing the game will notice or be bothered by, but if you are in the room watching, it can get a bit annoying after a while.This set uses two AA batteries and they last a good long while. We haven't ran them dead yet. I would recommend using rechargeable ones though, as it will cut down on the long term cost.Another benefit is how it folds up to be put away. A great aspect as there's not always room to have a large drum set siting out in the middle of the living room 24 hours a day. True, it's not exactly as simple as putting away a folding chair. But you have to remember, this is a sturdy, well made unit. If it folded and collapsed too easily, it would not hold up well during game play.Over all I would say this is a very high quality item that is a a must have for those Guitar Hero addicts out there!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2009"}

Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Super Mario 3D Land Review","reviewText":"Mario is back in his old school style, and his desire to rescue the Princess from the clutches of Bowser. You will have to fight your way through levels upon levels that will have you remembering the good old days of Super Mario World 3, except this time it's in 3D and there's a little extra depth to the actual levels.Graphically this is the first game that I really liked in 3D, so I left the 3D ability on the 3DS while I played through almost all the levels. There is some serious variety in the levels too. There's the desert levels, underwater levels, the castle levels, the moving levels, the warship levels, and more. There are definitely a couple of levels I liked the look of but really didn't want to have to fight my way through as the overall difficulty saw many a life lost. The different costumes that Mario dons looked pretty good. You will get to become a boomerang brother at one point, but most of the time you're going to be relying on the leaf, the flower, mushroom, and star. I think we all know what to expect when it comes to Mario's appearance in those outfits.The music was once again your good old Mario, and I have to say that as simplistic as some of it is, I couldn't turn it off, perhaps it was as simple as remembering my youth, but there was something to the music. Now of course there were no real voices to the game, but this one didn't need it.The controls are your standard Mario control layout. You're going to have a button to jump, one to do an action (fire a fireball, throw a boomerang, etc), and of course the D-pad or analog stick to move around. There was also a slight use of the shoulder buttons to tweak the view of the level ever so slightly.Overall I really like playing this game, though I don't think it should have been called Super Mario Land (I know that's what distinguishes it as a handheld game), it felt much more like a Super Mario World. There was also one other small thing that kind of bothered me about the game. You had to collect hidden and sometimes hard to reach coins to unlock some of the levels, and a couple of the castles near the end of the game. Purely getting through the level wasn't enough for this game, which I think kind of took a bit out of the fun. I wanted to see what the next level would be, not \"man I've got to play that level again I didn't find any of the 3 hidden coins\". The fact that the game had you moving in all 4 directions on the screen (back, forward, left and right) definitely made the game feel more up to date, and as I stated before the graphics looked good, and crisp. The real great thing about this game is that there's a little something extra for the gamers who want to keep going after you've successfully vanquished Bowser, and saved the Princess, but that's all I'll say about that.If you're looking for something solid to play on the 3DS, and love the Mario franchise (which I think is almost a given if you're going to be investing in a Nintendo product), then you're going to want this game to add to your collection. One point of advice, if you see one of the three special coins per level, try to find a way to get it, you're probably going to need it in the long haul. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Southpaw","summary":"Toy Story 3 DELIVERS!","reviewText":"I bought Toy Story 3 for myself and my six-year-old nephew. I'm a huge Toy Story fan, ever since I watched it in 1998.  My nephew and I have played it for hours on end. The graphics are stunning and the gameplay mechanics are fluid and simple. I'm often disappointed in Disney video games and their movie-tie ins, but this one certainly DELIVERS! The game has a co-op mode which doubles the fun factor.The game has two modes: A Story Mode and a Toy Box Mode. For the Story Mode, I give it a four star. The reason being is that the story in and of itself is short and very linear and I found the platforming too challenging for kids under the age of seven or eight. My nephew got frustrated during the platforming scenes, but with a little practice, he managed to progress through the levels. There are eight levels in total and the level designs were imaginative and fun. It only took me a few hours to finish the Story Mode.The Toy Box Mode is where the producers really shined in bringing you and your child lots of endless fun. You get to pick between three characters: Woody, Buzz, and Jessie (You can also unlock Zurg and play as him). You get to play in an open-world Wild West town. Your job is to complete missions brought to you by Hamm, Slinky, Stinky Pete, and Bo Peep. Some of the missions were simple and easy, while others were a bit hard. I had to check out the walkthrough for two missions. It's just the right tone in order to appeal to adults and children alike. When you complete the missions, you are given gold coins, and with that you can purchase items from the Toy Store. Items such as buildings, townsfolk, cars, places such as Sid's haunted house, Bullseye, etc,  The missions include snapping pictures, painting the buildings, bringing the cows from high places and returning them to the farm, rescuing a kidnapped citizen, to name a few. You can also get gold coins by smashing the gold mines. You can never run short of gold coins since the gold mines are everywhere and they re-spawn.My nephew and I loved roaming around the Wild West, kicking the townsfolk, and climbing the buildings and high areas. The goofing around was a real hoot!  He particularly loved the green/pink goo machine. You are able to purchase it from the Toy Store after completing a few missions. This machine can shrink or make something bigger. So he loved throwing the blob at Bullseye and the cows and giggled in delight as he watched them shrink/expand. He was disappointed that he couldn't make me (Jessie) shrink. lol. He also loved throwing the outlaws in jail.Personally, I have played the Toy Box Mode several times, whereas I've only played the Story Mode once. The Toy Box mode is very enjoyable and so much fun. I found myself playing it for hours with my nephew. This mode is what made me award the game a five star. I highly recommend this game and it appeals to all ages! It's definitely worth the purchase, especially if you're a Toy Story fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}

So that's great.The bad news is that this game has exactly the same flaw as Guitar Hero 2: When you get stuck on a song, there isn't a good way to move on. I just blasted through the first 20 (or so) songs on expert mode and only had to repeat 3 or 4 of them. No problem there at all. And then, all of a sudden, one of the songs I just could not get through. Not sure whether it is a balancing issue, actually. It might just be that it is a song that for some reason is hard for me (and might be easy for others). But in any event: I now probably spend 3/4 of my time with this game on this one song that I do not like and cannot do. And I have no way to get passed it, since I have to complete it to unlock more songs. This very issue means that you might end up spending the vast majority of your time with this game on a song you do not like. Bummer.Other than that, this is the same Guitar Hero that we have come to love. It is a great game, and in the big picture, the issue I describe above is not a deal breaker. But I wish they gave me a few wildcards or perhaps unlock one more track after I tried 20 times, or something like that, to remove the frustration...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2007"}

I was pleasantly surprised with awesome intro with intuitive music(import version-in fact, I watch intro till the end every time I turn on the game) and crispy clear graphic.  But every one knows that this game's reason for its popularity comes from its realism, utterly realistic.  I couldn't really get into first two games but really enjoyed Tokyo Extreme Racer one and two.  I liked the idea of racing against numerous rivals with unique game play where you have to drive through traffic.  The only complain I had with GT3 is that AI wasn't up to the level I have experienced in Tokyo Extreme Racer where some AI is so good that you really DO get frustrated.  Anyway, as I'm completing this game more and more, I came to realize that I have no choice but give this game 5 stars because it really does deserve it.  When there aren't that many quality PS2 games you can find these days (well, it's beginning to come one by one), this is the game you shouldn't miss.

You can also like some previous games upgrade your spider-man with a variety of different moves and combos as you progress through the game and seeing the different designs and backgrounds for the different spider-man is a blast too.

Ive been postponing some ps3 classics that are newer and cheaper than these oldies, but so many good reviews and the fact that you get not one, but two games for less than 30$, I went on and bought GOW collection, with nothing but fate, and especting to be dissapointed.I was worried the old graphics would ruin the experience.I was worried the gameplay wasnt all that good.I was worried it would be too easy for me.I was worried it would be a linear game that I could finish by just pressing a single  attack button as fast as i could.After  hours into God of War (one), I can see I was worried for nothing.I can safely and convincinly say, This game could easily beat many good \"current\" games for the ps3. I can compare this to one of my other action games, ninja gaiden sigma, This game beats that game in almost any category.First of all, Theres nothing to worry about in terms of graphics. If I had bought GOW as a current 2009/2010 game, I would have said: Not great, but not bad either. Knowing that this is a game from the ps2, year 2005, I can see why many reviewrs gave it no less thatn 9.5/10. From this perspective, Ill give the graphics 10/10, for holding ground against current games while keeping its head held high.Second, Theres nothing to worry about in terms of difficulty. im playing normal, and I cant say its hard, but its hell fun. This game remains fun, while still being easy enough to let you advance fluently without making you repeat a level time after time till reaching a point of frustration. If you think its too hard or too easy, the game has different levels of difficulty.Third, gameplay. This is what makes it fun. GOW has it all. Combos that look awesome and have to have memorized, special powers, puzzles, minigames, or you can just slash your way through. As you advance, you can upgrade your powers and weapons making them stronger, and unlocking new combos. That gives you the chance to learn new combos untill you can upgrade and get new ones.Besides all this, the fact that Ive been having fun for five hours and that I know that Im probably not too close to finish the game, and that I have the sequel waiting for me right there in the same disk, makes me truly believe what i read before but didnt believe. Godof War collection, is a steal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2010"}

The draw-in distance is not very good either with lots of pop-ins and graphical glitches like a characters leg showing through solid objects (clipping).There are also sound glitches which cut off an on abruptly at times. The music which is rather good, is very short and loops back endlessly, except that it doesn't have any musical transitions if it restarts again.Voice acting is certainly better for the most part, but the character you control sounds like a sleezy porn star with a raspy voice.The controls and in responsiveness of the character on screen is sluggish, you mash buttons wildly and see your character swinging the weapons in a limp fashion. Which brings be to the combat gameplay.One button can be used to block attacks but it feels sluggish and unresponsive at times. You can dual wield weapons but the techniques look goofy and ineffective. You cannot lock-on to enemies during melee combat so a lot of times when you thought you had a solid hit, you actually end up slashing nothing.The character animations still look sloppy, and they still move a bit stiff. The animations in Two World 2 lack the fluidity or any life-like movements found in many other open world RPGs.Probably the only thing I really enjoyed in Two Worlds 2, is the crafting system which allowed me to create or repair weapons and clothing and magic spells. Also Liked how it allowed me to \"dismantle\" items and break them down into core elements such as metals, fabrics or potions.The story was lackluster and tries to rip off the better Fable games. In TW2 main quest you have to rescue your sister from the evil Gandahar (incorrect spelling sorry). After the the boring and sloppy combat, blurry graphics and long list of glitches, I didn't care for TW2. The fanboys can attack me all they want but It won't change the facts that this tries to be a good RPG but fails on many fronts.The first game sucked bad and I had high hopes that the improvements to this sequel would make me enjoy the game.But this the second attempt which SouthPeak, and the developers fail to bring a good title. TW2 should be the final nail to coffin and hopefully this game gets buried or sold in the bargain bin.Pros:+multi-player game modes+crafting system is easy and fun to use+open world gameplayCons:-glitches galore-music and sound cuts off-some of the voice-overs still suck-blurry graphics-sloppy controls-sluggish response-goofy animations-goofy looking combat-no lock on system-navigation on maps an compass is not easy-interface takes a while to get used to-lacks intensity in actionIf you liked this game you might also like Oblivion, Mass Effect or Fable series.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"Awesome game -- what's all the fuss?","reviewText":"Okay, I've had my copy of HL2 for about week and was too busy to install it.  After reading all the complaining, whining and moaning on Amazon.com, I decided to give it a try.  It couldn't have been easier.  The program walked me completely through the process, step-by-step. All that was requested was a User Name, Password and my Disk Key Number. Then some files on my HD were decrypted. And that was it. It took me all of 10 minutes to create my Steam Account (whatever it is).  And you don't need to log on to the Internet to play the game -- repeat, you don't need to be on the Internet to play Half Life 2.  The \"offline mode\" works just fine.  A connection is only required for the initial process which is like a registration (the Internet requirement is mentioned right on the box -- it's not like they tried to hide anything).  My copy installed so easily and has run so flawlessly, I'm led to believe that most of the problems others are having are originating between the keyboard and the chair -- not in the computer or software.  Steam is definitely a bummer but that's the price we're paying for piracy.  I can't totally blame Valve for this.  The game itself is absolutely incredible. I've been playing computer games for about 10 years (mostly FPS), and this is right near or at the top of my list.  To the people who are \"unsatisfied\" with the gameplay, I don't know what the hell they were expecting.  To me, this is as good as it gets: total immersion in a game world for 15-16 hours.  My system is strong, but it's about a year old and nothing particularly special.  It plays HL2 totally glitch-free and smoothly at \"high\" settings in 1024 x 768 resolution (the game determined the settings), and I haven't had a single crash or problem.  The graphics are literally photographic quality.  HL2 sets an entirely new standard for games.  Everything can be used and/or interacted with, the physics are incredible (break a crate and then use the pieces, etc.), the people look totally individual and are detailed like photographs (the first time I've ever seen people done this well in a game) -- it's truly amazing.  In some places I was  hoping the game could have had some sort of conversation routine.  Especially with Dr. Vance's fine daughter Alex (she even says \"You're a man of few words.\"  Sorry Alex, no choice, I'm afraid.).  This is the clumsiest part of the game to me. You become a \"hero\" to the NPC's in the game, they talk to you, and you can even lead groups of them during certain fights, but you can't answer back when they say something.  Anybody having trouble with the overall story must not have played the original HL.  The attention to detail is incredible (right down to photographs on desks, newspaper clippings, books, etc.). And yes, the game loads like the first HL when you reach a new level, and the load times can take 15 seconds or so. This probably depends on the amount of RAM in your system and the general quality of your HD and CPU.  It's no big deal unless you're actually looking for something to bum you out. Generally, HL2 is a perfect extension of how the original could have ended. The original was the \"invasion\", and this is the \"outcome\" -- and how many of the original characters reacted or ended up.  Many of the main characters are the same, many of the weapons are the same, the new vehicles are great, the enemy is the same, the overall atmosphere is the same but expanded, etc.  As for as gameplay, I can say that I've already had some of the most exciting moments of any computer game (like a trip down the canal in an unarmed airboat while being chased by a helicopter gunship armed with cannon and mines and a final duel with the chopper (after you get a decent weapon)-- just incredible.  And I'm only about 2/3 through.  The main difference in HL2 is that the action takes place mostly outdoors in a nameless Eastern European country as opposed to Black Mesa - a much larger environment to operate in. You're still Gordon Freeman, you still wear an HEV suit, and even your old drinking buddy Barney  from HL (security guard at Black Mesa) is still around (he saves your ass right off). You've still got to deal with the zombies (a whole town full of them), several varieties of those damn headcrabs and many, many new enemies -- both extra-dimensional and homegrown -- including particularly evil types of cops and \"Combine\" soldiers. I could go on and on about this game, but what's the point?  All I can say is that if you're a Half Life fan, this was well worth the wait.  If you're not, that's cool too.  I've played games like Far Cry (great game), but this is simply better to me.  I would recommend this game to any FPS fan -- or even a fan of cutting edge computer graphics or programming.  Valve has managed to totally blow my mind.  And for people who complain there's not enough \"substance\" in HL2, it's only an FPS game after all.  How \"deep\" is it supposed to be?  As I said before, of all the FPS games I have ever played, this is right at the top of the list.  Finally, as for Steam, it does have a use.  I just logged on and downloaded a new (and free) multiplayer \"deathmatch\" version last night.  It took about 15 minutes and it's great.  And yes, you need the Internet for this one.EDIT:  As for the game being \"buggy\", I don't know what to say.  It runs perfectly on my machine (and thousands of others).  Perhaps the problems some people are having relate to \"operator error\" or computer problems (out-of-date motherboard drivers, video drivers, etc.). There's no patch that will fix this sort of thing.  This may be why many  developers are moving to consoles (Xbox, PS2) -- consoles don't require much maintenance from the user.  One's pretty much the same as another.  If this is true, it's really sad.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B008GFZV6Y","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"A delightful celebration of an iconic pink puff","reviewText":"It's hard to believe it's been a whopping 20 years since the world's most famous pink puffball, Kirby, broke out on the scene. Speaking as someone who's played just about every one of his games ever since, I was delighted to hear that the little guy's birthday was being celebrated with Kirby's Dream Collection, which cherry-picks several of his most commercially successful titles into one package. Given the lackluster disaster that was Nintendo's \"acknowledgement\" of Mario's 25th anniversary with Super Mario All-Stars: Limited Edition (which was little more than a sloppy port), expectations might be low, but thankfully this collection does its birthday boy right-for the most part.The collection includes most of Kirby's best-known games; there are the Game Boy titles Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Dream Land 2, Kirby's Adventure of the NES, Kirby Super Star and Kirby's Dream Land 3 of the SNES, and Nintendo 64's Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards. If you're among the select few experiencing these games for the first time, you are indeed in for quite a treat, as Kirby games in general offer some of the cutest, most charmingly whimsical platforming experiences available. Kirby's Dream Land 3, Super Star and The Crystal Shards in particular feature Kirby shining his brightest, accentuating his diverse array of awesome abilities as he travels through the colorful, surreal dreamscape that we've all appropriately come to know as Dream Land.Each of the games can be played holding the Wii Remote sideways, but there is Classic and GameCube Controller compatibility as well. Each game is a to-the-tee port (minus, arguably, Kirby 64, which is rendered at twice the resolution of the original, so keen eyes might notice cleaner, smoother polygons) and plays exactly the same; as veterans remember, classic Kirby gameplay consists of inhaling enemies to copy their abilities and then duking it out using the various powers you gain (ranging from throwing ninja stars to shooting laser beams or simply sweeping a little broom).Although these only encompass Kirby's first decade of existence (which ironically means Nintendo is ignoring the latter half of the anniversary they're celebrating), there's still much more for Kirby fans to sink their teeth into. Entirely new content is offered in the form of Challenge Stages, a series of time trials based heavily on the gameplay and aesthetic design of Kirby's most recent installment, 2011's Return to Dream Land. Like that game's own Challenge Stages, you'll embark on time-limited missions to defeat as many enemies, collect as many coins and take as little damage as you possibly can while using only one predetermined copy ability per stage. These newly designed Challenge Stages do make for some great fun and in fact present quite a, well, challenge, particularly if you're aiming for a perfect gold medal score. They even added a pseudo-storyline of sorts, reintroducing Return to Dream Land's mysterious alien Magolor as a competitor you'll race throughout the final stages. Although it's not the meatiest of new additions, many collections of this sort don't contain any wholly new content at all, so I appreciate and commend the extra effort.A lot of the value also comes with the packaging itself: Kirby's Dream Collection is currently only available in its \"Special Edition\" (which may or may not end up being limited), which includes the game itself as well as a collectible art booklet and soundtrack CD. The booklet is a total fan service delicacy, with each page displaying an array of Kirby artwork, conceptual designs and sketches, screenshots and more. There's even a bestiary of sorts featuring the franchise's most memorable baddies, and several blurbs of informational history denoting Kirby's original conception, plus some seemingly work-in-progress material yet to come. The text is descriptive and the artwork is delightful; Kirby fanatics will definitely treasure this little nugget for years to come. The soundtrack features music directly ripped from the games (nothing is rerecorded or orchestrated, for those wondering), meaning you may or may not have any desire to subject yourself to the relentlessly upbeat, older 8-bit tunes. There are also, however, a small handful of new, Kirby-inspired tracks that do merit an earnest listen, particularly the entertaining \"Electro Kirby,\" a techno mix of memorable Kirby tracks.Some other goodies include an in-game timeline that allows you to travel through a detailed account of Kirby's history, spanning from his debut in 1992 to his most recent outing on the Wii. In this feature, you'll be able to move Kirby himself along the timeline and physically view the box of each and every one of his games, watch its trailer, read its description, or, if it's included in this collection, jump right into playing it. There is also a wonky but fairly interesting inclusion of random trivia knowledge for each year (you'll be reading little blurbs about Janet Reno and the Olympics amidst all the Kirby games). There are also a few full episodes of the Kirby TV show, Right Back At Ya!, included, which you can view through the interactive timeline section.Speaking as someone who owned and played every single one of these previous titles, I definitely found some of them to be played out and then some by this point, particularly those that have already been rereleased several times. As truly fantastic as Kirby Super Star was, given that I played it a hundred times over the first time around and then played through the entire thing again on the Nintendo DS rerelease Super Star Ultra, I had little desire to revisit it here. I had also already downloaded the 3DS eShop versions of Kirby's Dream Land and Kirby's Adventure, both of which frankly are much better suited to a handheld console at this point in time. This leads to a bigger overarching issue: this is a collection that, in my opinion, was really meant to be a Nintendo 3DS game. Playing 20 year-old Game Boy games on an HD flatscreen in 2012 feels wonky, particularly when you realize that none of these titles are even the appropriate resolution to be properly displayed on modern TV screens (there is no fit-to-screen mode for any of the classic games, meaning you'll be seeing blocky borders on either side of the screen). This certainly doesn't affect the gameplay experience, but it does make one question if this was really intended for a home console.Additionally, although the games included are great in their own right, a greater addition of more obscure games such as Dream Course, Kirby's Avalanche, Star Stacker or the Japan-only release KiraKira Kids would've really beefed up the catalogue and made it more worthwhile for already loyal fans (who surely already own the biggest games, either in their original form or as one of their various rereleases on the eShop or Virtual Console). Ignoring all of Kirby's GBA and DS installments was also a bit of a poor choice; Amazing Mirror and Squeak Squad would have been great additions. Also, a big frustration players will be facing is the lack of a return-to-menu option once you start playing one of the classic games; you'll have to return to the main Wii menu and reset the entire game if you want to change games, which can be very annoying if you have the desire to switch games quickly.So the ultimate question most people will have when it comes to a collection like this: is it worth it? If you're a Kirby newbie and have yet to experience his catalogue of fantastic classic games, the answer is an absolute yes. For tried and true Kirby fanatics who've already played through each and every one, the answer is similar, but a bit more complicated. It really depends on just how much of a Kirby fan you are; speaking as someone who absolutely adores Kirby and didn't actually finish Kirby 64 the first time around (meaning I do actually have a first-time full playthrough to enjoy), I'm pretty satisfied with the purchase, particularly because I'm a sucker for Kirby merchandise (the colorful packaging, detailed art book and comprehensive soundtrack are all delectable goodies) and did get more enjoyment than I was expecting from the all-new Challenge Stages. All in all, if you're a fan of the pink puff, it's hard to go wrong with just $39.99 for this much content, whether you're craving the wholeheartedly new or just want to bask in the warm light of some truly dreamy nostalgia.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

Golden Sun's graphics are top notch, improving (im my opinion) drastically over its predecessor. The summon spells look great, although they seem useless, and in fact I think that using them can HINDER your chances to win big battles, but they do look great. The number of hidden secrets is incredible, ranging from optional superbosses to top-notch summons to weapons dropped only by monsters. For the fun factor, this game ranks up there with the best - as far as the puzzles go, I would rank them with those found in Zelda and Lufia.So, where's the problem? Well, unfortunately, GS2 is obviously not the end of the story, a fact which becomes painfully obvious early in the game. Whereas the first GS introduced us to this incredible new RPG universe, and the surely-upsoming GS3 will resolve the conflict for good, this game trudges along story-wise, simply playing through events in order to lead to the bolckbuster finale. I would liken this to the recent &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;; this game's story is here merely to deliver events until the third game can be released. And for that, I knock off a star.Oh, but maybe I'm nitpicking. I honestly haven't enjoyed PLAYING an RPG like this in a long time, and here's hoping that we get a few more like this. Even with the flaws, GS2 is a worthy sequel and is certainly worth your money (get it now, though, before it disappears like its predecessor!).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2004"}

I really was more interested in getting Silent Hill 2 and Soul Reaver 2, but since Soul Reaver 2 won't be out until next month I wanted to get Devil May Cry.And boy am I glad that I did.  I have read someone describe this game as kind of a cross between Castlevania and Resident Evil and I would have to say I agree with that.  It's got a Castlevania feel to it which I say is a great thing.  But don't get me wrong, this game is by no means Castlevania, but it might be just as fun as any game in the Castlevania series (yes even Symphony of the Night).The graphics as said by others are incredible.  But that alone does not a game make.  The fluid game play, great controls, wonderful environments make for a great gaming experience.The game itself is broken up into missions, but that does not mean that your freedom is limited.  Even though it has distinct separate missions you still have the freedom to go back to older areas.  Just because it&#8217;s a mission doesn&#8217;t lock you into going that way only.  Now sometimes you won&#8217;t be able to go back, because some area might have gotten blocked off, but it&#8217;s okay, you will probably want to see what they have ahead for you anyways.Prepare for time to disappear once playing this game.  You get so engrossed into it you are not so eager to turn it off, which I find wonderful, because I know that I am having so much fun that I don&#8217;t want to stop.  I find nothing tedious about the game and even restarting isn&#8217;t a bad thing, because you want to better your ranking (each level grades you on how you did) and collect more red orbs (money to buy power ups).All in all I would say this is one of the most fun gaming experiences I have had in a while.  It&#8217;s a game that that will entertain you and amaze you at the same time.  And even though I like Silent Hill 2 a whole lot, I would have to say that this game is actually more fun to play.  Hope I was some help to someone, take care and keep on gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2001"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player.

But Tekken 5 has turned a new coin over. As I pulled out my few more yen out for exchange for tokens I immediatley stopped my hand for the outcome of that deed. I knew what was going to happen. Either I randomly press buttons and win or play like I mean it and loose. So I waited until my friend got it. I bought it too around 4 weeks ago being in the heart of Tokyo but I was confused on what Namco is doing. I called up some of my friends and we e-mailed the Namco designers themselves. They described their need in changing Tekken from its former self. If I recall Soul Calibur and its series was full of pointless punching and kicking and took no skill at all. Similar to the great hit Guilty Gear which involved no skill whatsoever. So what do I do...I complain my heart out. Tekken is turning into sh*ty old Soul Calibur who wants that. The music sucks and so does the fighting systems. I loved the old Tekken I think i'll just stick to that.

There isn't really that much story here because the campaign is extremely short. You can probably beat this in two long sittings or about 4-5 hours. The characters are uninteresting and the voice acting isn't nearly as good as the console games. The way it sits now, I forgot about this game the second I finished it.It doesn't help that there just isn't anything memorable in this game. It copies everything from the past games and doesn't do anything new. The only thing new is probably the touch screen controls for secondary weapons, that's it. Touching the screen and sliding the circle where you want projectiles to go is pretty intuitive. The Mule lets you slide back on the crossbow for bolts, and tagging enemies with the Bullseye is as simple as pressing the enemy on-screen for a second. I also liked the fire axe melee button on the side which came in handy. Even dragging grenade icons to where you want to throw them was a nice touch. One thing I also liked was that there was no health bar so you don't have to rely on getting health packs, however, you die just as quickly. A few shots and you're down! This game carries over the relentless difficulty from past games which I didn't like.You can upgrade your weapons again, but not like in Resistance 3 through use. Picking up Grey Tech allows you to unlock 2 of 6 upgrades for each weapon at all times. Each weapon has three red and blue upgrades, but only one of each color for each weapon can be active. This system was alright, but finding the Grey Tech was a serious pain and isn't as intuitive as upgrading through use. You can also collect hidden files in the game, but I also don't care for this very much.There really aren't any bosses in the game except the terrible one at the end. Shooting red glowing objects and being able to be instantly killed in one hit is just unfair. The game in general is just seriously lacking any of the huge epic moments from the PS3 games and even the PSP game, Retribution. The graphics are great and some of the best on the console so far, but they could have done more with his. The visual style is pretty mundane and feels recycled from the first two games. The Chimera are all the same with only 3 or 4 different types that we have already seen. Burning Skies could have been a whole new game on its own like Retribution for PSP, but instead it just copied from past games and added a Vita shell around it. This is a great weekend rental, but nothing really more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Big Boss Games","summary":"Prepare to work those thumbs!","reviewText":"Reviewed for Big Boss Games by: TRCI sum up this game as \"Thumb Exercise 101\".In Metroid Zero Mission for the GBA you play as Samus going on a mission to destroy Mother Brain and all the Metroids.Metroid Zero Mission is a great remake of the original Metroid from the NES.This game has lots of cool stuff added, like a whole other level after you defeat Mother Brain.This game is very addictive.

It's sleek and powerful. Although the DS has undergone some major changes with the Nintendo DS Lite, you'll appreciate the minor changes as well. The built-in microphone resides in the middle of DS Lite and not at the bottom. We've moved the Power button away from the Control Pad and placed it on the side of the machine. Also, we've added a larger stylus to give you a better grip on gameplay.If that isn't enough, Nintendo DS Lite sports a longer battery life, up to 19 hours depending on the brightness settingyou choose. Of course, the new handheld still plays all the Game Boy Advance titles available in addition to games made specifically for Nintendo DS.And the built-in Wi-Fi lets you play wirelessly against nearby friends, or you can play online against gamers from around the world with Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.Awesome games, great enhancements and an incredible price makes Nintendo DS Lite will be your best acquisition of the year.","reviewerName":"Edward Cullen \"EC\"","summary":"Best Gameboy Yet !!!","reviewText":"WoW Where do I begin, when the first ds came out it was ugly as hell and the brightness suck too.I did not buy one knowing Nintendo and there greedy ways on changing their products religiously,I waited longer and got the ds lite two weeks when it came out and was very please with the design and brightness as well as how the games are so additive.The ds lite has 2 screens and one (the bottom one) is touch screen making your game play change to a new excited gaming experience for a new generation.The ds lite also has many colors so you can choose your own style.The system itself is very compact you can close it so the screens don't get dusty or scratch which is great because you won't stop playing and it comes with a stylus and the stylus can go in the system so you won't lose it,Now battery life last for hours with just one charge way longer then the psp.Now on to the bad, I don't care how many reviewers tell you they're aren't none cause that's BS because if Nintendo is good at something it cheap hardware.The ds lite can get very scratch on the glossy part unless you use a cover.The ds lite comes with a gba port but the stupid port sticks out the game so it looks ugly and out of place and people might steal the game seeing it all stick out form the ds itself,and when you do start playing the gba games the games itself look smaller then they were on the gba sp system and playing them feels very uncomfortable too because of the awkward controlling which you can't change which sucks cause I play more gba games then the ds games.The ds graphics aren't that really good yeah they look very nice but psp is waaaaaaay better in that department.The worst part is after you play awhile with the system it breaks because of the b button being press so much which is place on the power button and if you break it the system turns off every time you press the b button, I don't know how Nintendo dummy's didn't see that in testing the system but I'm up to my second ds because of it and don't even get a dsi they totally suck because the system breaks faster like my brother's he only had it for 3 months and the shoulder buttons broke then the screen lost its lines and he didn't even play with it much or drop it and now we have to pay 60 busks to get it fix.To be basic get this system and treat it like a new born baby, its great and even nice to look at, I got the cobalt and love how cool and pretty it is and guess what the ds plays great games so get this now and go crazy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

Many, many, many gamers loved the Mario games for being fun to play with and this game took the franchise to a whole new level. If you haven't played this particular NES game yet, shame on you. Back in the days, I rented this game out and was blown away by the graphics, sounds and variety of levels and its challenges.Super Mario Bros. 3 lets you take control of Mario as you guide him through 8 worlds of various themes. They were all packed with stages with plenty of various challenges to overcome with the main goal being reaching and beating Bowser. What made this game remarkable was taking the essence of Super Mario Bros. and expanding it in every way possible. At your disposable, you had numerous power ups to use and many coins to collect to earn extra lives. You even had the ability to save power ups to use later in the game, which proved to be very useful. There were many secrets to uncover so it was worth playing this game over and over even if you beat it already.Get this game and pass this on to those who never tried this out and get it if you, like me, missed out on purchasing the original cartridge back then. Or you can do this: take advantage of the Virtual Console Service up and running for the Wii and download this game for 500 points(US $5.00.)

You have two squads at your command, Alpha and Bravo; each has a squad leader and two additional squad mates. Each squad operates as a unit and cannot be separated into individuals. However, you can tell a squad to go over to a certain place, like making Alpha team hide at the top of a cliff and pick off any incoming enemy soldiers heading toward your position as you make your way to take out an enemy hideout.GR has four different classes for each member of your squads (e.g. demolition and your basic infantry). The game does not stop there it allows you to pick each members weapon and secondary weapon (which there are a lot of). Ghost Recon has some RPGish elements to it. The more any member of the GR team is used, the better his skills will get. If you get a squad mate hurt in battle he will have to take some time out of action if you want him to heal or you can keep him in the fray, risking the loss of a soldier. If you lose a man on the field he is gone for the rest of the mission.The battles in this game are fast, furious and truly intense. You will get breaks in the action to catch your breath. The AI in this game will have you second guessing almost every thing you do, they will suppress you with fire and have other members try to flank you. They will use this maneuver often but on occasion they will employ other ways to fill you full of lead. You must use strategy; you cannot go into an enemy base with guns blazing and expect to be successful.Although there are now new and improved titles in the Ghost Recon series, this is all in all a great game which is now playable on the Xbox 360 as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

When that day finally came, opinions were split down the middle. Most either hated it or loved it, and I for one happen to have love it. Although I feel a tad foolish for paying full price for it on day 1, I still enjoyed nearly every minute of it. Despite the games fantastic graphics, which are some of the best ever, the games main flaw is its repetitive gameplay and drawn out levels towards the middle part of the game. Some of the levels are a bit too similar and some more open areas would have greatly helped with this. Also constantly looking for a pda(basically a key), can get tiresome. Also not to be forgotten, is the fact that Doom 3 is an extremely dark game. There are no lights attached to your guns so you must constantly switch back and forth. However, this factor gives the game is creepiness and its oppresive mood. For me, the game was quite startling at parts. You can eventually guess where the monsters will pop out but its still fun finding a scary moment. Despite the games flaws, it is still a blast wandering around blasting the heck out of various demons and zombies while admiring the Mars station. Another thing about this graphics powerhouse, is that it requires a somewhat midtier system to really shine. Basically if your willing to give a game that isn't quite as good as its older brothers(mainly Doom 1+2) a chance, then you will have fun with this remake of the original.P.S. If you like this game, then be sure to grab the expansion Doom 3:ROE which is actually better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2005"}

Not only are the controls so simple even a 5 year old could play, but it's also fast, furious, and most of all, fun.A little bit after two years after its release, Nintendo announced a sequel to the best-selling fighting game. Shown at E3, it passed Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2 as the most anticipated Gamecube game. Over the next 6 months, Nintendo tortured their fans by revealing saliva-inducing options such as 292 trophies, 25 characters, 28 stages, an much, much more. Finally, the wait is over, and fans are treated to the greatest fighting game of the year.The graphics are magificent. People claim the backgrounds are terrible, but they look fine to me. The character design is so detailed you can see the furs on Fox and the curves of the cloth for Mario. And most importantly of all, it goes at a blistering 60 frames per second. That's an amazing feat considering most of the things documented in this site goes at just 24 fps.If anybody's a fan of Nintendo music, then this is the game for you. It remixes many popular tunes from Zelda's Overworld Theme to Pokemon's Battle Theme. The sound effects are wonderful, and best of all, there is none of the sound editing that plagued the first version.Super Smash Bros. Melee is not a rehash of the N64 version, as it has been often called. It has brand new moves. Now, if you grab somebody, you have a choice of attacking the victim, or throwing them up, down, forward, or back. There are 4 Special Attacks instead of the usual 3, and you can dodge projectile attacks and mid-air attacks.In the original Super Smash Bros., the one-player mode was going through a fixed set of 13 stages. In Melee, there is Classical Mode, which is a lot like the original, only the stages are mixed. There Adventure Mode, where the player goes through scrolling world with hazards before fighting your enemy. There is Stadium Mode, where you can play your character's target practice level, beat up a beanbag before seeing how far you can hit it with a bat, and fight against up to 100 computer characters. There is an event mode with 51 events where you fight in special pre-set circumstances. And then there are the 292 trophies which include people like Misty from Pokemon or the go-kart from the Mario Kart games.But the truly amazing part of this game is the multiplayer mode, which is what makes Super Smash Bros. one of the classics for the N64. You can play the usual stock (lives) or time mode, but you can also play coin mode, where you knock coins out of your opponents and collect there. Then there are the special melee modes, with special battles like Giant Melee (where everybody is big), or Special Sudden Death Melee, where everybody starts off with 300% damage. This game WILL last you over 500 hours if you are a fan of the original.This game is a perfect example of why Nintendo is so successful today. Like what has been mentioned earlier in this review, this game is fast, furious, and most of all, fun. If you are a fan of fighting games or Nintendo, then this game is a must.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2001"}

It is, hands down, the most compelling and well written game I've played. While it builds off the cinematic approach and mechanics of Uncharted it comes together in a very unique experience. While it may feel a bit unwieldy compared to Drake's quick, acrobatic character in Uncharted, learning to use the crafting system and know when to sneak vs. fight will make you feel like a very dangerous person by the time the credits roll.though there is a lot of it, the combat never gets repetitive. The player always has a variety of paths to choose when confronting enemies and it is a mixture of stealth, deceit and planning will get you through most scenarios. The gunshots are loud, the melee is vicious and even the enemies elicit an emotional response, from wrath to remorse.Every boss battle is tense and satisfying  without being so difficult as to break the flow of the story.There are some visual glitches. Ellies hair does some weird things and, as some have already mentioned, the friendlies' immunity to detection by clickers and other enemies is a distraction.

Emotion, story, 20 hours long, writing, combat, voice acting, even the multi-player is supposed to be different and tied in with the game, survival, crafting, and not a run and gun like Uncharted 3.It's a 10/10 game.  The game is dark like a cable series, like Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, etc, this is not Uncharted AKA Disneyland.  It's also not over the top, like you think it may be, it plays out beatifully.  It's as believable as it can be for a survival game.I will say one thing as you are learning to play at the start of the game and may even seem a touch boring, not a lot of action, don't worry about that it picks up and you'll never turn back just after that moment. I think it's called Downtown in the game, it was lulling a bit.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"I would like to start off by stating that I have played and own most of the Call of Duty games. For the 3 different modes of the game, read their respective sections below.Campaign: (No Spoilers)In my opinion, the campaign of MW3 was very good, but not as good as MW2 and BO. It has a decent storyline and loads of action, but some of the missions just weren't as fun and seemed like doing the same thing in a different place. The campaign of MW3 isn't too difficult and is about on par with MW2. Veteran is still pretty difficult, but there are no points which are brutally hard. I liked that Infinity Ward brought back some of my favorite characters from past games, and introduced lots of new ones as well. Like past games, there are multiple intel items to find and achievements regarding doing special tasks which aren't too difficult.Multiplayer:The multiplayer of this game is very fun, in my opinion. I agree that some of the maps are not as good as the others, but I don't think that all of them are terrible. Sometimes multiplayer can be very frustrating because of extremely overpowered weapons or bad losses, but not most of the time. There is a huge amount of weapons, attachments, and equipment that you can unlock. Many favorites have returned from previous games, and some new ones have been added. There is a new \"Weapon Rank\" system. Whenever you get a kill with a weapon, you get experience points for your main ranking system and the new Weapon Rank system. There are 31 progressive weapon ranks, and almost each new rank unlocks a new attachment or camo design for that weapon. Perks are special abilities that nyou choose for your player, and 3 are selected. There are many perks, including some that help you reload faster, sprint faster, or detect enemy equipment. There is also a \"Pro\" variant of each perk, which extends the ability of that perk (i.e. Scavenger-Collect ammo from each killed enemy, Scavenger Pro-Spawn with extra ammo) and is unlocked after completing challenges for that perk.  There are 3 killstreak categories, Assault, Support, and Specialist. In Assault, it's the classic Killstreak system, get multiple kills in one life, reset when you die. It is mainly focused on getting kills on the enemy team. In Support, your killstreak doesn't reset when you die. It is mainly focused on helping out your team get kills. In Specialist, your streak resets when you die. After a specific amount of consecutive kills, your player receives an additional perk. At 7 kills, your player receives all of the avaliable perks. Deathstreaks are also in multiplayer, where if you die multiple times in a row without getting any kills, you receive a deathstreak, such as dropping a live grenade when you die, detonating C4, or increased bullet damage for one kill.  A new system in Multiplayer is \"Weapon Proficiencies\". After ranking up a weapon, a player also unlocks proficiencies for that weapon, which are sort of like perks for the weapon, such as increased range or bullet penetration. There are 80 levels in multiplayer, and they normally take a while to progress through. Once you reach level 80, you can \"Prestige\". When you Prestige, you go back to being level 1 and lose all of your unlocked items. You also get a new Emblem, Title, and a Prestige Token. There are currently 10 Prestige levels, but 10 more will soon be added. Prestige Tokens are used to purchase items in the Prestige Shop, where you can get things such as an extra Custom Class or Double XP for 2 hours.Spec Ops/Survival:Spec Ops has returned from MW2. Spec Ops is a mode where you do special mini-missions usually related to the Campaign. You can either do it alone, or with a friend. You can earn up to 3 stars for each mission, depending on what difficulty you completed the mission on or the time it took for the mission. There are 20 missions, and all of them are pretty fun. I highly recommend doing them with a friend, especially on the higher difficulties. You alo rank up in Special Ops, which is a separate rank then in Multiplayer. There are 50 levels, and ranking up unlocks either more Special Ops missions or items in Survival. Survival mode is an extremely fun mode of Special Ops, and probably my favorite thing in MW3. It is similar to Zombies from BO and WaW, Firefight from Halo, or Horde from Gears of War. The maps in Survival mode that you can play on are the same ones in Multiplayer. The objective of Survival is to, well, surive as long as you can while fighting off endless waves of enemies, which progressively get harder. You start off with nothing but a pistol. For every kill you get, you get points that can be used to buy items from the Weapon, Equipment, or Air Support armories. Not all items are avaliable right away, but ranking up in Spec Ops unlocks new items. In the Weapon Armory, you can purchase guns and attachments for them. In the Equipment Armory, you can buy things that help you defend against the enemies, such as Sentry Guns or Riot Shields. In the Air Support Armory, you can buy things like Predator Missiles, Airdrop Markers, Perk Care Packages, and even friendly troops to assist you! You also start off with a Self-Revive and Body Armor. Self-Revives allow you, if downed, to kill an enemy to get back up. Body Armor lets you take 250 points of damage before you die. You can buy both of these from the Equipment Armory. When playing with a friend, if a player gets downed, the other player has one minute to revive him, or the game ends. The 20 Survival Maps have different difficulties, which are not selected by the player, but already put in. The difficulties are Easy, Normal, Hard, and Insane. The difficulties change not how much health the player has, but how quickly harder troops like Juggernauts and Attack Helicopters appear.Overview:Modern Warfare 3 is a very good game, and has a good campaign, great multiplayer, and very entertaining Spec Ops modes. I would definitely recommend this game to newcomers of the Call of Dty series and veterns alike. It may not be as good as the other games in the genre and series, but is definitely worth buying, especially if a lot of your friends have it too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A console system that truly screams...NextGen","reviewText":"The PS3 console was the last of the supposed \"next gen\" consoles to hit the market.  However by being last in line this console shapes up to actually be the only real NEXT GEN system which actually uses next generation hardware.  The system I run is the last generation 80GB \"phat\" models (the glossy bulky ps3's).  It contains chips coded identical to the 160GB slim, only negatives is, 80GB vs 160GB ( q _ q ) and Smaller chips.  However the phat model does have some perks over the slim but I'll get into some gripes I got about the slim later as nothing is perfect.The PS3 is basically a \"do it all\" console.  While the operating system feature has been removed, it wasn't that widely used to begin with and what uses it had mainly were used to crack the system and hack games (there were legit uses like the military using PS3's as a supercomputer network).  The reason why I chose the PS3 over a 360 and even a Wii was for a few reasons.1. Playstation 3 contains a blu-ray player, and yes BR-players are cheaper now  you are still buying a Gaming Console + HD Media player in one.  That's right.  Your PS3 not only gives you up to 1080p in your games, but you can pop in blu ray movies and enjoy HD movies .2. PS3 is 3D ready.  While I am not a big 3D fan (I am waiting for Auto-stereoscopic TV , but that's a whole other discussion) your system is compatible with 3D TV.  There also are many games available for 3D and new titles are starting to be produced with 3D in mind now.3. PS3 offers easy modification.  That's right, your PS3 system has the user in mind. Not only is it rather easy to reskin your PS3 (360 is just as easy) but the PS3 uses STANDARD 2.5\" laptop hard drives.  160GB not enough?  Just shut the system off.. take out the hard drive which is fairly easy (1 - 2 screws tops).  Pop in a brand new 1TB 7200 RPM laptop drive and congrats; your system is now using a faster and more drive space  hard drive.  System will also format the drive for you (backing up your data however requires a USB stick or external hard drive)4. Competitive edge.  We can spend 500 years arguing  Halo vs Killzone,  Gears vs this.. Uncharted stinks I like Alan Wake blah blah..  Each system has great exclusives and gives you a reason to buy both system honestly.  However when I talk about competitive edge I am referring to system lifespan.  360 is starting to approach a \"cap\" where if you push any harder the system will just push back ... the Wii hit a \"cap\" basically at launch cause it never went with HD ready technology.  While a system like the 360 is around 85-90% used, the PS3 is currently around 50-60%  which means the PS3 has the ability to long outlast the other consoles and keep up with the next best graphics engine5. Free online play anyone?  That's right.. PSN is 100% free..  in fact, if you chose to pay for PSN  you are given discounts on DLC, exclusive content, FREE DLC at times. Ontop of that  PSN Plus members can buy extended warrenties on their system that are 100% sony backed and cover a multitude of problems.  However if you chose not to be a plus Member (i chose to remain a Free PSN user)  there is no harm done.  I used Xbox Live for a long time and the PSN is pretty  much on par with the X-box Live network.  The difference is the standards being set(will discuss in the negatives)These are some great reasons why the PS3 stands strong in the console market, and at $299.99 it is worth picking one up.  However all good things do have problems as I shall tell below1. Firmware... bum bum bum... dramatic re-verb... ^_^  PS3 firmware updates maybe once every 6 months now (unless something crucial hits like a hack, or a problem turns up)  While I am all for keeping the system up to date, adding new features (sometimes removing some BOO!!!!), Firmware updates are risky. This isn't just you download a big software patch and OOPs it broke the XMB(desktop) or my games.. let me uninstall it.  The Firmware is corrupt or it bricks the system. Its done... period.  So there is high risk in firmware updates (never had a problem nor have any of my friends) but be aware you may have to download firmware updates.  If you do not have internet games that require certain firmware will have the firmware on the disk and firmware flash the system for you.  I just find it one of those nail-biting steps2. Slim model design.  Okay its slim, small, less heat and less prone to hardware failure (phats are like 5-7%  slims are like 3-5%) but.. honestly phats look better. The glossy case, the touch sensitive buttons.  Phats also have a kill switch in the back that lets you kill power to the system so it doesn't sit in standby mode all night long.  This is just a cosmetic negative however3. PSN network.  Yes it is free.. who doesn't love free stuff .  However paying for PSN doesn't give you better service; just perks.  Also PSN doesn't conform to a standard.  X-Box live has standards that must be met (server bandwidth for games, quality and run times , scheduled down times) . With PSN this is left up to the company.. not Sony.  While I have yet to run into a major problem with this, you sometimes will see a lack of polish online.  Like  the PSN store works, Killzone MP works, LBP2 MP works yet Black Ops MP is lagging like junk... or perhaps Killzone 2 servers go down middle of the day cause of a problem.  It is that lack of polish that sometimes can hurt PSN but in no way does it make it a horrible experienceOutside of those 3 problems all being fairly minor there are no real major problems I've had with my PS3.  It has been a fantastic, reliable system that boasts great exclusives, a free online, a quality blu-ray player for games and movies.  It also has a great Up-scaling chip inside for DVD's (my philips 1080p DVD player does a better job but it also is dedicated to up-scaling.. on the PS3 it is just an added feature).***  So lets see here..  $299.99 buys you a  PS3 HD gaming system, a Blu-Ray movie player, a DVD Up-Scaling player, a multi-media hub for pictures, music and data, it supports 3D,  supports motion gaming  honestly... for the most part Sony isn't lying when they say \"It does Everything\"  it kind of pretty much does._____Comparison______This is just a small section I'm going to put in for my + and - for each console system.  There is currently a much more detailed review on that so no point in repeating what has already been said.  + = pro  - = ConPS3+ Blu-Ray player makes it easier for future games to be 1080p, and watch 1080p blu-ray movies+ Built in DVD Up-scaling+ 3D ready (with firmware update unless current systems ship with latest firmware)+ Free Online+ Blue-tooth and wireless support out of the box+ Easy replacement of hard drive and upgrading- Routine Firmware updates are like playing Russian roulette  (i think so)- Free Online can lead to some occasional quality control problems- No background Installation (installing content pretty much forces you to wait for it to finish)Xbox 360+ Quality online play with a much larger community than PSN+ Now has built in Wi-Fi (older models required adapters)+ Popular exclusives and 360 has more competitive online play+ Media Center ready+ Better user customization- No Blu-Ray drive or optical- Incredibly High Fail rate- Pay to Play is required for onlineWii+ Great for kids+ Has motion gaming (I could of swore my NES had this also :) )+ Very simple to set up and like the PS3, gives you netflix access at no charge+ Games are lots of fun!

{"product_name":"B0050SZ49Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Eric Rose","summary":"meh","reviewText":"Update:Someone didn't find my review helpful, so perhaps I'll include this lightning review paragraph: For a dorm room or a kids bedroom where the PS3 is in the bedroom, this monitor is great, and I would highly recommend it for that application.  I do not recommend it for a living room application if that's where you use your PS3.Read on for original unedited review:I have used this monitor for about 1 week.  I watched Tangled 3D (Disney, love the horse!), played Batman Arkham City a little bit with 3D (I already finished the main mission and was doing some extra missions to test the 3D), and played the included racing game (Motostorm) in both 3D and in SimulView with my teenage son.  My primary display is a 110\" screen Epson 1080p projector (8350), with 5.1 speakers through a Sony receiver.Here goes:Cons:1.  Too small.2.  Batman was hard to play in 3D, I found it disorienting.3.  Sound is meh, especially compared to my home theater.4.  Glare on screen is terrible.  Room needs to be pitch black.  And any extra lights coming from somewhere in the house are distracting.5.  Glare on glasses is terrible, ditto from above.6.  Glasses are uncomfortable.  Yuck.  terrible.  Panasonic glasses (at twice the price) are way nicer.  Different league completely.7.  When used with Sony PS3 wireless headphones (which I think are great), the glasses become even MORE uncomfortable, if that's even possible (it is possible).  Too bad because the headphones and the display are otherwise a good match for each other, but combined they are painful.8.  Ridiculously limited number of SimulView supported games. (4 as of this writing).  SimulView is not automatic if a game (Call of Duty comes to mind) support split screen gaming.  Only a few games support it.  From the description:  Games supporting SimulView technology include MotorStorm Apocalypse, Killzone 3, Gran Turismo 5, Super Stardust HD.  Wow.  4 games.  Amazingly, I now own 2 of them.9.  Only comes with one set of glasses even though the primary reason to get this screen is for SimulView gaming with a friend/family member.  Come on, really?!10. \"Universal\" 3D glasses work with the display, but NOT with SimulView!11.  Have to play the HDMI cable switch-a-roo game to switch between this monitor and the projector.  I ordered an HDMI switcher, so I have to have yet another device plugged in and cables going all over the place.Pros:1.  3D movies look great and now I want an Epson 3010 3D projector.2.  SimulView games work great!  I wish that technology worked with other 3D screens and projectors.  SimulView is the best way to play \"split screen\" games and it will be a shame if this technology is lost because no one supports it because this monitor is the only way to use it!!  More SimulView games please!3.  2D picture quality is quite impressive, except for glare and small size.  It's a nice screen, no doubt.  Bluray movies look terrific.4.  \"Universal\" 3D glasses work with the display, but NOT with SimulView, only for viewing 3D.5.  The included glasses work on other 3D TVs that support the universal standard.6.  Motostorm in 3D was pretty cool.  Better than Batman I thought, since it's just a driving game and not a complicated action game like Batman.7.  Screen is pretty slim.  The pictures don't do it justice, it's very slim.  The border is as slim as my iPhone4, and the bulky middle part is only twice that thickness (thinness?).Other comments:I got it for 3 Benjamins, and I'm glad I didn't pay 4.  I got a 2nd set of glasses for 50 bucks.  So for 350 big ones, I can watch a 3D movie with 1 other person in my house (since there are 2 other people, this is a little bit of a problem).  Now I wish I had a projector for 3D.  I like the 3D blurays.  This screen is too small to enjoy in the living room, but that's where the PS3 is!  So sure, I could put it on my desk where the computer is, and sit 18\" away from it (where it would look great), but the PS3 isn't there!!  So now do I get yet another PS3 (I own 2 already!)?  No, we decided that is just ridiculous.  So we keep it in the living room, in the cabinet with the PS3, behind a door (to prevent the glossy screen from acting like a mirror when we aren't using it).  Maybe in a dorm room it would be cool.I think it would be cooler if:1.  It was 42-50\" in diameter!2.  Every game with split screen option could be made to work with SimulView. (Call of Duty, Portal2, etc).3.  The glasses were more comfortable (Panasonic did it, so Sony can do it too).  This is a big factor when watching a movie for 90 minutes.4.  It wasn't glossy!!  What is the deal with TV manufacturers and glossy screens?  NO gloss please!5.  I lived in a small room (dorm room) and sat 18\" away and only had 1 other person to watch movies or play games.As it is now, it's a novelty item and what I really want is an Epson 3010 projector (which unfortunately is not good for gaming with a PS3 due to lag).I hope you find this review helpful.  I went into this with an open mind and think I gave it a fair test.  It's only been 1 week, but I think we did everything with it that it was meant to do.UPDATE:  After a few months I got a vertical red line of dead pixels along the right side, about 6 inches from the right side, extending all the way down from top to bottom.  Bummer.  It's too much trouble to return it so I live with it.  But can you guess how much fun it is to watch a 3d bluray movie with a bright red line down the monitor?  I'll let you answer that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2012"}

(revised)","reviewText":"Alright, so after beating the game in 3 days, i have to change my review, and thats not a good thing. I still stand by how beautiful this game is. The glorious 3 of the ps3, Uncharted, Ratchet, and Killzone. They make the system shine bright. Console exclusives truly look good unlike ported crap from the 360.But back to the game. Now i love my ps3, sold an 360 to get a slim in fact. With that sad, i dont agree with anyone saying this is a 10 out of 10 like game informer did. I dont believe any game deserves a 10, or what ever perfect score system you want to use. rather then bitch and moan, im a gonna break it down.Graphics- 9/10They look sick, and truly shine the brightest here. Some scenery was repetitive, and a few landscapes kinda bland.Game Play Off-Line- 8/10Same great game play, but some really dumb AI, and a clunky climbing system at times. Killer story though were you actually kinda learn something, scary, i know.Game Play On-Line- 8.5/10Now i have only done a little, but what i did was super fun, and really awesome. I like the co-op and how it is still true to the single player story.Issues-The climbing system has a felling of Prince of Persia where at times, jump hanging can be a little in acurate.The cover transitions sometimes just dont work, very rare though.same mission twice, just summed up.Over all- 8.8/10It aint perfect, but its damn close. The train level made it standout, and again the history lesson in there really adds some flair.My Take-  \"A must buy. The Game is sick and looks astonishing. Just be ready for a fight on harder difficulties.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

SecuROM - all you have to do is read the other reviews to see what the problem is here. I don't pay $50 to \"rent\" a game.  But this issue is minor compared to the next.2. Missing inStall code.  I CANNOT EVEN INSTALL THE GAME! My manual has a 19 character install code.  The game requires a 20 character install code.  After about 3 hours of trying to figure out the problem and speaking to tech support twice, who REFUSED to believe I wasn't using a pirated copy of the game until I sent them a picture of my manual, it turns out that this is due to misprint from the printers.  Unfortunately I was one of the unlucky ones who received the game the day of release, before EA figured out what was going on, and I was treated TWICE like a thief (once with SecuROM, and again with this when they thought I had a bootleg copy).  Now, I can understand a problem with a misprint, mistakes happen.  I assumed EA would send me a brand new code and that would be it.  What I got was this ridiculous message from EA on their web site:\"There is currently a work around that may allow you to bypass this issue. Since you have the first 19 characters of the code already, you can basically try \"guessing\" the last character. To do this, simply enter your existing code, and then for the last character, try the letters A-Z, and then the numbers 0-9. You should eventually get the right combination, and be able to play the game.\"Are you KIDDING me??!!  You want me to enter in possibly up to 37 different 19 character codes until I find the right one?!  That is beyond lazy on their part. Ultimately I took my copy back to the store (I did not purchase on Amazon) and got a refund after showing them my screwed up manual.I have purchased two separate EA games recently with SecuROM and have only now learned my lesson.  I will not be buying anymore.  Buy this game at your own risk.  If you are okay with the draconian DRM measures and don't mind the chance that you may have to enter in 37 possible install codes in order to simply play the game, maybe you will have some fun (at least until you format or change your computer hardware a couple times, and EA shuts down your copy of the game).","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002V14VOC","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"Metro 2033 is an excellent ride. Be sure to buy a ticket.","reviewText":"I am never riding the Metro again.After playing this extremely creepy and atmospheric game, I don&#8217;t think I can ever step foot into a Metro station again without getting post-traumatic stress symptoms thanks to this excellent survival horror first-person shooter. Set in the aftermath of a nuclear war, the remaining Russian population has retreated underground to the Moscow Metro system where the majority of the game takes place. The individual Metro stations have been turned into refugee camps of sorts, with families trying to survive on whatever they can. Many of the camps are run by different factions, some of which are friendly, while others are not. Travel between these crowded stations is possible but dangerous due to the mutants, bandits, and anomalies that have taken up residence in the sprawling Metro tunnels. The setting is extremely dirty, depressing and claustrophobic, but rendered in amazing detail. Every inch of the Metro system seems plausible, and years of neglect have never looked so awesome. With resources so scarce, life seems to be hanging on by a thread. The world is clearly dying, with everything, including the tunnels which preserve this last bit of humanity, rapidly deteriorating. Still, there is still a lot of life left in the people in these Metro stations, and they are not willing to disappear without a fight.You play the game as Artyom, the son of the leader of one of the Metro stations. The Mutants have become more aggressive recently, attacking the station in greater numbers. The only hope of survival for those in the station are for you to get a message to one of the other, stronger Metro stations, asking them for help. However getting there, though the dangerous subway system, past the mutants, anomalies, bandits, and more will be no easy task. Luckily you are not alone in this, and you will have a number of companions to help you with your journey.The game takes a lot of gameplay cues from existing survival horror games. This means limited supplies, dark corridors, oppressive atmosphere, and scary enemies. Friendly Metro stations, which can be thought of as hubs between missions, provide opportunities to catch your breath and trade for supplies. The currency in the tunnels takes the form of pre-war ammunition. Considering how hostile the world is, it&#8217;s not very surprising that bullets are more valuable then money. Pre-war ammo is becoming more and more scarce, so Metro residents have begun creating their own &#8220;dirty&#8221; rounds. These homemade rounds are not as powerful as the pre-war munitions, however they are plentiful. Balancing between firing dirty rounds and pre-war ammo, which doubles as your currency, creates an interesting gameplay choice. Do you want to take down the enemies quicker using less ammo, or save the ammo to buy more powerful weapons but stick to using the less effective rounds?The gunplay in the game is pretty solid for the most part. There is an interesting selection of weapons that range from pre-war guns like AK-47s to weaponry made down in the Metro. These Metro weapons are often pneumatic in nature, requiring you to manually pump air into them (think squirt guns) before they can fire their ball bearing rounds. They take longer to prep, but they are silent and rather powerful. The guns behave in a realistic manner, and there are a number of choices for upgrades that range from scopes to silencers. The mutants behave as one would expect, charging after you without much intelligence. The human opponents show a reasonable amount of intelligence, and provide a challenge.If brute force isn&#8217;t your thing, stealth is a viable option in the game. The Metro tunnels are naturally dark, and light sources can be eliminated to provide even more cover. There are a number of silent weapons, such as the pneumatic weapons discussed earlier, as well as throwing knives the like. The enemies react to noises as you would expect, investigating sounds and alerting other guards upon discovering you. Stealth is never outright required, but at times it certainly pays off to take the quiet approach.If there is one defining aspect of this game it is that it absolutely nails the sense of atmosphere and immersion. It goes beyond the exquisitely detailed environments and superb graphics though. In a manner similar to that of Far Cry 2, a lot of the game&#8217;s HUD has been replaced by in-game items and other in-game visual feedback. For example, throughout the game you have to make use of gas masks. These masks occasionally require filter changes, but there is no timer on the HUD that tells you when to swap them. Instead, you can look at the watch on the character&#8217;s wrist. Other in-game feedback that indicates it&#8217;s time to swap filters is when your character&#8217;s breathing becomes heavy and the mask begins to fog up. Likewise, mission objectives are written on a journal that you can pull up and read without being pulled out of the experience. Other neat little touches includes a hand powered electrical generator that you use to charge up battery powered items such as night vision goggles and flashlights. Instead of having a meter that displays battery power, your flashlight becomes visibly weaker over time. Taking out your electrical generator and giving it a few pumps brings your flashlight back to life. Individually these little touches are not a big deal, but when taken together they help to really bring this world to life and immerse you in it.If there is one real disappointment about the game it has to be its ending. This is a spoiler free review, so I won&#8217;t go into too much depth about what happens. However I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the very end of the game consists of a sequence of trial and error events. During this sequence I felt like a mouse in a maze that has to memorize the correct set of turns to get out. It was somewhat disappointing given the buildup, but I still found the overall ending of the game sufficient.Overall, Metro 2033 is an excellent ride. Be sure to buy a ticket.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I tried really really hard to like this game, but it's not happening.I guess I didn't really comprehend that it is a remake of an old game. As a result all they really did was spruce up the graphics and sound.But the gameplay and controls are terrible. I am mostly comparing the game to recent Castlevania games I played on the gameboy advance (GBA). On the GBA games your character could do slides, get whip power ups, double jumps in the air and so on. In this game all of that is removed, so you can only jump and whip over and over and over.My biggest complaint with the game is the presentation of the levels is just boring and seems pointless. Everytime you scroll off screen you are in a new room (which loses the feeling of being in a specific part of the castle), the enemies just attack you at regular intervals and show no real AI of any kind.For example, on one level an enemy speared me from above which made me fall back through a hole in the groud, when this happened I was suddenly in a new room with swamp creatures. So I ran to the left to avoid them, the screen scrolled, and AGAIN I was in a 3rd new room. All this in under 10 seconds. I felt totally lost and had no idea where I was in the game. So you slowly begin to drudge back to where you were but it just feels OLD. With the lack of double jump and slide attacks I feel too limited to dodge attacks effectively.In a NUTSHELL, it feels like they took the original 8-bit NES Castlevania, and improved the graphics, while sadly throwing away all the cool improvements to Castlevania games over the years.Only nostolgic people who loved the original Castlevania games will like this game.

{"product_name":"B0050SYYTK","description":"Harnessing the controller-free magic of Kinect for Xbox 360, Kinect: Disneyland Adventures will allow children and Disney fans of all ages to explore Disneyland park, enjoy immersive adventures based on popular attractions, engage in challenging quests, and interact with beloved Disney characters using their full bodies and voices, no controller required. Kinect: Disneyland Adventures is your ticket to the magical world of Disneyland through Kinect, right in your living room.","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Great graphics and amazing attention to detail, although game play can be a little repetitive","reviewText":"In many ways, Kinect Disneyland reminds me of the game Epic Mickey that came out for the Wii last year. It's a fantastic concept and the attention to detail will absolutely delight die-hard Disney fans, but gameplay itself can be a little shaky at times. But overall, it's a winner, especially if you have younger kids in the house who are always begging you to go to Disneyland or Disney World.The concept and the graphics of this game are amazing. You start the game out at the Train Station and the scene swoops onto Main Street USA, which should be familiar to anyone who's been to the parks. You define your character by choosing a boy or a girl, and give him or her a face (you basically can choose one by race), and then a hair style, hair color, shirt, and pants. There's only limited customization you can do (I'm guessing you can't use the Xbox avatar because it's just too cartoony for this world).You meet a \"magic ticket\" that tells you how to move around. You point your arm straight ahead to walk, and you can point your arm to the left or right to pivot. I've heard complaints about this, but you do get used to it eventually. Still, I probably would have liked to see the option to use the old Xbox controller for walking around, as walking by pointing isn't all that intuitive.The ticket will lead you around to meet different characters. Of course, the first character you meet is Mickey, who gives you an autograph book. You're basically given different tasks to do around Disneyland. You need to find Donald to sign to book, and then return it to Mickey. Then you need to get Goofy's autograph. And so on. It's not really challenging, as the golden ticket will lead you straight to the right character and there's also a map you can use to see where any character is at any given time. Once you encounter a character there's a fair amount of interaction you can do with it--you can shout \"Hey there!\", get their autograph, dance a jig with them, high five them, hug them, and take their picture with a magical camera that Mickey gives you.And so this is basically the first way to play Disneyland Adventures: walk around the park, interact with the characters, and solve different quests that they give you. You can collect coins throughout the park which you can eventually use to purchase virtual souvenirs in the stores. There are also \"magic items\" you can collect which will unlock secrets throughout the park.You can just walk around and explore the park if you like. In some cases you'll bump across different rides you can take just for fun, for example, riding the roller coaster in Mickey's Toontown or the Dumbo Ride in Fantasyland. The attention to detail is spectacular, right down to the first-person view you see while sitting on the rides, to the storefronts along Main Street, to the views you get walking from land to land, right down to the location of the Fastpass ticket machines and the crowds (whom you can eavesdrop on).Of course, as you walk from land to land, you'll come across the \"attractions\" (if you don't feel like walking around, you can \"fly\" from land to land by pulling up a park map). These are basically mini-games, and there are a staggering number of them. Each attraction is broken into different parts. The best way to describe each mini-game is that they're idealized version of the Disneyland rides; for example, on Space Mountain, you're really flying through space and on Thunder Mountain Railroad you're really in a mine shaft. You can collect coins in all the rides are well.Here are the attractions:FRONTIERLAND:- Big Thunder Mountain Railroad: there are two parts to this one; in the first one, you're pumping a mine cart to try to get in front of a runaway train, and in the process you can reach out and grab coins (which will be a recurring theme through all the games). In the second one, you're running on the top of the train trying to get to the front to stop it. There's actually no running involved; your character runs on his own and you basically need to lean left and right and duck to avoid obstacles.ADVENTURELAND:- Jungle Cruise: there are three parts to this one. The first part was very much like the ride, complete with smart-alecky boat captain and rhino-infested waters. Here, you man a water cannon as your jungle cruise floats down the river, shooting barrels (which release coins) and the occasional rhino or elephant. The second part of this game is a blast--you need to mimic a guard ape's motions to disarm the ape, and then get into a fruit fight trying to hit a bunch of apes by throwing bananas. In the third part of this game, you're kayaking down some rapids, trying to steer out of danger by leaning left and right.CRITTER COUNTRY:- Splash Mountain: There are two parts to this one. In the first, you run after Br'er Rabbit (you'll run automatically but you can in run place to go faster). Eventually you get to Splash Mountain, where you jump into a boat and steer by leaning left and right. In the second part, you're in a barrel going down the familiar waterfall, again leaning left and right to steer and swinging at mushrooms and items thrown at you for more points.- Winnie the Pooh: The graphics of this one were phenomenal as you're transported to Pooh Corner, drawn in the exact style of the movies. For the first part of this, you fly through the air holding onto balloons, following Winnie the Pooh on his baloon. You can flap your arms to move higher and duck to go closer to the ground. You need to collect coins and honey. In the second part, you're bouncing along with Tigger by bouncing up and down as if on a pogo stick, giving an extra bounce to avoid obstacles and to collect honey. In the third part, you're essentially playing a game of \"catch\" (a lot like baseball in Kinect Sports 2) where Piglet and Roo are chucking presents at you from a bush.NEW ORLEANS SQUARE:- Haunted Mansion: In the first part of this game you're flying through the Haunted Mansion, steering to move left and right to avoid obstacles like chairs, cabinets and paintings. Occasionally you have to match the poses of paintings to fly through them. In the second part of the game you need to escape the mansion by leaning left and right to run and pointing a flashlight at ghosts to make them explode into a pile of coins.- Pirates of the Carribbean: The first game here is a very realistic game where you paddle a boat with two oars, but then the game turns into one very much like the kayaking game above..TOMORROWLAND:- Astro Blasters: This was a rail shooter game where you fight alongside Buzz Lightyear. As before, you fly by leaning left and right. You shoot by pointing your arm straight out at what you want to shoot (the blaster will fire automatically when you point at a target). As levels progress, you get into a spaceship flying through tunnels, battle Zerg by taking out shield generators, and escape by flying. This was definitely one of the more fun ones, which should appeal to young boys.- Space Mountain: Here you get in your space ship and fly through space graphics inspired by the ride. To steer, you basically hold your hands out like they're holding a steering wheel, and navigate up, down, left, and right. From time to time you'll have to shoot things with a blaster.- Finding Nemo: There are three parts to this game: Coral Reef, Bruce and the Sunken Ships, and East Australian current. The first game is a game of \"hide and seek\" where you need to hide behind certain objects so Nemo can't find you (easier than it sounds as there's a current you need to swim against and objects bumping into you). In the second and third games you're swimming and collecting coins (which feels pretty much the same as the flying games)FANTASYLAND:- Peter Pan's Flight: Again, this is a flying game where you're leaning left and right to steer and collect coins. What makes this one special is the stunningly beautiful graphics that come right out of the movie. In later levels of this game, you're battling the Jolly Roger (basically dodging and swinging at debris and cannonballs being fired at you), flying through Neverland, and having a sword fight with Captain Hook..- Matterhorn: Here, you start out on a bobsled following Goofy down the Matterhorn. It's definitely cool, but on the other hand, it feels a lot like the other flying games (lean left and right to steer, avoid obstacles, and pick up coins). The second part of the game is a snowball fight, very much like the banana fight in Jungle Cruise. The third part of the game is skiing, again, a lot like the flying games.- Pixie Hollow: This is one of those rare games that don't involve flying. In it, the fairies of \"Tinkerbell The Movie\" sit around and tell stories, and you need to strike the correct pose to get them to continue. This is definitely one for younger girls.- Princess Faire: Think \"Just Dance\", but with Belle, Ariel, Tiana, Cinderella, or Aurora acting as your trainer as they dance to their signature Disney song. It's not as sophisticated as Just Dance (if you strike the right pose at the right time, you basically get the points), but I think a lot of young girls will get a thrill out of this one.- It's a Small World: The graphics and music in this one are very reminiscent of the ride, if not the content. In it, you crank a boat to \"sail through the world\", stopping at various lands such as Africa, the South Pacific, and the American Old West. Each time you stop, you'll need to mimic the moves of a dancer to get points and coins.- Alice in Wonderland: Another game which has fantastic graphics that are reminiscent of the Disney movie, but with gameplay much the same as above (for example, as you're falling through the rabbit hole you need to lean to your left and right to avoid obstacles and collect coins)..First, the good. I found the graphics and animation to be amazingly detailed and accurate. For example, when playing Winnie the Pooh, the graphics, with all the scenes, the characters, and even your avatar drawn in the familiar style of the movies. Similarly, in the Finding Nemo games, the graphics take on a computer-generated Pixar feel. In the Peter Pan game, the graphics of flying through London are stunning just like in the movie. And so on. The designers and illustrators of all the mini-games definitely kept true to the originals, and Disney fanatics will be thrilled to spot a lot of little details.The same can be said for the voice talent and music. Everything from the narrator of the Haunted Mansion to the voice of Buzz Lightyear to the sound effects of Space Mountain to the music in Splash Mountain are completely accurate to what you find in the park and in the movies and cartoons that inspired them. There were some cases where hearing a particular ride's music brought back memories for me from years ago at Disney World.I was also pleasantly surprised at how physical many of the games are. In some of them I definitely had an elevated heart rate and felt I got a little exercise out of them.The one gripe I do have about the game concerns the gameplay itself. As you might be able to tell from my descriptions above, there are a staggering number of games but a lot of them feel very redundant and repetitive. Despite the dizzying number of different milieus, there seem to only a small handful of games at the core: namely flying games (where you lean to the left and right to avoid obstacles), rail shooters, snowball fights, and follow-the-leader games.After the fifth or sixth flying game, you can't help but think to yourself, \"this again?\" I think out of the 50 or so games, there were only a handful that I really felt \"this is really something new and original\" with regards to the gameplay. I would have loved to see as much creativity and originality in designing the games as there was in designing the game audio and visuals. Although one last thing that should also be noted is that the games do support two players, which of course adds a whole new dimension--what may otherwise be an exercise in tedium as one player can become a thrilling competitive battle for two.Overall, this is a very fun title which should definitely appeal to fans of the Disney theme parks and the cartoons (which is basically 99% of us). I'd say that young players will definitely appreciate the game more; ironically, the very repetition that may make the game a little tiring for adults may be welcome for kids, as they can master the moves easily and play essentially the same games in different environments.Kids will also love exploring the virtual park and interacting with all the characters, and certain parents will love that this game can keep their kids busy for a long, long time. If your child loves collection those blinging coins in Lego games, they'll appreciate collection coins throughout this world--and spending them. It's still not a substitute for actually going to the parks, but it's the next best thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000VBFW7E","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Even after all these years Gears of War is still one of the best shooters ever","reviewText":"The Good: Perfectly paced campaign, chainsaw bayonet!, memorable story with just as memorable characters, tight controls, epic boss fights, 5 new chapters are awesome, new graphics features add a nice touch, co-op is a blast, multiplayer is challengingThe Bad: Graphics look dated, some sloppy animations, need more vehicle segmentsI still remember Gears of War when I got my Xbox 360 on Christmas of 2006. It changed the way I though about games forever, and is why it is the only game I ever gave a 10. The game was perfect at the time and I couldn't really find anything wrong with it. I also remember the game being almost a complete failure early in development and seeing glimpses of shoddy game play footage on TV during E3 2004. The classic hit comes to PC with some enhancements that are great for new comers and enough for fans to come back for another run (or 3).I'll review this all over again for people who are unfamiliar (PC only gamers). You play as Marcus Fenix in Delta Squad who are sent on a mission to deliver a light mass bomb deep under the planet Sera to destroy the Locust horde that is trying to kill all of humanity. This sounds like a typical sci-fi  B grade, but this is one of my favorite gaming stories of all time because of the characters, sheer terror, and hopelessness humans go through to rid of this vicious species. Gears of War may seem like a manly shooter on the outside, but inside there is a deep and complex story (just pick up the four books and you will truly see) that tests and strains every human to fight for survival.Despite the excellent story and memorable characters there is a great underlying gameplay system here. Slamming against cover, shooting awesome weapons, and killing interesting enemies that were never seen before is quite awesome. Locust aren't just bugs or aliens, but they feel like entities that you should run away from and have nightmares about. It takes half a clip to take these guys down and they shoot back with good AI (excellent at the time, good for today's standards). During the time the AI was unrivaled because the Locust would flank you and act smart instead of just standing there getting shot at.The weapons are memorable such as the infamous Lancer with the chainsaw bayonet. Slicing through an enemy and watching blood splatter on the screen is just awesome and never gets old (even if you played the last two Gears). The Longshot is a powerful bolt-action sniper rifle, the Hammerburst is the Locust assault rifle, the Boomshot, Snub pistol, Boltok revolver, and Gnasher shotgun are some of the greatest weapons ever made and they are infamous for a reason. The enemies vary greatly and some can't even be taken down with guns. The Hammer of Dawn is used to take down the Berserkers who run at you and must be dodged during three different scenes in the game. The Corpsers are huge spider-like enemies that can only be taken down in the same manner and jam communications. The list goes on, but each enemy has to be taken on in completely different ways and most shooters can't do that.The campaign is well paced with lots of different scenarios such as avoiding the deadly Kryll at night while shooting tanks to stay in the light. There are turret sections, but sadly no helicopter sections which this game is dying for. There are epic boss fights, but overall the campaign is perfectly paced with varied environments from outdoors to indoors. All of this combined equals one sweet package that 90% of shooters can't accomplish in one game.The multiplayer is fun if this is your thing. Gears of War multiplayer is a lot different from most because it's tactical and close quarters. 6-on-6 is tough and you will die quickly against vets because the game requires a lot of rolling, dodging, and quick trigger fingers, but the modes are fun like Execution and Wingman. Sadly, not many people play Gears 1 online anymore so you will rarely find people playing. There is even a co-op mode for the campaign which is a blast, but good luck getting anyone to play online.For the PC we get updated visuals with DirectX 10 lighting, some higher resolution textures, and the best part, 5 all new chapters that were cut from the Xbox 360 version. If you did play that version remember after leaving the Fenix mansion a Brumak comes after you and you jump into an APC and escape? Stuff happened after that and between arriving at the train station. Delta Squad gets stuck at a lifted bridge and need to find a way to power it so they can head to the train platform. This is also where you take on that Brumak that followed you and is probably the best 5 chapters in the whole game. I'm sad Xbox 360 owners had to miss out on this epic piece of Gears, but PC gamers will be pleased. There are also three additional COG tags so watch out if you want those achievements!Gears of War is worth a re-purchase for vets or for new comers because this is a piece of video game history that can't be missed by any shooter fan. Why do I not give this a 10 then? The game has shown its age like the dated graphics. Sure they still look great, but the lower resolution textures, weaker lighting effects, and slightly sloppy animations show compared to the new Gears games. Most people will overlook this, but the game also does feel repetitive after a while no matter how you slice it. You're just running around shooting Grubs right? I feel it needed some more vehicle sections, and well...it was all fixed in Gears 2 and 3, but that's besides the point.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Nothing new here. I am not going into the minutiae like some people do. Here is the whole picture synopsis.This game offers something different in the way of weapons and the movements of your character. You do and don't get the typical machine gun. Yes, it is a machine gun but it feels and sounds solid and futuristic when playing this game.  Your movements are interesting. You can cling to, duck behind and walk along walls for cover like you have always wanted to. Peek out, shoot around the corner then duck back behind it.Sadly, that is the whole scheme of the game...peek, shoot and duck. Wash, rinse, repeat. Thankfully, the enemy will try to flank you, run right up to you and throw grenades at you. That definitely keeps it exciting.Tell you more about the grenades? OK. They are cool looking, they are powerful and the throwing system is unique. And it is also very disappointing! You hold your Mouse 2 button to create a \"throw path\" for the grenade to follow. When ready, you click the Mouse 1 button to throw it and BOOM! This works great when you are on level ground. In many cases, the camera angles for the throwing system completely prevent you from seeing where you are throwing the grenade. Effectively neutralizing your aim. Also, you can only carry 4!!! Yes, a measly 4 grenades.Which brings us to ammo. There are no health power ups or armor power ups to go hunting for. You automatically regenerate these when you are not being shot. AWESOME! Ammo is abundant and you can pick up your dead enemies weapons, allowing you to switch weapons and stock ammo to your hearts content. Again - AWESOME!The biggest SUCK factors of this game are as follows -Video is excellent but the colors are only gray, black and white.Game play is fast and fun but it gets repetitive.No save system. Checkpoints....YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!The game is entirely scripted so you know when the enemy is coming every time.When you die, you are forced to go through some of the same cut scenes over and over!!! Some can be skipped, others cannot!!!!!It feels like they ported it from the XBOX 360 instead of making a solid version developed specifically for the PC.Overall, it was OK. Not bad, not great. I played a friend's copy so luckily I did not have to actually pay for it. I definitely don't think it is worth $45. Maybe $30. No way would I pay more.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYAQ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Game Breaking Glitch Ruined My Experience","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game, the platforming is great and the game art is even better. There is a nice level of difficulty, where it generally isn't too hard to get to the finish line, but it can be very difficult when you go after the large coins. However, my experience was ruined by a game breaking glitch, or at least a combination of bad luck, poor level planning, and the lack of a very basic feature. The basic feature that I'm talking about, one that is found in most current games, is the ability to restart from the last checkpoint. Instead you are only allowed to restart the level or quit, and because of this multiple times I was forced to search for something allowing me to commit suicide when I screwed up and wanted to back to the check point. I could have lived with this and still enjoyed the game, until I came upon the very end of one of the ice levels. It was the ice level that introduced breakable ice cubes, and it was the very end where you have to kill 3 big fire breathing monsters that have a platform on their heads. The goal here (I think) is to break certain ice cubes and crush the monsters (or maybe just get behind them and punch them), I was trying to do this when I somehow managed to get trapped between the monster's platform and the ice cube above it. I was completely trapped, bouncing endlessly, there was nothing I could do but go to the beginning of the entire level. It was just such a let down, the level was the hardest yet, and I had spent a lot of time going after most of the large coins and the other things (whatever they were, the little circle faces) that I just didn't want to keep playing. So instead I just traded the game in. I would only take 1 star away for the unlikely occurrence (I doubt I could replicate it), but I also found the game a little repetitive, hence the 3 star rating.This is by no means a bad game, especially at the price it is now, and I'm sure others could have a completely different experience than mine. So even though I gave the game 3 stars, I would recommend it to others.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}

I wish I saw more new stuff!My only complain is about the AC difficulty level. There is no way to change the difficulty and playing the game is not challenging.Getting 100% sync. is challenging in some missions, but overall the game is easy to beat.I wish I could change the difficulty.Looking forward to next AC game.Thank you Amazon: I preordered the game and Amazon gave me a 10$ promotional code!

{"product_name":"B005185SDA","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"My favorite multiplayer experience on the PS3 thus far","reviewText":"Starhawk offers a much needed breath of fresh air for competitive multiplayer gaming on consoles.  The idea here is somewhat basic, yet completely unique to this genre....a mix of third person shooter (including vehicles), team-based combat, with elements of RTS (real time strategy).  Teams of up to 16 face off against another team of 16 in various game modes such as the traditional deathmatch, capture the flag, and zone defending.  Like most multiplayer games, XP is given after matches, which will unlock various customizations for your character and vehicles, as well as skill points which you can assign as a sort of attribute to take into battle.  The hook with Starhawk is that players are allowed to build an army of structures that aid them in completing their objective.  The \"currency\" used to build these structures is known as Rift Energy, which is collected near the team's main base.  Whether these structures be walls for defense, supply bunkers, shield generators, garages that house tanks, or any of the other many structures, this innovative mechanic creates a near infinite amount of strategic possibilities for battle that not only demand creativity and smarts from the player, but also strong cooperation from the team as a whole.With such large battles taking place in such large battlefields and so many possibilities for strategy, it is really remarkable how well everything in Starhawk comes together.  The vehicles, from the Sidewinder (think of the speeders from Star Wars), to the armored jeeps, to the tanks, to the awesome flying jet-like hawks that turn into battle mechs, all control in an intuitive way that is very easy to pick up and learn quickly.  A wide variety of weaponry, available to the player both on foot and on the vehicles, will give the player lots of toys to play with and master.  But what really makes Starhawk shine is when everyone within a well-functioning team takes a defined role, and uses strategy to overpower their opponents.  Do you like to assault and destroy your foe?  Build a hawk station, take to the skies, and dogfight enemy hawks and drop cluster bombs on enemy soldiers.  If you'd rather fight from afar, fortify a high point above your enemy's base and shoot artillery from your tank, or grab a sniper rifle and head to the hills guerilla-style.  Like stealth?  Zoom in under the radar on a Sidewinder as your teammates distract your opposition with the big guns, and pick off the unsuspecting.  Like to stay behind and defend?  Fortify your base with turrets, repair centers, supply depots, watchtowers, and shield generators, and hold down your base from whatever breaks through your defenses.  These are just a fraction of the roles you can play as part of a good team.  But \"team\" is the key word here.  Like the Battlefield series, only teams that work well together and communicate will be successful.  The lone wolf will not only have difficulty surviving, but won't get to experience all the richness and depth that Starhawk multiplayer has to offer.Starhawk offers a great multiplayer experience, and should be purchased for this reason alone, as it is obvious that the single player campaign was not really the developers' priority.  The 5-6 hour long campaign is fairly enjoyable, but largely forgettable.  What it does very well is teach the players the basic mechanics of the game to prepare them for the multiplayer.  The player will complete the single player campaign knowing how to operate all the vehicles, what the functions of each structure are, and have a good sense of how everything comes together.  It does well in this regard, but it is not nearly enough to justify a purchase for the single player campaign alone.If you are like I was, and think that console multiplayer gaming has been growing somewhat stale with the saturation of similar first person shooters and Call of Duty clones, then this game is exactly what you've been looking for.  It's a unique, deep multiplayer experience that is very easy to pick up and play, but difficult to master.  But once you get over the learning curve one, and you land on one of the many amazing battlefields and get your first victory with a team that you worked well with, you will be hooked.  The payoff of victory is sweet.  Don't miss out on what may be the best multiplayer experience on the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

Twlight Princess is, in a word, awesome.From the immersive storyline to the intuitive control scheme, this game has it all. It really is a joy to gut it out through one of the enormous dungeons, figuring out each of the challenging puzzles, and be presented with another great cut scene.The control scheme is better than I'd have thought. While I was dissapointed that, for the first time in 20 years, Link was made right-handed, after using the new motion sensitive controls it really had to be done. I'm left-handed and they don't feel at all awkward.Like previous reviewers, I've logged well over 20 hours on Twilight Princess and still have a long long LONG way to go.For the record: this game is listed as being 50 hours long. That's assuming an average person finds where they need to go with somewhat relative ease. I have this sinking feeling I'll be putting in more time than that.When it comes down to it, if you own a Wii you should own this game.

Set between the events ofSuper MetroidandMetroid Fusion, the game features unprecedented access to the backstory, thoughts and in-game interactions of the usually closed off heroine of the series, Samus Aran. Developed jointly by Nintendo and the celebrated Japanese development studio, Team Ninja, the game also features exciting play options, including the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, pointer and sideways Wii Remote controller orientation, stunning in-game cinematics and a classic blend of Metroid action and puzzle-solving gameplay..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Theresa Winfrey","summary":"Overhated","reviewText":"In case you might have misread the title of this review, it is overHated; not overRated. Yes, Metroid: Other M is overhated. It is also misunderstood.Is this game sexist? No. In fact, it is the opposite. Samus is the only female warrior in the game. However, that makes her ascension to the top of the ranks all that more impressive. Her commanding officer, Adam Malkovich, decides when she can activate her suit's latent abilities. People have a huge problem with this, and can't get over it. Think of it this way. Although Samus Aran is an independent bounty hunter, for this mission on the Bottle Ship, she allows herself to obey Adam Malkovich as if she was one of his soldiers. Also, the game gives an example of why certain abilities should not be used indiscriminately. Early on, Adam prohibits the use of the Power Bomb because it might have dire implications for the structural stability of the ship. Use that example and apply it to all Samus's other abilities. Also, the way that your abilities are unlocked are kind of epic. For example, you will be struggling against a boss, and then BAM, Adam authorizes a new ability and you mop the floor with it. Also, remind yourself that if this operation is to go as smoothly as possible, she will have to obey his orders to an extent, just like all his other soldiers. You are not alone. Also, from a gameplay standpoint, this is always how Metroid games have functioned: start off as a weakling, and slowly gain new powers, and by the end of the game, you're a bad-ass. This power-acquisition protocol actually makes much more logical sense than finding powers inside monsters or in hidden, out-of-the-way locations. Also, at the end of the game, you learn more about Samus's mental and emotional reasons for following Adam's orders.This game and Samus Aran are both highly misunderstood. In the Western world, strength is colloquially assigned masculine attributes: rudeness, boldness, loudness, physical heftiness, etc. Samus Aran possesses a quiet, inner strength that the less perceptive people will not be able to catch. If you look at Mass Effect and choose to create a female Shepard, she behaves in the exact same way that the male Shepard does. So what does that say about sexism? Bioware is implying that a \"strong\" female protagonist must behave like a male protagonist to be strong. Now that is sexist. Mass Effect is more sexist than Metroid: Other M. By showing a different way to be strong: inner strength, bravery, non-flashiness, a lot of people mistook that for weakness. It flew right over their heads. No. Samus Aran is a strong individual in Metroid: Other M. She doesn't need to act like a jackass (like Jack from Mass Effect 2) to be strong. We need to shed the stereotypes of strength and look beyond the exterior and feel the interior: the heart, the soul. You can even hear Samus talking to herself during the game. How can you not see that she is a strong character?The game itself is very good; it feels like a Metroid game. I thought that auto-aim might make the game too easy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case. In fact, this is the second-most difficult Metroid game in the series, next to the first Metroid, which honestly is not saying much because Metroid games have traditionally been concerned less with difficulty and more with level design and exploration. This difficulty comes in three parts: boss battles, Search View, and basic adventuring.Some of the boss battles in this game are fantastic. They will make you think, and have you dying over and over again while you figure out the right strategy for beating them. Oddly enough, I found this to be fun. When something is difficult but in the realm of perceptibly surmountable, it is good.There are parts of the game that put you into a mandatory first-person view mode, called Search View. You can also activate this mode manually. But in the mandatory Search Views, you must search the environs and lock onto the correct thing in order to proceed through the game. It is ridiculous how hard it is to figure out some of the tiny, obscure things you have to look at to advance the game. This is the only bad thing about the game, and why it didn't get five stars from me.What I meant by \"basic adventuring\" was basically \"figuring out what to do next\" - a staple of action/adventure games. On first glance, I did not think this game would be very difficult to figure out what to do next, and be as creative and extensive as the Prime games, but it is. This game is very dark (as in brightness), so early on, I was baffled at times, looking at the dark environments trying to figure out what to lock onto and do next. Later on, I would get stuck, only to find I had to go into first-person mode at a weird location, but I did not think all this ambiguity detracted from the game. The only part that I did think detracted from the game was when I had to backtrack to get an item to advance, when it was not obvious I had to. This only happened once, so it is more or less forgiven. Overall, I was impressed with how \"organic\" the \"puzzles\" felt. I figured out that there was a morph-ball hole from Zoomers crawling out of the wall. Metroid Prime 2 had all these weird morph-ball puzzles (that were cool, don't get me wrong), but seemed out-of-place. Metroid: Other M keeps everything believable.Another thing that helps keep everything believable is the awesome soundtrack. Metroid: Other M is as moody and creepy as ever. Other than the menu theme, I didn't like Metroid Prime's music. Some of the tracks were too whimsical for a Metroid game. Metroid: Other M doesn't suffer from this whimsy at all. Subtle and effective would be two words to describe its tracks. Also, there are some remixed songs that play at just the right moment that pump you up. It's awesome.The controls are great. Although you auto-aim, you must be facing the enemy within 90 degrees on either side of it or you won't target it. This basically means that you can't be facing away from an enemy, press the \"1\" button, and expect to hit it. This is great because it balances the ease afforded by the auto-aiming.In Metroid Prime, you could lock onto a target, hold either left or right, and tap B to dodge. In Other M, you can dodge attacks by tapping the d-pad (this move is called SenseMove). It works well, and its animation is very stylish. This has been balanced by making enemies attack more frequently at times. Thus, for instance, you will be mashing that d-pad during a fierce attack barrage, and when the barrage concludes, you will be able to attack.Search View has been unfairly criticized. Sure, you can not move, but you can shoot incoming projectiles, preventing them from hitting you, and also SenseMove out of it. It is not too cumbersome to go from NES-style Wiimote mode to Search View. If you need to shoot a missile, there is always an adequate window of time in which you can do so, where the boss or enemy is not attacking you.The graphics are fantastic for a Wii game. Sometimes, when a pre-rendered cutscene ended and gameplay started, I could not tell the difference. Also, the game is very stylish, like Metroid: Zero Mission was. You will be proud to guide the sleek and sexy Samus Aran to victory.The story, if you can understand that it is not sexist, as explained above, is very good. The story sequences, told with both pre-rendered movies and in-game graphics, work very well in that they explain the past, the current situation and motivate you to keep playing the game and find out more.This game is very similar to Metroid Fusion in that respect. Some of the save-points here operate like the Navigation Rooms of that game, and both tell and show you where you need to go next. This is fine because it points you in a general direction, but not the necessary steps to get there. Even with this help-system, I got stuck numerous times; don't worry, it won't baby you or annoy you.Overall, this feels like a Metroid game. This game could have been called Metroid Fusion because it fuses the 2D games with the 3D games and makes an excellent hybrid. If I could improve this game, I would make the mandatory SenseViews more intuitive, have an analog stick controlling Samus (Wiimote + nunchuk), and make it so that I am able to move in Search View. Metroid: Other M is a more than worthy addition to the Metroid franchise and is a great game - worthy to be played.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2012"}
