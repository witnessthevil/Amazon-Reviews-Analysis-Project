This game isn't worth $20 period. Once the novelty of the Afgan location and fighting the Taliban/Al Queda wears off (after about the first 10 minutes), you're left with a military shooter that consists of:1) Kick in door.2) Shoot dumbass enemies who take turns popping their heads up so you're sure to get the all-important head shot.3) Move to open field area.4) Shoot dumbass enemies who take turns running around in circles out in the open.5) Move to next building.6) Go back to step #1, rinse & repeat.All the while you're listening to a non-stop (literally non-stop) radio chatter dialogue that seems to include everyone in the military except YOUR character. To be fair, there are some \"challenges\" along the way that do serve to break up the monotony, somewhat.

I'm an adult as you might guess, and I find the headset to be tight on my head, but if it is purchased for a child, this will not be an issue. But, it's just not worth the premium when you consider that you can get the way, way superior XO7s (sans Titanfall branding) for the same price. I would highly recommend getting the awesome Titanfall Xbox One ControllerXbox One Wireless Controller - Titanfall Limited Editionand theTurtle Beach Ear Force XO Seven Premium Xbox One Gaming Headsetinstead.Now, if you are set on getting these headphones, I think they are pretty good, but there's a few issues to note. Turtle Beach has tried several different methods of powering their headphones and transmitting audio and they've finally settled on a cable leading from the controller. Previous headsets had built in batteries and required charging. No longer. Turtle Beach has also apparently given up on the bluetooth transmitter set up that never worked quite right. The downside is that you are tethered to the controller. For the most part its no big deal, but the cord does get tangled up from time to time. More concerning is the fact that your controller batteries drain twice as fast. When they die, the resulting strain causes the controller to suddenly stop working, which is extremely annoying. You're going to want one of theseEnergizer CHP4WB4 Recharge Smart AA/AAA Charger with 4 AA NiMH Batteriesso that you don't spend a fortune on batteries.Sound quality is very good. The microphone is stiff and not bendable as appears in the photo. As noted above, I found them to be tight and uncomfortably hot.

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"One of the best RPGs on the 360","reviewText":"I didn't even know about this game when I bought a 360. My friend let me borrow a few games to see what I liked. This game was one of them. I had to buy it.Story: you take control of an immortal named Kaim, that has no memory. The world is in a magic-industrial revolution. As you progress through the game, you start to regain your memory and the pain it brings. You meet other immortals and humans on your way that join your party. You realize the immortal sorcerer, Gongora, is attempting to destroy the portal to the immortals' world, making him seemingly invincible if he succeeds. Your party tries to stop him.Gameplay: Turn-base RPG, open world exploration. The game spans 4 discs! The path is linear to start with, but later on you can return to any area that is still available. The game plays out on a planet and work your way from city to city with the traditional inns, item shops, weapons shops, etc that you can use to upgrade your equipment and defense. You obtain water vehicles throughout the game that help you progress to new areas. There are numerous side missions throughout the game that help your characters with more experience, items, weapons, powerups, spells, etc. Each character has an ultimate weapon that can be found throughout the game. You will want to find these.Fighting: Turn-base. Up to 5 people can fight in your group. You have a front row and back row and the back row gets a wall barrier based on the front row's HP. Each character in your party and the enemies you face have a turn in combat that is based on their speed of attack. Higher spells can take multiple rounds to cast. Items are used immediately in combat. When attacking, if you have a ring equipped, you will be given two concentric targeting rings. You must time your button release at the perfect moment the rings line up. The effect of the ring can be perfect or good, depending on your accuracy. The effects are added to your attack. You can switch rings during combat. Each ring affects different things but it has a basic combat system based on the type of enemy. They can be water, fire, wind, or earth based. Earth beats water, water beats fire, fire beats wind, wind beats earth. As for leveling up, the mortal characters level up based on experience while the immortals learn skills from mortals by linking that ability and earning experience. Once learned, they can link another skill until it is complete. You can link affects of accessories as well.Magic: there are 4 classes of magic. White, Black, Spirit, and Composite. Magic is an important part of combat. Some characters are better at magic than others. White magic is for healing/protection, Black magic is for element attacks and negative status effects, Spirit magic is for stat changes, healing ailments, and non-elemental attacks, while Composite magic combines 2 spells. Once you obtain composite magic, the spells will appear as you learn new magic in white, black, or spirit magic. There are rings that help reduce casting times and protect the caster as well.Conclusion: the controls are easy. The game is long but never boring. Rings are a big part of combat and can be the difference between winning and losing a battle. There are multiple side areas to explore, including a temple that has the toughest enemies and is very tough to navigate. Lots of hidden areas and hidden items in the game. If you love the Final Fantasy style fighting from the original games and town explorations, then you will love this game. Tons of cut scenes and the characters are awesome. Get this game if you own a 360. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Jump Into Hell, Feet First!: A Decent Shooter from a Legendary Franchise","reviewText":"The Halo franchise is something of a legend for us gamers as it broke in the new generation of shooters with each passing installment.  The franchise introduced the first real regenerative shield/health feature with incredible reloading animations (Halo 1), immense maps and an intriguing story (Halo 2), and an insane multiplayer that never gets old (Halo 3).  The franchise then seemed to dip a bit with the only non-first person shooter (FPS) installment of Halo Wars; a decent game but lacked a general appeal to both the mainstream audience and Halo fans alike.Then, for more than a year, Halo fans were teased relentlessly with a trailer for a Halo: Recon game that was supposed to take the perspective of a recon trooper.  Later, Bungie and Microsoft renamed the game \"ODST\" and hyped up the game immensely.  Like many Halo and FPS fans, Halo: ODST (\"ODST\") probably mystified you with the absolutely incredible live-action trailer that more resembled a feature film trailer than one for a video game.  The hype was insane so the makers had a big pair of shoes to fill.  Sadly, while ODST shows some promise as an FPS it falls short to take its place among its predecessors as a Halo game.Let us begin...Halo ODST, or \"Helljumpers\" as they call themselves, are an elite group of space paratroopers that get dropped in from low-orbit to trample their enemies.  As \"Rookie\" you are explore the ruins of the mega-city New Mombasa 'investigating' the whereabouts of your fellow team mates by finding random objects and then learning everything that happened by looking at them.  After examining said object the player flashbacks to the event leading up to the creation of the piece of garbage and you then follow the short-mission campaign.  That is the ODST campaign mode in a nutshell as I beat the game in less than six hours.To make up for a VERY short campaign mode, ODST includes a firefight mode similar to Left-4-Dead's survival mode, where you fend off wave after wave of Covenant forces until wiped out.  My friends and I, disappointed with the campaign mode, played this for about ten minutes before deciding to try out the second disc that came with the game.The second disc comes with a prototype or beta version of the next Halo game; Reach.  We were hoping for a co-op campaign mode but, instead, were treated to a multiplayer-only version of the game... joy.So, on to the pros and cons.Despite my lacking enthusiasm for coughing up the full amount of coin for an XBox360 game that hardly held up its value, I do have some praise.My first bit of praise pertains to the controls.  I was impressed at how exceptionally well balanced the controls were.  Once I quickly memorized the controls I was able to skillfully traverse across the very hazardous maps with little to no trouble on the Heroic difficulty (Hard mode).  The aiming reticule was super-smooth to move around making aiming that much easier.  Kudos to Bungie for making THAT a whole lot easier.My next bit of praise goes to the heads-up display (HUD).  The ODST visor has two modes.  The first is a basic mode where you see as if your helmet is off.  The second is when the visor is down and all points of interest, enemy outlines, and obstacles are outlined and shown while the brightness goes into a sort of night-vision.  Naturally, this mode cannot be used in direct daylight.  It is really cool to see this special mode and I can tell Bungie put a LOT of emphasis on the visor mode.  It's fun to watch and makes finding your objective and enemies considerably easier.One of the elements I was weary about, but ended up liking, was the music.  Prior to the release of ODST I was informed that the music would be jazz influenced.  Scared to death that it would sound like the last Soviet level in Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3 (it was atrocious, trust me), I began to shake my head.  Fortunately, there are no saxophones that I could hear.  In fact, the music seemed to deliver a more personal, if not more human, perspective on things.  The battle music was pretty impressive as well, but I do miss the vocals that made Halo, Halo.I can definitely tell Bungie went to a few extremes to balance out the game play, controls, and interface but this is where most of my praise ends as the hype made the expectations far too high.  This is where I get out my trusty red pen and go to town.The story had promise, but became incredible lackluster.  There was a very short prologue, a very short intro, and a very short ending.  In between you have a few decent cut scenes with some great interjected humor (\"Get this thing off of me!\"), but otherwise I was not, at all, moved by the story.  There was VERY little, if any, character development making the participants nothing more than sound bytes.My next criticism is the lacking focus.  Unlike any other FPS, you start missions by finding the loose pieces of garbage in a very big map.  After the first mission, you can explore fully and recover more pieces in virtually any order you choose.  Bungie lauds this as an open-ended campaign of sorts but, to me, it jumbles the story and throws out any sort of focus whatsoever.  It makes an already lackluster story even more confusing.  On top of that, the tutorial explaining the New Mombasa 'lobby' is very confusing and the player will feel the \"what the hell am I supposed to do\" mentality several times before getting what to do.  The missions themselves have considerably more focus but the Rookie lobby does not and it almost ruins the game.This leads to my next problem, game length.  Do Bungie and Microsoft realize that some of us gamers buy games to play offline as well?  I bought this game, which was advertised on the back of the box to have 2-4 player co-op, at the midnight release to play with my two buds and my little brother in 4-player co-op and NOT online.  Once we realized that you need system-link to play 3-4 player co-op (I bought the 73-inch Samsung for a reason!!) we then took turns playing the missions and beat the game in under six hours.  Once I finished, my very sarcastic little brother turned to me, pat me on the shoulder and said, \"Well, there goes (insert full XBox360 game price here) bucks!\"WTF mate?!I can tell that Bungie and Microsoft intended OSDT to be mostly another only multiplayer game instead of a really good offline shooter.  This is really irritating as most of us gamers play casually since we have full-time jobs, families, or both and do not wish to be cursed at by 14-year-old German gamers with too much time on their hands.  The original Halo was an excellent balance, why can't ODST be the same?To the defense of the makers, I will replay some of the missions but mainly so I can get my moneys worth out of ODST.  The game was still excellent in many regards, however, the campaign mode should have been a WHOLE LOT longer with a more enticing story with character development.  It was too much hype for too little substance.All in all, a B- game.  A worthy rental, but not worth the whole price unless you play online.Peace out!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2009"}

Watch Dogs was designed to push Next Gen Hardware to its limits, we basically got a watered down version.First things first, the game comes with 2 discs and you need space in your hard drive to download the first disc (it may take you a few hours before you can play) So in some ways this game pushes the 360 to its limits! I have not noticed any load screens when traveling through the huge world. (except when you first start, and when you die)Pros.1. I lived in Chicago for 10 years and the game gave me moments of deja vu. I am not certain they got everything but they certainly got enough!2. You actually get used to the graphics and after a while you start appreciating all the effort that went into the game.3. The controls are tight, and the fighting is pretty good too. (Its mostly shooting, I like guns. But unfortunately you don't shoot anything until after you have played several hours)4. The story is a bit weak to me, but I have only played 7 hrs. I put it as a pro because I have noticed a few conspiracies brewing.5. gameplay wise I think they got everything in this game from what I can tell.6. Hacking experience is not as fun as they have you believe, but its a cool experience when you start hacking a person, then a camera, then hacking stuff from your car without thinking about it.7. Sneaking around is fun8. From what I hear the story takes almost 40 hrs to finish but you could spend a 100 if you did all the side quests! ( I have put in 7 hrs and I am at 9 %)Cons.1. The driving! Its a bit arcadie but I honestly didn't mind. I drive all the time so I am not looking for some more in video games. You get used to the controls and everything is fine. It would have been great if you could play music from your hard drive in the radio though!2. there really aren't any big cons. It would have been nice had they used real cars, etc. But most of the cons are nit picking.I would give the game a 9 out of 10 so far.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Sending the PS2 off with a vengeance","reviewText":"It's no secret that the PS2 is on it's way out, and that final death rattle isn't so far away these days.  So in that case, it's safe to say that the long awaited God of War II is the last, best original game to hit Sony's 128-bit juggernaut.  Picking up right where the first game left off, Kratos was successful in killing Ares, and now resides as the God of War in on Mount Olympus.  However, Zeus has grown displeased with Kratos, and the Spartan warrior soon finds himself cast into Hades.  After striking a deal with Gaia of the Titans, Kratos is once again on a very long, and very violent, journey of revenge.  The first thing you may notice when you pop in God of War II is that the game's graphics are astounding for a PS2 game.  The first game pushed the limits of what the PS2 could pump out, and God of War II exceeds it.  Besides that, the game ups the ante on just about everything that made the first game so great.  The level design is superbly done, and the boss battles are more plentiful this time around, and all the more epic as well.  Not to mention that the game's music score is even better than the fantastic one found in the first game.  And oh yeah, the incredibly brutal fighting and blood-letting is here as well, and there's buckets more to be found.  The kills are gorier than one could ever expect, and the game more than earns it's Mature rating.  The puzzle elements are more difficult this time around as well, wonderfully rounding out this package.  If there's any downside to God of War II, it's that the fighting system itself hasn't changed much.  There are still times when button mashing rules, but Kratos gets a few new weapons and magics this time around too.  Besides that, everything else about God of War II is superb: from it's narrative to it's voice acting, to it's overall epic feel; God of War II is one of the best titles available for the PS2, period.  This is one of those rare cases when the sequel outshines and outdoes it's genre-bending predecessor, and maybe the third installment will make the PS3 worth owning.  All in all, God of War II is a masterpiece of modern gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2007"}

You get to choose for of your favorite characters to play with at one time.  You can also push the directional buttons to switch between characters.  For instance, if you're playing with Cyclops and you need to fly somewhere, just hit your directional button to the person who has flight and off you go.  Fly back and you can instantly change back to Cyclops or one of the other two characters.When you level up, you get points to distribute amoung your attributes and your skills.  The game is rather stingy with the points so spend them wisely.  Also, spend money wisely because there isn't a whole lot.Most of the characters are awesome, a couple are worthless, like Jubilee and Psylocke, but they don't take away from how awesome this game is.  The graphics in the game are rather bland and tend to run together.  The voice work for the most part is good, can get cheesy at some points in the game.

I would recommend any hardcore gamer get this title, it's beautiful, plays tight, and has alot of hours of play to offer.

For example :  one site said I had to go to some random spot on the game and toot the pan flute because there was something buried there......which I NEVER would have known because I don't stop every few steps on each level to blow that flute.  I am tired of traveling around in the train....it IS monotonous.  Just as someone else said.....I ALSO have only half finished this game and I haven't touched it in a couple of months.  The biggest reason that I haven't sold this game already is because you CAN do some multiplayer mini-games with other DS owners who don't have a game card.

That said, I love the series.  I loved the 2D gameplay mechanics the games have, especially from Super Metroid.  If any game failed in my eyes, you wouldn't hear the end of it from me.Well... all I can say about Metroid Prime is... I'm shocked!  I still don't understand how, but it's like Metroid Prime captured the essence of a 2D Metroid game and put it into 3D.Anyway, lets go through this piece by piece.  First, the visuals.  All I can say is \"wow!\"  Metroid games have always been very atmospheric (or at least Super Metroid was), but I never thought they'd be able to duplicate that sense of atmosphere into a 3D Metroid.  Everything here is done well, from the sheer beauty of some of the environments, to the awesome visor effects (refering to visor modes AND visual effects, like water dripping off of it after coming out of water), to the sense of nostalgia breathed into full 3D that I'm still amazed was executed so well.  Even better is that this game runs super smoothly, and loading delays are far and few between.  Those loading delays only happen when you travel to a different sector, of which there are only about 6 or 7.  It should be noted there is quite a bit of backtracking, so you'll be dealing with that more than it sounds, though they've lessened the burden of loading delays by keeping the action going continually.  In between sectors, you simply see Samus being transported from one sector to the next via elevator, so you're pretty much going to have something happening all the time, unless you pause the game.Sound-wise, I only have one complaint.  There is one particular enemy you meet later in the game that has a sound effect that's rather hard on the ears.  Fitting, but hard on the ears.  Other than that, everything in this game is done well.  All the better if you have surround sound.  More often then not, you'll hear enemies before you see them.  The music helps add to the environment, though this is one of those soundtracks that wouldn't be much on it's own, so don't expect to see a music CD with the soundtrack for Metroid Prime.The controls in this game are better than I expected.  While they can take a while to get the hang of if you're used to a keyboard and mouse setup for these kinds of 3D games, once you get into it, the controls become second nature.  Better yet, the game is built so that everything is easy to control.  You may be surprised at how easy the grapple beam is to use, though you'd better be more coordinated than my brother-in-law is.  The best part is that jumping seems to be easier to execute in this game than most other games.  The view tilts down just a little bit so that you can guage how far it is until you reach the platform.  The best thing by far is the fact that the beam weapon and missles have their own button.  If you want to use a missle, it's as easy as pressing a button, though don't get to comfortable switching weapons like that.  They programmed a slight delay when you switch from missle to beam, which makes sense because you are using both out of the same arm cannon.  There's also a cool feature called \"auto lock-on,\" which allows you to target an enemy using a button, but more on that in the next paragraph.Gameplay is where the final bit of my sense of awe with this game comes in.  By all rights and measures, this game actually feels like a Metroid game.  Everything from the fights to the simple, yet fun, puzzles just screams \"I am a Metroid game.\"  Not only that, but it's a sheer testament to the game and it's developers that the auto lock-on feature doesn't hinder the difficulty of the game.  In fact, some of the enemies (particularly bosses) actually utilize the feature in a variety of ways, such as only being able to target under certain visor modes, or targeting specific parts of an enemy, such as arms and legs.  The scan system works into this as well, giving you detailed information on enemies in the game and how to defeat them, if you can.  Along with that, several objects themselves can be scanned for information, including Space Pirate computer databases.  If you are the type that loves to explore, you will have fun using this feature.All in all, Metroid Prime is one of the absolute best games on the gamecube.  In my mind, it easily rivals Halo and other FPS games out there (keeping in mind, Metroid Prime IS NOT an FPS!  It doesn't play like an FPS, it just looks like one).  However, from what I've heard of reactions from others that have played this game, it seems this is one of those \"love it or hate it\" games.  If you think there is a possibility you might hate it, either rent it or borrow it from someone.  You at least owe it to yourself to play this game a little bit to see if you'll like it.  I know I like this game... a lot!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2004"}

It really takes work to master all the controls.  From aiming, to switching between weapons, reloading, crouching/lying down/taking cover/goggles/battlefield map, etc., etc., this game probably has the most complicated control system of any shooter. Then you have to gain competence deploying all the various resources the game gives you--at the same time, while taking fire from enemies.  At many points you command your squad which is walking with you, plus a ground vehicle, plus a helicopter, plus an \"eye in the sky\" reconnaisance drone!  The wheeled vehicle, helicopter and drone have no AI, so they don't do anything unless you command, btw!  Not to mention controlling your actual character at the same time.The other problem is the fact that the character just moves really slowly.  He aims slowly, he reloads slowly, he does everything way slowly, and that gets you killed but quick.  The aiming is just painfully. freaking. slow.  Dudes will blow you away while you try haul your gun around.  I'd say the character moves his gun at about 1/2 the speed a person in real life would.  When you have the scope up on the rifles, that speed gets cut to about 1/6 the speed it would be in real life.  Ridiculously frustrating.Then there's the fact that you can be blown away with just a couple of shots from enemies whose targeting is impeccable, and who are camouflaged really well.  Add to that the fact that it is about 1 million miles and a thousand bad guys between save points, and that any type of healing is even more rare than the save points are!I like hard games.  I really enjoyed Rainbow Six Vegas, for example, depsite the fact that some levels are just killer (like the dark construction site at Dante's!!).  But GRAW is just too freaking complicated and difficult in an annoying way.  Not in a challenging way--an annoying way.  Like when you get continuously blown away and have to restart the level at a point WAAAY back and kill the same 2 dozen dudes all over again.  And again.  And again.  And AGAIN!!!I've been playing this for quite a while now and despite having long ago mastered all those darn controls and commands, I'm throwing in the towel.

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"I. J.

That being said, Fable 2 was pretty cool, but Fable 3 kind of took a step down the ladder. I'll save you detailed descriptions and get right down to the....SPOILERSCONS-Beginning is too quick. It doesn't give you enough time to warm to the characters around you, like in the other two games.-You start as an adult rather than a child.-The game is too short-The quests are a bit dull.-The fighting system sucks. You have to hold down the 'X' button in order to strike a good hit (flourish), but as you hold it down you get attacked. This is especially annoying when battling the big giant dudes that throw fire at you. Balverines are a bitch to fight too.-The \"darkness\". Wow, I still don't get this. It was completely random. I'm like trying to figure where the hell I am in some random desert, trying to figure out if it used to be Snowspire Village or Archon's Shrine or whatever, but apparently it's just some ancient random cave with some random \"darkness\" that is threatening to take over the world is approximately one year to your reign over Albion. Seriously, Molyneux?-To add onto the \"darkness\" there aren't any explanations of things, such as: what some of the places are (like Aurora), what the \"darkness\" is and the place it dwells in, what Theresa's role in all this is and what she's doing at the Spire, where Oakvale is, etc.-Crappy selection of weapons. I've visited like four stores and they all have the same weapons.-Not only do the weapons suck but the prices are ridiculously high. At least you can make money pretty fast.-You pretty much have to destroy Albion's beauty in order to save it (to gain money to save everyone). No doubt it can be done with keeping all your promises as King or Queen, and I was honestly going to make the money to do it, but then it suddenly went from like 150 days to one complete year. Gay.-Oh, and the main character talks. I mean, I didn't really mind it, but it just kind of ruins the whole having a mute character, or at least the traditional \"no talking\" character, especially since they established that in the other two games.-You can't choose how you want to interact with someone. If the 'X' button says patty cake you gotta play patty cake with them. If anyone else has gotten around this I'd like to know too.-I was hoping they'd let you make more decisions as King/Queen after the game, such as upholding promises you declined earlier in the game. I saved Albion but everyone hates me anyway.PROS-It isn't as laggy as the second game, which is great. I absolutely love the start menu. I've heard others complain but I understand why they did it. They did it this way in order to fix the lag problem during the menu screen. It was horrible in Fable 2. They fixed it in Fable 3 by making you go to the \"sanctuary\" where you can walk around your menu and try on your clothes, dye them, try on hairstyles, look at achievements, etc. This saves me LOADS on the time I used to consume dying clothes and stuff in Fable 2.-They brought back some old landscapes so it was cool to see some of them.-The Spire is visible out in the ocean in one of the areas. If you try to swim out to it an invisible barrier stops you and the camera zooms out so you can see the Lionhead logo on the bottom of the ocean floor. Pretty cool easter egg.-Great graphics. I honestly fell in love with the water in this game. They made it looks so cool and realistic. I was so enthralled by the water I was telling my mom and sister about it and making them watch me swim around in it.-The boardgame quest was pretty funny, and really neat.-There are still many areas I haven't explored and many quests I have yet to complete, so that just goes to show that there are extra hours of fun packed into it.-I liked being King/Queen of Albion more than anything. I thought it was fun choosing what decisions to make. I found myself debating on one issue for 10 minutes.Overall it was a fun game, a bit boring at times, creepy at others, and funny too. I've played it twice but the second time around the beginning quests were a bit boring. I hate that you can't save one game several different times, like with the first game. Not really a step up from the second but I think I was more disappointed with the plot more than anything. It didn't go anywhere. I thought there'd be some explanation as to what Theresa is all about, what she's really planning for Albion (because you know she's up to something). And of course they leave it open to a fourth game, which sucks because I feel like I didn't even get enough information about what's going on in the third one. We went from Jack of Blades, the hero who defeated him, his descendants, the heroes in Fable 2, their adventures, the Spire being built, mankind being wiped out, then all of a sudden this \"darkness\".

It's fun, around 8 hours in length, and constantly introduces new mechanisms and gadgets and gameplay modes - all within a charming and whimsical package(+/-) The on-line experience was rocky at launch but stabilized within weeks. There are plenty of inspired and well designed levels available, both from other players and the developer Media Molecule (MM). MM deployed a community site and tools, lbp.me, that allows you to quickly rate, find, and queue up content with the community at large. The in-game tools for finding and rating content are likewise powerful and easy to useDespite being stable and content-rich, accessing on-line content is sluggish. I average 3 MBps download rates for everything from Hulu to the iTunes store (peak 5 MBps) - but for some reason it takes no less than a minute to download any level and a short while after to connect. Multiplayer sessions, even with friends, drop on occasion are often laggy. I don't feel that this problem is unique to myself, since I've seen the same complaints from many users on their official forums and elsewhere(+/-) The 2D/3D hybrid of the general platforming is still present from LBP1. The controls have been refined, and the levels designed in a manner to work around the shortcomings. However, it's still a tad too floaty at times and feels like it's working against the player. The differences are so noticeable between old and new content that I just couldn't bring myself to play levels created in LBP1 after finishing LBP2(+) Vast graphical improvements, particularly particle effects and higher resolution backgrounds, were made that aren't apparent when looking at screenshots(+) The Collector's Edition content is more than adequate, and of the general quality you would expectWorth the money, without a doubt.

Also like with the previous game there are cutscenes in her throughout the game that are sometimes short other times long but if you go to the option setting you can set it up where you can skip the cutsenes if you wish though it will help you understand what's happening if you do watch the scenes. The voice cast regardless if you understand or not do a fantastic job voicing their characters as you feel that their actually doing a live movie instead of a video game.The controls are pretty typical for the series so you won't have to learn any new button smashing combos if you've played the previous game which is appreciated. Also remember the social station of the Yakuza in Japanese society is vastly different to how the majority of Americans look at organized crime syndicates in the U.S.Still the game is very fun to play and keeps you attached to what's happening in the game,yes there are some areas where it will feel repetitive but so do many other games when you play them,regardless if you give the game chance you'll be surprised at how enjoyable you might actually find it when you're playing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}

Everything about it; the new characters, levels, the infected, and campaign endings are really clever and have you doing some different things. All of the \"movies\" are awesome. Three new special infected types have been added along with some new medical equipment but they kept all the old stuff.The new guns along with the addition of melee weapons and explosive and incendiary ammo add some flavor as do the new gameplay modes. For sure I would say this is better on PC for the graphics but they really cleaned it up on the 360 but it is nice to play split screen with a friend. The realism mode makes it a little less mindless. Personally I haven't had any issues with lag while playing online in either mode.

{"product_name":"B000BGPGU2","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Oblivion is the biggest monster you'll ever fight","reviewText":"What a long wait it's been. Bethesda's Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion finally released on Xbox 360 and PC on March 20th, 2006, and since then, my gaming and real-world lives haven't been the same. Oblivion is, without a doubt, one of the most astonishing video games ever created and in every single way that comes to mind it manages to impress me. Bethesda proves once again that they are in fact the masters of the role-playing genre.Once again, Elder Scrolls throws you into the shoes of a completely unknown character that becomes immersed into a worldwide threat. From the start of the game, you create every aspect of your character, including his or her race, appearance (detailed as far as the color tint of his or her skin), and attributes. These parameters are set and level up as you progress through the game, using different skills, weapons and abilities. From there, you're thrust into the huge world of Tamriel, where Emperor Uriel Septim is assassinated by a mysterious cult. It's eventually your job to find and destroy his murderers and discover the secrets of Oblivion, the hellish world attacking the otherwise peaceful land.I say that it is \"eventually\" your job to complete the main quest because Oblivion, like its predecessor Morrowind, is an extremely huge game that is composed of far more side quests than storyline missions. Almost every one of the hundreds of NPCs you interact with have something for you to do, whether it's finding a lost loved one or spying on another character. There are four factions scattered throughout the cities in the game where you can obtain quests and earn a rank, including the Fighters, Mages, and Thieves Guilds returning from Morrowind. Last of all is the Dark Brotherhood, a band of murderers and criminals that give you quests that involve a lot of sneaking and a lot of killing. Beside these quests, there are self-induced quests, like closing Gates to Oblivion. These gates pop up across the world, even more commonly when you're at a high experience level. Running parallel to the side quests is the storyline that takes you from a being a prison rat to a personal friend of the emperor and hero of Tamriel.Oblivion is one of those games you could talk about among friends for months. \"Have you done the quest where you spy on this person?\" Or perhaps you'd talk about closing the Oblivion gates scattered across Tamriel. One of my favorite stories to tell is the first time a horse died. I was galloping across a cliffside and decided to try and run down the side, discovering the hard way that the hill was far too steep. My horse crumpled and my character slid down the cliffside as I watched my horse's body flop around with the Havok physics engine. In Morrowind, this would have resulted in an hour or so of walking across the map, but in Oblivion, the trusty teleport feature was there to bring me back to civilization.The things that Morrowind lacked the most, cohesive controls and an interesting battle system, are two of Oblivion's strong points. Finally, traversing the world doesn't require the effort of a champion. Sifting through the game's menus and inventories is very tedious at first, but eventually I learned my way around the system and it wasn't difficult at all. The map is the press of a button away, and travelling is made easy with a new teleport ability. Exploration is made faster with the inclusion of horses, which can be bought, found, or stolen throughout the course of the story. Battling enemies is no longer a flailing match, and in fact many of the battles can be rather intense. A new hotkey system allows you to switch between weapons, armor, and items with the press of a directional button on the D-Pad, which makes almost everything combat-related easier. If you realize that you need an enhanced weapon and you're equipped with a bow, switching weapons no longer requires you to go into the menu and fumble through tiny icons. Overall, fighting is similar to Morrowind, but much more accessible.In fact, the game as a whole seems to be an improved, nearly-perfect, accessible version of Morrowind. Other than the battle system and menus, the world of Tamriel is simply more interesting than Morrowind. It's not as barren, it's not as brown, and it is definitely a hundred times more full of life. There are even more distractions along every forest path, caves and caverns loaded with treasure and dangerous enemies. The Speechcraft system is now a mini-game in itself, one that's fun to use and experiment with.Visually, Oblivion isn't the best-looking game ever made. In fact, I can pick out at least four or five Xbox 360 games that look better. But none of those games have better art or detail, and that's where this game shines. The amount of vegetation is stunning as you ride your horse across the countryside. Every character you talk to is individual, either in his or her appearance or his or her dress. Argonians no longer look like grown-up combinations of lizards and toads, and in fact, they look pretty menacing with the detail put into their eyes, skin textures, and skin color. Armor and weapons shine and even get bloody in the heat of battle, and they're detailed with the same style of medieval design as in Morrowind. Animations are still a little stiff, but the Havok physics engine makes for some interesting (and humorous) floppy-body moments. Each and every city has a design, layout, and style that could only be described as elegant or beautiful, or both. The cold, snowy village of Bruma and the bustling Imperial City, the port of Anvil--every in-game location is a work of art.The soundtrack is also something to note; the score being as epic and powerful as anything you've ever heard from a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings film. Of course, the custom soundtrack is only a few button presses away if you don't want to listen to beautiful orchestral pieces, but you'd really be missing out. The voice acting, though it's filled with typical medieval British and Scottish accents, is pretty awesome. There is passion and care in Emperor Septim's voice, firm confidence and power in Jauffre's, and evil in every member of the game's cults. There are so many lines of speech that credit must be given to Bethesda for working in all of the spoken dialogue.The only complaint I have with Bethesda's masterpiece is that I've lost hours of life that could have been spent elsewhere, but that's not a bad thing. Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an early candidate for Game of the Year, and I for one think it'll make that mark. It's the perfect RPG, filled with hundreds of quests, leveling-up, an interesting and exciting battle system, beautiful graphics, and a fantastic soundtrack. Xbox 360 owners have really been treated in the last two months, with releases like Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter, Fight Night Round 3, and now this monster. Downloadable extras in the future are the only thing that would make this game better (hint hint, Bethesda) and until then, I'll continue to ignore life's essentials for the life I live in Tamriel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2006"}

With the Kinect there are no controllers at all - YOU are the controller! The Kinect literally reads your body movements.First, the basics. The ONLY thing you need to get a Kinect to work is the Kinect camera (and of course the XBox 360 console). You plug the Kinect camera into the USB port on the front of your 360 console. You put the camera above or below your TV. That's it! You don't need ANY controllers at all. You don't need any chargers! So while the Kinect camera might be more expensive than a single Wii or PS3 Move controller, it is far LESS expensive than getting a full set of controllers for either of those other systems.  It's also far less hassle compared with charging and maintaining all those controllers.So how does it work? We had a group of people over to help us test this out, and everyone had a *blast*. It was incredibly easy to see how to play. Swat your arm to hit the ball at the screen. Jump up to hop over a hurdle. Dance left to match the dance moves of your on-screen avatar. There is no \"thought\" involved. No remembering to press X or Y, no worrying about how to hold the controller in your hand. You simply jump, dodge, wave, swing, or do whatever else you want your avatar to do - and they do it.This is definitely a game that gets you active! We were all getting tired out with all the jumping and moving - but we kept going because it was so much fun! Instead of an exercise bike where you keep looking at the clock saying \"Shoot, 10 more minutes to go\" here you are feeling tired and pushing yourself to keep playing because you're enjoying it so much. It sucks you in.I'll review all the games separately, and of course some games are more fun and some games are less fun. That's quite normal. The *system* itself is superb and I can see some fantastic games coming out to use this technology.It's important to note that you need a fair amount of space to play this. We have what I would call a reasonably sized living room in our house, with our TV mounted on one wall and our futon on the opposite wall. There is nothing in between. Even so, standing right against the futon, we are barely in their \"OK\" range and not even into their \"best\" range. If we move too far forward (towards the TV) we get warnings that we are too close. This is with the Kinect mounted above the TV as far against the wall as we can get it. So we would have to literally clear out the room (move the futon out) in order to get adequate playing space. So before you get a Kinect pull out a tape measure and see what kind of space you can create. You might have to rearrange furniture to create the play space. I would say it's very worth it, though! You are creating a home health system that will keep you active and energized!Really, that was the only down side. We had a tall (6'3\") person in our group and he had to stand right against the futon in order to play, or his head would get cut off and the screen would give warnings.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

Some minor spoilers below.I bought the Death Edition of Dante's Inferno, which is supposedly loaded with bonus features, and that's not really the case. There's the game wrapped in a nice lenticular box with Death on the inside cover and all nine circles represented in the background. There's the game itself, the manual, a code for a free Dead Space-costume, and one bonus DVD. There's a very brief making of-featurette on it, another very brief Dante-featurette, a music featurette, 30-second samples of the soundtrack (only playable from the DVD menus), a slideshow of Wayne Barlow's artwork, a short scene from the animated filmDante's Inferno: An Animated Epic [Blu-ray], and a link to the EA website where you can read the full poem (which you could also do for free on [...]). Yes, there's nice stuff here, but overall it doesn't hold up to all that it promises.And as for the game, it's maddeningly designed - really infernally annoying at times, as you're given absolutely no clue or hint as to all the many puzzles you have to solve, and you'll often have to do a whole series of elaborate puzzle solving, also doing spectacular jumps (with a risk of plummeting to your death at any given moment) while simultaneously fighting off a hoard of demons. I had to resort to YouTube ten times just to get to the next part of the game, and who wants to have to do that? If you're aiming to complete the game, do it in the easiest difficulty setting, Classic. I spent a few months getting through the thing on the second-easiest one, and I came to find that the final boss is quite literally unbeatable (if you don't have the right upgrades by then at least). I switch over the difficulty, and eureka - game completed from start to finish in two days. There's too much to nitpick to praise this game, especially as it's literally near-impossible on the first time through, and easy as pie the second one. Had it been a little longer and a bit more balanced (with some hints every now and then, and bosses that don't require particular upgrades), it would've been a far better game. The \"all in one combo\"-challenge is absolutely maddening if you don't have the right upgrades (and possibly difficulty setting).But there are a lot of very good things about this game as well. It's fantastically designed, envisioned and scored. It's atmospheric, brutal as..well, hell, and very fascinating to play. Coming across your first damned soul, Pontius Pilate, and making the choice of either condemning his damned soul or granting him the light of eternal paradise is a tough one. Dante's quest for fair Beatrice is truly epic, and it's easy to marvel at the gorgeous cinematics while you're expecting what comes as you venture deeper and deeper into the next circle. It's definitely resparked an interest in the original poem as well (and even beyond that, Purgatorio and Paradiso). Even though it's revamped and adapted, there's great storytelling here, in a story as old as time itself - but most of all, there's a lot of minion asskicking, and if you're into that kind of thing, this might just be a game for you. And if you find that you're screaming just as loud as Dante does in certain parts, you can always resort to internet guides and (at least) switch the difficulty setting at any given time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2010"}

For the most part this is because I now have a better idea which problems were part of the first game and which problems were really due to the PS3.  Happily the PS3 and Folklore got along wonderfully and since Folklore is now fresher in my mind it gets to go first.Folklore has an unusual story line.  Ellen, a young woman receives a note from her mother requesting that she come to the village of Doolin - since Ellen was raised as an orphan this is a bit of a surprise.  And elsewhere, Keats, a writer for an occult magazine receives a call from the same village - from a woman who fears for her life.  Both arrive only to witness the aftermath of a murder that recalls three deaths from 17 years ago and presages even more fatalities to come.  Ellen searches for clues to her past with the help of Keats and the find entry to the Netherworld - a fairy world of many dimensions.  It is in the Netherworld where they find help and hindrance as they battle their separate but intertwined routes through a galaxy of strange creatures.All that sounds complicated and, to some degree it is.  But Folklore is really a mission based RPG where the player fights various creatures, absorbs their 'ID's and then uses the absorbed creatures in more battles, where you absorb more IDs, etc., etc.  Various tasks allow you to develop the creatures until both Ellen and Keats have a large menagerie of weapons.  Killing some of the creatures, and all the mission end bosses involve combinations of IDs, which keeps fighting from being a complete hack and slash fest.  All of this is very well animated, but keep in mind that, while there is some variation between Ellen and Keats creature collections there is a lot of repetition.  This is perhaps Folklore's worst flaw, and it's by no means a show-stopper.  This is an interesting game to play, regardless.The artwork is excellent, done in a watercolor style that sets Folklore apart.  The game uses a combination of full animation (in battle and some set scenes) and shifting illustrations much like a comic book.  Sometimes conversations are voiced and sometimes people use balloon speak.  Somehow this all works together seamlessly and the effect is quite memorable.  As I said, this is an unusual game in many ways.  If you would like a good battle oriented fantasy RPG with a solid plot, Folklore should be high on your list.  Expect 40 to 80 hours of gameplay depending on how much effort you put into ID building.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Welcome Back to the Jungle...","reviewText":"In 1994, Rare developed a little game called Donkey Kong Country that became a huge smash on the Super Nintendo.  It went on to sell millions of copies and was even followed up by two sequels.  After the Donkey Kong Country trilogy came we were subjected to Donkey Kong 64 and then numerous strange games that seemed to feature Donkey Kong, but not exactly play like Donkey Kong.  Thus, when Donkey Kong Country Returns first came out, it was easy to be excited.  Because it was the first time in a decade and a half that we got the chance to play a traditional Donkey Kong Country game and the results are fantastic.The original game followed the tale of Donkey Kong.  His bananas were taken by King K. Rool and Donkey Kong had to go out, along with Diddy Kong, to get them back.  Donkey Kong Country Returns goes back to that.  But instead of King K. Rool and Kremlings it's a bunch of Tiki's that have done this.  It's actually very hard NOT to miss the Kremlings.  Especially in a Donkey Kong game that's supposed to be a return to things.  But you won't mind too much because the level designs and the challenge this game evokes is absolutely fantastic.You'll go by on a world map from one level to the next completing them in an effort to get back your bananas from those Tiki's.  They all start off rather easy at first, teaching you basic things and hoping you can keep up with all you've been taught.  The first two worlds in particular are cake walks but once we get to world 3 things really pick up and start to become challenging.  But the gameplay is extremely familiar to anyone who played the original Donkey Kong Country games from a long time ago.  You'll run and jump on your enemies, and you'll find hidden barrels and passages that'll take you to bonus rooms where you can reap the rewards.  Every level also has puzzle pieces that you'll want to collect.There are a few things that have changed, however.  The first is how your partner works.  In the original games you could switch between Donkey and Diddy.  And when one took a hit, he immediately ran away and the partner picked up the slack.  After that one more hit meant the loss of a life.  Here, both Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have hearts.  And Diddy will always be on Donkey Kong's back.  Always.  You won't be able to switch to him at all.  But he will allow you to hover for a short period of time.  Once you lose your first two hearts you lose Diddy and your ability to hover briefly.  Until you find a DK barrel and get him back.  Donkey Kong also has two hearts, and once lost the level ends.  The level design here has made Donkey Kong Country Returns quite difficult, but fun and manageable.  You'll find some moments of trial and error.  But they're some well crafted levels that never throw the same thing at you twice.  Even familiar levels will always have new tweaks.  The first mine car level is basic.  But there's one down the line that has you having to stay inside a giant while until it crumbles away.  It is AMAZING stuff.  The boss battles are also amazing and require a lot of pattern recognition.  There's a lot of variety to each level.  Couple that with the fact that some levels have you going into the background and foreground and there's a lot to do and explore in just about every level.  The game provides a challenge, but like so many of Nintendo's games that do in this day and age, it makes sure that extra lives are scattered everywhere.  Just in case. Even if you ARE having problems, you're still not likely to see a game over screen any time soon.There are other moments that breathe of Donkey Kong Country.  A lot of the music you here is simply remixed from the original Donkey Kong Country and it sounds brilliant and sometimes even sets the atmosphere.  It's likely to fill long time fans with nostalgia.That's not to say it's all nostalgic though.  There are some things that were either left on the cutting room floor.  For instance, there are no real animal buddies here and that's a shame.  You won't find some of your favorites like Rambi the Rhino or anything like that.  For the most part Donkey Kong Country doesn't really feature them.  The other thing is that a lot of the Kong family isn't really there either.  Part of the fun and charm of some of the other games was running into some of the ohter Kong's such as Wrinkly or Funky or Cranky.  And while Cranky Kong returns, it's not with some of his clever fourth wall breaking \"we know we're in a video game,\" banter that he used to always have that made him such a comical character.There are a couple of issues with Donkey Kong Country Returns control scheme.  You'll have to hold the Wii Remote sideways.  You'll mostly be jumping from one platform to another, but from time to time you'll also have to roll or something.  And this is where the controls can be touchy.  The Wii Remote seems to be a little sensitive this time around and there will be moments where you'll make Donkey Kong roll when you didn't actually mean for that to happen.  This is mainly because there aren't enough buttons to actually assign his roll to a button.Donkey Kong Country Returns also has a multiplayer function similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii.  One player controls Donkey Kong and the other controls Diddy Kong.  It's the only time you really can control Diddy manually.  You'll have to work together, but unlike New Super Mario Bros. Wii, there isn't much fun in messing around with your friends.  The focus here is strictly teamwork and it holds to that.  The game is a challenge and the last thing you'd want to do is mess up your partner who could potentially be carrying you through a level anyway.Visually you'll be hard pressed to find a game on the Wii that's quite this detailed.  The backgrounds are amazing, beautifully complimenting the art style of the game.  The fact that you can transition into the background and foreground so easily also helps.  There's a lot of life here.  The development team has outdone themselves here.  The fact that it's also so smooth is just as fantastic.If you were a fan of the original Donkey Kong Country games then by all means play Donkey Kong Country Returns.  If you never played them before and you just want to jump in, there's nothing to stop you this time around.  It's a fun game, just one that can be pretty difficult.  But that's not such a bad thing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

Allen","summary":"All I can say is, Wow!","reviewText":"I haven't played any online game since Counter Strike. I wanted to get back into the online gaming community, but fear that I don't have a good computer, or that I am getting too old to be playing (I'm 24 years old). I have been following Call Of Duty 4 (the 360 version) for some time since its release. The main appeal is the \"modern\" combat aspect. However, when I first got my 360, I played Call of Duty 2 (not online) and did not really like the game.So finally I got my tax refund back. I asked myself what I wanted? I broke my 92FS (a handgun like the M9) some time ago (the slide broke after about 10K rounds), and I was deciding to go buy another one. Then I said to myself I am not too fond of starting to shoot again. I liked shooting, but I fear I am losing my hearing from firing too much (even though I wear hearing protections). Why shoot real weapons that are nosiy, loud, possibly deadly (the slide broke from my 92FS scared me and I thought I lost a finger at first), and dangerous? So I was on the hunt for a \"virtual\" experience. Then Call of Duty 4 came to mind. I went and bought with one year of xbox Live and went home and connected. From the first moment, my thoughts were, \"Wow!\"Here are some things I like and don't like:* Nice online community. I thought I was in for real troubles. I found that the online community is helpful and most people you meet online are fun to be with. I feel the news about the online world is completely exaggerating. I am 24 and I found the people to be nice to you and that most of them aren't much older or younger than you are. I have one real life friend who plays this game, but most of the time, I play with people I don't know and they are nice 99% of the time.* You can level up by scoring kills, and playing the game online. With each level up, you get new weapons, perks (I'll explain later), and game modes.* You get awesome weapons that you can customize. After so many kills with a particular weapon, you get new attachments and camo. For example, if you get 25 kills with the M16, you get a Red Dot to make shooting easier. Also, if you get 25 headshots, you get a new gun camo. You also get a cool gold plated gun - on certain weapons - after completing the kills/headshots for all weapons of that category.* Single player is awesome! The story line is awesome and at two points in the story you can fly an AC130 (truly great) and be a Marine door gunner. I cannot tell you how exciting it is to join the \"Mile High Club.\" If you don't know, the Mile High Club is an achievement given to those who complete the last level on veteran mode (the hardest game mode).* Online Perks. You can set up to three perks. As with weapons, after a certain level, you unlock a new perk. Perks ranges from increased health, increase damages, ability to sprint, drop a grenade when you're dead, and so fort. Each perk can be used depending on your playing style. Some people complain about the perks online, however, they are all quite fun and I recommend switching them up to suit your playing style.* Call in airstrikes, helo, and provide UAV support. The game is all about teamwork. On average, you will find one or two good people on your team who attempts to work as a team. Basically, after so many kills you can call in airstrikes and give helo support (you only call them in, but you don't actually control or fly them). On hardcore mode - a mode where friendly fire is on and damages are increased - it is almost essential to communicate with your team as you call in airstrikes and helos.* Graphics are awesome. Honestly, I can't believe how far along we've come in computer graphics. The graphics are liquid fast in the game. On a hdtv, your eyes will bleed from the beauty. Not only that, on multiplayer you can hide in tall grass and so fort to avoid detection from your enemies. It is truly a bonus from the old games of simply running around and shoot. Now you actually have to be careful and think in 3D as you try to make you way through the ranks.* Respawn can either be a blessing or a curse. Most of the time, you respawn away from the enemy. Unlike other games where you respawn at one point, Call of Duty 4 attempts to spawn you at the best location to prevent \"spawn camping.\" Most of the time it works; the enemy team takes over your spawn, then you respawn on the other side of the map without fear. Other times, you're not so lucky. You might respawn at odd locations. Sometimes it takes me a moment to realize exactly where I respawn and try to get a fix on my location. During this time, you might accidentally run into an enemy. Also, sometimes you get unlucky and spawn in an airstrike area where you will die - possibly twice.* Grenades, flashbangs, and stun don't affect your teammate. On regular game modes - except in Hardcore - you don't have to worry about hurting your team mates. This is good for beginners who often make the mistake of killing his own teammates which can result in rather unhappy times.* Killcam. This is awesome. After you get killed, you can watch how the enemy killed you. This is ideal to get a fix on hard to see snipers and you can easily avoid making the same error.Overall, it is a great game. The single player is far better than Call of Duty 2 that I played. I say get this game if you like Counter Strike or Rainbow Six 3 series. Right now, I recommend getting the Game of the Year edition since you get the free map pack - otherwise you'll have to spend roughly 8 dollars to get the new map pack.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

There are plenty different ways to go and there are plenty of people there to help you as you go along, but there also people who wont be happy with you for asking them questions.  The fight sequences are one of the best parts of the game, and learning moves as you go along was also one of my favourite parts.

Because of that I had little hope for the sequel and thought it was deliver the same experience, I was wrong. Vigil improve the combat, puzzles and story of the game that far exceeded the pervious game.Playing as Death was a joy, his agility and move set made combat and platforming easy but fun. Equipped with dual- interlocking scythe and one powerful melee weapon you can combine attacks for some deadly combo attacks. Outside of combat a series of puzzles and platforming challenges, that utilize the environment, allow for some rewarding challenges.The biggest change is the introduction of loot. Death can obtain new pieces of disposable items that can increase his magical abilities or physical attacks from weapons to mystical talismans. This encourages you to travel throughout the explorable world of heaven and hell to complete side quests and powerful enemies, outside the main story, to gain these powerful items.The story takes place before the events of the original Darksiders as War's brother Death attempts to absolve War of his crime of annihilating humanity. Things become more complicated as Death finds out a dark manipulative called corruption is causing havoc on the supernatural world and must stop the source. It's not a complicated story but introduces new characters and plot devices to keep it engaging. Death himself is a cold character that cares little about other things but his goal, however agrees to assist only when his interests are being met.Darksiders 2 is a great sequel to a poor game. Anyone interested in action-adventure should definitely check it out. In addition to the 10 hour main campaign a litany of collectable items and side quest allow add a sizable amount of content to an already bulky game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

While Halo is arguably the best launch title for any console ever released, it simply has been bettered many times since launch.  Many who bought their XBox and Halo together are reluctant to admit that Halo is good, but not great as Halo is the game that gave them the XBox that they love.  It is a good game, just not great.  Levels are repetitive, the enemy AI is weak and works more on overwhelming by force than by tactics, and the vehicle control is strange at best, a detriment at worst.  Halo brings nothing new to the FPS style, and by now, things have been done better more than once.  I am not a Halo hater, I actually enjoy reading the books more than playing the game.  Halo 2 shows promise at the time of this review, but it is still a ways out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2002"}

Another amazing world!","reviewText":"I know... reviewing this in 2008 probably seems kind of stupid.  Who out there hasn't heard of this game/franchise yet??  I really just like having things complete so I figure I'll review this just for the sake of completing my reviews.  Plus I might have a slightly more in depth perspective than a few others since I followed Bungie long before Halo ever came out.When I was younger and got my very first computer I was absolutely outraged at my family!  They decided to get a Macintosh and I didn't even have a gaming console at the time.  I saw my future gaming career dwindling as I booted up the Mac.  Now this was around 1994/1995 and Doom II was still a hot topic.  So we looked at a special software catalog and talked to someone on the phone, they recommended a game called Marathon.  By now you're asking what the point of all this is?  Well Marathon was developed by Bungie.  It was their first major development and to this day it is one of the most engrossing and best First Person Shooters I've ever played.  Since then I have followed Bungie's career and have always wished they would remake Marathon on an updated platform.  They kind of fell off my radar for a while then Microsoft decided to purchase a controlling interest.  Originally Bungie was planning on continuing with the Marathon saga in some fashion, but they turned it into a new project to be main release for Microsoft's new console system: The Xbox!  Enter the Halo project.  This game would practically single handedly transform our expectations for console games.  Not to mention I consider the Xbox to be primarily marketed towards the computer gamers, like myself.Well I have to hand it to Bungie, despite the fact I was disappointed in the lack of a new Marathon title, I am definitely awed with the new world they have created.  In the far future the human race has come across a powerful enemy.  It's not a single race of alien, but a group combined into a huge force that call themselves the Covenant.  Their ruling structure is actually fairly interesting.  They form a very hierarchical structure and the grunts of their forces are mostly treated like slaves.  However these slaves have weapons and do fight against you with their overlords.  The major issue that makes the Covenant such a major threat isn't just the sheer size of their force, it's the amount of technology they have at their fingertips.  The human race has already gotten quite far with technological advancements, but the Covenant is still light years ahead of us!  You can really see the influence from Marathon in the design and structure of the enemies.  While they look very different from an artistic perspective you can tell that their hierarchical structure is modeled after the S'pht.  In Marathon you fought against an alien organization that was made up of many different kinds, not just a single species.  This added element in Halo made it a lot of fun for me because I think they got that kind of alien threat right with Marathon.  However, in order to win this war we're going to need something special.  Enter the Mjolner armor.  This name is taken from Viking mythology and is actually the name of Thor's hammer.  This special armor is worn by an elite force known as the Spartans, another name taken from history... albeit Greek this time.  Apparently there were more of these enhanced super soldiers, but the Halo story line mostly follows the story of Master Chief and to find out about the others you'll just have to read the novels.  The armor design is really cool and enables the wearer to have enhanced strength and reflexes.  On top of this it has its own shield, kind of like a force field that can stop enemy fire and lets you last longer in battle.  To help the wearer along his way it is paired with an incredibly advanced artificial intelligence.  These AI's are fully self aware and the one that is paired with your character is the beautiful Cortana.Strangely the game doesn't start us out at the beginning of this war; in fact it seems to have been raging for quite some time.  The Spartan has been dispatched to help a new command crew and the game opens up in the midst of a battle.  The ship we're on jumps to slipspace (basically a dimensional gateway) to get out of a lost battle.  They pick a trajectory at random and before our eyes we come out into unknown space to view a giant ring floating in space.  Halo.  Unfortunately the Covenant are still on our tail and boarding the ship.  The only option is to fight our way to the escape pods and to take refuge on the alien ring world.  From there we are brought on a journey of epic proportions to find the mystery of Halo.  The Covenant seem to worship it, yet know little about its origins too.  For them it is a structure made by the Gods.  Surprisingly it seems we stumble upon a threat even worse than the Covenant.  Just what is Halo and what is this new threat?  Play through this amazing game's story to find out just what is hidden in the vast reaches of the universe.I have to say that this is one of the most fun games I have ever played and has tons of replay value.  One of the things that really set this apart from others is the co-op play that the system allows in order to play through the story with a friend.  My friend and I have played this game over and over again on co-op and worked our way through all the difficulty levels.  It's so much fun that even years later we still want to play this game from time to time!  I was very impressed with the enemy AI throughout the game and as you increase the difficulty the AI gets a lot smarter so it's more than just the sheer volume of enemies that makes things difficult.  Another aspect that impressed me was the view.  It feels like your kind of looking through a bubble and gives you the illusion that you actually have peripheral vision when you don't.  I don't know if this was an intentional design, but I thought it was great!  One thing people may dislike is the lack of a map to help you get through the levels.  I think Halo accommodates for this by making Navigation (Nav) points.  Although sometimes they are hard to see in the background of the sky, so in some way they should've made them more prominent.  This is basically my one complaint.  The graphics are simply stunning as well.  They are surely on par with games like Half Life 2, though the world we're in isn't nearly as interactive.  However, you do get to drive vehicles in this and that was an element that was a lot of fun.  It seems like a lot of FPS games are including this now, but the only one I can think of before Halo is this obscure FPS called Redline.  It wasn't all that great, but driving the cars was fun.  You get a decent array of weapons to choose from; however you can only carry two at once.  This is kind of different from other FPS games where you can carry all kinds of different weapons.  Although, I will admit that it does allow for a decent controller configuration because there's nothing you need to push to make a weapons menu show up and you can seamlessly switch to a different gun in the heat of battle.This game is the reason I pretty much picked up an Xbox in the first place and I'm glad I did because I've been introduced to a lot of new and awesome games.  However, none of the Xbox only titles really compete on the same level as Halo and this game makes me wish all FPS games had the co-op function.  Bar that, all games in general!  I've played Diablo as a co-op on my home LAN, but never an FPS of this caliber.  Oh how I wish Half Life or Doom 3 offered the same feature on the Xbox!  Either way, if you're a big fan of Science Fiction, First Person Shooters, and epic stories then Halo will swiftly be launched into one of your all time favorite games.  For me I think it actually ties with the universe of Half Life, though in some respects Half Life is a lot deeper, but Halo is just a plain awesome fighting adventure.  Ultimately I can safely say that I still associate the name of Bungie with the word quality and while the Halo story isn't as huge or engrossing as Marathon, they've still written something very enthralling for us to enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2008"}

You'll find that there's no solace in a room that you think you've completely freed from zombie infestation.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The cheese is back!","reviewText":"Anyone questioning how powerful the DS is has a relatively good answer now. The original Resident Evil on the DS holds its own pretty well on the handheld with clean graphics, slightly improved over the original. Basically, on the small screen, the game resembles the N64 RE2. But those of you who are not interested in retro gamming may not exactly be excited about yet another port/remake of the original RE. It's not the masterpiece that the GCN version is, and what was scary a decade ago about this game is laughable now. To be truthful, aside from a couple of DS exclusive puzzles, and the knife fights, and a couple of much needed tweaks to the interface Deadly Silence really doesn't offer anything new or innovative so the motivation for picking this title up has got to be entirely about reliving the cheese-fest that was the original PS Resident Evil.The game is fun, as it always was, but doesn't light a candle to its GameCube counterpart. In fact, the original live action fmvs are included, intact, as is the original horrible voice acting (the only element of the game that really is scary). Ever wonder what all the hoopla about the \"master of unlocking\" is? Well now's your chance to wince in pain as the dialogue passes through the DS speakers into your unsuspecting ear. But that's where the fun lies. We can use this game to remember how far the survival horror genre really has come over the years, and more importantly, we finally have a Resident Evil handheld game that isn't completely unplayable (Unlike RE: Gaiden).My only gripe really is that this game is the original RE... Again. I picked this up only because I want RE games on handhelds that are good, and also because you can't resist an old favorite on a handheld. It means there's actually time to play it. It's also the reason that I've picked up the re-releases of Final Fantasy for the DS/GBA despite having their PS1 counterparts. I have more time for handhelds.Even though there are nearly as many ports of RE2, I think that one would have been a better choice to port to the DS. Mainly, it's voice acting (while still bad) isn't nearly as horrid as RE1, and it didn't have the glory of being remade into a masterpiece of gaming for a newer console like RE1 did, basically playing RE2 would feel more natural, since I don't have memories of significantly better graphics and dialogue to contend with.In all REDS is a fun addition for the DS library for a handful of reasons. It is the first M rated title for the DS, making it a milestone of sorts. It's a classic, it's so bad it's funny, but still retains enjoyable game play and even has a few new surprises up its sleeves. I just hope Konami sees how good this turned out and brings Silent Hill to the handheld as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2006"}

It isn&#8217;t bad, it isn&#8217;t good - it&#8217;s just kinda playable but there&#8217;s nothing to get excited about. The sandbox approach is copy and pasted over from the first game, with slightly enhanced graphics and tweaked gameplay mechanics which you won&#8217;t really care about. It really is just another version of the original. There are some things that Crackdown did better, and the new additions are lacklustre - this time zombies are lazily thrown into the mix because the devs couldn&#8217;t think of anything else. Some of the collectable orbs move this time &#8211; that must have been hard. The auto-target system seems ultra-lazy, no accuracy is required at all therefore, very little skills needed. Taking over control points is the main objective throughout the entire game, this never changes and really grated on me after the first four hours or so. You progress further into the game expecting something exciting, but late in your slumber you realise this is all Crackdown 2 has to offer.There are some interface issues which could have been done better. The map is atrocious and hard to follow. You can&#8217;t add waypoints onto the map which makes it a necessity to pause the game and go into the menu to see where you want to go next if it&#8217;s not the main objective. The voice announcer is extremely irritating very early on, more so with the fact your highly exaggerated explosive skills are guaranteed to maim &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; who get involved in almost every shoot-out.  Expect to be told off and insulted at every turn for incidents you have very little control of.If you&#8217;ve not played Crackdown, this is probably the game to go for if you were curious (the original is free to Xbox Gold members). Otherwise, Crackdown 2 is simply an average title that you will have fun with for a bit before throwing back on the shelf to gather dust.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}
{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"the gamer","summary":"This is a bit of a war for the yet to be God","reviewText":"Summary:Pos-1. Feels like the old God of War games. (for some this might not be a pos)2. The controls are easy to get used to again.3. Different weapons and/or the ability to use dropped weapons (could also be considered a con)Cons-1. There are still a few spots where the route splits and you have to choose which way to go. Which can cause you to miss out on some bonus chests if you choose the one that forwards the story.2. The story is somewhat forgettable which is unfortunate.3. It ALMOST seems like they are starting to make up ancient mythological (Greek, Roman etc) characters (bad guys).4. The ability to pick up dropped weapons but with very limited durability.5. Having to repeat certain sections because of one small problem. (ie jumping to another platform)More detailed explanation:So I got God of War: Ascension because I enjoyed the other God of War games. I was slightly unsure of the game when it first was teased and also when it was released. That is why I waited till the price went down. One of those reasons was because the game was said to be a prequel of all the games that have come out. I expected to play as a regular Kratos Spartan without any powers and such. It would be interesting but also slightly boring after a while unless they kept it fresh.After playing the game almost non stop until finishing it I found out that wasn't the case. There is kinda flashbacks in a way though. There was also a type of time travel device which I will go more into later.The story though is unfortunately forgettable. Especially if you have played the previous games you already know whats gonna happen. Or do you?Just after a few weeks if your like me you will actually find yourself trying to remember what exactly happened let alone the characters names (which I grant you is always difficult when they use ancient Greek names but I digress).I felt with the mention in trailers and gameplay of a time travel device that not only would it be quite fun like the ones used in the previous God of War games (which by the way.. how many damn time travel devices are around? Its like either the Gods or what have you are pumping them out of a factory and spreading them out across the games) but it would also shed some light on his own past and/or his future.....Now in game the time device is mainly used for solving puzzles and as a weapon (what a surprise) against some enemies. As well as in some scenes. You do get shown your past but not with the time travel device as you might think.There are weapons you find on the ground and dropped by enemies in the game that can be used such as a secondary weapon. Some have their advantages and disadvantages. But they feel quite bland as well as the fact they don't last long. They tend to only last for a small battle before either getting used up or being switched for a different weapon. They also aren't very powerful really and you could easily beat the game without using them much at all. Its nice they tried to add it though.Just like previous God of War games you will find yourself at forks in the road here and there where you have to pick and sometimes if your lucky you will go the way that will lead to a few extra bonus chests then have to back track a bit to go the other way to continue with the story. Or you will get screwed over and miss out on those chests because of a scene or a locking door behind you after you realize you should have went the other way first. I always hate this in games like this cause you miss out on stuff and can't try again until you play the game again and by then you have probably forgotten and are doomed to repeat it.Also if they plan to make another God of War game, I am wondering what enemy they will use that time. Cause for this game it felt like they were just re-using the enemies from the third God of War game here but calling them something else. If you have played the other games you know why they can't re-use certain enemies. When I start a game like this I feel like they might be just making up a new enemy just so they can have someone for Kratos to fight. That is unfortunate.I wont spoil what happens in the game even though you can't really spoil much when most people have played the previous games and know what lies in his future. But something I expected at least at the very end, or at the end of the credits was the time device or something to go ahead in time... all the way to God of War 3's ending in some way and maybe either expand on what happened or just tease that more might happen or something. However, at the end of the game it just ends and expects you to realize this was just a prequel to all the other God of War games. Its quite a shame.While writing this review though I did have to go back and try and remember what exactly happened and how it ended just because it was that forgettable. It is a fun way to pass the time and if you enjoyed the other God of War games you will enjoy this one as well but don't expect anything huge.As for the multiplayer I never tried it at least not yet. It didn't look all that interesting to me when I first heard and saw it but I do concede it is good that they are trying new things with the franchise even though this could just be the very last God of War game to come out.Now my cons might seem more then the pos in my list. It kinda is but don't get me wrong this is still a fun game. Just don't expect it to be better then the third game. I think that kinda set the bar a little to high (which is kinda a good thing since they felt that was the last game that would come out). I still enjoyed it but there was little things here and there that caused it to be less enjoyable for me. Who knows maybe if I give it more time and play it again I will enjoy it more. Just know not to go into this expecting it to be the best God of War game ever.Sorry for the long review. Just wanted to make it clear. I also didn't make it as long as I could have. I hope this review helps at least one person out there when deciding on this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2013"}

Just as Tekken has gone vastly downhill and is a dying franchise soul calibur has taken its time to release only 4 games (one was a saturn port), yet each has been better than the last. It has rightly gotten great reviews, and sold past the magic million mark easily.The main character stories have been even more improved and are now called tales of the soul. You travel on a world map and can make different choices depending on who you meet and what you do. There are also fully animated cutscene endings for all the characters, along with different outcomes depending on how you do and if you take certain actions. E.g A character in a scene might launch a giant cog at you and up flashes the button press you need to make to avoid it (like resident evil 4). The whole experience is very polished and its only part of the whole package. Superb.There is a challenge section where you can face giant greek gods or race to collect coins. I won't spoil them as some are very inventive and they never feel like \"space fillers\".A major part of soul calibur 3 is the chronicles of the sword mode mode. This is like an rpg with weapon and armour collection and party members. You play a young recruit in a vast army who though his/her actions can shape the world and history. It's very well made and there is lots to do in it. You can attack the enemy strongholds in groups or switch to vs mode and fight enemies in traditional soul calibur matches. You issue orders to knights, ninjas, infantry etc and many famous SC characters make an appearance. It's a big improvement on the weapon master mode of part 2. Top class. Did I mention that you create your own character with so much variety it puts most PC rpgs to shame, you can chose their class, their wardrobe (hundreds of items), their weapons, even down to eye colour and hundreds of shades to pick.There's a great tutorial, a large tournament mode for various trophies as well as the excellent shops to buy weapons, armour and items from (all stafed by very attractive women!). An art gallery, exibition theater.....etc..etc. This will last you months and months.9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2006"}

This was a highly anticipated game because it was the last entry in the trilogy of the excellent Metroid Prime games, which started out on the Gamecube. And it delivers big time and shows that the Wii can foster great looking games with motion controls done in the right way. While The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess may have disappointed some gamers because it started out as a Gamecube title and only added motion controls for its debut launch on the Wii, MP3:C was developed from the ground up for the Wii.You once again take control of Samus as you explore new worlds and face old and new enemies. Like in the previous games, you fight your way to get a hold of new weapons to acquire and use against your enemies & get past areas that were previously not accessible. The visors also return and you use different them for different functions.So that part of the game hasn't changed much and anyone who has played the previous two games in the series will feel right at home. The major difference this time are the continuing story, the controls and the obvious benefits on being on a more powerful console.The PROS: Retro Studios made a huge name for themselves by showing they can take a popular Nintendo franchise and bring it to life as an adventure title disguised as a first person shooter with adventure elements. If there were any issues with Metroid Prime 1 and 2, this game eliminated them and balances everything out. The graphics are gorgeous, detailed and are top notch. The controls, including the gestures (they are kept to a minimum), are spot on and you can tweak the settings so it plays like one of your favorite FPSs. The music, sound effect and voice acting from the NPCs you encounter all fit right in and help immerse you into the planets you visit. You have a difficulty setting option so this game will challenge once you bump it up.The CONS: Well there isn't much to say here except that there is no online functionality with this game because it was released before Nintendo launched their Wi-Fi Connection service to play games online. Some people might be bummed that there is no multiplayer function but that's actually a good thing. There were multiplayer modes in Metroid Prime 2 but it did not play out so well and Metroid Prime Hunters,a multiplayer focused title, was released on the Nintendo DS to mixed fan reaction and reviews. Like I said before, some players may need to tweak the controls before playing the game to suit their way of playing. These are just minor gripes that don't derail the overall quality this game brings to the Wii.Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is an excellent game that should be in your collection and is a great way to end the Metroid Prime games. If you haven't picked this up yet, go get it. If you haven't played any of the Metroid Prime games, go get the Metroid Prime Trilogy instead. This collection has all 3 games with motion controls and optimized graphics added to the first two games. Either way, it is worth playing so don't miss out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}

Bakehorn","summary":"A foxy DS game","reviewText":"I've always felt that Nintendo treated its Starfox franchise like a lab rat. Even the original, which was released on the Super Nintendo, used the FX Chip, a new 3D technology. Starfox 64, what I consider the pinnacle of the series, was the first major release to use rumble technology and launched bundled with Nintendo's N64 Rumble Pack. Starfox Adventures took things to the ground and ultimately failed as a boring, fetch quest marathon. Starfox Command, the series' first handheld debut, puts Starfox back where he belongs: in the sky. But it does so in a strange, DS-appropriate way that isn't quite great but it also isn't bad, either.Consider this experiment a success, because it shows that the Nintendo DS can handle a flight action game very well. Starfox Command utilizes only the Nintendo DS touch screen and the L Trigger (or R Trigger, for left-handed players) and it does so very well. Using the touch screen, players control their pitch and yaw, steering the Arwing with precision. Making a frantic scratching motion sends the Arwing into its classic laser-deflecting barrel roll, and there are buttons found on the touch screen to pull off other maneuvers like flips. The L/R Trigger is the only non-touch-based control button, and it allows you to shoot your lasers. Any other button allows you to shoot as well, but the L/R Triggers are definitely the most intuitive.The touch screen mechanics don't end there. Q-Games had to implement something new into their game to set Starfox Command apart from other Starfox games, so they made the game's battles spread out into a turn-based strategy mechanic. Each mission will throw you out onto a battlefield diagram where you'll direct your Starfox team around the map, engaging in conflict with enemy ships and taking over bases. The goal in every mission is to keep the big, defenseless Great Fox afloat while destroying all of the bad guys and stopping their missiles from reaching Great Fox. On the diagram you can fly over power-ups that give the Great Fox a little defense of its own, as well as power-ups that give you more time on the master clock for each mission. That's right, each mission has a time restraint. What a bummer.The conflicts (or more appropriately, scuffles) that you'll engage in are over far too quickly, and that's unfortunate because they're where the old-school Starfox charm is delivered. I've actually completed some of these little battles in mere seconds. Sometimes you're asked to take out several different units, and sometimes they appear right in front of you, making it all too easy. Now, near the end of the storyline, I started engaging in much more difficult battles-some that, admittedly, had me frustrated and wondering what to do-but most of the game I plowed through untouched.The game's over pretty quickly, but Starfox Command offers branching paths and multiple endings, and is also one of the many games these days that takes advantage of the DS's WiFi capabilities. With a trusty wireless Internet connection, players can connect and duke it out in the Corneria skies any time of the day. The wireless battles are fun and entertaining as you'd expect them to be, after all, they're Starfox flight battles. What more could you ask for?Visually, Starfox Command is a standout as one of the more impressive DS games that runs on a 3D engine. The frame rate is almost always smooth, though it admittedly does slip up from time to time. There is a considerable amount of things moving around at all times and despite some fog issues, Starfox Command looks fantastic. It also sounds pretty good, and the standard Starfox gibberish is a nice addition-especially when you record your own voice to use in the cut-scenes!Overall, Starfox Command is a pretty successful lab rat. The gameplay holds up pretty well but it has the same old Starfox problem; the thrills are over far too quickly and far too easily. The visuals run smoothly and the presentation isn't bad. The online multiplayer is quite a service for Starfox fans who want to take on the world with their skills. Starfox makes a decent handheld landing, albeit with a few holes in its wings-it's not perfect, but it'll entertain fans of the series regardless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2006"}

Driv3r's detailed cities boast over 30-square miles of drivable roads!","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Not GTAVC, but a Fun Driving Game","reviewText":"Driv3r is an obvious offshoot of the blockbuster hit Grand Theft Auto - Vice City. Unlike Vice City's mythical city, Driv3r uses real life streets of Miami, Nice and Istanbul.While this is obviously riding on the coattails of Vice City, it would of course be a mistake to want any other game to be exactly LIKE Vice City. Why would you buy it if it was an exact duplicate? Instead, Driv3r has you as Tanner, a FBI agent stationed in Miami, going through its real streets, getting sucked into a conspiracy.The graphics are really pretty impressive. On one hand, you get a general person-model like in Vice City - reasonably good, not Splinter Cell high quality. The clouds overhead are quite nice, the shadows falling off your car and buildlings are quite impressive.The car models, as you might expect coming from a car-driving game company, are quite spectacular. They're all &quot;clones of&quot; - no real car licenses here - but they're quite nice. Even better, if a car manages to blow up, the bits that go flying are quite recognizeable as well.We found the default driving view a bit annoying - it's right &quot;behind&quot; the car so your car ends up blocking the view of what is ahead of you. We'd rather have a high-and-behind view that gives you a better look at what you're driving towards.There are a few shooting missions and a ton of driving missions, again as you might expect. The cut-scenes and plot are all nice to move the plot along. The voice talent is impressive - Mickey Rourke, Iggy Pop, etc.The sounds in general are quite well done. The engine sounds, squealing tires, ambient noise, soundtrack, all fit the mood. Again, this company has done driving games for many years. It's what you would expect.There are definitely a few bugs in this game. We were driving our car in a convoy with other cops to get to a crime scene - and the cop behind us rear-ended us and drove us into a building. There are the usual random clipping problems that you get in games like these. Also, the game really expects most players to have to replay a given mission many times to get the timing down exactly right. If you make one small mistake, you miss your opportunity and lose the mission.There are fun rewatch-the-cool-part options, making this like an action movie. Many items in your world are destructable, depending on the size of what you are driving. In a small car, you can take out the smaller light poles but not the larger ones. In a large truck, just about anything is game.If you loved the driving aspects of Vice City, or other racing games in general, then Driv3r is probably a great game for you. In addition to the missions there is free driving options and mini-games to play with.If, however, you really liked the sneak-around-and-shoot missions, you probably won't like this one. Your money would be better spent on other shooters on the market.Still, I had great fun with this game, once I accepted that it was very perfectionist-minded and required great driving skill. The more you play, the better you get, the more fun you have!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2004"}

Not only does this improve in game mechanics from the previous Oblivion entry, it shows off in visual splendor the new beautiful Nordish land of Skyrim. When exiting the tutorial beginning, the player is immediately presented the most realistic game world to date. Much like Elder Scrolls fashion, it's entirely up to the player to choose what to do next, and there is SO MUCH to do. It's amazing that the 5gb installation having ten times the amount of content compared to previous releases such as the 16+ gig installations of Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Rage.Three big improvements from Oblivion are as followed:Animations: for the first time, combat is not clunky and is very fluid now. Even magic casting looks and plays great.The UI: It's cleaner and at the same time, simple to understand with providing lots of detail. Just inspect random items and see what I mean.NPCs: Everything is officially better looking and moves less clunky. There is zero signs of that typical Oblivion and Marrowind \"plastic\" stiffness. Every animal, humanoid, and even the dragons move wonderfully.This game deserves nothing less of a perfect 10/10 even though there are obvious glitching issues that can randomly occur. I have seen weird things happen, but it never stopped me from enjoying this game. I am currently playing this game on medium, and it's still beautiful. And with that in mind, this is a game worth buying a new video card to play it in Ultra settings. I played a good portion of Marrowind and Oblivion, almost ended up liking Fallout 3 more than them.

Vendetta \"alkaline\"","summary":"Must buy for car lovers!","reviewText":"So I'm at level 21 in the game and I figured I put enough time and effort to write a review. I'm a car nut, I love cars and tweaking cars, so off the bat I love this game. I've been playing with the controller, saving up for the pedals and proper cockpit so I'm sure my love for this game will only grow when I can race properly. I will say there are some negatives to the game, but the positives out weigh the negatives BIG TIME.Some of the issues that people may hate are the shadows in this game are choppy/blocky. It's something I deal with, it is an eye sore though. But I have read that a patch can fix this issue so I'm not too upset. Another issue is load times, they suck but again, I deal with them, not crazy long, but they're there. And people will complain about the load times more even after you install the game to your PS3 and that alone takes 45 minutes. Another is from my understanding, unless I missed something, you cant customize your individual gear ratio but you can customize the whole thing, say you want more acceleration rather than top speed, you can adjust it that way. And then theres is damage that I don't find that bad. I heard a lot of people complaining about it. But from what I read the more levels you progress in the game, the more damage you unlock, weird I know, but it is there. So I'm at level 21 and I have noticed more damage then before, but I rarely crash so no biggie. Another one I hear people complaining about is the absent of cockpit view on the standard cars and the graphics on the standard cars. I will say that some standard cars don't look good but some standard cars look really good. And the premium cars obviously look gorgeous as hell. But back to the cockpit view, I don't even use it, so it's not that big a deal to me. But you get about 200 premium cars with cockpit view and damage, oh yea, damage is only to premium cars from what I understand. And people don't realize that 200 cars is A LOT then you have 800+ more cars that are just as awesome. I don't care if the standards don't get damaged or have cockpit view so I'm still happy.Now to the positives. The game looks great, really great. From the cars to tracks, to the spectators. There's a rally race that your racing at night and they have fireworks shooting off in the distance. AWESOME LOOKING. Anyway, we all knew the game was going to look great. Another plus for me is the cars, so many cars and so many awesome cars. And the sense of speed is really good. Driving a Bugatti Veyron is intense. Another plus is you seriously get your moneys worth. They have 5 or 6 sections from amateur to expert and each section has like 9 different races and and most of those races have like 3 races inside of them. Theres a lot of racing to be had. Thats just A-Spec, then theres B-Spec which is pretty much the same as A-spec but you don't race, you pretty much coach your driver, like telling him to hold that pace or overtake or pace down. Not as exciting but a cool way if you want to earn credits but have something else to do, just start the race and let your driver do it all. Then there's like special races or events. Thats where go karts and NASCAR come in. Theres a lot of challenges in there and they can get frustrating. Nascar is actually fun, not a fan, but it's enjoyable along with go karts. Also in that category is rally races which are very fun. And I read theres is some drifting in here too but I have not came across it yet. Yea I told you theres A LOT to do in this game. Then you can customize your cars like tweak the engine or upgrade exhaust or intake. Then you can paint the car or rims. Pretty fun stuff if your'e into that stuff. One thing that I have not tried is online multiplayer, I hear its really fun. You can race up to 16 players onscreen, but I've been too focused on my career mode. Theres a lot of other tiny things like head tracking, if you have a PSeye then you set it up and it'll translate where you look in the cockpit. Seen it, it looks like it works, but not sure if I'll use it. It has a course editor so you can modify tracks, played with it once, it's ok but I rather just play on the tracks already there. And to top it off. THIS GAME IS FLAT OUT FUN. The control changes for different cars obviously, it's challenging at times but in a good way. The sound of the engines are good. But I think the amount of content and things to do in this game is alone worth the price. If you have a PS3 and are into cars or racing games, PICK THIS UP. And if you love racing games and cars and don't have a PS3, but you have money to spend, GET THIS GAME. Yes there are some minor negatives, but I heard that a lot of it will be fixed through patches. Overall though, I've been glued to this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

And That's a Good Thing","reviewText":"Out of all the CoD and other shooter clones that seem to invade the shelves every year, a game that's truly different stands out; enter El Shaddai. The graphics are simply breathtaking; not in a Final Fantasy way, but in an almost metaphysical way. The combat is almost deceptively simple. It consists of pressing the attack button in various different timing combinations, which set of different combo moves which change depending on the weapon, of which there are three. You can also steal weapons from the enemy, called \"purifying\", which must also be performed every so often as evil builds up on the weapon. Anyway, I will make my review obsolete by summarizing in one sentence. On your way home, stop by your favorite video game store and buy this immediately. That is all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

Sims 2 was probably the single greatest wide interest game ever made. Appealing to everyone from 8 year old kids to baby-boomers, there was so much right about the game (ease of use, the fun of designing and building custom houses, the excellent expansion packs, the fantastic user made content, etc.) that perhaps it would be unfair to expect Sims 3 to be better than Sims 2. However, I AT LEAST expected it to be playable, and reasonably similar to Sims 2 in quality and fun. To sum up the rest of this review: It's nowhere close. It stinks. It's unplayable due to crashes (for me at least). It's a buggy, unfun, massive step backwards from Sims 2.So what makes it so bad?First off, the game crashes nearly constantly. It is not my computer. I own and successfully play dozens of computer games including the most graphics intensive on the market. (For the nerds, I have a i7 processor, 6gb ram, and crossfired ATI HD4870s). These problems are due to buggy code and terrible beta testing. This game should never have been released in this state of unfinished unplayability.They have also removed many of the things I liked best about Sims two like the ability to construct a neighborhood from scratch and then play each family and watch your Sims interact, make friends and enemies, get married to each other, etc... You are now forced to play a single family at a time. Start a new family and your old ones become NPCs (non player controlled) characters. You can never go back once you start a new one. Why EA, why? This singlehandedly ruined the game for me.Next is the drastic step backwards in ease and fun of playability. Why they decided to jack with the control mechanisms that every Sims 2 player is accustomed to, or slow time down to the point that I started falling asleep watching my Sim sleep with nothing to do in the game to keep me interested, and why EA released the game with a deplorably low number of home furnishings, I don't know. It's like a horrible nightmare where instead of games progressing and improving, they're regressing towards oblivion. The menus are just clumsy, hard to use, and so very much worse than Sims 2. If you loved the Sims 2 menus, you will HATE these.The camera is also bad, in that sort of early generations Nintendo 64 way where you can never get it to do what you want it to do with regularity. It seems to have a mind of its own, and controlling it is as frustrating as the terrible controls.Making attractive Sims is about as easy as sculpting the masterpiece David from play dough. All my Sims look fat, ugly, and just not what I had in mind. It is Uber hard to get a face the way you want it to look. It is even harder to make a nice looking Sim than the character creation system in Oblivion: The Elder Scrolls. If you like plump, slightly froggish looking Sims, you'll love it.For interior design, rather than giving you a solid and complete set of home furnishings, you are instead offered very few selections, but the ability to make them patterned. Oh joy! What I really want is about 6 options of sofas, most of them ugly, but that I can apply plaid or camouflage skins to! That's so much better than having say 12 sofa varieties right? Not so much. This strikes me as either laziness, or that EA released the game intentionally sparse so they can sell even more add on packs later. Except they missed the entire point: the reason they sold so many add on packs for Sims 2 was that the core game was so good!Overall this might be one of the worst failures in modern PC game history. Destroying a famed (even legendary) series of games like the Sims franchise by changing core elements and just doing a flat out poor job of quality control is abysmal. EA will need to heavily patch this game to make it worth playing, and by the time they do that, it might be too late.My recommendation: sell your copy on an auction site. At least then you can get back some of your money and buy something else.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2009"}

Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World will sure to be an instant classic.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Great for Fans of the Original, Otherwise...","reviewText":"Pros:+Good looking game+Fun battle system+Returning characters who do more than simply make an appearance+For the most part, good voice actingCons:-Battling can be a button mashing affair-A slow story to start-Too linear-If you haven't played the first game the plot becomes harder to understand throughout and it is just harder to appreciateWhen Tales of Symphonia debuted on the Gamecube, it became an unprecedented cult classic.  Since then there have been several Tales games to come about, but none have hit the spark Tales of Symphonia did on the Gamecube.  Fans of Tales of Symphonia will probably come to Dawn of the New World with open arms.  Newcomers, however, might do best to play the original first.Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World takes place two years after the original.  The story itself can seem a bit complicated at times.  Mostly because there are a lot of things thrown in from the first game.  In terms of being a sequel it's not bad in the sense that it brings in familiar faces who do more than just present a cameo, and that it also has you revisiting areas, but it also refers to the first game many times down the road.  Needless to say, if you haven't played the first Tales of Symphonia, some of the story just might not click right away and you might even find some of it to be a mess.  The original game had a lot to swallow and much of it you'll be expected to remember.  It also doesn't help that the story isn't all that well paced.  It takes a while for it to jump into things.  Tales has never been great about jumping into the story, but for some reason it's a bigger problem with Dawn of the New World.On the other hand, the characters in and of themselves are interesting.  You'll learn a lot about them, and familiar faces returning also helps matters along.  There are also skits that are optional side conversations that add to the story and characters.  It's easy to like the characters, and it's nice that skits are voiced this time around, unlike the original Gamecube title.Also like many Tales games, get ready for a lot of conversation and exposition.  There's some good humor within the game and most of the dialog isn't bad at all.  The voice acting is strong, for the most part, but there are some areas where it's laughable.One of the bigger differences between Dawn of the New World and the original Gamecube title actually comes from the fact that the world map completely restricts exploring.  It's now a point and click mechanic.  On one hand, considering the amount of running around you'll be doing, it's nice to have that quick and easy access.  On the other hand, part of the fun of an RPG is exploring.  The new world map system makes the game much more linear than it really has to be.When you're exploring dungeons, however, the game can be exciting.  Mainly because Dawn of the New World doesn't get rid of the battle system the Tales series is known for.  Once in battle, Tales plays similar to an action RPG where you can run up to enemies and start clobbering away.  You've also got special attacks called Artes you can use provided you have the right amount of TP.  There are times when the game can become a button mashing fest, but there are times when some genuine strategy is needed.  Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World isn't exactly an easy game.  When you're not controlling the other characters they are controlled by AI that, for the most part, does a good job.  Luckily you can issue commands and customize things if they aren't to your liking.Dawn of the New World isn't a bad looking game by any means.  It ditches the cell shaded look for something a bit more realistic.  It doesn't look quite as artsy as the first game did as a result, but it's not terrible by any means.  You'll also visit a lot of locations from the very first game that look almost exactly the same.  The same could be said of the music.  There are a couple returning tracks that are remixed but there's some new stuff as well.  Tales of Symphonia didn't exactly have memorable music to begin and Dawn of the New World isn't different in that regard either.  It's not bad music, you just won't find yourself remembering any of it.Unfortunately, Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World doesn't exactly have a massive appeal.  This is a game meant for those who enjoyed their romp through the Gamecube original.  If you've never played the original game, it might be a little harder to get a grasp on everything that's mentioned throughout the plot.  It's perfectly accessible to newcomers and they'll probably like it if JRPGs are their thing, but its hard to deny that the game is more appealing if you were a big fan of the first one to begin with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}

I was pleasantly surprised on how they did things. It is easy to get the hand of things once you play it a while. The levels are kind of bland, but if you are like me and enjoy games offline and online then it's definitely worth it.Pros--It's AVP! Its back!-Fun system to choose whether or not you would like to be an alien, predator, or human.-Unique idea for the most part-Fun online multiplayer (this will keep you occupied and on edge the whole time)-Easier learning gap then most FPS's.Cons-The graphics aren't as good as I was expecting, most FPS games have a bit better graphics but the graphics on this aren't bad don't get me wrong.-The trophy kills are horrible in multiplayer, if you do one it's a big chance someone is right behind you to do one to you (similar to the chainsaw on gears of war)-Some races need tweaked. (I felt that alien was the most powerful in all aspects of online play)-There should be a better campaign, but I'm satisfied.All in all it's a great game. I would definitely rent it to make sure you like it, or try the demo first. But if it's your thing hop in. Well worth the purchase for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

Each track has its unique challenges, ranging from crabs skittering across Shy Guy Beach to the piranha plants lurking in the quicksand of Yoshi Desert. Grab coins to max out your speed and blast your rivals with the ever-popular arsenal of red, green, and spiked Koopa shells. You'll earn points with every high-place finish, and you'll win trophies with the completion of every four-race cup. Doing well will earn you a high rating and unlock more tracks. You can compete against as many as four friends (Game Boy Advance Game Link cables required). The game features multiple scrolling planes that move in perspective as you zip through high-speed turns.","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Been there, done that","reviewText":"I realize that Nintendo excels in many video game genres. For example, Mario will probably always be the king of platform games. Mario Party will always be the must-have party game. No one has even tried to top Super Smash Bros. But Mario Kart is an exception. Sure, Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo was fun when it was the only cart racing game out there and it was a new concept. But Nintendo has done almost nothing since to improve upon its own idea.In Mario Kart Super Circuit, you will see essentially the same courses, same weapons and the same characters that you have seen in every other Mario Kart game. The courses are actually pretty short and boring. You spend a day or two playing through all the circuits to unlock nothing and after that there really is no incentive to ever play it again. If you can find some friends who have GBA's then you can have up to a four-player race. But in order to play the battle mode, which is probably the best part of the game, your friends all need to have not only the GBA but the game cartridge as well.Overall, this is a pretty sloppy effort by Nintendo. I like Mario, and I cannot seem to resist buying every one of his games, but I always want to kick myself for buying the Mario Kart games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2002"}

Yeah it is that scary. The graphics are realistic, the music is eerie and the sounds are squishy and gross but the controls are difficult with the Kinect. The game itself deserves 4 stars, but for the Kinect controls it is more like 3 1/2 stars. I found myself getting sometimes frustrated trying to get \"me\" to make even a simple turn. Maybe it is because I start hyperventilating and having panic attacks when I know I about to meet my death and I loose control of all my bodily movements. I have attempted to set the speeds of the body controls to my own setting but it does not really seem to make a difference. Maybe the more I play the better I will get. There are basic maneuvers you have to remember like keeping your arms down at specific times, hold your arms at a certain heights, don't take more than one step forward or back, etc, etc. I find myself using \"auto\" more often then I should be. Auto allows your character to walk and do things without much interaction from you. However, it won't fight battles for you.Another feature I found frustrating is the auto save, The game chooses where to save the game. You can not stop playing whenever you want and save it to start from the point again. You must begin from where the auto save last saved the game.So other than the issues with the Kinect reading my moves, the game itself is extremely unique and it shall be interesting to see what games will follow now that Rise of Nightmares has made it debut.**NOTE - Just like many others have mentioned, this game has blood, gore and adult language. Not intended for very young eyes and ears.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

I was very skeptical at first (have never been a huge fan of the 3D elements on 3DS) but it was very fun to revisit the Hyrule I've always known and loved so well.The game pits you against Gannon as always, as well as a new villain, Yuga, a sort of female Gannon who turns things into paitings and travels in the Second Dimension. This leads to Link gaining a new power that allows you to merge into walls and travel within 2D in a 3D environment. Beautiful execution overall, puzzles and dungeons were new enough to keep me entertained but the feel of the world is still the same, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who owns a 3DS or loves Zelda games. My only real complaint is that it's a tad easy, but still very enjoyable.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file.

{"product_name":"B000U34SYQ","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A solid game, in a genre where solid isn't good enough.","reviewText":"\"Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn\" (hereby dubbed \"FE:RD\") is the latest in a franchise of turn-based strategy games of the \"FE\" brand. This is my first foray into the series, and my impression is that the game really does nothing wrong. It is solid strategy, with adjustable difficulty (and a huge \"cheese\" factor - more on that later), a passable story, a decent combat engine, some good extras, etc.The problem is that turn-based strategy has been done so much better, so many other times. It is a genre that is packed to the hilt with incredible games. For example, there are the gold standards of \"Final Fantasy Tactics\" and \"Disgaea,\" as well as the less-well-known, but equally impressive \"Vandal Hearts.\" There are also unique turn-based games, such as \"Dynasty Tactics\" and \"Phantom Brave,\" which don't have the \"oomph\" of the games cited above, but carry nice innovations which manage to distinguish them from the pack somewhat.Unfortunately, \"FE:RD\" doesn't reach the upper echelon, and has no real innovation to speak of. It just...is. The story, while passable, is lackluster compared to the marvellous epic of \"FFT,\" or the humorous but immersive \"Disgaea.\" Moreover, the dialogue is annoying, and often juvenile. Since much of it is delivered via text, this forces one to actively read some bad writing.The combat engine is OK, but opens itself to criticism, particularly due to the fact that battles tend to have surprise attacks out the yinyang. In the early going, it is merely annoying, as the game will end and one simply needs to replay the battle. Later on, though, it is incredibly frustrating, as soldiers will appear from a place that should have been secure and kill your healers/spellcasters, which are gone FOREVER. I like the use of battle tactics in a game, but only when the computer plays fair.Another annoyance is the movement from map screen to battle screen. Every time I attack an enemy, I have to sit through a pointless transition to a battle screen. The time spent loading up the screen is nontrivial in the end, and adds quite a bit of unnecessary length to the game.The graphics are pretty good, but not particularly vibrant. In fact, I still prefer the pixilated goodness of \"Disgaea\" and \"FFT\" to this - the colors were bright. Here, it's not so.SO, my final review is this: \"FE:RD\" is a perfectly passable strategy game.However, for those of you who cut their teeth on the masterpieces I listed above, this will leave you wanting more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"an improvement over its predecessor, yet still has its share of problems","reviewText":"I give developer Vigil a lot of credit for not resting on its laurels when they began to work on Darksiders II. Despite the issues that I had with the first Darksiders, I enjoyed playing the first game and was able to see the potential in both the franchise and the developer. Darksiders II is an overall improvement over the original Darksiders, but in the process of evolving itself, it creates an entirely new set of issues. Thankfully, though, the game is still very fun, and well worth playing for fans of these types of hack n slash games.The greatest improvement the series has made, and the change which is most immediately noticeable, is the the new character, Death, and how he controls. The previous game had you controlling War, who was not a very mobile, nimble character and one who relied on powerful, slower attacks to dispose of enemies. Death, on the other hand, is lighter on his feet, looser, and much more enjoyable to play as. His ability to run up and across walls, grab onto ledges, and engage in various forms of platforming makes him a joy to control. The combat is a huge improvement as well. While the combat in the first game felt nearly carbon copied from the book of God of War, the combat in Darksiders II comes into its own and has begun to forge its own identity. Not quite as button-mashy as the previous game, yet not as fluid as something like old Devil May Cry games, it strikes a nice balance of accessibility, depth, and fun factor.Death's ability to scale walls has also allowed for Darksiders II to incorporate verticality into their level design, making dungeons much more explorable and fun to play. Joe Madureira's impeccable vision shines just as brightly in this game as it did in the first, with an art style that is creative and moody. And a special mention must go out to the game's musical score, which is stunning. It is varied, complex, and completely engaging. It is easily one of the best musical scores I've heard in an action game, and should be heard by everyone who is looking into a career of scoring video games.Darksiders II is a significantly larger game than its predecessor, containing a world that dwarfs the original game's in size and scope, but oddly, this is what contributes to Darksiders II's biggest problem, its pacing. Darksiders II's world seems to be large simply because it can, and unfortunately, large stretches of this world are dull and void of meaningful content. Unlike something like Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V, both games in which every square foot of the game world is meticulously thought out and crafted, Darksiders II's dungeons and overworld expanses seem larger than they need to be, and thus can become monotonous and tedious after a while. More restraint and focus would have allowed Darksiders II to be one of the preeminent action games of the PS360 era, but too often, you'll find yourself going for long stretches of time without any combat, or simply trying to figure out what areas are traversible and which ones aren't. It makes Darksiders II feel like a game that isn't sure what it wants to be.Another area of concern is the game's technical performance on the PS3. The game is packed to the gills with beautiful graphics and art, but strangely, does not allow for an installation on the PS3. The game therefore suffers from long load times, a choppy framerate, various texture pop-in, slow menus, and screen tearing. Perhaps this game was too much for the aging PS3, or maybe the developers just didn't know how to optimize the game for the console, but regardless, while performance isn't horrible, it sure seems like it could have been better than it is.Darksiders II is still a very fun game despite its flaws, and I definitely recommend it to fans of this type of game. The combat, platforming, and general navigation is far superior this time around, the art style is fantastic and the game's wonderful musical score will always keep your blood pumping. Since the dissolution of THQ, the franchise has since been pulled away from Vigil and, if it's ever resuscitated, will be in the hands of a new developer. This remains a franchise with a ton of potential, and perhaps Vigil letting go of their baby will be the best thing for Darksiders. In the meantime, we are left with two flawed, but very fun, games that will always be a genuine curiosity of their era.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

Jak has been in prison for 2 years, tortured and infused with dark powers. By the time Daxter rescues him, he's ... different ...Where the first Jak and Daxter was about bright, cheery bouncing to gather up objects, the second Jak has an older, wiser, more cynical guy. The game begins in almost a Grand Theft Auto style, with the cops chasing you down and you carjacking whatever vehicle comes by to get around town. You drive around the streets from spot to spot, getting new missions and proving yourself.The graphics are really good as you bounce, spring and roll your way across the various levels. Daxter has some really cool moves as he tags along with you. There are the normal hop-and-jump platform levels plus tank-chasing-you and other combinations of efforts.The game definitely appeals to the more mature audience of the PS2. While the first Jak and Daxter was an &quot;E for Everyone&quot; game that was more of a Super Mario game, this one is darker and more serious. It carries a rating of &quot;T for teen&quot; and isn't quite suited for the pre-teen set.There are plenty of games now for the kiddie players, so keep this one for the teen-and-up gamers. It's a more mature platform game, with themes of slums without water, torture and death.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"GameMaker","summary":"Nice game, but pay as you go?","reviewText":"I like Dragon Age Origins a lot.  I played it all weekend, got pretty far, and had a very good time doing it.  The story is very engaging, and music is superb.  The gameplay is also very strong.  I think it's saying something when you can play for 10hrs or so and not encounter a single crash or hang or any sort of technical problem with the game.  I'm impressed.  The world seems to be massive as well, which means lots of longivity.  And I'm already contemplating making a very different character to get a different gameplay experience.Now the drawbacks...1) I was really appalled by the fact that I'm playing along in the game, encounter an in-game character, and agree to do some adventuring on a little quest that he has, only to have the game tell me that I lack the funds in my online account to \"purchase\" this content.  To me that is unprecidented in a non-mmo game, and I really hate where this sort of thing may be leading.2) The character art is kind of shoddy.  The artist really has trouble with hands, noses, and ears in particular, which leads to some pretty odd looking characters.3) The game seems to be surprisingly linear.  For the first 10 hours of play or so, I really didn't seem to have all that many choices of where to go or what to do.  I felt like I was \"on rails\" (even though they were very good rails admittedly).4) The \"goody-two-shoes\" factor.  In similar games I've often felt gratified to play \"bad-boy\" characters, or at least characters who periodically chose to do anti-hero kinds of activities.  But in this game, I felt very strongly compelled to \"toe the line\".  This is because it seems like in order to achieve goals, recruit a party, and so forth, you need to be a \"goody goody\".  And I don't like that aspect of the game.Anyhow, these complaints are sort of minor in the big picture, but do keep me from considering this a truly excellent game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0009PETYO","reviewerName":"W. Scott Heitman","summary":"Perfect Rental- review from a Matrix fan and avid gamer","reviewText":"Let's get 2 things straight from the start: I play a ton of games, and I love the entire Matrix trilogy.  I'd been anticipating this game for months and shelled out 50 bucks for it a few days ago.  I don't have the game anymore...I turned it in after beating it.  Was it bad?  On the contrary, I enjoyed parts of it greatly.  However, it's more or less a 10 hour game with negligible replay value.  In addition, it has some deep flaws.  Detailed breakdown follows:Graphics:At moments, the graphics can be pretty good, but many times the game looks like absolute crap.  There were a few moments where I seriously had to wonder how the programmers let some of the really pixelated textures stay as they were.  In addition, the graphics engine feels a bit hokey...animations don't always feel as smooth as they should.  So the graphics are a mixed bag.Audio:The game has a new soundtrack and uses little to none of the original music.  Some of it is pretty good, and a bit sounds like it came from the movies.  However, most of the time, the music is very subdued and does little to enhance the atmosphere.  Music can be used in video games to make the player truly feel like he/she is engaged in an awesome situation...not here...a missed opportunity.Gameplay:The good news is this: Neo has a ton of moves.  He can do plenty with his hands...add in guns and melee weapons and it will be several hours before you've seen everything he can do.  Some people have complained about the gunplay, but I really don't understand their problem.  The gunplay worked very well: dives, targeting, and weapon switching were all expertly handled here.  Between the gunplay and the hand-to-hand combat, there are plenty of \"oh my gosh that's awesome\" moments to be had.  The problem with all of this is that it gets old.  Many games like Devil May Cry 3 and Crimson Sea 2 have incredible replay because they have a certain spark (the speed of combat perhaps) that keeps them interesting long after the battle animations get old.  Here, once you get tired of Neo's moves, there isn't much to look forward to...combat feels just a tad too slow...especially hand-to-hand.Level Design:Another mixed bag.  Most of the fights featured in the movies translate extremely well here and inspire giddy exclamations of glee.  The burly brawl and the lobby are incredible fun.  It's just that the good stuff makes up too little of the game.  The \"original\" material introduced to make the game longer has little variety and ultimately adds no new insights to the story.  Bottom line- several levels are fantastic, but most are ho-hum.Story:If you haven't seen the movies or thought the sequels were \"teh suck\", then don't bother with the story.  For those that like the trilogy, this is possibly the strongest aspect of the game.  First, between every few missions is a \"remix\" of scenes from the movies- cut by the Wachowskis themselves.  These are brilliant recutting of scenes that add irony to the original material and suggest new themes- all just by editing the existing material....brilliant.  In addition, there is a new ending to the trilogy that, thankfully, doesn't sell out on the original ending.  I won't say anymore....wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.  Suffice it to say, it is a must see for any Matrix trilogy fan.Overall:This is a game that doesn't merit more than one playthrough.  Some cheats are unlocked at the end, and there are multiple difficulties, but once you've seen everything Neo can do, there isn't any real draw to play it again.  The game simply doesn't have the intensity that many of its competitors do (DMC 3, God of War).  At 10 hours, it's a short game to only play once.  However, if you're a Matrix fan, you have to experience it.  The re-cut movie scenes and the ending especially are a must.  This, then, is a perfect rental.I will add that intend to re-buy the game once it gets to 15 bucks...the game is good enough that no Matrix completist should go without it; it just isn't worth 50 bucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2005"}

Ulreich","summary":"the best game console on the market right now","reviewText":"I am not a fanboy by any means I think all the consoles are great each one has strong points that the other one doesn't.  Its just the xbox 360 has the features I want compared to the rest. The thing that puts the xbox 360 over the top is of course xbox live.  It does cost money but its worth it compared to ps3 online service which is free and sucks hard I'd gladly shell out money for online service if ps3 had one.  As for the xbox 360 elite I mainly bought this for the 120gb hard drive.  I didn't care about the hdmi port really because my TV can't handle 1080p so that feature is kind of useless to me.  I could care less about what color it came in yes the black looks nice but I would of gotten a pro but I would of end up spending more money if I bought a 120gb hard drive add on so the 360 Elite actually saves you money on the hard drive and the extra space will be worth since they are offering xbox originals on to there live service.  This console isn't perfect by any means it has 3 flaws and easy flaws that could of been added to make this console stand out from the rest.  They call this an Elite but yet it doesn't come with no HD dvd player and built in Wifi.  I understand that most people don't have wireless internet but the other systems even the Wii that doesn't have really great online service comes with Wi-Fi built in.  The other thing is the media center, they call it a media center but I only use it for mp3s and pictures right now.  Lack of codec support is the main thing that bugs me about the 360 they make me spend $479 and it can't even play a simple mpg file or divx file.  If they finally added divx support I can finally pack up my old xbox.  I have no use for WMV nobody does please add more codec support in future updates Microsoft.  Anyway if your looking at which console to buy, buy a 360 it has the games and a video marketplace where you can download TV Shows and videos in HD and extra content for game so all in all I am happy with my purchase however I would recommend buying this at a retail store instead of through amazon it might save you money but in the long run its always better to buy through retail.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000TG72OW","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"Come now people...let's drop some of the bias please.","reviewText":"OK.Background: I am not a Grand Theft Auto fan.  I'm not clouded by this game, nor does this game \"own me\".  The only GTA games I ever beat were San Andreas (because it was just too well done) and Liberty City Stories on PSP (because it was the first PSP game to allow custom soundtracks which made the game all the more fun).  I bought this game for one primary reason: I know it'll get banned, or severely edited, and I want to make sure I have an untouched version.If you want the quick and dirty, skip to the very bottom.I decided to actually give the game a fair chance to see what the hype was about, and from there, decide whether or not the game was worth every penny I spent.I did buy the special edition from Amazon, pre-ordered the day before release date, got it today as I should have.  I was very impressed with the packaging and the speed with which I got the game; I noted some others didn't have the same success, so I feel fortunate.  Let's go down the list of special goodies, in order of worst to best (IMO).SOUNDTRACK: OK, there's over 200 tracks in the game, yet we get a 16 track CD.  Mind you, I wasn't expecting to get a full box set of songs, but why bother with a soundtrack at all if it's not going to be more than this?ARTBOOK: Very nice, but I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed.  I mean, I look at art books like those of Persona 3 and Growlanser and then I look at this and wonder if Rockstar understands how to truly wow its customers.  It's not bad at all, just not as great as I would expect.  I mean obviously a lot of art went into this game, so when I see just three  wireframes of Liberty City I have to ask myself where the rest of the drawings are.DUFFEL BAG: It's not what you think.  It's actually quite small, and thin.  Probably would suit storing stuff when you go to the gym or something.  I wouldn't rely on it for much.KEY CHAIN: It's a key chain, nothing special.  Letter \"R\" and a small star.  Good quality though, nice build, better than the one that came with Growlanser for sure, but not as nice looking.LOCK BOX: Yes, someone with a bit of strength could pop this bad boy open with a butter knife, but so what?  IT's a cool addition and a really nice concept.  (FYI, that's why the box is so big, it barely fits in there)LICENSE PLATE: Amazon says it's exclusive to them but is it really?  Dunno.  It's nice though - if California weren't so Draconian when it came to vehicles I would put it on my car.Negatives are the lack of a \"Making Of\" disc: hopefully they'll put those clips up for FREE on Xbox Live - then this is a moot point, and, as usual for GTA games, a very lacking instruction booklet.As for the game I'll just go through the various complaints people have and see if I agree or disagree.  How's that?POP-IN: Agree.  It's not bad and it's not a deal breaker, IMO.  In fact in the time I played the game I didn't notice it all that much.  It's really when you're going faster than the loading engine can keep up with, which isn't often considering most of the cars are rather slow and the traffic is dense enough that you can't speed through like you could with the other GTAs.JAGGIES: Agree.  Again, not too bad and not a deal breaker.BLURRY: Agree.  It's not as bad as people are making it out to be though.  Like in Lost Odyssey and Kameo where the entire background is blurred and it has a realistic feel to it, this is more subtle.  It's not a filter, it's more like the textures start out degraded and then slowly improve as you approach various things in the distance.  It's NOT that big of a deal, only videophiles would even notice, really.FRAMERATE: Agree.  Again, not that bad, and not nearly as much as Lost Odyssey.  There is just some slight stuttering that occurs at times, it's noticeable but not a deal breaker.MUSIC: Agree.  The selection of songs was poor this time around.  I pretty much keep going back to the jazz station because it's the only one I can really tolerate.  If you're open to indie music you'll probably find some things you like here.  Also there are some big name artists with little known songs (that aren't that great), i.e. Nas, so if you're open to new types of songs from established artists, you'll find some good stuff here.GRAPHICS: You know, I don't know why these got a 10.  Not to beat a dead horse, but I can think of at least 4 other games with better graphics just off the top of my head: Bioshock, Lost Odyssey, Gears (different art direction, I know), and Fight Night Round 3.  It's not the city, the city is fine...it's everything that's animated about the city: cars, Niko, characters, bikes, etc.  Even trees don't look that great.  And it's often hard to make out certain objects like when there's a fence or something.  Additionally, the text on the cell phone is a dark font which is hard to read against the navy green background when you're more than 5 feet away from the screen (which you should be to keep from getting nauseous while playing).OK ReV, so what's the good news?The good news might be your bad news.  To me, I like a game that sticks to a formula.  Some hate that - some love games to always change.  GTAIV sticks to the tried and true formula of the past PS2 games, with one small twist: Now you've got choices.  You can make decisions on whether you're going to help or harm someone, save or desert someone, etc.  So in a way it's taking the concept of Fable and slapping the GTA world around it, if you can envision that.  Don't know if I care for the choice part yet, but it does keep things lively.Everything else you love about GTA is here to the n'th degree.  I'm sure you heard about the fact that you can now do more...uh...'more' with the hookers, plus the various engines for gunplay and weapons have been improved.  Sadly, it's a LOT more difficult to control both Niko and the various vehicles.  With Niko, he now walks by default, and you have to hold A to get him to jog (what was the default in the previous games) and tap A repeatedly to get him to run (what was hold A in the previous games).  With the vehicles the buttons seem to have been switched around or made less effective.  I had a very difficult time just steering in the city, and I still haven't been able to power slide around corners.  It told me about handbrake controls, but I could swear I could do it with just the regular brake provided I was at the right speed, before.  I actually failed a mission because of that.So, in summary:- There are things you will need to get accustomed to.  Some things are different, some things are the same.  Some things were improved, some were a blatant step back.  It's anyone's ball game whether you'll truly enjoy the game for yourself or not.  One thing's for sure...no matter what reviews come out, no matter what reviews get posted here, and no matter what a stripper tells you, THIS IS NOT A PERFECT GAME.  It's a good game with its flaws, just like any other.  If you can accept that, you'll want to buy this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2008"}

If you have gotten to batman, you have probably played one or both of the two.  You can expect a lot of the same.  The game definitely appeals to the completists, those who are trying to find all of the pieces to the various kits, which, once you get through the game on the initial run, is pretty much what's left.  So if you like hunting for those pieces, this game will entertain you for hours and hours - it's pretty long, much longer than indy at 30 episodes, and some are quite long.  I do have to say that this game is a little easier than previous lego efforts on piece hunting (some of the red bricks are downright easy to find!) This time around, you get mostly the same two characters with suit changes/upgrades, which is a nice twist, but makes it a little crazy with free play flipping through your options.The lack of direct movie tie-in is both disappointing and charming - if you are familiar enough with the batman legacy, you will recognize chunks from previous shows and movies rather than, say indiana jones which basically follows the movies.  It lacks a real story, but seeing the various chunk smashed together in one video game is entertaining for me.The controls are not that interesting.  I find the wii batarang a little annoying to game play.After playing all three lego video games, I would recommend the star wars first, this second, and indy third, mostly due to length.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2009"}

You are Gordon Freeman who has mysteriously wound up in City 17 between a civil war against Dr. Breen and the Combine thanks to Gman. You and your sexy companion, Alyx Vance, have to reach the Citadel and take down the Combine. Instead of explaining what you already know I'll explain what's new. Nothing really. Just the achievements involved (and they are cleverly thought out). You have all the same weapons, levels, and monsters. Just sit back and enjoy the first part of the HL2 saga and you'll have the best 8-10 hours of your life. Back when the game was released I gave this game a 9.5, but due to it's age it drops half a point.Half-Life 2: Episode 1=8.5/10The Good: Evolves the story even more, great new scenarios to play throughThe Bad: Cliff hanger ending (that left us hanging for more than a year), recycled stuff from HL2, nothing new at allThe story takes off after the Citadel blew up and you now have to escape and stop the reactor before all hell breaks loose. With Alyx once again by your side, you have to push back the Combine once more. While EP1 uses the same engine as HL2 with no enhancements (literally every thing's recycled to death) you still get a great experience. Well, there is one new thing ZOMBINES FTW!!! While the game is a bit more on-the-rails-cinematic than HL2 you get more clever puzzles this time around along with some memorable fire fights. In the end if you've played EP1 on the PC there's nothing new here either, but for first timers it's a blast.Half-Life 2: Episode Two=8.5/10The Good: Some solid new content, great evolution of the story, more cinematic than ever beforeThe Bad: Still the same aging HL2 engine, another cliff hanger endingWhile this is the best HL2 entry yet with more cinematic game play, and some NEW content you'll love this one the most. After escaping the Citadel and City 17, you and Alyx must head through White Forest to her dad to stop the Citadel portal from letting loose monstrosities beyond our imagining. In EP2 we finally get new content such as acid ant lions, ant lion larvae, Combine Hunters, a new vehicle, and an evolved story. EP2's story is more touching then ever before and we finally get some background on Gman. EP2 is a couple of hours longer than EP1 and you'll want to play through it more than once.Portal=9.5/10The Good: The most clever idea since gaming itself, great next-gen graphics, cleverly thought out level design, great storyThe Bad: Short, very short, very very short, no downloadable puzzles (still), advanced challenges can be kind of impossible to solve, the cake is a lieThis is a whole new creature. Portal is the introduction of brand new technology. You are an unknown tester for Aperature Science and you are given a Portal gun which you use to solve puzzles. This is probably THE most clever puzzle game ever made...ever. You use velocity to launch yourself over obstacles, use portals to navigate through rooms, and to even move objects. The game is just so clever it really works your mind, but in such a way to where you won't get frustrated. The game has a next-gen engine and looks fantastic as well. After you beat the 3-4 hour game you can go back and beat the advanced maps and challenges for more achievements. There's nothing more that I can say than to pick TOB for just this game...it's worth the $60. The game even sports an awesome, and memorable, story that you'll joke about for years to come...THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!!Team Fortress 2=8.5/10The Good: Unique graphical style, perfectly balanced characters, and maps, can be really funny at timesThe Bad: Not nearly enough maps (still), no new characters either (still), no offline bot fragging (sorry Silver guys)I remember playing TFC back when I bought HL1 Anthology and it was a blast. TF2 sports a unique graphical style and wonderfully balanced characters to use. You all know what the characters are unless you've been hiding under a rock this whole time. You have a heavy weapons guy who is as slow as malasses in January but packs a serious punch, a spy who can disguise as the enemy, and sneak into the other side, a sniper who also sports a machete and a machine gun. This is why I love TF2 so much. Everything is perfectly balanced. Instead of being a vulnerable sniper with just a pistol you get a moderate machine gun. Instead of being a slow heavy weapons guy you get a shotgun. Instead of being a weak Pyro with a flamethrower you get a shotgun as well. If you love online gaming TF2 will keep you hooked for hours. This is just the 5th reason to buy TOB and you're bound to be happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker","reviewerName":"Sean David \"J.W.\"","summary":"Sean David reviews Onimusha:Warlords","reviewText":"When I saw this, it looked like a Resident Evil-type game, only instead of zombies, there's demons and instead of guns, you use swords. I picked this up the other day and now I'm ready to give you, my loyal fans(if I have any), my opinion of Onimusha:Warlords. Now to start off, the graphics are a thing of beauty, even if the game's about 2 or 3 years old. Backgrounds are highly detailed, character models are stunning, and the CG intro is just nothing short of jaw-dropping. Music is pretty darn good too, but the English voice-acting is horrendous. I've set it to the Japanese acting instead of the English. Controls will take some getting used to unless you're a Resident Evil veteran. Once you get the control scheme down pat, it's all gravy from there. Only other complaint is game length, camera issues(like every single Capcom survival horror game) and English acting. I will mention that Onimusha does do a few things better than most games of this particular genre do(save for Devil May Cry). One is you can block attacks, death stab an enemy once it's down, and the swords are fun to use. I know this is a reletively short review, but it's a reletively short game. Overall, I still give it a 4 out of 5. This is Sean David, signing off.Until next time,Semper Fi, Carry On.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2004"}

I followed this game for months ever since it was announced, so I will admit that my expectations were set artifically high by the hype machine.  In fact, I have to say that the hype was a little too much.  What I can very confidently say is that this game is good.  Very, very good.  It falters and stumbles in a few places, but still manages to be the best FPS on the Wii, and in my opinion the shooter with the best controls found on any platform.PROS:+++ Amazing graphics+++ 12 player online multi-player with a lot of game modes+++ Amazing, ridiculously customizable controls.+++ Voice chat support+++ Great sound supportCONS:--- Unstable frame rate at times--- Some online matches are very laggy.--- No local multi-player or co-op modes.STORY: This is probably the game's weakest point (except for Friend Codes, more on that later).  You play as Agent Ford.  You run and gun through lots of guards and aliens as Washington DC is attacked.  The game honestly looks and feels very similar to Perfect Dark (the good one on the N64, not the atrocity that poor XBox 360 customers suffered through).  Really, the game doesn't do anything particularly innovative in the storyline department, but how often can we play Humans vs. Aliens before the whole concept starts feeling cliche?  Halo, Resistance: Fall of Man, Perfect Dark, Gears of War... each are based mostly the same concept.  So is the story in this game.  It's decent for what it is.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is pretty standard FPS fare.  Fight enemies, complete mission objectives, fight more enemies, etc.  In terms of gameplay, The Conduit stays safely within the genre and doesn't venture much farther.  There are no vehicles but you get the all seeing eye, a device that finds hidden things, decodes alien writings, and stuff like that.  It functions a lot like the visors do in the Metroid Prime series.  Weapon designs are diverse, but nothing really new or noteworthy shows up that hasn't been done before in the genre.  In terms of design of the gameplay elements, The Conduit plays it safe and sticks to tried and true methods that have worked for many FPS games that came before it.GRAPHICS: Best looking FPS on the Wii.  Some environments look kind of plain, but everything looks crisp and sharp.  Bump mapping, super nice water effects, motion blur, particle effects, and dynamic lighting are all present.  The downside is that sometimes the frame rate takes a nose dive at times, most notably during multi-player.  The Wii is really getting pushed hard by this game, which is nice to see a developer take the time to make sure a game actually looks good.  It doesn't beat graphical shine of Halo or Gears of War, but this game definitely belongs to this generation of first person shooters.AUDIO: Very good.  Some very clever music was written, my favorite so far being a techno mix that repeatedly announces the baggage guidlines for carry-on luggage while you're blasting soldiers in an airport.  The voice acting in the game is also done quite well.CONTROLS: Simply amazing.  Nearly everything can be customized to your taste.  Button layout, controller sensitivity, and bounding box are completely customizable.  PC gamers have had this luxury for a long time, but even many PC games don't even approach this level of customization.  The Conduit has raised the bar.  Hands down, this game controls better than any other FPS that I have ever played and I actually like it a little bit better than mouse-and-keyboard on PC.  Also, although it isn't part of the controls, the player can also customize the HUD, moving ammo counters, health meters, and whatever else to their liking.  Seriously, I have never played anything that gives me this much control.  Every game ever made for every console should immitate this level of customization.MULTI-PLAYER: Really good, but it has some flaws.  The conduit offers 12-player matches and a respectable number of game modes make this a must have for competitive gamers on the Wii.  And if you happen to own a Wii Speak peripheral that just collects dust, The Conduit supports voice chat!  When online matches work (which is usually), this really is the best the Wii has to offer.  Matches seem to set up fairly quickly, usually within a minute or two, which isn't bad considering every match I've played has been at least 10 minutes long.  As you play, you gain experience and gain ranks, which is a nice way of showing off to other players how great you are at the game.  Sometimes matches are very laggy, but you can exit the match and find a smoother one usually.  The lobby uses a voting system to set up the game rules, which is nice and seems unbiased.Here's where the online experience falls apart.  Friend codes.  Without exchanging Friend Codes, you don't get the benefit of voice chat, which really hurts team play in a big way, especially if you are playing with strangers.  Additionally, lets say I play randomly against someone online, decide that they are pretty cool, and I want to add them to my friend list. You aren't allowed to do that.  Instead,  I have to find some way to track them down in real life and then we have exchange the cumbersome string of numbers.  I understand that the idea is to protect children from online predators, but my opinion is that children probably shouldn't be playing a game this violent in the first place.  There is nothing friendly about Friend Codes.  EA has a much better matchmaking and online experience with their service that just bypasses the use of Friend Codes altogether (Medal of Honor: Heroes 2 is a great example).for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {print(\"I hate friend codes! \");}I must apologize for the anti-friend code rant and beating a dead horse, but it really bothers me with this particular game since the experience could have been so much better without that extra hassle.  With as much effort that was obviously poured into the online elements, it is a crying shame that some people will probably give up on online play because of the clunky friend code system and a lack of a sense of online community.  Basically, the online multi-player rocks, but it isn't a perfect experience.  As many complaints as I have about the online play, this is still probably the best online offering the Wii has to offer.REPLAY VALUE: Very high.  The emphasis on multi-player really pushes this game over the top.  The single player mode is pretty short, but entertaining.  An achievement system is included which gives completionists the incentive to keep replaying previously beaten levels.So, my final verdict is that every Wii owner who is serious about first person shooters should buy this game.  The controls are amazing.  While online play isn't as complete or as smooth as many XBox Live offerings, this game steps up to the plate and offers the hardcore crowd something to be excited about.  This game definitely showcases what the Wii is capable of and really proves that up until this point, all of the other developers pushing games out on the Wii by the truckload to shame.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2009"}

Its not spectacular but for all intents and purposes it delivers its promise of excellent controls. The story is not particularly great and I think in that department it could of used some more work. The voice overs were quite nice as they brought in Kevin Sorbo and he did a good job.The single player campaign is extremely short. If you want to extend your time in single player get out your ASE and start scanning for hidden symbols and the such and you will be able to unlock achievements like concept art and cheats for the game.There is something else the Conduit does right other than nailing IR aiming down to perfection and thats they actually know how to make a good looking game. The Conduit has some flashy graphics and they really do look good and the only thing that hurts the graphics is the sometimes bland level design.Unfortunately the online multiplayer is going to be great to some and decent to others. I was plagued with this glitch/bug where I kept loading into walls upon the first match. Now its not all a big fuss as you can do one of two things and that is wait for the match to be over or you can turn your Wii off and try again. I usually just wait it out as I am patient. There was a rumor that the Wii 4.2 upadate fixed this glitch but as of Nov. 9, 2009 I still experience this problem. Since I am plagued with this nearly every time I go online it does hurt the overall score as I have no other problems running any games online for the Wii. At the same time though its not a total game breaker for me because they have some good online modes and a few good maps.Overall I think the Conduit could of used a little better level design to show off there flashy graphics and I feel this way because its not HVS first FPS but it is there first FPS on the Wii. I do not mind linear gameplay as long as its fun and the Conduit is fun but the replay value only comes in small doses for me. I play this game online maybe once a month and thats for an hour or so.Note this is an edited review. Disregard the June date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2009"}

These days, who really hasn't imagined what it would be like to be a Club DJ spinning tunes to keep the crowds on their feet, dancing the night away?  \"DJ Hero\" manages to fulfill that scenario with a unique controller that attempts to emulate the DJ turntable experience along with a snazzy presentation that is in line with the whole night club/raver vibe.  The song selection for the most part is decent with a predominant mix of well known cuts ranging across a variety of genres (Hip Hop, Techno, New Wave, Pop, R&B;, Classic Rock, etc) and while the presentation is better than average I felt that it still had a 'Guitar Hero' look to it and could have used further enhancement to really distinguish this game, visually, from other titles.The gameplay itself is ok.  There is a really helpful tutorial to explain the basic gameplay mechanics so be sure to start off with that.  At the easiest level most people can tear through the tracks as their is no cross-fading and a limited amount of scratching and effects.  Medium will provide an adequate level of challenge to seasoned music game vets while the Hard difficulty will provide a real challenge.  My biggest issue with the game has to do with the controller itself and the imprecision of the cross fading, specifically that there is no discernible center groove to snap the fade back into.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil.

After Super Mario 64 blew everybody away in 1996, the only direction Nintendo could go for Mario is up. Super Mario Sunshine is proof - Literally, since it was the follow-up to 64. Is it as amazing? Probably not, but I would be lying if I didn't say this is one of the best Gamecube platformers (if not one of the best Mario games) ever!Super Mario Sunshine basically did what Mario 64 did and boosted everything up in scale. The levels are extremely well-crafted and fun to play around in, the graphics are incredibly colorful and fresh, and the soundtrack is a whole new selection of memorable Mario music! Even better, we now have new toys to play with in the gameplay department - Not only is Yoshi back (albeit with a downgrade), but you also get a FRICKIN' WATER PACK! This thing's name is F.L.U.D.D., and it drastically changes the way you play Sunshine for the better.You'll be squirting water to wash away graffiti M's, stunning enemies or attacking them, against bosses, wash out goo, etc. It doesn't sound too fun at first, but the result is truly satisfying, especially when you get to run around and shoot, as well as go into second-person view to shoot more precisely on certain occasions. The control is remarkably fluid, as Mario feels as acrobatic as ever. He can even use F.L.U.D.D. to hover in the air with water, leading to fun platforming moments by itself.When I say the levels are fun and well-crafted, I mean they are FUN AND WELL-CRAFTED. Every bit of these worlds contains memorable set pieces, so you can't get lost, and there's always something unique in various portions! Plus, the places themselves are brand-new to the Mario universe - You'll be fighting ghosts in a hotel, collecting Red Coins at an amusement park, and even ride squids at a harbor!Pretty much the only thing I have my concerns with is Bowser. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I'm gonna let you off with a warning - Fighting Bowser is not nearly as grand as in any other fight in a previous Mario game. It's rather disappointing, considering how everything else in the game is so great, but it doesn't diminish the fact that this game is an overall everlasting Gamecube treat! If you're a Mario fan, you can't live without this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Gaming Fan xbox","summary":"First time player of Ocarina of Time.","reviewText":"First time playing the game, so I'll be reviewing it without any nostalgia factor. The game is pretty good so far. I'm about 10 hours in and the game plays well for the most part. My only complaint about this game so far is the camera and gyro controls. The camera sometimes just doesn't work. When you hit the L to lock on, sometimes it turns you into the other direction and your facing the completely wrong way. It made fighting the 3rd dungeon boss pretty hard because you had to battle the Boss from a distance and hit him with your boomerang. I wish the 3DS had a second analog stick, that would eradicate this problem entirely. The gyro controls are something else to be desired. Bringing you out of the 3D field of vision most of the time, I've been finding myself playing most of the game now in 2D.The graphics are nice on this update. Runs in a nice 30FPS per second, though some framerates drops do happen when you are up against multiple enemies. The cool particle effects are really nice. The 3D really works well when you are not using the GYRO controls. Stuff will fly out of the screen. It's the best 3D title to date on the 3DS. Some slight ghosting does occur while in dark areas. Where you will see 2 images of Link or whatever object is on the screen. It's only minor, but it's still noticeable when playing.The gameplay is almost perfect. The camera lock on problem has dropped this just a tiny bit for me, but it's still a very solid game. I'm really enjoying what I've played so far, and I'm 10 hours in and about 1/3 of the way through! Zelda is going to be a very long game!Overall, if you haven't played this game yet, like I had, I'd advice picking this up if you have a 3DS. It's the best the system offers right now, and it's really deserving of your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}

Rhodes","summary":"Just as good as the original","reviewText":"Soul Caliber II is nearly flawless.  Unlike most sequels, Soul Caliber II doesn't try to go above and beyond its prequel, instead it borrows and repeats many elements insuring that those who liked the first one will like this one.Soul Caliber on the Dreamcast was considered to be a flawless fighter...not only that but was considered the greatest fighting game of all time by many.  Where as most sequels try to out do their prequel, Soul Caliber II does not.  Instead, it kept the same gameplay elements from the first one.New levels are introduced in Soul Caliber II, and all the old characters from the first one are back with the same moves, weapons and the like.But perhaps too much was taken from the prequel as far as gameplay goes.  Many of the animations are about the same as they were in the first one.  While the costumes are different and it isn't quite as easy to Ring Out someone, a lot of the gameplay has this &quot;Rinse and Repeat&quot; thing going for it.Graphic wise, Soul Caliber II doesn't disapoint and you'll love the animations.  The first one had amazing graphics as well but Soul Caliber II doesn't go overboard on the graphics. They're better thant he first one but don't get that much better.  Still, the graphics are nice eye-candy.Link is the hidden character in this one and is without a doubt one of the strongest characters. Whether Namco did that intentionally or not is beyond me but all the consoles have hidden characters that are amazingly strong.Gameplay is more or less the same as I mentioned. You've got your kicks, punches and grabs.  With the graphic engine it's amazing to see a lot of these moves and combos get pulled off. There are plenty of different modes as well.  An arcade mode which is pretty much like playing it in the arcade, the VS. Mode which I shouldn't need to explain.  There is also a classic VS. Mode and that's for those who want to get all those fancy new weapons.There are survival modes and deathmatch modes too.  There is so much to do in Soul Caliber II that it'll take you a long time to get it all done. So this isn't a fighter you can complete in one sitting.The major con with Soul Caliber II as far as I can see is that eventually you'll grow tired of playing alone.  It's fun to bring in a friend to play against.  Alone Soul Caliber II becomes pretty boring after a while and eventually it'll come down to the point where you'll only want to play it if it's against someone.Overall Soul Caliber II is a game that should please any fighter.  It's a fun game and if you liked the original there is no reason why you shouldn't like this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"It's Final Fantasy, just not quite as good.","reviewText":"Well, you'd expect that on the GBA, the graphics and sound would be sub-par, but the voices in this game are more limited than in Metroid Fusion.  Still, that doesn't take much away from the game itself.  Most of this game's problems spring from the storyline and gameplay quality.First off, this entire game is spent, not only in turn-based battles, but in turn-based movement from place-to-place, as well.  For those who like to be able to move in something resembling real-time, you would be wise to look elsewhere.The second problem with the gameplay is that it is uproariously difficult to gain experience once you reach a certain level, because after a while, the enemies only give you 1 experience each.  I eventually had to force my characters to attack one another to get any sort of experience.Now the story problems.  Unlike most Final Fantasy games, which immerse you in the world, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance only slingshots around the upper atmosphere of the world before returning you forcibly to cold, hard reality.  The chocobos, moogles, monsters, magic, castles and so forth are all fake.  Illusions.  They don't really exist, and because of that, this game feels more like you're playing someone else's Final Fantasy game, rather than living in a Final Fantasy world.  The &quot;real&quot; world of the game is just like ours, and I find that to be most disappointing.  What's worse, when you return to the &quot;real&quot; world, the fake Ivalice vanishes completely.It just felt wrong that none of the strange things in the game should be real.  It didn't feel like Final Fantasy.  It felt more like Earthbound.On top of that, the game suffers from a terminal case of Themaincharacterisanobnoxioushatefulbratitis.  The character of Marche is a person who does things based on some unfounded moral belief, never once questioning that what he wants is right, and entirely willing to go directly through his friends and family to get it.  That's the sort of thinking that brings about religious fanatics, and in my mind, it hurts a game to have a character whose attempts at soul-searching are limited to &quot;I need to convince myself of this.&quot;  Even the ending is bittersweet.Still, it's Final Fantasy, and although it's possibly the worst Final Fantasy I've played so far, it's still far better than most of the games for a less lucky system like, for example, the Gamecube.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2004"}

It is a perilous path &#x2013; one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region. In addition to Ezio's award-winning story, the acclaimed online multiplayer experience returns, refined and expanded, with more modes, more maps and more characters that allow players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Assassin's Creed Continues To Evolve And Impress...if you ignore den defense, which IS possible","reviewText":"First things first -If you haven't played the first Assassin's Creed and subsequent releases (or at LEAST starting with II, and going forward) - go no further. Do yourself a service and start with II as a bare minimum and work yourself forward to this, the 3rd in the Ezio Auditore trilogy. Otherwise, you'll be completely lost.For those of you familiar with the story, you're going to find Ezio Auditore in his twilight years on a quest to find Altair's legendary, yet quite well-protected, library. The Templars have caught wind of it and Ezio is also trying to find his way in to thwart their attempts at worldwide control. This is hardly a spoiler as you're quickly brought into this within minutes of beginning to play Ezio - no further spoilers here.From the standpoint of playing all of the previous Assassin's Creed entries, how does this one fare? Well, I finally played it tonight and I must say that it is really quite remarkable. There's a major change in the way that combat is handled - you select a primary and then a secondary weapon so that you can enter a sword fight and then throw knives at will, for example (no longer do you have to constantly \"weapon wheel\" between sword and throwing knives constantly). Graphic engine has been updated and it's quite smooth; I don't find it stuttering nearly as often as it used to. Even the story itself has been given a facelift - now there's more of a cohesive, unified story rather than a series of seemingly disjointed events culminating in your goal in the first place of killing \"x\" person because he did \"y\". \"Eagle vision\" also has some significant improvements, some subtle and some not. For example, in addition to identifying enemies, you'll actually see faint red lines indicating a guard's patrol route. This enhances the formulation of tactics. In other cases, where smoke bombs are even more effective at obscuring your enemies' ability to attack you, \"eagle vision\" will actually allow you to pierce the cloud and attack your enemies at will. In addition, you will be collecting materials to craft a variety of different bombs (lethal and non-lethal). The animations of Ezio kill moves are superb and some of his abilities show that Ezio, in his twilight years, is deadlier than ever. The music, as always, is very well-done and the voice acting is even better than usual. The beginning of the game reminds me of Matrix Revolutions, but I do mean this in a good way.The environments are breathtakingly beautiful. The game has departed from Italy and finds itself in Constantinople, once the true crossroads of the world between Europe and Asia when the United States was still a mere 264 years away from declaring its own independence. Ezio finds himself with new equipment (the hook blade is fun opening a variety of attacks as well as an ability to zip line around your environment - fantastic!), friends (including a romantic interest), and actually enters into the conflict politically - it's no longer a mere Templar/Assassin conflict. There are layers to appreciate here as Ezio makes an ally and as I am starting to delve into it, I truly appreciate what Ubisoft has created here.If there is one thing that I have to complain about, it's the mode where you have to defend your own Assassin's Keeps in addition to creating them for those of you familiar with Brotherhood. It becomes a \"tower defense\" game at this point...and I don't mean that in a flattering way. It's one thing that Ubisoft could have omitted (or seriously improved upon) without impacting the story whatsoever. It comes off as a silly gimmick that didn't appear to have been given a significant amount of thought in terms of how it flows with the rest of the interlocking parts. This is an oprhan 301st piece in a 300-piece puzzle; it doesn't fit and, quite honestly, you don't really need it to complete the experience.I haven't had a chance to explore multiplayer too much, but what I've seen so far seems to indicate that Ubisoft has taken the best parts of Brotherhood and have added both modes and additional customization not seen before. I'm more into the story then the multiplayer, but Revelations has shown me enough to convince me to give it a try...later. Assassin's Creed is still, first and foremost, about continuing a quite fascinating story. And the final chapter to the overall story arc (with Ezio's presumably ending here, if rumors are believed) is to come in yet a single year, although how Ubisoft plans to bring this epic to a conclusion in the absence of such a strong character like Ezio has my curiosity piqued.Despite the fault of \"tower defense\", everything else is so vastly improved that I still have to give it a solid 4.75 stars (5 stars on the Amazon scale - don't think it deserves a 4). Enough said - get it and enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

The newest Castlevania game takes both and throws them out a window.Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, like most newer games based on a classic franchise has decided to move away from the side scroller format of yesteryear, to a 3D &#34;roaming&#34; setting. This gives the player more freedom, and gives them a sense of discovery while traversing and exploring their new surroundings. Plus, it&#8217;s kind of expected nowadays.On top of the new roaming setting, the game series got injected with an extra dose of jaw dropping graphics, that rival most games currently out.Let me be blunt, and address the elephant in the room. Yes, C:LoS is a clone of the God of War game series. In fact, someone not really paying attention to what you are playing, could be forgiven for thinking it was God of War III. So, if you hate the God of War games, I am pretty sure you will hate this game. It&#8217;s kind of a given.There are a few issues I have with this game. The first, and the biggest is the difficulty of the game. Instead of gradually increasing in difficulty, allowing you to get comfortable with the controls, C:LoS just decides to let it rip! Thankfully the first boss is easy, but since he&#8217;s a tutorial boss, that&#8217;s to be expected! After that, your next boss is fairly simple, and not too much of a complaint. The third boss however, is extremely difficult! Now, for people who have played God of War, it might be simple enough, but you&#8217;ve had three 6(counting the PSP games) games to adjust to those gameplay mechanics. It&#8217;s like the developers just expected people to have already played GoW, and they feel they don&#8217;t need to slowly train you.Controls of the game, again, an almost exact copy of GoW, so if you are used to it, you will do fine. For me though, I had an issue with the camera controls, or lack there of. This particular issue displeased me even in the GoW games as well. If I want to turn my camera around and look behind my character, I should be allowed to!Don&#8217;t get me wrong, im not saying it&#8217;s horrible! It has Patrick Stewart doing a voice in there, how could anyone say anything bad about it?What I am saying however, is that the game wasn&#8217;t that enjoyable for me. Some people will love the game to no end. Others? Not so much. It's a flip of the coin really.However, on the upside, the GoW games are insanely popular, and are playstation exclusives, which means Xbox only owners never had the honor to experience this ground breaking game series. So, since C:LoS is multi-platform, Xbox owners now get a chance to experience something similar to GoW.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Schwe1nehund","summary":"Modern Meh.","reviewText":"Give credit where its due so I'll get the good out of the way first: as a shoot-em-up experience, Modern Warfare 2 is good. Very enjoyable as far as the gunplay is concerned. Tight controls coupled with a fun array of weaponry is sure to delight any shooter fan. With sharp-looking graphics and good sound, the action is non-stop. But nearly everything else about the game is one big pile of Fail.Story: What story? Early COD games had really interesting narratives. Even the first Modern Warfare had an entertaining story - missions progressed in a sensible manner. Too much of Modern Warfare 2's mission progression relies on leaps of faith - urging the player to accept one set-piece action sequence after the other for the sake of blowing shhtuff up. It is worth repeating that the set-pieces aren't necessarily bad! I liked the locales and the action, but JEEBUS gimme a coherent story. Peering underneath the mess at the core storyline you get the sense that the writers had a decent Tom Clancy-ish concept, but either they were under too much pressure from the publisher to rush the product out the door or they all collectively suffered from the Lucas Effect. By the Lucas Effect I mean that they realized Modern Warfare 2 was to the other Call of Duty games what the Star Wars prequels were to the original trilogy; You could put out garbage and still make enough money to rival a small nation's GDP. Great job with the marketing Activision. Seriously.Gameplay: Third time repeating myself, but its not that bad. While the controls and core mechanics all feel very refined - all the other elements do not come together well enough for me to write home about. Its the same old stuff under the same old engine (more on this later). a mad rush of enemies - you'll hug the ground or the nearest cover like white on rice. One thing IW: its been almost 7 years since we first realized that you guys love grenades - time to tone it down a little.Graphics/Game Engine: They're quite good! Actually there are three aspects which are flawless: the lighting/shaders, animation/motion-capture and the incredible texture work. While all this is well and good, I've come to expect more and more out of shooters ever since Crysis - especially where physics is concerned. MW2 feels too static and too on-the rails in certain parts. With all the firepower we get to lug around, it'd be nice to see some permanent and procedurally-generated destruction. And gibs. Gibs are good.Sound: PHENOMENAL! with a good surround system, this game is an orchaestral ballet of whizzing bullets and tense radio chatter. The music is a step below what Modern Warfare offered, but in no way is it bad. The music ranges from dramatic action suites to truly emotional notes - especially when you witness things like Washington DC en flambe.Multiplayer: This is where the game fails completely - and I'm repeating what many others have already written about. For a game whose campaign is over in a ludicrous 4 to 5 hours, you expect a tonne from the multiplayer. At least an experience that rivals the original, even if it doesn't surpass it. Sadly, with the numerous restrictions and downgrades, MW2 will just leave you angry that you spent 60 dollars on it. For the PC that is unjustified. Not when fantastic games like Dragon Age Origins that can easily take 75 hours to finish are available for about 39.99. Okay so I'm comparing apples to oranges. If multilplayer is your thing, do yourself a favor and either wait for Bad Company 2 (which looks much more promising) or grab a copy of Left 4 Dead 2, which is oodles of fun.Bottom line: I hope this is a misstep that Infinity Ward corrects with the inevitable Modern Warfare 3. They've made some remarkable shooters in the past. For 60 bucks I, at the very least, expect a campaign that lasts longer and a multiplayer component that doesn't feel like a downgrade. Also, they need to work on the story. The jump from the Taskforce 141 missions to the all out US invasion was so ridiculously paper-thin its not even funny. It pains me to say this but Modern Warfare 2 is more than a little overhyped.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Pokemon Black/White","reviewText":"The DS is dead. Face it. With the 3DS less than three weeks away, Pokemon Black/White seem like the system is saying goodbye with one final great game.Pokemon Black and White are all-new. You won't see any old Pokemon, and this is good, as it allows for more strategizing than just re-using your old teams from past games. You start back at Route 1, and it's all new from there. Surprisingly, B/W actually have a story, and it involves Team Plasma, and they delve into Pokemon morality and if keeping them trapped in Poke Balls is the right thing. It's a really touchy topic, and as you delve deeper into the game, Team Plasma attacks you at every team and makes you re-think yourself. It's a nice new twist for a Pokemon game.Although the story is new, the gameplay isn't. It's tried and true Pokemon formula. You're still a young Pokemon trainer, hoping to rise the ranks, beat the gym leaders, and eventually become the Pokemon master. It's formulaic, but that's because it works. There are significantly new changes to the gameplay, as well. You actually have friends now, and they show up a lot, and you can challenge them and chat whenever you'd like. The battles are basically the same, except your Pokemon move now! New gameplay features include triple battles and rotation battles, and these all offer new strategies than just the old 1 v 1 battles. The Unova Region is one of the coolest regions in Pokemon yet. The cities feel fresh, and all the locations and things to do are really unique. There are also subtle new changes such as the merging of Pokemon Centers and PokeMarts, making for one easy stop for all your needs.This brings us to the graphics. The game looks great, and there are some phenomenal sequences aboard bridges that really take full use of the DS's hardware capabilities. That being said, the battles look bad, and the Pokemon are downright ugly. They're so uncreative, and have ridiculous names. I know there's only a certain amount of Pokemon that can be made before you have to resort to this, but, come on, these Pokemon are hideous. The same can't be said about the soundtrack, and it offers catchy Route tunes and new city music reminiscent of Diamond and Pearl's tunes.The multiplayer this time around has been completely revamped, and instead of having a huge building to do all your global trading/battling needs, you have the C-Gear. The C-Gear goes on the bottom screen and you can do almost every Wi-Fi function with it: trade, battle, look at records, you name it. This makes it much easier than having to go to a Pokemon Center, and you can also now trade Pokemon in your PC, instead of having to leave the room and restock Pokemon to trade.Pokemon Black/White are a refreshing new take on the same old Pokemon formula. They're great for beginners starting on square one, and they're great for seasoned players looking for a new spin.Pros:New Gameplay ElementsA story!!Fantastic SoundtrackCons:Ugly PokemonPassable GraphicsOverall: 9.0/10.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}

Included on the disc are over 5,000 questions ranging from music, to movies, sports, and more.  Put your knowledge to the test as you play with up to 8 friends - buzzing your way to game show stardom!","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Fun game if you have people to play with","reviewText":"Buzz Quiz TV is a trivia game for 1-8 people (for 8 person play you will need a separate set of buzzers as this box comes with only 4 wireless buzzers). Think Jeopardy on steroids and interactive.The game is played using the \"buzzers.\" The main red button is used for selection of items on the menus and in a couple of the actual quizzes. For the most part, the quizzes require you to push the colored buttons, each button corresponding to an answer on screen.One really fun option you have available is the couch vs couch on-line option. You can play 4 people at your house and 4 people at someone else's house anywhere that Buzz Quiz TV is being played by someone who is connected to the Internet. It is a nice addition to the game.There are 5000+ questions included (so the manual and game box says). The best part about this? When you run out of 5000+ questions that are built into the game, you can jump on-line and download user created quizzes, so essentially you have a game that has the potential to be upgraded endlessly. When I was connected to the Internet I believe the currently available downloadable user created quizzes was just under 8000. That's a lot of extra quizzes to use (I'm not saying these quizzes will be as good as the originals, but they are there for expandibility).I played with 2 other people and we all had a good time playing. The questions aren't terribly difficult and a general knowledge is a bonus. On-line in couch vs couch has proven to be fun as well, if not a little awkward at first.The buzzers are relatively cheap feeling. They don't feel like they will break on you, but they don't have a high quality feeling either. Also, realize that each wireless buzzer requires 2 AA batteries that are NOT included in the box.One aggravating part for me is the manual. Here you have these new controllers and nowhere in the game manual do they explain how to set them up; they just assume you'll know or as it says in the manual, you are directed to look at the manual for the devices. The \"device manual\" was NOT in my box. Thankfully I am electronics savvy and it was simple to figure out, but for some of the more technically challenged, this lack of device manual could be quite a set back.If your box doesn't come with a manual for setting them up, all you need to do is:1) Install batteries into every Buzzer you wish to use2) Power on Buzzers using switch on the right hand side (assuming you are looking at the top of the Buzzer; the side with all the buttons)3) locate the USB stick included in the box4) pull the cap that covers the USB connector off the stick5) insert USB stick into any open connector (should be on the front of the PS3, below the disc slot)6) power up the system7) Insert game discOther than the lack of manual, I am pretty happy this game. The only real caveat is one of single play. If you are buying this game for single player, do yourself and DON'T. The single player game, while essentially the same as the multiplayer, lacks the type of fun required for the $60 investment. If you want to play alone, wait for the price to drop to $30 or less as otherwise I don't think you'll enjoy it enough to justify the cost. If you like playing on-line and are alone at your house/apartment/wherever, on-line play is just as enjoyable, or mostly as enjoyable, as multiplayer when you have people in the same room with you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

Everything about this story had such a nostalgic feeling to it.  I am really glad I got to replay this game, and I hope all gamers give this game a chance.Pros1.  The story and the soundtrack are awesome.  I really enjoyed the soundtrack this time more then last time because I guess I am older and I feel what the music is expressing with the characters, and the mood of the situation as well.2.  The boss fights are fair in this game, but I forgot how hard chocobo breeding is lol.  I also forgot how hard the ruby and emerald weapon were in this game.3.  I actually like Aeris the most in this game.  I loved her goofy and flirty personality in this game.  She became my favorite character in this game, and then I would say Nanki was my second favorite lol.Cons1.  The graphics are dated, but a good story comes before great graphics.  Final Fantasy XIII is prime example of great graphics and a terrible story.  A great story is more important.Overall this is great game to pick up again just to see your favorite FF characters :).  Anybody new to the series I recommend playing this one first or FF 12.Game On.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

Even though this was a game on rails, it was still hard,yet fun to play.  You have to have pinpoint accuracy to pull off a headshot.  When you finally learn what angle works best for you, it is very satisfying.  Other than that I had no problems with the controls.  Some of the bosses were really difficult.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"You only live twice (with a million deaths in between)","reviewText":"Well, these are exaggerations on both counts but... you get the idea.I do not consider myself a hard core gamer but there were a few grand games that I played hard and long on the PS3: Oblivion, Fallout, Grand Turismo, Demon's Souls. Of these, Demon's Souls was the only Platinum I've ever earned and it clocks at over 500 hours of pure fear, strong anxiety and intense frustration punctuated by brief moments of pride and joy brought by the hard earned sweet victories.I started talking about Demon's Souls because to us, PS3 gamers, Dark Souls is NOT the first coming of unspeakable terror onto our consoles. Dark Souls is the SECOND coming. And what a visitation this promises to be :)Okay, here it is, after the first few hours. I am going to post updates (not spoilers) as I progress through the game.THE COMMONSDeomon's Souls has many, never-seen-before, amazing innovations. We hoped and we expected to see most of them again on 'chapter two' and Dark Souls does not disappoint even though Dark's seems to be a Universe unrelated to Demon's. It's not even a parallel Universe (I like to think of parallel Universes as those in which the other fellow Dark Souls players exist - if running around as a hollowed-out soul you can call 'existence'. It's a different world but a lot works in seemingly familiar ways.Here's what I would call the Demon's heritage:- One-save only. And this is a BIG thing because the game saves itself every couple of seconds. Once you get hurt or you hurt someone you didn't mean to you can't go back to the previous save because there's no such thing. Unless you have one hand on the power cord ready to pull it, everything you do has consequences and you can't go back and try again. Be VERY careful when you talk to them merchants or blacksmiths because one unintended slap and they will never deal with you again.- Human vs. Soul form. Can't be invaded by other players while in Soul (Hollow) form. As a Human you can invade other words, help others, seek help.- Classes. You pick yours from 10. Not exactly the same as in Demon's though.- Stats. Again, 10 different categories, some differently named, some totally new like 'humanity' and 'attunement'.- The ability to seek help and to help others. I believe that you can have up to 3 others helping.- The Stones. They are of different colors but they have uses not unlike the Demon's stones, possibly more: to seek help, to leave messages, to invade.- Souls as currency of the land and the price price you must pay to level up. And you lose them all every time you die so... use them (buy, uplevel) before you lose them.- Every time you rest all non-boss enemies respawn.- The ability to play nasty and invade other players' worlds.- Blood stains. You can see how others died.- Second (and ONLY second) chance. You can recover lost souls if you can touch your own blood stain before you die again.- Messages. Can leave messages but don't expect to be able to type away detailed clues. You pick your message from a pre-approved list.- Incredibly precise combat. Each class of weapons acts differently and you can see/feel the difference between hitting flesh, bone or armor.- Uchigatanas!!! Need I say more? These are by far the coolest katanas you'll ever swing in any game and probably the best you can get through this one at least through mid-game. Demon Souls most terrifying black phantoms (invading players) where the 2-Uchigatana dudes. Most, possibly all of the Demon's weapons can be found in Dark: Claymores, Halberds, Clubs, Axes, Estocs and so forth.- Practice makes perfect. Like Demon's Souls, this is a struggle for perfection because in most instances only perfect or near-perfect attacks and defenses will save you from yet another horrific death.- Continues the Deomon's tradition of no difficulty levels. Like its predecessor, there's only one difficulty level on Dark and that's 'very easy', as in 'very easy to get yourself killed'. Seriously, for anyone who played Demon's, Dark feels like the second or third playthrough only you start at a low level, have no weapons or armor and find yourself in completely unfamiliar territory now so it takes a little bit of dying, observing and experimenting before your learn the ropes.THE DELTAS (new and never seen before)This, I'm sure, is going to be a growing list and I'm going to update it as I progress into the game. If what's going on in this game can be called 'progress'.- One-world design. This appear to be a huge world but gates, bridges and passes are all well guarded so be prepared to shed a lot of blood and die a lot to earn your right of passage. Unlike Demon's which had a hub that was the only connection between the several separate 'worlds', Dark's world regrions are very much interconnected and much of the fun and mystery is your gradually discovering and unlocking sometimes secret doors and passages.- The healing system. The role of 'grasses' is drastically reduced (there are some mosses that you can still use to cure ailments) but Dark doesn't make it as easy when it comes to your ability to recover health. It's no longer near-unlimited.- The Covenants. Each of the 9 will open new play modes and, as always, every action brings about consequences. Joining may appear an easy decision but separation can be painful and costly.- Pyromancy as a THIRD class of magic, joining sorcery and miracles. For anyone who likes fire and explosions... it's awesome.- The Gifts. Interestingly some seem to have no effect while others such as the Magic Key you get if you pick the class of Thief is quite useful.- Danger times 2. It may be just because I'm a little rusty playing Souls or because I know Demon's so well now it's like a walk in the park but Dark appears to be a lot harder. But... we play, we learn. We shall see :)- More color. Can't imagine Demon's with colors but in this world the occasional bright splashes blend well and don't subtract from the feeling of danger.- No Luck. You COULD get lucky in Deomon's Souls but that's no longer the case. That particular stat has disappeared, replaced by your ability to hold 'humanities' which you lose every time you die.- Sweet revenge. One of the covenants mission is to hunt down and kill those nasty dark phantom bullies.- And, of course, Dark Souls does away with all the gentleness and hand-holding occasionally found in Demon's. It really does. Remember that nice Russian lady in the Nexus that you must kill if you want your Platinum? Gone! My first impressions: don't trust anyone because everybody seems to be either evil or insane.THE STORYNot quite sure what's expected of me yet and I don't think I should spoil anyone's fun anyway. There is a prologue, of course and, clearly, terrible things happened that caused this not to be a happy world. Need to investigate some more but I'm not sure who's to be trusted, who should be used, who can be a friend.MY RATINGIf Amazon's 5 stars stands for 'I love it', what would be the star count for \"I love it, I fear it and, 80 hours into the game I'm obsessed by it\"? Well... 5's the limit :). I expect to spend hundreds of hours playing this game and, hopefully, with a little or maybe a lot of help from my friends and a lot of priceless advice from some of the game-focused sites - I will name my favorites on a comment to this review.__________________________________________July 2012 Update:Several months and several hundreds hours of gameplay later, I'm still playing Dark Souls.Sure, I 'beat' the game so many times already but finishing the game the first time is only the beginning. Then you play 'new game plus' (NG+), then NG++, NG+++ and so on where everything gets harder and harder. Can't get the platinum trophy unless you go through the game at least twice.And there's the PvP (player vs. player) which is where, with your most deadly or your most fun character built to much your skills you can face other players in everything ranging from helping out a fellow player beat a boss or a fair 1v1 fight where players bow to each other in the beginning and pay their respects to the defeated one once the fight is over to no-rules melees where magic and poison knives fly, buffed greatswords or halberds hit hard and you may face up to 3 players plus whatever the game may be throwing at you at the same time. The fun never ends, the variety is almost endless and it's addictive.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYX8W","description":"","reviewerName":"Night Lord 40K","summary":"Locked, Cocked And Ready To Rock. Master Chief Is Back.....","reviewText":"I like most people was a little worried about buying a Halo title developed by someone besides Bungie. I didnt even make up my mind to pre order until 2 days before release ( GameStop ). Sorry Amazon I love you but I wanted my game on midnight release not late into the late afternoon.1: Gameplay - This game plays just as smoothly as all the previous titles. Of course we have Halo Reach touches in here. And those touches are armor abilities , Jet pack , Sprint , ect. There are also new additives to the game such as perks and loadouts. After so many kills in multiplayer you can recieve an Ordinance drop. You will get a random selection of three weapons that you can choose from with your D pad and what ever weapon you choose will teleport to your location. All you get is some type of weapon. No you will not get some Pelican support or artillary strike. The loadouts are a nice touch. Now you can start out with any weapon you want. I never liked the DMR or any other one or three round burst weapon, all I want is full auto and now I have it.2: Campaign - The campaign is about 8 hours long on Normal. That is if you take your time and not just blast your way to the next check point while soaking up enemy fire. I love the story, it gives you another side of our beloved Master Chief ( John 117 ) , and his faithful AI counter part Cortana. Master Chief talks ALOT more in this game which I found pleasing and you can feel that he really cares about Cortana. The Covenant are back in this game but only as a splinter group , The real threat now is the Prothians , a new threat to human life ,and of course it is the MC's duty to stop them at all cost. By the end I was sitting there and thinking WOW. Oh and by the way If you think the game isnt long enough just up the difficulty and you will extend your play time. I am on my second play through and am playing this time on Legendary. YOU WILL NOT FINISH THIS GAME QUICKLY ON LEGENDARY. BE PREPARED TO DIE ALOT !!!!!! Luckily this game has a great check point system so when you die you wont be set back far at all.3: Graphics - 343 has upped the game in the graphics department alot. I thought Halo Reach was beautiful but this game is just crazy good. Detail , detail , detail. Besides the detail the graphics are REALLY clear and crisp. The cut sceens are created by the game engine and let me tell you I dont think you will find any better on any other console or game. I was completely amazed by the way this game looks.4: Extended story - After completing the campaign You can play a new mode called SPARTAN OPS. These will be released in episodes and all of them build upon the story. There will be 10 episodes with five missions in each episode. That gives you 50 more missions in this game. You do not play as MC in these missions but as a Spartan IV. This took nothing from the game to me because I had a blast playing it. Also just like the campaign you can invite 3 other friends or random people into your game and play the whole thing in Co op or alone , its your choice. I think it is alway more fun playing with friends but I played through the first time by myself and the next with friends.Summary : I know I left some things out but I am in a little bit of a hurry since Im writing this at work. The story ( in my opinion ) is gripping and leaves you wanting more , alot more. Luckily we have our Multiplayer and Spartan ops to sate that hunger for a while. Between the campaign , multiplayer and spartan ops you will have many, many, many, hours of happy game play. I couldnt recomend this game enough. Two thumbs up to 343 industries for bringing us this game and also a special thanks to Bungie for all the previous games we have played and loved . I have loved them all ( even ODST and I know some will disagree. ) and cant wait to see what happens in Halo 5 and 6.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}

B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"3.5 Stars - This is where it all began","reviewText":"Resident Evil: Director's Cut (1997). The PSX re-release of the 1996 survival horror game.Back when the PSX was first released, the system didn't have much in the way of standout games. Of course, there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal, Doom, and Tekken, but for the most part, the PSX didn't have anything outstanding yet. Thus, Resident Evil was made. Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark, Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcom's most successful franchises to date, ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games. In fact, the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years.Most everyone who's played the games already knows the story, but for those who haven't, here's a brief synopsis: A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious, so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (STARS) teams to go investigate. You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, both of them surviving STARS members. The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains, so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion, where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies, mutilated dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters. These were all created due to Umbrella Corporation's disastrous T-Virus. As the game goes along, more important discoveries are made.Now let's talk about the game itself.Of the three PSX RE games, this one easily has the worst graphics. We're talking first-generation PSX graphics here, if that's any indication. The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed still-screen environments. These environments are navigatably 3D, but the camera angles sit at fixed 2D points, which can be both good and bad, depending on the situation. By bad, I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action. The monsters (especially the zombies) have very limited animation and models compared to the later games, and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than 3 monsters on the screen at one time (not including the crows). So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments. But even they don't quite compare to the detail in the following games.The sound effects are good for the most part. However, the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters, and the voice acting... dear god? don't get me started. It's so hilariously bad that it's just fun to listen to. The dialogue doesn't help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by B-movie standards. One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game. The music on the other hand, is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately. It's nothing special, but it does add to the overall suspense.The controls are something that most people either love or hate. It took me some time to get used to them, but now I have no troubles whatsoever. Most people that hate them don't seem to realize that RE isn't just an all-out action game, but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments. The controls were a bit rough here, though they have been more refined in later releases. I do admit though, that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you can't hold all the items you want to. Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris, I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris, although Chris's voice acting isn't quite as nerve-grating as hers is. Both characters each have their own sub-character that helps them along game, such as Barry who helps Jill, and Rebecca who aids Chris.Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games. I'm not sure I agree with that, but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points. I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows could've scared newbees to the series, but since I was introduced through RE2 and the fact that I've already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games, the original didn't scare me nearly as much as it should have. To the game's credit though, it does present the most puzzles, and a majority of them are real brain-benders. It's something that the series started to get away from as time went on. Plus, I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series, so it will take a while for new players to beat it. The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with. Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more.This version of the game is a director?s cut edition, but it?s really nothing special. All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters, but if you already own the original, there?s no need to get this version. Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cut-scenes, so we were cheated! So much for it being a ?director?s cut?, huh?Although this game is extremely dated by today's standards, it's still worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place. However, it's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube, so I suggest looking into that game instead. RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES. NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH RE 2 OR THE GAMECUBE REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL FIRST.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2004"}

If you've ever wanted to cut 50 zombies in half while listening to \"Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind, Hey Mickey\" or run over 300 zombies with a wheat thresher while listening to \"You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby...\"  Then you should enjoy it.Concept:  10/10Take the Bizarre and Crude Humor of Suda 51 (No More Heroes, Killer 7, and Shadows of the Damned) and make a hack and slash starring cosplay sensation, Juliet Starling, a very high spirited zombie slaying cheerleader and her boyfriend...  Well, actually, he got bitten by a zombie and Juliet had to cut off his head with her chainsaw and resurrect it with black magic to prevent him from turning, so instead of her boyfriend, it's just his decapitated wise cracking head hanging from her belt.  Anyway, the duo must team up and battle their way through an army of the undead, retro mini-games, and memorable boss battles.  Of course, the game does not take itself seriously, but it's a really campy kind of fun.Story:  9/10The Zombie Apocalypse happened on High School Cheerleader Juliet Starling's 18th Birthday, and she just happens to be a zombie hunter armed with a very cute and very deadly chainsaw... and pom poms.  Juliet and her boyfriend Nick's Head, must battle their way through hordes of the undead and deal with High School Drama as they defeat an army of zombies and their evil minions.  The story is hilarious and manages to combine high school drama, the apocalypse, and loads of humor.  It's well told through in game cinematics and really funny one-liners from all of the characters.Gameplay: 8/10The gameplay involves Hack and Slash, Mini-Games, and Boss Battles.  The meat of the game is definitely the combat.  Juliet has a ton of unlockable (XXXXYY) combos.  She basically uses her pom poms to weaken enemies and if she hits them enough times, they get stunned.  That makes it easier to finish them off with high or low slashes from her chainsaw.  The combat system works because it is very rewarding.  By killing zombies, you collect 3 types of currencies:  Stars, Coins, and Special Coins.You get more stars by stunning enemies with your pom poms before slaying them.  When you accumulate enough stars, you can unleash a short berserker rampage where all of Juliet's chainsaw attacks are 1 hit kills.When you kill zombies or rescue fellow classmates, you get coins.  These are used to buy power-ups, permanent upgrades, or new attack combos.  The more style you use when killing zombies, the more coins you get.If you manage to kill 3-7 zombies in a single swipe of your chainsaw, or take down a sub-boss, you get Platinum Coins, which allow you to unlock concept art, music tracks, or special sexy outfits for Juliet.So even though, this is just a simple hack and slash, you're really rewarded for effective combat.If you just hack down 7 zombies with your chainsaw, you get 7 coins.  If you manage to stun them, and kill them all with one swipe of your mighty chainsaw, then you can get 49 coins and 7 platinum coins.Each level grades you at the end based on your combos, kills, time it took to complete it, etc...  The game does not downgrade you for damage that you took, so it really rewards aggression.  Which is GREAT!  You can also replay the levels as much as you want to farm more coins.There are some Mini-Games that pay tribute to Pac Man, Elevator Action, Breakout, and Crazy Climber.  Unfortunately, these really aren't that much fun.The Boss Battles are pretty good and the one liners are really funny.  Most of the fights involve defense, waiting for an opening and using your chainsaw.Graphics: 8/10The graphics are stylized like a graphic novel.  This isn't the best looking game, but it works with the campy feeling of a High School overrun by zombies.  The characters are all well designed and a lot of style went into the game.Sound:  9/10The music is great and the characters are all hilarious.  The sound effects highlight the action and Juliet's one liners keep you going.Replay Value:  Hit or MissYou can blow through this game in 7 hours and if you aren't into collectibles, then you can just finish it and be done with it.  If you want to get high scores, unlock achievements, or buy things like Cosplay Outfits for Juliet, then you're going to want to play the levels over and over.  The levels are easily selectable from the World Map.  There are also two different endings to the game.  If you saved all of your fellow High School Students from being eaten, you get the good ending.Maturity: MIt's a fun, gore filled game, where you kill thousands of zombies with a chainsaw, while characters are swearing, and saying hilarious yet perverted things.  If a little kid played this, he'd immediately go through puberty right there on the spot.  This game is best enjoyed if you're in or just graduated from High School.Overall:  9/10This is a very fun and very entertaining game.  If you just want to hack, slash, and laugh, then you'll have a great time playing it.  You can blow right through it in 7 hours, but if you want to unlock everything, it could take you about a week.Buy it if you like the bizarre humor of Suda 51.Buy it if you like fun hack and slash games.Buy it if you ever wanted Buffy the Vampire Slayer to be Rated R.Rent it if you have 7 hours to blow through the game.  This is GREAT Rental!Avoid it if you don't like campy or crude humor.Avoid it if you like long games with deep combat systems.If you like the fun atmosphere of this game, you'll probably like Bayonetta.  If you have a Wii and like the humor, definitely pick up No More Heroes.  It's very similar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2012"}

But I played the game through almost twice and you can hit fire only and still do very well.I seriously love this game I spent hours upon hours playing it and love that you can just roam the island ( Actually two islands but only one at the beginning). This game is huge and mean it would seriously take you all day to discover the whole island without making any story progress.If I can give you a few tips that I found to be beneficial to make a game a lot more fun And easier Period at the very beginning just run around unlocking all of the radio towers this gives you free weapons in the stores and also allows you to see what things are available as an animal skins on the map.

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Video Game History \"Gamer 4 life\"","summary":"Brilliant!","reviewText":"Awesome single player.

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Revolutionary new portable game system","reviewText":"Despite a much higher percentage of quality titles to total titles, Nintendo's most recent console, GameCube, is lagging behind its competitors, PS2 and Xbox.  With Nintendo's next generation console, under the code-name Dolphin, plagued by rumors of strife and struggle, while also having to contend with the Playstation 3 on the horizon, Nintendo is finding itself perilously close to the dreaded country of `Sega-ville'; the land where hardware consoles go to die.  Sega was big player in the console market from the early to late 90's, but seriously misjudged its target customer and rapidly saw its market-share evaporate, forcing it out of the video game hardware industry completely.Nintendo is faced with that same scenario, but is buoyed by one shining beacon; their unparalleled hand-held platforms.  The original Gameboy was the standard for nearly a decade for all portable video game systems.  It beat back challenges from Turbo-Grafx, Atari, and Sega, to remain the dominant (and ONLY) portable system.  Over the years, Nintendo spruced the system up a bit by making a more compact version of it and then creating a version that had full-color games instead of just the standard black/grey-green screens.  In 2001, the portable was completely re-vamped with the introduction of the Gameboy Advance (GBA), which dramatically improved the graphics and redefined the degree of complexity possible for handheld games.  However, the GBA was plagued by an easily scratched screen and a monitor that had no backlight (which was a severe drawback for the multi-toned games with dark screens).  In 2003, Nintendo corrected that problem with the release of the Gameboy Advance SP (GBA SP), which provided a backlight as well as a compact clamshell design that protected the screen while preserving the ease of game play.This leads into the next great advancement in portable technology, the Nintendo DS (dual-screen).  With Sony poised to enter the handheld market with its PlayStation Portable (PSP) and overtake the Big Daddy the same way they did in the console market, Nintendo was pressed to deliver the goods on a system that truly redefined handheld gaming and could bring in a whole new generation of gamers while still remaining true to its long and loyal customer base.  By taking into account what fans wanted, having a vision for what they would need, and having the foresight to re-engineer the system based on test studies, a system was produced that was exactly what Nintendo fans were hoping for.The DS obviously provides what its name indicates, dual screens.  Its clamshell design is roughly 1  times the size of the GBA SP with roughly the same thickness.  However, the dual screen design is truly innovative.  The upper screen is the primary game play screen where all of the action takes place.  The lower screen is a supplementary screen that helps enhance the overall gameplaying experience by employing touch-screen technology.  This innovative addition provides alternate ways to control the gameplay, such as addition different was to move characters in Super Mario 64 DS or moving the entire play menu into a more aesthetic and easy to use location as with Madden 2005.  Of course, the entire system is backlit, too.The beauty of this system is it is like having a better designed Nintendo 64 in the palm of your hand.  The graphics are actually a slight step up from the quality of the N64 system.  Don't worry about the design, either.  After getting used to that little analog joystick in the N64, fans will not left out in the cold, as Nintendo easily adapted the gameplay options for this new system.  In addition to all the fabulous new technology, Nintendo also kept a eye towards fans who still feel the tug of the games they played on the GBA and GBA SP by reverse-engineering the DS to include a slot where GBA games could be played as well.  (Sorry, though, original Gameboy games have been put out to pasture).  There is a stylus pen included to increase the responsiveness of the touch-screen to gameplay, while also being valuable for the system's wireless chat function.  I have yet to try the chat feature, as well as its ability to wireless multi-player gameplay, but I look forward to trying it.With Sony's PSP now beset by design delays, bad early word-of-mouth, and pushed back launch dates, the Nintendo DS sits poised to beat back its first serious challenger to the portable throne.  Hopefully, Nintendo has learned its lessons from its console experience and will keep its stranglehold on the portable market, while it seeks to rebound with the consoles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2005"}

That's it. Otherwise it's pretty much the same game, for better or worse. I'll be comparing it often to it's predecessor, as is only fitting, so it would benefit you if you played the original first before playing this one.Story wise, the game is very predictable. Two people at war, Samus must protect the light and save the planet from the dark. Wow. That's crazy original. What really got me though was the fact that I HAD to lose my equipment in the first 5 minutes. No grappling beam for you Samus. They even had the nerve to list me the items that I lost which were about 10. WHERE DO THE DEVELOPERS GET OFF DOING THIS EVERY GAME?! It's an excuse not to actually do something new, and it's enough to get the game knocked down a whole star. It may seem harsh, but I'm sick of having to go through the same fetch quest every time for the same items to magically find them because Samus accidentally loses them and forgets a spare. Very very very disappointing. Retro needs to stop designing Retro. If Samus is an intergalactic bounty hunter living in the distant future, SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY AN EXTRA MISSILE LAUNCHER OR GRAPPLING HOOK. There I said it. The same goes for Zelda where they make us find the same items over and over and over again game after game. I don't care if it's Zelda or Metroid. Having those names on your game is no excuse to skimp on common sense or originality. 3/10Starting with graphics, MP2 isn't really that great. Compared side by side with MP1, the games are indistinguishable. The graphics haven't been changed in 2 years. Now the original Metroid Prime was absolutely amazing. I can still remember the opening sequence with the landing in what is a jungle, the rain, the waterfall, Samus and her ship. It was stunning. MP2 just doesn't have that WOW effect that MP1 had nailed down. It looks good, but not that much different then it's predecessor, and in some ways, it actually doesn't match up. 8/10Musically, the game has lost something. MP1 had an amazing soundtrack, but MP2 is lacking in this department. It has a lot of the sound effects nailed, but it lacks that really memorable tune. Still, it's solid overall. 8/10Gameplay hasn't changed a bit since the original. The emphasis is heavy on exploration and visor use. You still use a mostly First Person view, but it's all done very well. The controls aren't typical of most first person shooters, but they become very intuititve after an hour of playing. Basically, the game involves upgrading Samus so she can explore more of the environment, using a collection of various visors and weapons. Unfortunately, there is WAY WAY too much scanning in this game. If you didn't play the original, scanning consists of switching to a visor and holding L over a colored item, an enemy, building, etc. and gathering info about it. But pretty much everything can be scanned in the game, and a lot of it is just repeated or useless information. Generally, a waste of time. Even worse, they got rid of most of the weapons seen in MP1. Now you basically have 3 weapons (one of which, the charge beam, is standard in every game.) The light and dark beams. Unfortunately, they require ammo, which is very unlike every other game in the series that gave unlimited ammo. You'll often find yourself running away from enemies to conserve precious ammo needed for bosses and such. It's tried and true but has a number of flaws. 8/10Difficulty: this game is HARD. There is no option to choose difficulty anymore. You start on normal whether you like it or not, and the normal in MP2 is like the hard of MP1. And the hard mode of MP2 is insane if you have what it takes to play through it a 2nd time. Many of the enemies take a very long time to beat, you have limited ammo, bosses consist of trial and error, and to compound all the problems, save points are relatively hard to find. At the beginning of the game they locked one of the save points so I couldn't use it after a boss battle. Not to mention that you constantly take damage in the Dark Realm until you get the Dark Suit which they choose to give you much later. Puzzles will have you reaching for a strategy guide which I would recommend. Bottom Line: This isn't your old Metroid Prime. 1 being Ninja Gaiden hard, and 10 being for Elmo and friends. 5/10Finally, we get to originality which this game, and many of Nintendo's franchises suffer for. Like I said, this is Metroid Prime by and by. Different story, slightly different weapons, same game. The light beam is similar to the wave beam in look and attack with only a difference in color, and the dark beam is very similar in look the the ice beam and the way it fires as well with the difference being its color. The graphics are the same, story isn't too far off, and even the idea of Dark Samus was stolen from the GBA game Metroid Fusion except that Fusion implemented Dark Samus much better. If that was the only problem, I would be ok. But it isn't. As in every game before, Samus loses almost all of her equipment in some kind of accident and you have to go on another fetch quest. Shouldn't she carry a spare suit or upgrades since it's happened for the umpteenth time. You once again have to go hunt for the grapple beam, missile launcher, etc. It's a wonder they actually gave the charge beam from the very beginning. INTRODUCE SOMETHING NEW!!! 3/10Overall, Metroid Prime 2 isn't a bad game. But it's severely lacking originality, and feels far too similar to MP1 to be considered a good game. Hopefully, they will really do something new for MP3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"Bioshock, but not Bioshock at the same time.","reviewText":"A review from a REAL gamer and fan of the Bioshock series... ME!I waited to finish the whole game on PC before writing a review as I am quite a fan of the first 2 Bioshock games. I played with a 360 Controller and it worked beautifully, so this review applies to the Xbox version as well.I know that the rumor mills and PAID game reviews are saying this is the best game of all time and has achieved the mythical 10 out of 10 and that every gamer should own a copy... Well... I have to say that is just not true. The coveted 5 star, 10 points, or 100 point review scores are lying. A 100% score from a gamer is basically saying that a game with that coveted score is a GOD among all other games and that all other games should bow down before it and kiss its feet. Everyone should own a copy even if they only play flash games online. I do not feel that is the case here and is pretty much hype or just new players that have never played the first two Bioshock games.Before people start exploding with anger as to why I only give it a \"meh\" 3 out of 5 and not 4 or higher is that, as a part of a SERIES of games, this one is a step BACKWARDS from the previous games. If this was its own game, in its own universe, and not connected any way to the original 2 Bioshock games; I would give it 4 out of 5.I have to say this is a VERY SHORT GAME, they could have done so much more with this to get it up towards the amount of content that the first two games had, near 15 hours or more, but it looks like the Bioshock series has fallen to the DLC monster and time constraints that so many big game companies are forcing upon games now. I went all through the game and explored every little inch I could in the game, and it came out to under 9 hours of play time.Since this game IS titled as part of a series/established universe, I will rate it as such and compare it to the previous games. I believe that ANY new game in an established series should ALWAYS try to out-do and improve upon the previous games.Here we go:First- Replay Value: The original Bioshock games were all about CHOICE and DIFFERENT paths and MULTIPLE ENDINGS to add what gamers like me call the holy grail of gaming known as \"Replay Value\" or \"Replayability\" and what companies call \"Lots of people buying our games\"... This is what makes a game worth buying over just renting, beating, and never playing again. Bioshock 1&2 had SUBSTANTIAL side quests that sometimes took an hour or more to complete, and were quite in-depth. There were many choices to be made that would change all manner of outcomes in the game and would give different endings. Bioshock Infinite seems to give you the ILLUSION of choice during the first 1/3rd of the game and then everything is set on rails from there. As for side quests, there really are none other than quickly exploring a side building with under 3 rooms in it and a few cypher loot hunts. You get the same ending in Bioshock Infinite no matter what you do in the game.Second- Setting/Atmosphere: While the settings of the first two games are underwater and quite gloomy and atmospheric, even claustrophobic and frightening with sporradic placing of some enemies... Infinite is mostly in the open air and bright sun shine with open spaces, and what I call \"Arenas\" where you KNOW bad guys will be attacking you, so it has a completely different feel from the first two games, and just does not feel very... Bioshocky.Third- The Weapons... In The first two games the weapons were very steam punk like, and you could see the upgrades you bought as they were added to the weapons. Such as spinning gears on the shotgun or the extended capacity add-on sticking out the side of the revolver. I loved the design of the weapons in the first 2 Bioshock games. In Bioshock Infinite you get rather plain weapons, some of them feel like copies of other weapons you already get in the game with maybe some red paint on them or such... They get no visible upgrades either. Instead, the upgrades are in name and text only with no change to the weapons visually.Fourth- Ammo Types: There were DIFFERENT types of ammo in the first two Bioshock games: Armor Piercing, Exploding, Electric, and so on, with varying strategies to go along with nearly every enemy... Bioshock Infinite, none of that, just one type for each weapon and, to me, it felt like the basic enemies took a lot more hits to go down and ammo was much more scarce, especially near the end of the game. Pray and spray.Fifth- Player Engagement: Bioshock 1&2 were very engaging all throughout the game, always making you wonder what might happen next or when some enemy may pop out at you since enemies were not constrained to just appearing in wide open spaces. There was quite a bit of backtracking and revisiting old areas with new things unlocked. Much fun could be had while playing the game in a darkened room. With Bioshock Infinite it felt so.... FPS Typical... Enemies drop out from the sky, shoot em', clear this area, move on, clear next area, move on, with very little backtracking or encouraged exploring or random encounters.Sixth- Enemy AI/Character Design: This is where Bioshock Infinite FAILS MASSIVELY! In Bioshock 1&2 the enemies were downright scary in how creative they were, they would stalk you, or flank you to get you from behind, or would run away and hide at times, popping up in entirely different areas. They would look for you if you ran away or hid. Every fight was different. The enemies/splicers in the first two games all seemed to be different, unique, and quite memorable in their own ways. One thing Infinite gets right is the main story characters facial expressions, especially Elizabeth... If they had spent as much time working on the game as they did her expressions, this would have been a much better game. As for the AI in Bioshock Infinite the enemies just come at you in mindless waves as if this was a Serious Sam game, they don't hide, they don't stalk you or look for you... They all know where you are with their magic radar sense. So just lots of shooting at generic police, rebels, robots, and heavies that all stand out in the open waiting for your bullets and powers to splatter their faces. Or the opposite, friggin' stands right on top of you Zerg rush style. All while they shoot mindlessly at you or at the item you may be hiding behind while you are required to run around like a chicken with your head cut off. I really did not expect Bioshock Infinite to have AI that is this downright TERRIBLE after the amazing experience from the first two games.Seventh- Powers and Abilities: Those that have played Bioshock 1&2 know the massive amount of plasmids and abilities you could get and upgrade, you could play the game how you wanted, even as a stealthy character with some of the upgrades. In Bioshock Infinite it has been broken down into weapon upgrades, and I believe only 8 vigor abilities, with 4 clothing power up options. Infinite just feels \"Dumbed Down\" and over simplified from the previous games with NO STEALTH/invisibility this time. It has had most of the strategy taken out and just turned into a \"run and shoot\".Eighth- Graphics/immersion: The game is quite stunning graphically; in the first 1/3rd of the game it is engrossing and enjoyable... But... As the game moves on it feels like they were in a rush to reach the end so it is just not as immersive as the first two Bioshock games. The graphics from the first two Bioshock games were and are still amazing, especially when it comes to water effects. Infinite just did not feel \"on par\" with the previous games or even when comparing to some of the newer games out there. It does look good but not jaw dropping good. Though, in all honesty, I couldn't care less about graphics as some people are but it seems important to some.Ninth- Controls: I played the game for a short bit with keyboard and mouse and the controls were decently simple, typical FPS. Same for using the controller which I played the rest of the game with... Obviously the game feels better with a controller than the keyboard and mouse, since it was made for a controller.Tenth- The Writing/Story Telling: Bioshock 1&2 were absolute masterpieces in original Videogame writing and storytelling, fully fleshing out the world and characters and making it hard to guess what was coming next, while giving some rather hard choices at times that would change the game play and ending possibilities while in the end giving a good feeling of closure and satisfaction. Bioshock Infinite is more of a... Well... Without spoiling the story, as convoluted as it seems to become, look up the definition of \"String theory\" and the game may make more sense in the end. Otherwise the story of Bioshock Infinite may sail over the heads of certain gamers. Since there is only one ending for infinite, it just doesn't feel complete or like it would have made a difference any way you went.THE BOTTOM LINE TL;DR: Short Game... NO REPLAY VALUE! Horrible AI. Fun, but not very Bioshock feeling compared to previous games... It IS a fun FPS game on its own, but just didn't feel like Bioshock. Biosomething but not Shock in any way.RENT IT for a console system and play through it before you even THINK about buying it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"IdrilCelebrindal","summary":"The best in the series","reviewText":"As a long time fan of BioWare, I loved the entire experience of this game.  I've only played through one character I have transferred over from the first two, but already, I'm looking forward to replaying it with future transfers.  I believe this game, overall, builds on a combination of strengths from the first two in the series and makes for what as a very excellent gaming experience.From the release of the demo in February, I've been eagerly anticipating this game, and if you're indecisive, I feel it's a good intro to the feel of the game.  Much like the Dragon Age II demo (which, for me, appropriately anticipated the disappointment for that game) I feel that the ME3 demo has the same effect.  If you like the demo, odds are you'll have a good experience with the game.A listing of pros and cons:+ - The story is the best that it's ever been.  Unlike ME1, where the story faded to the background until the finale, and ME2, where the story was more concerned with the collection of party members than the threat of the Collectors, ME3 has a story - Earth (and the galaxy) are invaded by Reapers - and it actually informs the entirety of the game.  It's a constant presence in every aspect, from every environment you visit, to each piece of the storyline, which primarily involves the amassing of the galaxy's forces (and by doing so, resolving many centuries-long inter-species conflicts).  Unlike the first two game, I actually felt it was a strong story that *mattered*.  More than that, it is epic.  In a way ME2 never accomplished past its brilliant beginning, and ME1 only managed during its last two hours.  I haven't been this tense, nervous, or excited playing a game in a *long* time.+ - BioWare said they lessened the amount of squad mates to improve character interaction, and it shows.  More than that, not just with commentary from your squad mates on missions, there's a much greater sense of them being individuals with lives and personalities outside of Shepard's presence.  When you visit the Citadel, various crew members (not just your squad mates) will be found at various places throughout (often changing depending on what point during the game) with unique interactions.  Similarly, instead of staying in one place, many will move throughout the ship and be found interacting with one another (my personal favorite was when I came upon Garrus and Joker exchanging jokes).  There's also simple interactions that don't necessarily play into cutscenes, which I feel strengthens alongside the ambient dialogue, and has a unique role in the new morality system.+ - The sheer breadth of environments explored in this game is amazing.  Honestly, I was not near this impressed with the first two games; the major plot playthroughs stand out the most significantly, and I was stunned and thrilled at the places I got to see and explore as Shephard.  Something even more impressive given how many worlds are visited that appeared in the first two games - and not one is a re-used environment.  Long gone are the cookie cutter environments of the first game - ME3 even manages to significantly improve on the second game.+ - The cover system has been somewhat improved.  And I really enjoyed not only the diversity of weapons available (weapons, alongside with armor upgrades - more than what was in ME2 - and credits are scattered throughout combat environments when you explore off the main path) but also the ability to mod each of your weapons.  There's also the option to pick how few or many weapons you want to carry, with weight (and class) affecting the cooldown of your powers.  I also feel they managed to find a nice balance between the first two games - more diversity and customization than the second, without becoming bogged down in inventory management.  When a new weapon or mod is bought/found of the next tier, it automatically is replaced (meaning no time wasted having to sell older versions to clear out inventory).+ - I also feel the power system found a nice balance between the first two games.  More customization (six levels instead of four, with the last three a decision between two different options) without the overblown tediousness of the first game (where I felt so overloaded with points and powers that it was hard to tell if any were making a difference in their use).- - More auto-dialogue than in previous games.  In addition to the neutral (middle) option being entirely eliminated, the option for the player to choose Shephard's dialogue happens much less frequently.  I find the writing to be overall fantastic, but it did somewhat take away from the feel of Shepard being *my* character.- - The journal system is considerably pared down from what it was in the second game.  I would even cite this as my biggest beef with the game - and much of the overall sidequest system in regards to planet scanning.  Not all quests logged in your journal are done so with enough details of where to go (for example, one quest required me to find the Elcor homeworld and though it gave me the name, it didn't tell me where the homeworld was located).  And unlike ME2, they aren't automatically logged onto your galaxy map (the way there would be an arrow with info telling you that this specific quest could be completed at this specific location).  What's worse, they changed the planet scanning to one where you send out a radar-like signal from the Normandy, and EDI tells you if she's located anything within that vicinity - but if the system is occupied by Reapers, each scan results in increasing their awareness, and the only way to bring it back down again is to come back after you've completed a mission.  I think the idea of it could've worked in theory, except that there's no way to keep track of which parts of a system you've already scanned.  So I found myself returning to systems over and over, likely scanning the exact same area with the 2-3 times I had available to me before the Reapers appeared and I had to escape.  It definitely gives a feeling of tedium, and I feel is something that could've been easily rectified.+/- - Once again, aspects of the morality (Paragon vs. Renegade) system have been changed, and though I'm still not entirely sure I understand, I do think it was done for the better.  When receiving points after character interactions, oftentimes it will be given as general Reputation points - which, from my understanding, adds to the combined scores of your Paragon and Renegade scores, while keeping them balanced (so the overall changes, while the difference between each bar remains the same, if that makes sense).  I think it's a nice idea, because it definitely adds to the ability of playing as pure Renegade or pure Paragon (since not every interaction is going to give points strictly one way or the other).  On the other hand, I felt like there were overall fewer Charm/Intimidate options spread throughout the game, and oftentimes when I used them, it was difficult to tell how/if they were making a difference in the conversation.- - My first playthrough clocked in at just over 30 hours.  About ten hours less than ME2.  I'm hoping this will improve with more playthroughs, as I attempt to reach closer to 100% completion.  A little bit disappointing, though.EDIT 4/15: I'm actually opting to change my opinion on this - a single-play through is shorter than ME2, but from what I understand, the script was longer, which I imagine was due to the sheer amount of permutations for how the story can play out.  Really, the more I read around on-line, the more I find the variety (whether your have Ashley or Kaidan in your squad, who you romance, and a countless number of minor and major decisions from the first two games) and how it can be altered in this game is staggering.  It gives an unprecedented amount of replay-value, more than almost any other game I've ever played.+ - The climax is epic.  Much more so than anything in ME2, and I feel it gives the last two hours of ME1 a serious run for its money.Of course, this is all not addressing the elephant in the room, being the fact that this game has a very controversial ending that has displeased a great number of fans.  Though I realize this puts me in the overwhelming minority, I enjoyed the ending.  Perhaps it came in part because I went into it knowing that others were upset about it, but despite what I feel others have argued as justifiable holes, it really, really worked for me.More than that, without wanting to invalidate the opinions of those who disagree with me, all I can offer is my perspective, which is this: It took me long enough to beat this game that by the time I did, I was already well aware the ending was controversial.  And in those days leading up to it, I thought about it a lot, and I couldn't name one game that I've played to completion where the ending fundamentally altered my overall experience of a game.  ME1 has a fantastic ending, but is still a bit of a chore to replay.  Dragon Age II has a so-so ending in keeping with a so-so game - and even if it did have a great ending, it would still be a so-so game.  ME2 has a lackluster ending, but is overall an amazing game.  And so what really matters to me is how I feel when I'm playing a game.  And throughout the *entire* experience of this game, I loved it.  When I wasn't playing it, I was thinking about it, and wanting to play it more.  And I feel confident that had I been unhappy with the ending, I would still be on here gushing about what a great game this is.  Because I feel the experience of a game is more than just one piece, like the ending, or the combat mechanics, or the story, or what have you.  If the majority of elements are working - which I feel they are here - then I think, for me, the game can be called a success.  Enough so that I'm willing to forgive the elements which I felt were weaknesses (like the journal/side-quests).So all I can say is that I understand why others are unhappy, but I loved it, I loved the game, and I love the series overall.  And I think if you skip this because others warn you away from the ending, I think you're missing out on participating on one of the greatest video gaming experiences ever.  Battlestar Galatica is still an amazing tv series, even if it does have an ending this is rushed and incoherent.I also am appreciative of BioWare's approach to having both Male and FemShep.  In an era and industry where it's still too easy for people to dismiss female gamers as a relative minority (and thus don't need to be given notice), BioWare went the opposite direction, incorporating FemShep into the marketing for the first time (with two trailers, and appearances in combat videos), as well as making the insert reversible, so I can have FemShep on my cover.  It might not be an issue to others, but as a female gamer, I really appreciate it.Overall, Mass Effect 3 is an amazing end to an amazing series.  For myself, I would rank it up there just below Dragon Age: Origins and Baldur's Gate II among my all time favorites.  And I know that I will be playing this for many years to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

The game lives up to its hype - both good and bad. I'm writing a walkthrough for this game, so have been playing it pretty much non-stop since its release.First, the gameplay. If you've been living in a cave and haven't heard of this game, it is definitely MATURE. The other two GTA3 games were mildly mature. This one is full blown mature. There is more swearing in 5 minutes of the game than in most full length R-rated movies. You are beating up people with baseball bats, having drive-by gang shootings, and more. This isn't a game for kids.That being said, there is a lot here to entertain adults who are into gang life and rap music. The graphics are really quite amazing, and the maps are HUGE. You can drive all over intricately detailed streets, hopping in and out of whatever cars you see. There are different areas of town, each with its own look and feel.The music immerses you in this world which is both bad and good. If you love the rap / hiphop music, you're all set. But unlike the other games that gave you a wide selection of music to choose from, in San Andreas you're pretty stuck with that one genre. I suppose there is one country station, plus the traditional (and fun) talk station too.Gameplay is typical GTA style. You go on missions. In your missions you shoot the bad guys and go on object-finding hunts. There are tags to spray paint, people to talk to and deeds to do. A lot of blood is spilled along the way.An addition to San Andreas is the customization of your character. You're a black male adult, and can go into barber shops to change your hairstyle at whim. You can also hop into a tattoo shop to add tats to various parts of your body. As you eat and run, you can get muscular, slim, fat or so on. If you eat too much and get fat, it slows you down. If you don't eat enough, you end up weak. Balance is key here.The game is flying out of stores at an incredible rate, and the pre-orders for it were collossal. Loyal fans will not be disappointed - the game really amps up every aspect. Those who want to complain about the violence and language will find plenty to be upset about - but remember, this game is for adults only. It clearly says mature on the box. So if an adult chooses to play this game and have fun with it - well, that's their decision to make!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0015HYPOO","description":"Logitech Driving Force GTPS3 racing gets real with the official wheel of Gran TurismoHold on to your seat. Designed from the pedals up for PLAYSTATION 3 and Gran Turismo, this racing wheel lets you feel every bump in the road, crash and tire spin with jaw-dropping realism. With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Brian Seiler","summary":"Decent Wheel","reviewText":"I'll confess, I'm not really a wheel guy.  More to the point, I'm not much of a racing guy any more.  Those games tend to do little more than piss me off, frustrate me, and generally rub me the wrong way.  As such, I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed playing the latest Gran Turismo title using this control interface.I should say right out that this was my first experience with a force feedback wheel, so I don't have much basis for cross-comparison, but with that in mind, it was certainly a better way of interacting with my game than I have previously had available to me.  The wheel feels pretty tight for a two-thirds size plastic toy, and the feeling you get while driving is.....well, it's not a perfect replica, but it's still pretty authentic.  All of the buttons, switches, and levers are located in easy to reach areas from your natural grip on the wheel.  The only mechanical element that really bothered me was the gear shift level, which doesn't have as much wiggle and slide to it as I might have preferred, but otherwise it's pretty exceptional.That's not to say that the device doesn't have its problems.  I personally had a problem with the gas pedal disconnecting from the wain wheel assembly - the pedals would walk progressively further away as I operated them.  If you want to work the device from your lap you're probably up to the creek as well, as the whole controller is just a little bit way too humongous to fit comfortably in your lap and still work.  I couldn't expand the clips far enough to slide the wheel onto my coffee table either, which is partly the fault of my gargantuan coffee table and partly the fault of Logitech not making the clips expand another half an inch to slip on.On the whole, I'm not sorry that I have the device, and it's made the PS3 my future platform of choice for those racing games that I do decide to get.  However, it should be said that this wheel isn't going to change your life.  I'm not sure I could advise anybody to spend over a hundred dollars on a device like this that isn't really interested in racing games as a genre.  For the price of this device, you could get two other new release games that will probably entertain you longer than the wheel will.  While it's a great piece of technology for people who know they're interested, I'd say that at its current price point, it's probably still a toy for the hardcore racer crowd, though those folks should be reasonably pleased with what they get here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000038IFX","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"My Return to Xenogears (SPOILER ALERT).","reviewText":"On November 2, 2003, I wrote a review of Xenogears and it went like this:\"Out of all the RPG fansites and magazines and such, you'll find many RPG fans adoring this particular game. Xenogears is a decent game and it's a shame that it wasn't released under a Greatest Hits collection like the horrible Chrono Cross has. Still, I find myself finding this game to be far from great. Being somewhat of an RPG fan (I use \"somewhat\" very loosely), I find myself disappointed but also intrigued. Read on or face the fires of Hell:THE GOODThis game has a REALLY good storyline, and we get a main character that's unique in the sense that he doesn't want to fight, but he knows that he must. The storyline has often been touted as the best plot an RPG ever had, and while that can be debated (I always thought Chrono Trigger had the best storyline...), it's still awesome. A futuristic tale of social class warfare with various different symbolisms... very complex. I was a bit disturbed at the game's athiest point of view, but oh well. I'll let that slide. The battle system is also quite good, featuring several different combos your characters and gears can perform. The music is top notch, and since it's the same composer of Chrono Trigger (Yasunori Mitsuda), you can expect a gold musical score here. The multiplayer feature is quite good, too, and I shun all those people who have beaten me by using Xenogears (the ultim---er, CHEATING gear *Cough Cough* Someone I know.... *Cough Cough*).THE BADThe unfortunate downside of this game happens to be in the presentation. This game is virtually 70% dialogue and story and 30% gameplay. I'm not kidding. I came here to play a GAME, not WATCH it! I guess the RPG fans just want to sit there in awe, but when a battle is going on, I EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. I was vastly disappointed when it cut to one of the characters in a chair talking about the battle with the pendant in the background swaying back and forth. This happened a lot on the second disc and it's a shame. I also felt the love story, albeit far from bad, didn't quite get the boost that it needed; it just seemed to \"happen.\" Oh well.OVERALLDie hard RPG fans no doubt love this game and while it's far from terrible, I do think it's overrated. A great story with interesting characters, but not nearly enough gameplay involvement. If I wanted to watch something, I'll watch a DVD. Nevertheless, I do recommend this game to any RPG fan, BUT ONLY TO THOSE WITH A LOT OF PATIENCE. I might get negatives for this, but that's just because the people that give negative votes are usually very shallow.\"Seven years later, I decided to return to Xenogears.  I don't play video games that often these days, but this was a game that haunted me.  I gave it an average---nearly sub-average---review and as you can tell from my earlier review here, I already had bias going into it.  I felt it was overrated and was really let down by the second disc, in particular.  Also, being a Christian at the time, I didn't like its atheistic storyline and despite \"letting it slide,\" I think it seeped its way into the review, nonetheless.So, as a bit of an addendum, I am changing my review.  Also, some of you complained that my reviews have spoilers.  Well, this is an RPG that I'm reviewing, so therefore, consider yourself warned.THE STORY10,000 years before the game's story takes place, a ship called the Eldridge was flying through space.  The humans onboard had dismantled \"Deus,\" a powerful biomechanical invasion computer that was deemed too powerful.  Deus had become self-aware, a la The Terminator's SkyNet, and started to take over the ship.  It crash-lands with only a handful of survivors; one of them was Abel, a boy who came into contact with the Wave Existence (some sort of supernatural god-like junction...it's a bit confusing there.), and thus, many descendants and reincarnated versions of him appear at several different points of the game (in order to relentlessly stop Deus).  For all intents and purposes of this review, the last incarnation is the game's main character, Fei Fong Wong.What starts off as a Gundam-like game shifts into a very deep, very philosophical storyline.  We have awesome characters like the \"Doc\" Citan; We have Bart, the prince and heir to the throne of Aveh; There's Rico, a physically strong prisoner originally in Nortune; Also, there's Billy Black (my favorite character, actually), a former priest who specializes in guns; and Elly, a former Gebler soldier who crosses paths with Fei not only within the current time frame of the game, but as different incarnations in the past as well (and his love interest in all incarnations).  There are villains in the game, two of them having a connection with Fei; the only two I'll spoil are Krelian (who was a friend of one of Fei's past incarnations) and, of course, Deus.What is so controversial about this story is that it takes on an atheist (or humanist) approach.  Deus is worshiped as a \"god\" by the humans throughout the centuries and it is only revealed much later that it had malevolent intentions.  Square has a lot of cajones for getting this game released; Fei essentially has to kill god!  The scene that really stuck out to me was near the end of the game...Fei chases after the departing/ defeated Deus to rescue Elly and confronts Krelian, who---by this point---becomes a part of Deus.  Krelian kept whining about how he thought mankind needed to return to the \"beginning,\" when human frailties didn't exist and all there was, was God.  Fei followed that with talking about the inherently good qualities of mankind, and that \"we don't need a god\" to understand and embrace concepts like love.  This sensitive subject almost caused the game to not be released here, and probably turned away a lot of potential gamers because of its stance.  I turned away for a while partially because of that reason, but I'm glad I returned.The character Fei is also not your typical hero.  I will not spoil his backstory, but you will learn that he's a very Freudian type of hero and not your typical righteous youngin' like Cecil or Crono.  I also liked Citan, whose real intentions were very \"behind the scenes\" most of the game, and I identified with Billy's upbringing in the priest hood and then learning that it was all a cover up.  Bart is your typical smartass, whip-wielding hero, who despite his rambunctious nature wants to bring a democracy to the kingdom of Aveh.  There are other characters to flesh out, but I will leave it to you---the gamer---to explore the rest on your own.GAMEPLAYThere are two different kinds of battles (well, three, if you count the one-on-one arena battles).  One is with your regular people (up to only three this game) and you can perform combos.  The second is your gear battles.  When you're fighting in gears, it's a bit more complicated.  You use fuel, so you have to learn to play smart and conserve sometimes; later in the game, you can find different accessories that allow you to \"Charge\" up to 500 fuel at a time, so it gets easier then.  You also perform combos, but the combos can lead to higher attack levels and even into Infinity Mode.  It's actually not as complicated as it may sound, but if you're expecting a button mashing RPG, you've come to the wrong place.ANIME CUT SCENESThere are several anime cut scenes located throughout the game, especially on the second disc.  They are nice, although for someone like me that just wants a good story and awesome gameplay, they're not all that necessary.  More on that later.MUSICThe music is composed by none other than Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda.  The soundtrack is AMAZING.  It was the one thing that kept me going through some of the game's rough spots, and I especially liked the vocal tracks (\"Stars of Tears\" did not make it into the game except as the instrumental \"Emotions\" world map theme, but the ending theme is still there.).  His themes for Grahf, Thames, and the love relationship between Fei and Elly (\"The Treasure Which Cannot Be Stolen\" and \"Shattering Egg of Dreams,\" among others.) were very well composed.  Some tracks remind me of Chrono Trigger, like Bart's theme (\"Bonds of Sea and Fire\") and \"Leftovers of the Dreams of the Strong,\" which sounds ironically similar to the theme of Guardia in Chrono Trigger.  \"The One Who is Torn Apart\" (played most during the \"Id\" encounters and Fei's revelatory scenes) reminds me of Zeal Palace and Magus' Castle from Chrono Trigger, respectively (ambiance and everything!).  My favorite track is probably \"Flight,\" which plays during some momentous fight scenes (one of them with a giant Chu-Chu...erm, k...).  The score as a whole is well-rounded and while the game could've used a couple more tracks to break up some of the monotony of the second disc, I have no complaints.  Yasunori Mitsuda is the man.NOW, ONTO SOME OF THE NEGATIVES...Despite my newfound love for the game, it does have its drawbacks.  Like many reviewers have already said, it has a LOT of dialogue.  For one thing---going back to the anime cut scenes---they didn't sync up the English voice acting with the scenes at all, which may throw a lot of you off; I didn't find it to be a huge hindrance, but it was a minor distraction.  Another thing with the dialogue was that once you reach the second disc, the first freaking half of it is basically a couple battles and a lot of \"chair\" scenes in which a particular character---for instance, Fei, Elly, or Citan---will sit in it with Fei's pendant in the background swinging, all the while said character explains what's going on.  There's a particular point when you discover Solaris using dead people as medicine and food, even going so far as to reference the \"Soylent Green\" movie, and reading about the further explanation of that was pointless.  During this time, also, is when you discover Deus is the reason some of the population starts mutating into zombies (to recollect them as part of its bio-mechanical being...yeah.), and that part I found particularly annoying (I also found it odd that Fei talks about killing the zombies off to save their souls, but when a ginormous zombie monster bursts out of nowhere to eat them, Fei's like \"OH NO!  We have to save them from the MONSTER!\"  Weren't you just discussing putting them out of their misery?  Am I just a cold-hearted you-know-what from playing too much Resident Evil?).  BUT, fair reader, ONCE you get to the point on Disc 2 where Fei's personality is explored, THEN it gets awesome again.  So, do be patient!One other complaint before moving on is that some of the characters are pretty much useless towards the end; I'm not going to say who, because maybe someone reading this will find (or have found) different strategies with which to beat the final hour of the game, but there were a couple that I started using at the start of their entry into the storyline, but quickly found that the later battles did not suit their fighting styles.  I would like feedback on this particular part of the game.OVERALLSo...after my rediscovery, do I highly recommend this game?  Well, it is still a difficult game to rate.  The pacing is a bit sluggish, which is the main drawback of this game.  It throws a lot at you at once in terms of story, and believe me, the spoilers I gave you aren't even half of the game.  I don't know if Square lost money during production, or they just ran out of time and couldn't smooth it over, but either way, the pacing will frustrate you for a time.  Also, I could've done without the anime cut scenes, despite how beautifully they're done...and like I said before, the minimal voice acting present is off-sync with the anime cut-scenes and switches to Japanese during the fighting parts, which can be a bit distracting at first.That being said, the game is infinitely better than I have painted it out to be before; the music's awesome AND diverse, the gameplay's addicting (when it's not sluggish), and the storyline is not only immersive, but very deep on both an emotional level and a philosophical one; its challenging of religious authority and support of the human condition deserves some commendation.  I also liked the love story, which plays out well despite some unnecessary angst right when Disc 2 begins.  The characters, for the most part, are very memorable; any time you actually make me CARE for the characters is a good thing!  If you can get past its flaws, the game will sweep you into its narrative.So, to put it simply, if you are a novice RPG goer, you might be turned off by it initially.  But if you've played a few RPGs, especially some classics like Final Fantasy 7 and Chrono Trigger, then by all means, get a copy of this game and enjoy it!If you're a gamer like me that was turned off by initial impression, I hope you've at least given the game a second chance.  It's a must-have for any fan of RPGs, and I hereby take back my statement that it was \"a mixed bag.\"  I'm glad to finally see why Xenogears gets the status it so richly deserves.My recommendations before/alongside this one are:Super Mario RPGChrono TriggerFinal Fantasy IV (II on SNES)Final Fantasy VI (III on SNES) or VII","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2003"}

This game, like most games to be fair was overhyped, but Force Unleashed was overhyped to an obscene degree. The game didn't live up to it unfortunately but this is not a bad game, a good weekend rental instead of purchase may be a better option. It's not what I would expect from a supposedly next-gen SW game. This game was more like a dark jedi's bad day at the office. The targeting system, well there may as well not be one, you have to get close enough to an enemy or an object. Most deaths result from not making jumps and falling into pits of stock planet footage. The story was okay though nothing approaching an epic. You don't really get the moral choices of being dark or light save for the end when it's really just a matter who you want to beat up the most: the Emperor or Vader. The Emperor of course isn't a weak senior citizen as he appears to be and Vader isn't some slow heavily armored guy just waving around his light sword. And the protagonist seems like a angst ridden teenager with a Romulan-like forehead. If you are a SW fan, then this game can be absolutely awful and you'll still enjoy, but really if you are a luke warm fan like myself who has marveled at the terrible things being chucked out from this franchise of late, then you may want to save your dough and rent it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Berlin L. Brown \"Ghost in the Shell\"","summary":"Great open world simulation, OK game","reviewText":"My review can be summed up with this; GTA5 is a great simulation, open world environment where you can interact with almost everything.  But it felt more like a demo than a full game.  I guess I would have felt better if I was expecting a simulation where I could drive around and stare off into the sunset.  I was expecting a complete and challenging game.  GTA5 is going to get good reviews and it may be a top ten ever game,  I just wish they did more than improve the visuals and expand the map.  The graphics, the textures, the movie sequences, the voice acting, the kinematic sequences, NPC characters driving and walking around are all great and probably superior to most other open world games, but that is all the praise I can give.  The actual game or any challenges in the game are non-existent.  There are no challenges in the side missions, there aren't any challenges in the main missions.  And for an open world, everything is heavily scripted.  Pick up this thing, here is the route, shoot at this guy, here is the gun, get in the plane, fly there, buy this, steal this.  Even if they didn't give the exact directions, even the toughest missions have you picking up 'car X' or 'car Y'.  Well how hard is that?  So what about the actual combat in the more comprehensive heist style missions?  The combat is definitely improved since the other GTAs and I am glad they give you the ability to crouch behind a wall, release and fire.  But this combat AI is laughable.  You may have 10-20 enemy guys out there but only one or two will shoot at time and awkwardly move to the next barrier.  The only challenge is that they throw dozens of characters at you but most can be taken out easily.  It all feels so scripted and almost boring.I have some suggestions for the next GTA.  I wish the world was truly interactive.  Like Fallout or Obvlivion, give the random NPC characters names and profiles.  Just like most average open world games developed in the last 20 years, the NPC characters in GTA5 randomly appear and go through their script.  It would be interesting if you randomly shot mayor Bob Jones of Los Santos and there is a funeral and media discussion, the city drops into chaos because the mayor is dead.  In Fallout, you can kill quest characters and just make due without that story line.  Also, I like how in Fallout, water, ammunition and misc items are all necessary to complete the game.  There is no reset button, if your character sucks or you can't gather the right items, it will be difficult progressing.With the GTA5 heist missions, you pick one or two members of the crew, out of a selection of two.  You pick up this truck, go through this entrance, shoot this guys, maybe the army or swarm of police show up.  But the game pushes you, what to get, where to go, how to get away.  How about this, rob this bank and that is it, if you screw up, you get to try a different strategy.- PROS:* Great world, great graphics* Great voice acting, interesting characters* Semi-interesting story between the three characters* Combat is finally improved* Sometimes the heavily scripted NPC characters do funny stuff- CONS:* Interaction with the open world is heavily scripted and purely stateless.  When you kill someone, start a fight with a gang member and die, everything resets.  It would be nice if it didn't operate that way.  It would be interesting if you kill a police member then the police go out of their way to screw with you for the rest of the game* Most of the game or side-missions feel like yet another adventure game.  Click a, b, move the joystick up, repeat, mission complete.* Combat is improved but the enemy AI is not very robust.  I died in the game, but I never had to improve my strategy to complete any mission.  I just went through the motions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2013"}

But to my surprise, i like it. Sure its not a numbered RE game but that doesnt mean it doesnt need any attention. The new feature to this game that I really love is that it is squad-based 3rd person shooter. So 3 other players can join you in campaign via online only. No split-screen play though.  There are a total of six playable characters each with their own special abilities/perks. Each ability can be upgraded by playing through the campaign and earning XP. You can also spend XP to unlock a variety of weapons from assault rifles to handguns. This adds to the replay value as you can play through missions again using different weapons. The campaign IS short in which I was able to complete within the day I bought it. Well if you want more, download the Echo Six expansion pack which you can play as a special forces team sent to investigate the outbreak. I have not bought it but it should add more hours of gameplay if you finished the U.S.S. (Umbrella Security Service) campaign and wanting more. I have not play any online multiplayer games so I cannot comment on it. When I said online multiplayer I meant Versus mode.

I think the rumble feature became a standard in the game systems that came after it such as the Nintendo Game Cube and Microsoft X Box. I think the rumble pack has so much rumble to it that you not only feel it but you actually hear it. It gives another great sound to make an even better audio experience. The games that work with the rumble pack are even more fun when you use it.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"\"missmegan301\"","summary":"Time to Party!","reviewText":"This was a great game.

Yes, Killzone 2 looks amazing, probably one of the best looking games of the generation (even 3 years later). Killzone 2 definitely goes for the \"cinematic\" philosophy of design, and it sure is nice to look at because of it.Unfortunately it seems that Guerrilla utilized all there talent in this single department, as nothing else about the game really stands out from the immense crowd that is the modern shooter. The premise is ridiculous from the get go: you play space marines who fight space nazis. This may not have been such a bad thing had the game not taken itself so seriously. But both space marines and nazis have been played out so much in modern shooters that their combination results in a feeling of staleness rather than potential freshness.What makes even less sense is the contemporary weapon set given to the players, which doesn't fit the space or the nazi themes. There isn't any creativity going on here in the weapons department, aside from a single gun you get later in the game that isn't really all that unique anyways. This is where the game could have really shined, but instead we get the usual assortments of assault rifles, smgs, shot gun, sniper, etc. Nothing you haven't seen before if you've ever played a shooter in the past 10 years.Another curiosity is that even though the game takes place on another planet, most of the time you'll be shooting it out in urban/industrial environments. You know, the same ones that EVERY SHOOTER EVER has taken place in. Sure, they're rendered better than any game before, but there's still no creativity here. Killzone 2 disappointingly takes no liberties with the potentially exotic setting. After you beat the game, there will be very few set-pieces that will stick out in your mind, because they all feel bland; just another brown or grey urban/industrial level...That's not to say that Killzone 2 is a bad game, because it's not. Everything on display is pretty much perfect. The game is great to look at, tight to control, enemy AI is great, guns are satisfying to shoot... But absolutely nothing on display here can't be found in almost any other shooter released in recent memory. Nothing at all sets this game apart from the pack. It's simply an old shoe that's been polished so much that there's hardly any leather left. If you're still new to the genre or you just need a mindless \"popcorn\" game to pass the time, Killzone 2 is definitely worth checking out. But for shooter vets or those looking for something fresh, Killzone 2 plays it a bit to safe to justify the waste of time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0038N0A24","reviewerName":"Alexander Lucard","summary":"Shockingly Good For a Licensed Game","reviewText":"Being a tie-in game for the movie of the same name, you can expect Toy Story 3 to follow the film's plot pretty much down the stretch. However, the main \"campaign\" mode leaves huge chunks of the film out, and focuses more on the action sequences. Most of these play out in a platformer-style of control, but there are a few stages that mix things up with stealth or shooting gameplay. All of the story missions are played via flashback with Hamm, the piggy bank, telling the other toys the story of the film. The missions can be picked off of a board-game style board, and you can go back and re-play the missions if you want to find more of the pickups. There is one serious problem though, and that is the size of the game. The main story mode can be beat in probably less than five hours by most people, and I'd bet that serious gamers can do it under four. An aggravating checkpoint and save system extends things a bit, but this game is not a long-term investment. There is the option for some two-player exploration, but that falls apart in most levels when it becomes obvious that the game is really meant for one player.There is also a free-play mode called Woody's Cowboy Roundup that works very much like an open-world game. In this, you pick from Woody, Buzz, or Jesse, and run around a wild-west themed area mining for gold, purchasing new buildings, and rescuing lost toys. This is fun, but it can get a bit repetitive. Still, this is an all-ages game, so having something that is completely kid friendly that you can do over and over again doesn't hurt.While the developers could have phoned in another summer movie tie-in game, Avalanche Software made some great choices backed up with some great assets from Pixar. Toy Story 3 might look like a simple platformer on the surface, but there is some hidden depth. The graphics are astounding in action and the sound is wonderfully done, using the voice actors from the films and some very close sound-alikes. Unfortunately, the game is brutally short and the campaign can be finished in an afternoon. Controls are mostly okay, but some loose jumping and a difficulty level that expects you to know what's coming will cause a few headaches. There is a free-play mode that extends the play time a bit, but eventually the grind of playing will cause you to put this one back in the toy chest.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"N. C. Hill \"Nchill\"","summary":"Same Game Formula, now with Fusion Preservatives!","reviewText":"Im a big fan of this series, i've stuck with it since the beginning and played all the different iterations of this game formula and it still holds up, but its appeal is starting to wane.  This is basically the same game repackaged with a different plot and an added feature called \"Fusions\" which allow you to combine each hero's powers together for some serious beat down.  There are less heroes to choose from this time around but i feel like the 24 they included are more polished and better represent the powers of the characters from the comics.  To be honest i was sold as soon as i found out Gambit was a playable character, its about flippin time!I guess i'll get the gripes out of the way so here goes.  One thing i hate about this game is the completely asinine character unlock codes and pre-order Juggernaut nonsense, all it does is piss people off.  I picked up this Xbox version with the Hulk code included inside, it makes you start the game and enter some ridiculous direction pad code to unlock the hulk....what the hell is the point in that??  Whats even worse is the people that wanted to wait to find out if this game was worth a shizzle before buying it are penalized because they didn't pre-order it, so no flippin Juggernaut for you.  As of now you can download a Juggernaut teaser that allows you to play with people that did pre-order so that they can rub it in your face that you didn't pre-order.  WTF?!?  The camera can be annoying at times, sometimes completely blocking your view and occasionally your character will just get stuck, which makes no sense to me.  It makes me wonder if they even play test these games anymore.Now gripes aside, this MUA2 just plain delivers the goods.  The graphics are improved, noticeable as soon as you start, with the exception of wolverine his mask just doesn't look right.  The powers and abilties are better represented this time around and with the destructive environments you will feel the differences in each character, i mean storm is actually powerful this time around and Iron Man's weapons actually kill enemies instead of just looking cool.  What really surprised me is the introduction of the fusion powers, its just plain good ole fashioned fun trying out each different hero combination just to see what will happen, for example Iron Man will fire a beam out of his hands while Captain America will deflect it with his shield vaporizing anything in between them, its just fun to watch.I can't say im a big fan of the civil war storyline as it limits what heroes you are able to add to your team depending on whether you choose pro-registration or anti-reg.  Overall i feel MUA2 is a fairly solid title, if it didn't have the fusion power feature it wouldn't be worth your time really as its basically a rehash of every game in the series before it including the Xmen Legend series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00319DX4W","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Truly Great Adventure","reviewText":"In the spirit of Prince of Persia and Ico, Enslaved is an epic adventure in a futuristic Garden of Eden.Concept:  9/10I didn't get this game when it first came out because I heard it was a \"platformer.\"  This conjures images of you trying to jump across chasms, falling, and starting over.  The title of the game is Enslaved, and who really wants to be enslaved?  But I picked it up for $10 and it turned out to be a sleeper hit.Story:  10/10You play a nomad adventurer named Monkey in a futuristic world where mankind has been enslaved by a mysterious entity called Pyramid, who is armed with an army of war mechs specifically designed to hunt down and capture humans.  The story begins with Monkey waking up aboard a slave ship and a beautiful saboteur / tech genius named Trip trying to escape and blowing up the ship in the process.  The couple survives the crash and Monkey wakes up wearing a slave headband, which forces him to obey Trip.  She needs his help to return to her homeland and promises to release him once they arrive.World:  10/10This is a post apocalyptic world, but instead of ruins and dust, the planet has been overgrown with lush vegetation.  The ruins are actually beautiful.  Scattered all over the ruins are tech orbs that Monkey can use to upgrade his abilities and there are also holographic masks, that give some insight to Pyramid's mysterious function.Gameplay: 9/10There are four basic types of gameplay:  Environmental Navigation, Combat, some hoverboarding, and a bit of Stealth.I say Environmental Navigation instead of Platforming because you can't fall by accidentally jumping in the wrong direction.  Money jumps from acrobatic prop to acrobatic prop as he works his way through beautiful environments.  In the later levels, there is some timing involved, but the navigation elements are actually fun and you can explore the ruins for hidden items.The Combat is limited in terms of moves, but each move has a tactical function.  This isn't one of those games where you get 50 xxxyxyxxyyyyx, attacks and they all pretty much do the same thing.  You get a wide arcing XXX attack, a linear damaging YY attack, a block, a counterattack, an evade, an evade attack, a charge up stun attack that stuns enemies or temporarily removes shields, a 360 knockback, and a super attack that charges up by hitting enemies.You typically fight 1-4 enemy mechs at a time and their attacks and defenses perfectly match your attacks and defenses.  Enemies have states when they are blocking and they are vulnerable.  Their position around Monkey determines if it's best to use XXX to damage a few of them or YY to heavily damage one of them.Attacks can either be blocked or evaded, and a few more powerful enemies have a glowing red unblockable attack that Monkey must dodge.  Some enemies have glowing shields in front of them, so Monkey must either use a stun attack to remove the shield, or quickly evade behind the enemy and strike it from behind.Monkey's staff can also be used to shoot two types of ammo.  Blue, stuns and removes shields, and red damages enemies.This simple system forces the player to constantly make decisions about their attacks and defenses, which makes combat engaging.  There isn't one all powerful move, instead there is a `best' move for every 2 seconds of gameplay.There are a few levels where Monkey can use a hoverboard and explore or chase bosses.  The controls feel like a loose skateboarding game, which is fine most of the time.  There are 2 levels in the game where Monkey must chase after bosses over difficult terrain while gliding over speed boosts.  If he misses a few of them or misses a jump, he dies and must start over.  These two levels are frustrating, especially on HARD Mode, where you have to be perfect.There is a bit of stealth in the game, where Monkey has the option to either fight mechs head on, or navigate around them, by finding the right path through the environment.  There may be a partially hidden hand hold somewhere that leads to rooftops.  Most of the time, I just fought the enemies because it was fun.Graphics:  10/10The environmental graphics are great, but where the game really shines is in the facial animations.  The same facial capture technology that was used in Avatar was used in this game.  As a result, the acting is the best that I've seen in a video game.  The scenes are also mo-capped, so the character's body language isn't just a bunch of recycled animations.Sound:  8/10There's some good acting, some decent ambient music, and the explosions bring the action to life.Maturity:  TeenThere are a few appropriately placed swear words and some fantasy violence when the main characters get killed, other than that, it's really just a guy and a girl navigating through environments and smashing robots.Replay Value:  3/10Aside from harder difficulty levels, there really is no reason to replay the game.  It takes 8-10 hours to finish the game on Normal Mode, depending on how much you explore and search for items.Overall:  9.5/10Enslaved really captures the feeling of a romantic fantasy adventure with action, suspense, and comedy.  The gameplay is streamlined but engaging, the graphics and sound bring the world to life, and the acting is great.  For $10 you can't go wrong!Buy this game if you like good adventure stories.Buy this game if you like Prince of Persia or Ico.Buy this game if you like adventures with dynamic melee combat.Rent it if you just want to blow through the story in 8-10 hours.Avoid this game if...  You know, I can't think of a reason to avoid this game, especially at $10.

This school of thought is no different with Tekken 5 that just does what its predecessors did with more characters (need never buy Tekken 4 again) has the improved graphics engine look but there is no doubt that Tekken 6 will have everything that I am asking for and is sitting on a hard drive inside Namco HQ right now as we speak waiting to grab an extra few bucks when this quick fix entry is dead, so what if you included Tekken 1, 2 and 3 on this DVD - if we wanted that we would have asked for it!  We WANT TAG. We wanted this as 4. Delivering on 4 that was half of this is just begging for attention from me, so Namco is going to get it!Fans of the series know what I am talking about. Sadly Tekken is not what is used to be because it does not lead anything anymore... or should I say for long. TAG is the best Tekken game that is let down in the graphics department (moving map backgrounds and character animations) but the map background bug I have noticed is back in Tekken 5, so I question how much is `new' here. Also the graphics are not beyond what \"Virtual Fighter 4: Evolution\" had to offer and is the main reason why Tekken needed a graphics boost in the first place and now, in 2005, Tekken matches VF4, maybe a little better detail in Tekken 5, but this asks the question what more does 2005 have to offer? I would guess lots better than Tekken 5. If you look closely at the new map impact system you can see that once something cracks, the crack effect disappears after making its impact so after a few games it sort of looks like the animation is coming from your characters more than the maps. I don't think the new world smashing system is wrong, it just could be better at this stage, however like Tekken 4 things do break and there seems to be more of it.The characters in Tekken 5 and the quality of the animations are the only reason to jump at getting Tekken 5, but when you have opened everything and played all the models and your friends have had a few rounds, it starts to sink in that this is what Tekken 4 should have been, last year. To be honest Namco's Tekken entries since the initial release of the PS2 have done nothing but knock this fighter flat on its face, but before we get to the cons lets talk a little about the pros. Tekken 5 corrects a number of Tekken game play issues, like Tekken 4's limitation to a shocking 10 players, reducing it by 20 from the previous 30 player staggering TAG entry, Tekken 5 now has the same. Tekken 4 also gives us an extra one-player level fight setting and improves on the graphics, even the colourful design looks better, provides more moves for each character (but not much just a little more) and corrects the TAG fight move-sharing problem meaning that most characters do not share many moves which is good. So if you are looking for more unique moves per character then Tekken 5 has it (4 is gone), however TAG wins Tekken 5 in terms of its lifespan and game play (even if you own Tekken 5 or 4 friends will still ask you to put this disc in), so the tag game play makes TAG a better buy. Tekken 5 does not solve the old `this character is better than that character' syndrome that 4 solved. Some characters just rule others by default of button bashing, Tekken 4 is more balanced than 5, but 5 is a more fluid fighting game when characters are not mismatched.However TAG rulez Tekken 5 and this is bad news for Namco because this game is not even remotely close to the kind of quality that they could have delivered on... and believe it or not, Tekken TAG isn't a whole pile better either. The PS2 has not had the good Tekken gamer it deserves which is bad because Tekken is for the PS2! This one gets 3 stars like 4 because it is nothing NEW and by this stage should be. I know they are just sitting on TAG for 6, so BAH! AVOID if you can unless you really need a game (get MGS3: Snake Eater instead) and certainly wait for other 2005 games, get this when it goes cheap platinum style.Pros:- Better graphics than TAG and 4.- 30 characters and some new ones.- Did not deliver anything expected of the Tekken series by 2005.- Nice animationsCons:- NO TAG!- Background glitches and character mismatching are back.- Done it all before.- We know they just want to sell TAG as Tekken 6. So wait for 6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2005"}

It's very rarely that I'll play a game all the way through, three times in a row. I guess Freedom Force has that effect on you.  There are several aspects to this game that make it universally appealing - you definitely don't have to be a hardcore gamer to enjoy Freedom Force.Firstly, it's important to note that you definitely don't need a high-powered PC to play this game. If you have a Pentium III processor or faster you'll have no troubles at all running it. The graphics are truly beautiful, and it's obvious that Irrational Games have put a lot of work into eliminating all the annoying graphical glitches that sometimes mar a 3D-game such as this. The music and the sound also deserve praise - it reminds me exactly of the old Superfriends shows from the 1980's.An interesting aspect of the game is just how important a part teamwork plays in the strategies you choose. It's virtually impossible to accomplish any mission in the game with only one hero. Irrational have also made it difficult to create a hero with  overwhelming superpowers, as the Campaign points for such a hero would be too high, making it impossible to recruit them.There seem to a proliferation of websites on the internet that allow you to download models based on your favourite superheroes... I've already downloaded models for Superman, Spiderman and Batman already. Thanks to the in-game character editor (and a little judicious file copying), it's entirely possible to have the entire DC & Marvel superheroes fighting alongside the Freedom Force. There's nothing cooler than seeing Superman fly over to a villain and deliver a massive super punch - awesome stuff.Irrational Games (the creators of Freedom Force), have recently released an Editor, that allows the user to modify every single aspect of the game - characters, powers, missions. The editor is 12MB in size, but it?s definitely worth the download. The only problem is that there are still a few major bugs in the program. For instance, a character modified using the editor can't walk on certain terrain (eg. Snow, ice, metal, plastic or wood). Hopefully, Irrational will fix these problems soon.It's fantastic to see that such an innovative and creative game has gotten such a positive response from so many people. Here's hoping Irrational Games get the support from their financial backers to release the planned sequels. I can't wait to see what these guys come up with next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2002"}

Full of noir. Noir-tastic.","reviewText":"If you played Max Payne, and I'd highly recommend you do before MP2, you'll find MP2 to be just about as good a continuation of the first game as you could want.I'd recommend playing Max Payne first, simply because many of the same characters make appearances in MP2, and the development of their characters is, in many cases, a continuation from their appearances in the first game.From a gameplay perspective, Max Payne 2 is more of a continuation of Max Payne than a really &quot;new&quot; game. Bullet Time has been improved, and becomes a more interesting experience in itself than the relatively simplistic shoot-dodging of the first game. You'll also play as characters other than Max, which normally would be really disorienting, but fits within the structure of the game.I've heard some people complain about the revisiting of environments throughout the game - you'll come back to the same locations several times - but it doesn't feel &quot;lazy&quot; to me. Every time you revisit an area, either it has changed, or your perspective of it has. The areas are never the same twice through, and as a result, it feels more like an evolving place, than a series of &quot;levels&quot;.There's not really a whole lot of other &quot;noir&quot; games out there, and though the over-noir atmosphere may be a turn-off for some, it's one of the things I love most about the series.

I've seen every zombie movie i can get my hands on. Some are better than others, both games and movies. I am a huge fan of the Left 4 Dead series and at the time of Left 4 Dead 2, that was the new gold standard of zombie games. This game came out and had a ton of mixed reviews. I was extremely hesitant to buy this because of all the horrible things I've heard about it. Now... the key thing that made me steer clear of it for so long was i heard about the game's weapon durability system. I bought dead rising the day it came out on full price and loved it. i played for hour upon zombie slashing hour. then i backed myself into a corner... the game has a time limit which i HATE. and there also is a weapon durability system in that game. there is a spot in the mall where there is a sword store. i would fill up my entire inventory with swords and slash my way through the MASSIVE hordes of zombies. But I noticed I'd only make it about 300 yards before all my swords are broken and now i am brains and guts a la mode. And i always said, if there was no time limit, more side missions and slightly less zombies, this would be the best zombie game ever made. Well, several years later, my undead apocalyptic prayers were finally answered. The weapon durability in this game can be an annoyance but is tenfold of dead rising. This game does have it's flaws but what game doesn't. The graphics are a solid 8/10. the soundtrack is 8/10. the difficulty isn't impossible but challenging enough to keep you interested. they have an exorbitant amount of weapons, interesting and unique characters that each have a expertise in a field of combat. there are a ton of side missions to keep you busy and a great online/offline campaign. I would recommend any zombie lover buy this game and give it an open minded try regardless of all the terrible reviews. I did and I'm hooked and couldn't be happier.

This game doesn't even follow the poor family's fate after the disaster. Except, maybe, for that easter egg at the beginning. If you can count that.I began this game as a newcomer to survival horror games with zombies in them. I was pleasantly surprised.  The graphics of this game are beautiful and I kind of like the story.  The combat system is heavily reliant on melee and weapons degenerate with use.  Good thing you have a workbench to upgrade and repair your weapons.  Dead Island had an almost RPG feel to it. You kept track of quest in a log and had more free-reign than most games of this genre.  One thing I liked about this game was the co-op play. It was great to suddenly see a friendly face ready to stand by your side and shoot zombie's heads off.  However, I disliked that fact that you could not have LOCAL co-op. Sometimes me and my friends, who don't have xbox live, just wanted to get together and kill zombies.  I found the vehicles a little hard to control and just clumsy. The game itself felt unpolished.  The replay value is just non-existent. Don't purchase his game, rent it.Parents, this is not for children under the age of 13 or sensitive to blood and death.  It also contains strong language and bringing a drunken tart champagne. Cuz \"Svetty\" f'in loves her champagne.  This game is also not for those who want to purchase based on the trailer. Dead Island is COMPLETELY different from the trailer. Just want to warn you folks. Don't buy it based off those expectations from the heart hitting trailer.For me, Dead Island earned an 4 out of 5. While it wasn't a perfect game and had TONS of flaws, the combat was BLOODY GOOD FUN.  Whether you are slicing heads off with a machete or shooting furious, fast moving bullets, it was sickeningly satisfying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2012"}

They play along side you, do really smart tactical things (most of the time), make useful comments (along with other more \"colorful\" comments) etc.  You really develop an affection for them after awhile.  Another very cool feature is that if a player drops out, the game senses this after a short while, and \"demotes\" that player to being an NPC.  Then when and if the player returns, he or she is free to resume their game by taking back control from the NPC they were previously playing.The game is filled with really thoughtful multi-player touches like that which keeps the game fun.

{"product_name":"B003EZ1KGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"This is a MUST Play for any Shooter game Enthusiats.","reviewText":"To give one word describing Spec Ops the Line's release into an over saturated military shooter game market, is none other than \"wonderful.\" Now, I know you are thinking \"wait, why wonderful? Wouldn't that word be pertaining to something positive or gleeful nature? Not some 3rd person shooter that shows the horrors of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and war in general?\" It would yes, but the developers Yager and publisher's 2K games unleashed a single player experience that needs to be played at some point for the violent military shooter game enthusiast.The main thrill of Spec Ops The Line's firefights are pretty much hit or miss. Where it misses, the game immediately makes it up in the dark, gritty narrative presentation. At first you think this trio of Delta squad operatives are going to hint at the typical cockiness we've seen in games like Gears of War or other first person shooters. But as the story progresses into it's Heart of Darkness theme, the main characters start to show very realistic emotional and physical responses to what they do to enemies and civilians in Dubai. The dialogue is once again top notch with Nolan North in probably one of his best motion captures and voice overs. Please note that this game's content is very Mature rated. Profanity is abundant and the violent imagery is tremendous. The scenery of post sandstorm Dubai is beautiful. Lots of debris \"invisible walls\" persist, but the amount of detail to various locations are displayed dramatically and strangely beautiful. When playing on PC, the in game character models are very well done. Most notably is the transition the main characters endure and how their models change as the story goes on. Sand plays as the new destructive barrel gimmick and I welcomed the idea of shooting glass to have sand crashing down burying enemy soldiers. The music soundtrack helps the atmosphere while in game with very familiar tracks by well known artists. The original score created by the development team adds the perfect desperate and \"time is running out\" mood. Players who watched Apocalypse, Now! will notice these music elements fit perfectly. Spec Ops the Line is officially the \"Silent Hill\" of military shooter games.The most discussed subject of criticism this game received was it's very lackluster multiplayer. I did not touch one bit of it because my intent was to play the campaign. In honesty, they should have taken it completely out. Not every game that involves shooting has to have the element of multiplayer. Most cases, it can't help a game's longevity, especially if you direct your marketing to the single player portion. Yager could have focused more on the single player to polish up loose ends and add more play time. The biggest issue I had was with the control. It handled okay on PC. My hiccups were sometimes trying to aim right while messing with cover and sprinting. It felt weird, but it is was a small issue. The AI for this game will not be like Call of Duty or Battlefield variety. Sometimes it will be easy to dominate, other times you will be aggravated at the random difficulty increase of trying to flank while being barraged by bullets. It did get old watching the screen change color with the sound muffling mechanic when close to death. I've never been a fan of these, but 3rd person shooter developers (Naughty Dog or Sucker Punch for example) love to include these annoying effects. The strangest moment I had was after reading a loading screen tip about a certain sniper rifle able \"to kill any enemy no matter what location,\" and a direct chest and head shot on an heavy soldier didn't allow that. The final gripe I had was the quick slow down in time after getting a random head shot that the developers thought would add to the grittiness in game. The over the top gimmick of a headshot resulting the head completely blown off from a single bullet be if from a M1A4 assault rifle or M-9 pistol was not needed. This mechanic fails when you look at a body model's lack of design effort. It's just weird.The story gets dark and morbid fast, and it's nice to see how your squad mates react to the destruction you wrought upon enemies and Dubai itself. This is a rare gem in these days of shooter video games. I loved how Yager wasn't afraid to show how screwed up a militaristic action could go then take the action seriously. Killing is never easy and the justifications of what is murder and righteous start to blur each other out. If you thought the airport level/scene in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was shocking, just wait till you experience certain parts in Spec Ops The Line. The game version I played had Steamworks support, which is an immediate plus in my book. I personally would not have paid full price for this game. If on a Steam or Amazon sale, I would consider purchasing it for a weekend play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

I loved the original Force Unleashed, it had both stunning visuals, amazing force effects and a great story. This game to have great visuals and some good force effects, the problem is that there is hardly any story, for the simple reason of the game just being so extremely short. Now in the original part of the fun was unlocking all of the Apprentice's cool force powers, you sort of do some unlocking here to, but the game is just to short for any type of character development.Let me try to illustrate how short this game is. My and my hubby played through the entire game in 3 and a half hours, and let me tell you that we are not good players, we play for the story so a real gamer could probably do it in one and a half hours. Now I know what you are thinking with a storyline so short there have to be multi player, different game play modes, anything to make this game's entertainment value last for more than a few hours, well no there is not, there are a few challenges and a handful of trophies to unlock and that is it. When we finished this game and the credits begun to roll me and hubby actually tried to restart from the last checkpoint as we first believed there had to be some glitch, that it was not possible for a full prized Playstation 3 game to be this short, when we realized there where no glitch we just felt cheated. Yes that is right, I would go so far as to call this game a scam to harvest money of the popularity of the first game while providing no content for the second one.To be fair to the game I have to add that what there is of the game is good, the graphics are beautiful, the sort storyline is good, the controls work wonderfully and had this been a download off Playstation store or a budget title sold as a add on story to the first game then I would have had no problems with it, but that they dare to charge full price for this claiming that it is a full game, that is just an insult to players.If you can find this game very cheaply it might be worth having for the short but good story, or if you can find it for rent you might enjoy it. However be aware that this is not a full game. I have never seen a modern game this short, this game is an attempt to milk money out of fans of the first game while putting in minimal effort. To sum up my feelings on this game let me just say that I am disappointed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2011"}

I received the Steam code for this with the GPU I bought. I haven't gotten too far yet, so will update this when I finish.The graphics are very good. Especially little effects like snow. One suggestion I have is to update to Nvidia's newest driver, because some settings will create issues with older drivers even if they list support for this game. Even on my GTX 770 I only get about 45 FPS max settings. That does create an issue for me though, because I can't turn vert sync on without creating graphic issues during gameplay, and during cut-scenes I shoot up to 230+ FPS. Lots of screen tearing during cut-scenes.Gameplay is fun, but I made the mistake of setting hard difficulty. They took the lazy way and simply reduced your hp and increased damage taken, and higher NPC HP as well. It really just makes this game less fun, not actually more challenging. And once you start in hard mode it doesn't let you switch to an easier mode. Need to delete the save profile and start over. I was hoping hard difficulty required timing on things such as counter, but no. You just spam it until attacked. Counter was poorly designed in general... when facing many NPCs you basically have to spam it and then take a few shots in rare occasions where you get an opening. When facing bosses and other NPCs you end up having to stun spam the boss (who is immune to counter) so you can continue spamming counter, or they will hit you. You can roll away... but if you are doing that you can't really do damage since things tend to constantly attack. Just a lot of single button spamming and not a whole lot of strategy. Not so much a problem on normal because everything dies a lot faster, but really annoying on hard. I normally set all games to their hardest setting, but this one it just isn't fun.I suggest buying this game, but don't play it on hard.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"A Fantasy RPG Dream Come True - seriously","reviewText":"INTRODUCTION - SETTING THE MOODHey, I apologize in advance for the super-long review but this is an immense game so maybe it deserves a long review. I'll see if I can abbreviate it a little but I'm afraid it will stay 'long' no matter what I do.Hmmm... I worked so hard to bring my beloved Uchigatana to a +6 but now Ben, Bladwin's brother - they are both blacksmiths - suggests that I give it to him and he's going to make a Crescent Uchigatana +1 out of it. A PLUS ONE out of my +6? Yes, my kids advise, go for it. While it's true that the Plus One Crescent does only 75 damage vs. my +6's 153, my current level of magic 35 should add at least 92 points of magic attack to the physical damage and, with the help of a few dozen Darkmoon stones (lots of Grim Reapers had to die for me to harvest them) and less than 10,000 souls (a bargain) I can immediately upgrade it to Crescent +3 and with THAT weapon, my friends, it only takes one quick slash to dispose of a silver skeleton and I can do away more than half a dozen low-level zombies with one swing. And, did I mention that it will slowly restore my MP (magic points) while I'm wearing it so I don't really need to keep the Fragrant Ring on and I could use the Sharp Magic ring instead to further boosts my magic strengths including Uchigatana's power but, true, it WILL lower my magic defenses. Or use the Thieves' Ring while in Queen's Tower prison so that the lovely bell-ringing octopus-head prison guards (good looking girls with a passion for electrocuting and stabbing while hugging you tight) won't notice me. And the Thieves' Ring seems to do well with those giant flying stingrays. They do notice me eventually but it makes them less vigilant so there are fewer of those 15-foot long, self-homing spikes they keep shooting at me when they get angry or suspicious.Did I say too much? Then, let me say this. Granted, I'm a slow player because I really like to enjoy my games so maybe this is not typical but, after almost 100 hours of play, I'm probably 20-30% into the FIRST round of playing. It's true - after you finish the game, you get to play it again as it gets even harder.BRIEFLYDemon's Souls is, in my view, one of the best fantasy RPGs that ever came to a game console. If you don't mind stabbing, slashing, shooting, cleaving, crushing, tearing, punching, scratching, infecting, slicing, burning or poisoning your enemies (and have the same thing done to you) and watching them die as they bleed, scream, decompose and sometimes howl  in agony or even beg for mercy. And you'll be facing several classes of zombies, gargoyles, giant flying stingrays, knights in shining or all-black armors swinging what you could safely call 'weapons of mass destrctions' in the shape of ten-foot long meat cleavers at you, leeches, rats, blobs with shields on top of them, daemons of all shapes an sizes, grim rippers, octopus-headed ladies, immensely powerful fire-breathing dragons, giant steel spiders, huge worms with human faces.Coming from someone who's played the Ultima series way back in the 80's and who's still waiting for the next in the Scrolls of the Elders, having enjoyed Oblivion more than any other console RPG, saying that Demon's Souls is 'awesome' should mean something. But, I was trying to briefly describe the game so, here it is, the story line in a paragraph, as dark and impossibly complicated as it could possibly come out of Japan. A king attempts to keep his kingdom - Boletaria - prosperous by means of some dark rituals involving the consumption of souls which, eventually, awakens the Old One, a great demon whose awakening unleashes lesser but still immensely powerful demons who quickly begin feasting on the regular people souls themselves while the kingdom is enveloped by a mysterious fog, isolating it from the rest of the world. None but one who went into the fog ever returned and that one told the story - everyone in Boletaria is now insane and, unless someone does something, the fog is likely to spread and envelop the entire world. And that's where you, the player, get involved so your mission is to talk the Old One into going back to sleep and maybe save the world.MY EVALUATIONIt's strange how a game that's so unforgiving and that requires you to fight so many battles again and again until you achieve perfection - only to have to fight them some more - can become so addictive and almost obsessively so. There are three gamers in our family and not only do we wait for our turns but we watch each other playing, share 'funny stories' and tips involving gameplay and lose a lot of sleep when we can afford it and sometimes when we can't. It's probably illogical but, having to fight the same battles many times is not only immersive but it's actually fun and rewarding. On the third or fourth try you know exactly how to defeat the Grim Reaper and you know each individual Gargoyle's style and capabilities and you can play each battle in many different ways by slightly changing your tactics and strategies and the weapons you use until you achieve the perfect stab or slash or cast your spell at the time and place needed for it to hit the mark and to maximum damage. The only thing... before you get to the Grim Reaper you must first annihilate a few dozen other enemies, every single time.And did I mention that that worlds of Boletaria are simply Awesome? Exploration and discovery are a joy in this game only balanced by the overwhelming sense of fear, dread and desolation oozing out of it. Most of your enemies don't only die when you dispose of them, but they go screaming, screeching or howling. Their bodies bleed and, through the controller, you can almost feel the the flesh tearing apart or stabbed by your blade or their armor breaking into pieces.Being so hard to master - but not impossible because I won't consider myself a great player - there is a great sense of accomplishment every time a new boss is defeated, a weapon is upgraded and tried out in the field or a new location is conquered.I can't give too much praise to the online play elements. You are NEVER alone in Demon's Souls. Other players can watch you and you can see their ghostly outlines as they play. You can leave messages to warn others of dangers and... you can see how they die or sometimes commit suicide. You can help others and sometimes you must defend yourself from those attempting to invade your world and destroy you. And all is smooth and so well integrated into the game's atmosphere that, in the rare occasions when our PS3 loses its network, all seems disturbingly quiet and lonely.While nothing is perfect and nothing can be perfect and without having finished the game yet, I would say that Demon's Souls is without a doubt a top RPG for the PS3 platform.GAMESPACEYou act in 5 'worlds' or locations:  the Boletarian Palace, the Stonefang Tunnel, the Tower of Latria, the Shrine of Storms and the Valley of Defilement and you can cross from one world into another via the Nexus, a safe space, to the extent that anything built on top of the Old One can be safe, where you do most housekeeping chores. You can move relatively freely inside each world to the extent that you don't mind fighting... everybody all the time and there are gates that take you farther (usually deeper) into the worlds IF you manage to defeat the bosses guarding them.Along the way, and usually following a fight, you find weapons and armor or items that may help you upgrade your weapons or armor and you decide how to manage your possessions but the main currency in the worlds of Boletaria is now 'souls'. Everyone is after them and the only way you can survive is to get them, usually by killing your opponents and to spend them on things that you need.But this is only scratching the surface. Your eventual goal is to calm down the Old One by defeating and killing the demons that feed him souls and, as expected, this is not exactly a walk in the woods. How about a walk in swamps infested by some of the most foul and poisonous and or disease spreading critters you could never imagine? Or exploring deep and dark tunnels where ghosts and Grim Reapers live, or some immense prison where all have lost their minds and the warden ladies wear tentacles on their heads? Or a mine where... you guessed it right, everyone is insane and they keep acting as if they were working but they will always take a break so that they can chase you around, throw some fireballs at you or drop boulders the size of trucks on you? And if you think that the 'surface' is safer, think huge dragons capable of completely incinerating your with one casual sneeze, or armored and well-armed skeletons always in a bad mood.GAMEPLAYAfter you create your character - name, gender, class, looks - you start with very little but, as you gather souls, you pay the blind lady who doesn't look like much but almost everything here is deceiving and she will raise your soul level, allowing you to improve on ability: vitality, endurance, strength, intelligence, magic, faith, dexterity, luck and you will need these abilities to be able to cast spells use certain weapons and generally survive in a world in which there are very few you could call 'friends'.You progress by improving yourself and your weapons and defeating the various bosses. Doing so is important because the bosses block access to areas where... the next boss can be found.Once you get killed, something that happens often, you lose the souls that you accumulated and wake up in the Nexus in 'soul form'. And there are ways to regain your body, usually by defeating a boss or... HELPING someone else defeat a boss but acting in human form must be a well-thought decisions. You do have more 'health points' as a 'body' but you are also weaker and while in a body form your world is open to invasion from other players out there. They can show up and kill you and, every time you die (or when you do bad things) the world you died in turns a little 'darker'. And the darker the world, the tougher your opponents become and... you are more likely to find 'good stuff'.While in 'soul' form, you can volunteer to help other players defeat bosses or simply ride along with them. The reward is that you are revived in body form if, when summoned, you help the other player defeat a boss or maybe defeat an invader who teleported into his world to kill him.Now, just to make it all a lot more fun, while you are online, the makers of Demon's Souls have the ability to control the so-called 'world tendency' in each of the five worlds, independently of your own actions so a pure-white world may suddenly turn darker and more dangerous or vice-versa.And this is not all. While playing, you can see the 'blood stains' of the heroes who died on that particular spot. You touch it and you see the last seconds that preceded that hero's death. And you can leave messages to warn others and, you can see in real time, the ghostly images of other players fighting monsters or just running around as you are minding your own business.And, of course, every time you leave a world for the safety of the Nexus, ALMOST everything other than the bosses and some of the NPCs resets and respawns. So you will be fighting the same battles over and over and over again, using different tactocs, improving your skills until you approach perfection and achieve elegance.And... how about whole the game resetting itself? It's true, or so I heard that, after you complete the game you can retain some of your hard-earned possessions and skills and go for an 'encore' but a bit harder this time.THE PAIN FACTORThis is one of the most brutal and unforgiving games I've ever played. And I'm not talking about the slaying of zombies or slimy creatures at almost every turn and having to do it repeatedly. Demon's Souls is unforgiving to the player because nothing but complete dedication and near-perfection would do.The tutorial is probably the threshold that's the hardest to cross. You start weak and almost unarmed and you mission is not only to survive - which, if you are successful, you won't - but also to defeat a mysterious monster that's almost nothing but slime, near-impenetrable armor and dozens of extra-long spears and do it in near-complete darkness. Saying that it's frustrating it's an understatement. I would have given up if it weren't for my kids who won their first victory before I did and motivated me to continue.And the hardship continues and only grows after that. Unlike most other games, you can't just save once you defeat an opponent and establish a safe point to restart from. You are in that world until you are killed and lose your hard-earned souls or you return to the Nexus on your own but, remember, every time you come back from the Nexus, all the monsters you killed except for the bosses are there challenging you again and you have to kill them again. But, not everything resets itself completely. Usually 'the good stuff' only presents to you once or twice, IF you are lucky but the bad guys are always there to challenge you again and, if the world turns dark on you, to maybe slice you and dice you a few times before you develop some new and better tactics to defeat them for the 100th time again.VIOLENCEI believe I mentioned this all throughout my review but maybe the level of violence merits its own heading. There is A LOT of it in this game and all of it is graphic. I believe there is a setting that would hide 'bleeding' but with or without that, there was a reason it was rated 'M' as in 'mature'. So, anyone who doesn't feel comfortable about killing tens of thousands of soulless, computer generated creatures, don't buy this game.TECHNICAL MERITDemon's Souls was made for the PS3 exclusively and it shows. The graphics and animations are simply breathtaking and, unlike the multi-platform Oblivion where 'fire' and 'smoke' could only be done at the expense of slowing everything to a crawl and the objects in the the distance became usually blurred, the world of Demon's Souls is almost always crisp and responsive visually, it rarely skips a frame and it never slows down, even when dozens of characters are present and moving independently on the screen.Add to the above some of the most realistic sound effects and 'break and shatter' graphics, with the audio-visual experience enhanced by the controller perfectly synchronize vibrations that allow you to 'feel' the blows as your shield blocks them.Unlike many other RPG worlds where a lot of the landscape and the dungeons are cookie-cutter reassemblies of a limited number of elements, the world of Boletaria appears to be fully, uniquely custom-designed. Very little repeats and every new location you discover is different and usually surprisingly different from anything else in the game.FIVE STARSOn a 1-100 scale, I would rate Demon's Souls as a 95+. The game is remarkably bug free and the instances where characters do silly things because they can't climb a boulder or can't make a turn are rare enough for the game to stay immersive. I already know that I'll be spending more hours on Demon's Souls than on any other PS3 RPG or any other type of games I own so far.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

Here is my response to both the positives and negatives.I agree that the unforgiving and non-adjustable difficulty in Demon's Souls is beyond brutal. That having to start from the beginning of a level every time you die is cruel, the potential of losing all your \"souls\" (which is the in-game currency for both leveling and equipment upgrades) can be devastating, when you die it is frustrating, not being able to save your progress mid level is unfair. I have felt such feelings of anger, and literal rage when playing Demon's Souls that I have screamed into the couch like a sad and desperate 5 year old. Mind you I have not behaved  in such a childish way since I was a kid  playing the many insanely hard games on the original NES. Seriously,  I have never had to endure such sadistic torture at the hands of a game in my 25+ years of gaming. Call me or anyone else who plays Demon's Souls a masochist, but you know what? I will keep coming back for more. You know why? Because even at the highest level of difficulty most games these days are a walk in the park. Demon's Souls is a rarity largely for one simple reason, it is challenging. To beat this game is a badge of honor unlike ALL mass produced games of today. Saying that you beat \"God of War 3\" or \"Fall Out New Vegas\" bears you the gamer little stock in knowing you did something that everyone else who bought the game did, granted they are fun and excellent games in their own right though beating them means very little. Not like in the old days of gaming, a time when reaching the final boss, and beating that boss actually meant something. You impressed your friends, you took stock in your polished skills and the time spent overcoming the game. And you know what, that is a good feeling. Here is another analogy, yes going to a state park and observing the beauty of its waterfalls and vistas feels nice and is enjoyable. Though while another experience in nature, say climbing Mount Everest is not about the majesty of the views and fun family time, it is about the blood spilled, the almost unyielding suffering of the ascent, and finally overcoming the greatest challenge the world offers in \"Climbing\".  Where the state park is your \"Fallouts\" and \"God of War's\", Mount Everest is \"Demon's Souls\". I can say from my experience that it is the hardest I have ever played and to defeat it represents the pinnacle of skill in 3rd person rpg/action strategic combat \"Gaming\".Challenge yourself, feel the rage, and feel the utter joy that follows overcoming what was once perceived as impossible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

Clearly, the game came out years ago, and I am just now solving it, long after most of the buzz has died down (for 2, anyway) .  Yet, there are people still reviewing this game in the last few days, and laying claim that it is the best game they've played.Well, because it is.  I've been playing games since pre-Atari 2600 days, and I can honestly say that this is the culmination of gaming history up until this point.  It is the best example of multi-genre excellence I've ever seen, and it sucked me in for over 50 hours, first time around.From the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way.  Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic (Uncharted comes to mind, as does Bioshock) but Ive never been pulled into a game with a \"need to play\" like ME2 has done.  It does almost everything to a \"10\", and even some minor quibbles are tolerable as the story develops into the richest gaming experience you might have on a console to date.The diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it.  The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on.  I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction. The \"choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say.That's just one part of the mix, and it all blends to make the game what it is.  From solidly envisioned sound effects for weapons and vehicles to the dark ambient beats at the club on Omega, sound was as well thought out as the rest of the game.  Graphically, it is gorgeous, and even with the extreme size of the game (settings and worlds), still makes its mark as one of the best looking to date.  Gameplay is never too far from the cutscenes in its graphical quality. Background rendering is fantastic, and close-ups of faces...well, the resolution is as high-def as you'd want it, edging closer and closer to photo-realistic.Gameplay is varied, but never boring (except one mission, which I would still do again), and its mixed up enough to keep it fresh.  The only hazy bit, control-wise, was the land-shuttle piloting, but it can be forgiven.  Main missions, loyalty missions, side missions, mining, collecting...it has it all.  First person shooting takes a forefront to the RPG side, but I think it keeps it moving, and there is enough strategy involved for me.When a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job. This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something.  Many say we are in the true golden-age of television, and I think this can also be said of video games, which have now reached a level that has begun to rival anything you can watch as entertainment.  Its an exciting time to play, and even more by the fact that I am sure Mass Effect 3 will once again raise the bar for this type of experience.  Even if it were identical in all aspects, it would still trump anything currently on the market, and that says a lot.  This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future.Simply put, the best game I've ever played..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2011"}

This is just a fun game. The graphics are adorable. For all of those doubters back in the day, you owe it to yourselves to check it out. Now for a more detailed review:THE GOODAs I said before, it's a fun game. The story is simple - find your sister, kill Ganon - but there are some pretty good dungeons and quests along the way. It's an easy game, but with some epic moments and nice boss designs. There are some moments in the dungeons that had me stumped, which I don't think every happened when I played Skyward Sword.THE BADI think Nintendo fixed most of the problems from the Gamecube version. I really only have two complaints.First, the non-playable characters are somewhat shallow. I never felt like any of them were characters so much as static entities for side missions (with a few exceptions like Medli). The characters don't really have their own stories or evolve over the course of the game. They just keep saying the same thing over and over. Moreover, the game isn't very hard at all and so you probably won't need 50% of the power-ups. These combined gave me little incentive to do the side quests. I just didn't care enough about the characters to go do a bunch of fetch quests to get a heart piece. I could force myself to do those quests, but again they just seem pointless.Second, the combat mechanics don't feel accurate or fluid. The number of combat moves felt very limited. Even something as simple as targeting and jumping around to the back of an enemy didn't always work. Maybe I'm just used to playing Zelda with the Wii motion controls.These are minor complaints though. The game is definitely a worthy addition to any Nintendo library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"More of the same","reviewText":"A few years ago I would have been extremely excited when all the hype surrounding Modern Warfare 3 started to surface, but after 2 lack luster COD titles from both IW and Treyarch, I knew better than to expect that this game would be much of an improvement (if any) from MW2.  When the game was released I didn't even lift a finger to go out and get it and the only reason I finally tried it out was that it happened to be in my local Red Box machine.Single PlayerIf you played MW2, then you basically already know what to expect here.  While the environments are different everything else is pretty much the same, save for a few new weapons.  Enemies seems to spawn endlessly and always concentrate there fire on you out of all the people in your squad.  There is still non-stop action, endless explosions, and too many \"OOOOH LOOK AT THAT!!\" moments.  Admittedly, it wasn't as bad as MW2 which was just a complete mess, but still anything would be an improvement over MW2 single player campaign.  Where the game differs from MW2 is that is is EXTREMELY short.  As I said earlier, I got this game from Red Box, for a couple of bucks, and the next day, about 5 hours before I had to return it, I had already beat the game on Hardened.  My official completion time was 7 hours, 11 minutes.  So if you plan to play only the single player, do not waste your money, it is not worth it at all.MultiplayerMultiplayer is where many people will be spending their time with after playing the single player, so after beating the game, I decided to try my hand at this.  Basically all the problems in MW2 (and Black Ops) are also in MW3's multiplayer.  IW completely ignored all the issues and complaints from many gamers such as myself had with these two titles.Spawning:  People still spawn right behind you, seemingly immediately after you move out of a spot.  I remember being spawn into a game for the very first time and I'm already getting shot in the head before I can even move.  I wish this was an isolated incident, but unfortunately it is not.  I don't know why IW and Treyarch can't ever seem to get spawning right.  What I find funny is during an interview with IW, they came right out and said that spawning was fixed.  WRONG!Hit detection:  Hit detection is still horrible.  Playing Core is already ridiculous enough as it is being though it takes 35 shots to bring someone down, but this coupled with poor hit detection makes this situation even worse.  I guess this would be better when playing Hard core, but you can't even play hard core until you reach a certain level, so you are forced to deal with this issue until you reach a certain level.Magic Bullets:  Just like MW2, bullets still seem to curve around corners, so don't think you are safe from enemy fire, because quite often the bullet will still find you.There are some nice new game modes like Kill confirmed which doesn't award you a kill unless you pick up the person's dog tags, but the base game play is so bad, even this game mode is not enjoyable as it could have been.Maybe IW will \"patch\" it again, but I don't understand why can't they get it right the first time for once.  I'm glad I finally got to play the game, and I'm glad I beat the game for only 2 dollars instead of dropping fifty or sixty bucks on a 7 hour single player game, and the same flawed multiplayer that the COD series is unfortunately becoming known for.  All of my XBOX Live friends who I played Black Ops with frequently have moved on to MW3, but I decided to not give COD anymore of my money until they make a concerted effort to fix what is wrong with their games.  You know I wouldn't even mind the lack luster single player so much if their multiplayer was on point, but it is not.  Me, I'm still playing Black Ops, and honestly once I reach the 20,000 kill mark, I will stop playing that game as well.The COD series is becoming the Madden of First Person shooters, minus the exclusive license. They release the same game every year with a hand full of new features, but refuse to fix what has been broken for years.  They instead use their resources make flashy commercials hoping to reel in the next batch of sheep that will blindly buy their games every year for years to come.If you only want to play this game for the single player, do not waste your money on a purchase, this game can be easily beaten in a few hours.  In addition, if you are expecting an improved multiplayer experience from past COD titles, then you definitely will not get it here.  At the minimum, I would say the single player is worth playing, but other than that I wouldn't even bother.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

It is open world right from the start. I've played Nier for over 5 hours now and I have not found any quirk or bad moment as of yet. Fought 2 huge bosses one of them twice and they were awesome fights.. The music score is top notch and the characters are very unique. The controls are simple and the camera is ok. Might get a bad angle in some fights here and there but its not like you can't adjust it. The fetch quests are not bad and not all are required to be completed.

Lohrke","summary":"I have no history with Splinter Cell and this is what I think","reviewText":"Before playing \"Blacklist,\" I had never played a Splinter Cell game.  The only Tom Clancy game I'd played was \"Ghost Recon: Future Soldier,\" which I enjoyed a lot.  So, I was excited to jump into this game.And about this game: make no mistake, it's a punishing game.  So much so that several times I had to lay down the controller and take a mental break before trying a particular mission for the 10th time.  This isn't a game you can blast your way through.  It takes a lot of time, patience, planning, and careful moving.  The lack of a checkpoint system or a hard save interlevel means you'll probably spend 20 minutes sneaking around, only to take a wrong turn and have to start over.  It was almost a game-breaker for me.  But if you hang in there and take your time, clearing a level or mission is immensely satisfying.  Also, it's just a really cool game.  The presentation is fantastic and the gameplay, while frustrating and tense, is outstanding.  You can certainly play the way you want 90% of the time, though you're sometimes forced into certain play styles.Speaking of levels, there's a lot of content in this game (and I didn't even get to play the co-op missions and only played a few MP matches).  I think I dropped 20+ hours into the game across it's nearly two dozen missions.  Sam is also highly customizable, whether it be suit options, google options or gun/gadget options.  You can upgrade your gear through the in-game economy, which you earn for completing missions and challenges.It's not a perfect game, however.  While Sam is fairly decently drawn as a character, the supporting characters come straight out of central casting:  the black dude, the \"tough-as-nails-no-nonsense\" female officer (an American who speaks with a Canadian accent - the \"outs\" and \"abouts\" are immediately noticeable - I checked IMDB and the voice actress is, in fact, Canadian), the \"tech guy.\"  In the year 2013, I'd like to think we can get past cliched characters, but maybe that's wishful thinking.  Having said that, they're perfectly serviceable, but not particularly memorable, at least for me.All in all, I'd heartily recommend this game to anyone looking not for just a great Splinter Cell game, but a great game all-around.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

I mean that.To be really, really shallow - You could call this Vanquish a third person action game.  You could call it a blitz riff on Gears of War.  You could say those things.  But you'd still miss the mark.  In my mind, Vanquish is a true spiritual successor to one of my all time favorite games.  If you're old enough to remember Super Turrican, then you may see where I'm going with this.  You have badass weapons, badass rocket propelled slide, badass mech monsters to shoot down, badass graphics and badass music.  This game is, you guessed it, pretty badass.Vanquish is an all out lead assault, arcade style technotronic blast to old school Japanese shooters wrapped in a HD action wrapper.  On the shell, there is absolutely nothing new here at all.  In its day, Super Turrican wasn't really new either.  Aside from the wonky melee attack, the gameplay in Vanquish is effing tight.  Sure the game is short, but if you up the difficulty, it is less so.  And this is one game I seriously relish replaying checkpoints over and over again.  I love gunning for the golden Pangloss statues.  I love dashing and firing in slow mo hoping my suit holds as the last red power bar lines vaporize health  of a giant mech.  This is just a very tightly honed shooter that feels as adrenaline junkied as UN Squadron or Contra.On either the 360, or PS3, this game performs like glass.  At the current price, I can't think of a bigger bargain.  If you like fast paced shooters, if you like a bit of challenge or even a casual play, and you want a rockin' good time - please buy Vanquish.

The action is intense and fun, with a definite feeling that this is a game which can be mastered.  There are some techniques to be learned to improve at this game, one of the most important being the way you manage your \"special meter\".  It took me some time to figure out that if I don't run it down all the way, it regenerates a lot faster and will allow me to use it again shortly.  You'll discover things like that as you play, and it gives a definite sense that you are improving.  The progress that the weapons make in the upgrade system is significant and rewarding, making you feel like you're packing quite the deadly arsenal by the end of the game.Why only 4 stars for a game I liked so much?  Two reasons.  First is that the camera can give some problems.  Several times in the game I was killed and had no idea at all what killed me.  While that is realistic, it is not appreciated in a video game.  The second flaw is that the story is so forgettable that all throughout the game I wasn't sure where I was or what my overall goal (as in, the main object of the game) was.  All I knew is that there were things shooting at me and I had to kill them.  Where did this space colony come from and who does it belong to?  Am I capturing it from the other side or getting it back for my side, or just breaking stuff?  Who IS the other side, anyway?  Who is this Russian guy?  You get the idea.This is a game that I'd love to play again.  I considered it as a candidate for just my second platinum trophy, but I think the trophy for finishing the game without dying would cause me enough trouble, pain and suffering that I'm going to pass on that idea.One of the best 3rd-person shooters on PS3, and the best I've played since Uncharted 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2011"}

Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun.

The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas.

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Fun for a while, but ultimately disappointing","reviewText":"Every time a Command and Conquer game has appeared, a new iteration of its brighter, shiner, much stupider cousin, the Red Alert series, has rapidly followed. With Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars proving to be a big hit in 2007, the news that Red Alert 3 would be making an appearance in late 2008 wasn't exactly a major surprise.Red Alert 3 opens towards the end of Red Alert 2, with the Allies about to overrun Moscow. In a last-ditch gambit, the Soviet leadership time-travels back to 1927 and kills Albert Einstein, after he had executed Hitler in the original Red Alert (thus ensuring WW2 never happened, the core premise of the Red Alert series) but before he started developing high-tech weaponry for the Allied cause. Upon returning to their home time, the Soviet leadership discovers that they have proven victorious and driven the Allies from the European mainland. However, they also discover that, rather than joining the Allies as in the original timeline, Japan has become an independent nation, the Empire of the Rising Sun, and forged a vast and powerful war machine which it has now unleashed on both the Allies and Soviets. With no nuclear weapons to hold them at bay, the Empire seems poised to take control of the entire globe.Red Alert 3 is a throwback to the good old days of the earlier Red Alert games, throwing out the tighter narrative focus and sequential campaigns that Tiberium Wars brought in and reverting to having each of the three campaigns in the game take place in an alternate history to the others. For example, one of the Japanese missions has you racing to defend the Empire's colony at Pearl Harbour from a surprise Allied naval assault (irony!), an event not mentioned or replicated in the Allied or Soviet campaigns, which is a bit odd. However, those used to the prior Red Alert games are used to this by now, so it is not a major issue.Unfortunately, whilst Tiberium Wars proved to be the best Command and Conquer game to date, with a tight storyline, fast-paced combat and doing a sterling job of updating the geriatric SAGE engine, Red Alert 3 is not as successful. The game engine is looking increasingly ancient these days, especially when compared even to the two-year-old Company of Heroes, and the bright, primary colour scheme of Red Alert 3 doesn't play to it as well as the darker, muted C&C3; aesthetic. The exception is the new water system, which is fantastic but also system-intensive, with even more powerful machines likely to stutter during busy naval battles. There is also disappointment with the unit roster: the Allied and Soviet unit selection is mostly just copied over from Red Alert 2, with a few new units thrown in.On the plus side of things, the new Japanese faction is innovative, with many units lifted directly from anime, such as the mecha which can transform from a ground robot to a fighter, which seems to directly inspired by the Valkyrie from Macross (aka the Veritech from Robotech). In addition, several of the Japanese cut scenes use music cues which seem to be heavily inspired by Ghost in the Shell's soundtrack. This new faction requires a totally different approach from the Allies and Soviets, and their part of the campaign proves to be the most challenging and interesting.The campaign itself is delivered through the familiar mix of briefings and FMV. An all-star cast leads the way, with Tim Curry as the Soviet Premier, Jonathan Pryce as the Allied Field Marshal Bingham and George Takei as the Japanese Emperor Yoshiro. The higher quality of acting means the FMV side of things is not quite as ludicrously camp as Red Alert 2, but the story is still extremely daft, filled with plot holes, military impossibilities (how the hell did the Japanese get to Stalingrad?) and, for some reason, an apparent reliance by all three sides on attractive young female military advisers. None of this is exactly new to seasoned Red Alert vets, however. Suffice to say that the tradition of silliness in the spirit of the prior Red Alert games is carried on here.All in all, Red Alert 3 (***) is fun and fast-paced, but it seems a bit too contrived compared to its forebears. The game isn't quite as intense and furious as C&C3; gets in multiplayer, and the storyline isn't far off from being a comedy, meaning you don't get as much emotional investment in it, the games or the characters. For knockabout entertainment, Red Alert 3 suffices but it won't be dragging RTS fans away from Company of Heroes multiplayer for very long. The game is out now on PC (UK, USA) and X-Box 360 (UK, USA).A Note on DRM: The PC version of Red Alert 3 is protected by SecuROM, the same digital-rights-management software that previously blighted Spore and Mass Effect. It requires an internet connection for the game to work even in single-player and the game is limited to five 'activations'. EA has not been forthcoming on what constitutes an 'activation' but experiments by players have shown that even simply changing a graphics card can use up an activation. After a chorus of complaints, the latest patch allows the game owner to de-authorize the game prior to carrying out any modifications to their PC, so they don't use up an activation, but it is still a hassle for players. Naturally, all of this proved totally unnecessary as the game was hacked and leaked onto the Internet a week before its official release date.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2008"}

Thank goodness I was lucky enough to get one. Out of the box it was easy to set up.The Wii is a nice change from the Xbox 360 and PS3 (high priced alternatives). Yes the graphics of the Xbox 360 and PS3 are no question the best but the Wii has the motion sensor. Almost like a virtual reality setting. The added feature is the possible workout you get while playing the games. I have been playing the Wii Sports and my arms actually hurt the next day and playing them for an hour makes you sweeat enough to \"think\" you did a workout. Not bad for someone who has zero time to go to the gym.The graphics are basic but they look nice on a LCD TV. I play mine on a 42\" LCD Sharp Aquos and it's amazing. The sound is great.

{"product_name":"B002V14VOC","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Excellent and atmospheric, but brutally hard in places.","reviewText":"2033. Twenty years have passed since a nuclear apocalypse ended civilisation. A number of survivors have built an underground society based in the Moscow Metro. Stations and their adjoining halls and tunnels now serve as towns, some banded together into factions. Some of these factions are at war with one another, and all are threatened by the hostile creatures (transformed by radiation into mutants) that roam the tunnels and the overground.A young man named Artyom volunteers to leave his station and journey to the largest town in the metro, Polis, to seek help against the creatures threatening to destroy his home. However, this is only the start of a long journey as he discovers that there is a potentially greater threat gathering and he may be the only hope of stopping it.Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter developed by the Ukrainian 4A Studios, an off-shoot of the recently-closed GSC Game World (the creators of the STALKER series of games). It's a post-apocalyptic game employing some elements of survival horror in addition to its more traditional FPS trappings.The game is played from the POV of Artyom, who narrates the game through observations that appear during loading screens. Otherwise, he is a silent protagonist in-game, more willing to listen and learn from other characters than engage in lengthy conversations. The game style is inspired by the Half-Life series, most notably the idea that it's up to the player how much exposition and backstory they need to hear. When in a peaceful area, such as a town, you can simply press on immediately with the next mission or stick around and listen to conversations to pick up more information about the world and setting. There are a variety of NPC characters who help Artyom out during missions, though usually they are forced to bail out at some point, leaving Artyom to press on alone.The STALKER influence can be seen in the atmosphere, which is dark, brooding and often oppressive. When on the surface or in gas-filled chambers, Artyom has to wear a gas mask to survive. As the gas mask's filter clogs up, his breath starts to fog over the screen and the sound of his increasingly laboured breathing becomes dominant, until he replaces the filter. Finding filters is thus essential to survival (though only truly an onerous task at the highest difficult levels). This gives a tremendous sense of claustrophobia to some parts of the game. Another issue is that bullets are relatively difficult to find in the game and enemies tend to soak up a lot of damage, making the player have to think much more carefully whether to engage in combat or attempt to sneak past enemies by sticking to the shadows.The game employs a highly naturalistic style to its interface. Your journal and compass are in-game objects and looking at them means unequipping your weapon, which can be lethal in dangerous areas. The onscreen HUD only appears when needed and tends to vanish whenever you're not using it. There are both stealth and morality mechanics, the former tracking how locatable you are and the former how 'good' or 'bad' your decisions have been, but both are invisible to the player. This adds to the atmosphere, as it leaves you wondering if you have made the right decisions rather than being able to hit a button and bring up a bald numerical figure representing your situation.The game's art style is dark but impressive, cold in atmosphere and successful in conjuring up an air of constant terror during missions. The towns are warmer and richer, with people huddled over fires discussing how they are surviving and merchants eager to sell you their wares. However, the towns are let down by a lack of variety (they're similar to one another, with little in the way of optional side-quests available) and also a sense that they are not necessary. Whilst ammo is very limited, there's usually enough to be looted in the wild to make depleting your (extremely limited) supply of currency. Amusingly, currency in the game are also bullets, which in moments of desperation you can use as ammo.Combat is chunky and in many cases satisfying, but the game's difficulty level can make it frustrating. At normal difficulty headshots have no impact and enemies can take a lot of damage to kill. At high difficulty levels enemies can be killed more easily, but at the expense of also making you extremely fragile and also making ammo and money extremely difficult to find. Unfortunately, the game also pulls the old Far Cry trick of removing the satisfying human opponents in favour of unconvincing monsters and mutants later on, but unlike Far Cry never brings back the human enemies later on. The mutants tend to be much less satisfying to fight, which is a problem since they dominate the second half of the game. Particularly annoying are the ape-derived 'librarians', who take ludicrous amounts of ammo to put down. There is a system for 'staring them down', but it feels somewhat arbitrary whether employing this tactic is going to work or not.Metro 2033 features regenerating health, but only at a very slow rate, making it almost impossible to heal up mid-battle (you also have pain-killing injections that speeds up the process, but is little help in frantic firefights). There is also no cover system (at least beyond the old-school 'duck and pop up again to shoot' technique). These reductions in modern gaming's most tedious and over-used elements are successful in returning real menace and tension to combat, although they do sometimes go the other way and make battles annoyingly frustrating to win. This isn't helped by a checkpoint system that, whilst never as enragingly awful as Max Payne 3's, is still sometimes unforgiving, forcing you to replay lengthy sections as punishment for tiny mistakes (or random chance).The game's atmosphere is tremendously effective, its setting interesting (and surprisingly varied) and the characters you meet and ally with tend to be well-motivated individuals. There's a jet-black sense of humour that constantly pervades the game. The game also has a surprising, twist ending (but only if you've done enough 'good' acts to unlock it) that nicely subverts the violent action game you thought you were playing. This has to be balanced against sometimes frustrating spikes in difficulty and a sometimes ridiculous lack of ammo for a first-person shooter.Metro 2033 (****) is definitely one of the more original and impressive first-person shooters of recent years. If you can get over its brutally unforgiving difficulty, this is definitely a game worth playing. It is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360) and USA (PC, X-Box 360).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2012"}

I've been a Call of Duty fan for many years and am in a comfort zone there.  At first glance and even for the first few times you level up, Call of Duty is a better game.  This one gets better when you learn how to use the weapons, how to properly switch between weapons and how to navigate the maps.  See, in Call of Duty, you can run blindly all around the map and go on a killing spree.  This one makes it a little more difficult to run and turn sideways to the point where you need to duck and get to cover or a sniper will take your head off.  This relies on strategy and teamwork.  One of the best perks of this game is it doesn't have the silly \"perks\" that Call of Duty has.  In COD, you can add stuff to your weapons to make it reload lightning fast and run nonstop...this is a realistic game.  The leveling up is much harder to do, especially if you don't work together.This game is a nice change up for those who are fans of first person shooters.  This game isn't the best at first so I'll let that be the word of warning to those who get irritated quickly.

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing. When that happens, Mom is likely to serve them dinner on the floor.Gamers may find that it takes a while to get the hang ofThe Sims' style and control scheme.

Still, Level 5 is known for developing slightly campy games and if you're willing to give some slack then the experience will be rewarding.Story: 7/10Art style uses a cell-shaded look that I think worked very well, not too gaudy and not too bland, with most of the characters and environments leaning more towards realism than the exotic. Granted, there's more than a little repetition, particularly in Zerard Prison (where you're likely to get lost more than once), but abilities are suitably flashy and the humor is well played. People familiar with Dynasty Warriors will note a...remarkable resemblance of Zegram to Xiahou Dun.Graphics: 8/10There's no internal control of volume leveling, and some people may not like the occasional corny line, though things are played straight more often that Level 5's Dark Cloud games. Ray guns sound suitable and blades clang acceptably.Sound: 7.5/10The music in both of Level 5's Dark Cloud games sounded to me like midi not far from the Super Nintendo. Fortunately, there must have been changes in staffing because I found the soundtrack pleasant. A little repetitive, especially if you grind a lot, but most areas have relatively unique music and it always seems to fit the scene.Music: 7.5/10Level 5 is known for delivering quality action-adventure games, and they certainly deliver yet again. Weapons can't be directly customized like in Dark Cloud, but will automatically grow with use and it's easier to synth more powerful weapons than it was in DC due to the removal of the weapon levels and Synth Points, and restorative items are easier to come by, which makes it easier to travel without having to power-level. As long as you're diligent in filling out your characters' Revelation Flowcharts, you'll have powerful abilities to get you through suitably challenging battles. Having a real party this time is also a boon, though AI-controlled members have a tendency to get themselves hurt or killed so don't hoard your money or restoratives. Minigames do provide welcome (and even better - entirely optional) diversions.Gameplay: 8.5/10After completing the main story mission, you'll be given the option to save \"clear data\" and a new dungeon (the Ghost Station) will appear. Depending on how you've been leveling characters and weapons it can either be a cakewalk or a grueling challenge, but if the first was too easy there's a 100-floor version that you can unlock after playing the first version. The items at the end aren't especially flashy (no new upper-tier weapons), but you can get some new costumes.Replayability: 6/10Level 5 pulls out all the stops in creating what I felt was a fairly engaging, very amusing story. All of the characters felt motivated and believable even when they were being used as comic relief. Completionists will definitely need to be careful which weapons they fuse (you'll probably have to go through multiple guides online since there are flaws in the official guides), but for more casual players it's a very simple, enjoyable experience.Overall: 8.4/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2010"}

Don't get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed theMetroid Trilogy- it just did not give off the sense of a classic METROID game. Well, NINTENDO made sure to take care of that.THE OTHER M is an old-school platform shooter, only equipped with the latest innovations that enhance rather than hinder the true character of the game. Samus Aran can now move in 3D (and not only in a sidescrolling manner), yet this is and feels like a classic platform game. There is some puzzle-solving and expect to spend quite some time in the form of a morphing ball, zipping through pipes, bypassing obstacles, unlocking security doors and finding powerups; and the FirstPerson perspective is still available to deliver devastating missile shots (while keeping Samus stationary and vulnerable to enemy attacks, one cannot play the game as an FPS). Nevertheless, this is an pure action-shooter game that is greatly enjoyable.Visually this must be the best game I ever played on Wii, with beautiful and distinct environments than never get boring and never interfere with the gameplay. And, following the tradition of the classic Metroid games, the THE OTHER M experience is enhanced by great orchestral music. Nothing epic, but it sure fits the mood of the scene it accompanies.THE OTHER M is a tad story-heavier than I would have liked and the cinematic sequences are unskipable(?) whereas, annoyingly, the story at times throws Samus in the midst of her enemies with minimal firepower and often without her Varia suit. Other than those minor complains (and it being a bit short), this is one of the best games I have ever played on a console.I dare say, this is a title that is comparable to the monumentalSuper Metroid.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2010"}

I don't think so, but even if I am, I've been playing games for over 20 years on various consoles.  I'm not THAT inept.  No video game --- or any other product --- should be this difficult to figure out.Now...let's assume I'm doing something wrong with this voucher code business.I have sampled a good chunk of the \"Uncharted 2\" bonus content, and frankly, it's not worth the extra money.  I think multiplayer skins and online avatars are pretty lame overall, so I'm biased there.  However, the 4 motion comics that you can see are interesting, but not must-see products.  After all, they're simply comic stories with a bit of motion thrown in.  Unless you're a hardcore fan of the Marvel or DC motion comic DVDs, you can skip these altogether.  The \"Pinball Heroes\" PSP game is fun, but in the end, it's just pinball.  And the mutliplayer enhancements and modes aren't awesome enough to warrant this hassle.Both of the \"Uncharted\" are proud examples of why we bought a PlayStation 3.  I strongly encourage everyone to buy both of those games, because they're wonderfuly action-adventures.  But every system has its ups and downs, and although the PS3 should be commended for its strong qualities, Sony should be criticized mercilessly for this debacle.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000A0EFHY","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Impressive movie inspired video game","reviewText":"King kong the video game doesnt follow the movie step by step not at all its a different storyline and a great visual quality make this game look like the movie and for a movie inspired video game its very impressive!The characters you play are jack and kong they both have different style of gamings despite being in the same game.While playing with jack you will be playing a first-person type of game as you have guns and the game will be harder as the missions are tougher.Now while playing with kong you will play a more destructive kind of game thats more exiting as you battle with many t-rex at the same time.You can jump tree branchs and climb.The missions with kong arent a big percentage of the game maybe 25% but they are the best missions.You will need to help the girl like in the movie.COOL THINGS;-You can use internet cheats to unlock weapons-The game has two kind of playability,first person shooter with jack,and the destructive(as i call it)mode with king kong-The graphics are awesome it really looks like in the movie and the enviroments looks like the movie-There is an alterning ending-King kong missions are greatNOT COOL THINGS;-When your in danger of dying the screen flashes red and you cant see wich killed me many times.-The game is pretty short wich does the game bad,would it have killed to have more kong missions,or more missions.What i liked is the alternate ending that is longer than the original and that kong survives instead of dying.The extras are cool with prewiews of the movies and the art gallery.APRECIATION;The game offers something quite individual ,great graphics and a different storyline.The missions with the giant ape are the best part of the game even if they arent half of the game.The game despite being quite good is way too short but if not for that the game would be so much better.Very recomended","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}
