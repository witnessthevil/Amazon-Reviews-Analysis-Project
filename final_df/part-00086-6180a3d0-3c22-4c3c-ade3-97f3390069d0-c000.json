{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"AMM \"adrian_m\"","summary":"Best Football game EVER!","reviewText":"Having played football games from the 2600 days, to Tecmo Bowl on the NES and more recently the 2K series on the Dreamcast, I was curious to see what more Microsoft could do with a football title on it's new game system.I was expecting poor AI, better graphics, and some improved sounds.  However, Microsoft has done the impossible and added some INNOVATION and cool features to this tired genre of games.  This is an unexpected surprise considering that this is truly Microsoft's first football game for any console and that fact that NFL FEVER 2002 came out this well on their first try is remarkable.  I can't even imagine what more they can add to next year's version!As for the innovation, thanks to the Xbox's hard drive, Highlights are stored for highlight reel at the end of the game.  Player of the week, etc awards are given out at the conclusion of each week.  You can save your progress in the middle of a game...even highlights can be saved thanks to HD!  The Dynasty mode is truly great...here you take control of a team for a span of 25 years with the ultimate goal of building and maintaining a dominating franchise for as many years as possible.  What's cool is that the stats and records are tracked in such detail.  For example, each team has all its REAL retired numbers which you can add to once your dynasty develops some proven players.  They added in historical data that you can actually add to when your team gets good such as rookie of the year, Superbowl MVP, MVP's, etc.Yes, some of these features and stat tracking have been done before on other systems, but this is the first time it's done correctly and effectively because the hard drive has the room to store all the data necessary to maintain the stats.  No memory card needed here!In short, get this game!  Forget Madden 2002, this is the best Football game I've ever played and this is coming from someone who felt the 2K series on the DC wasn't very good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2002"}

Is. BACK!Disclaimer: I'm a HUGE Zelda fan and have every game that has been created, including those on the DS :). So I was very excited to get my hands on the new Skyward Sword. Let's break this down, shall we?STORY LINE: For me one of the more important parts of playing a Zelda game is the story line. Unlike a Mario game (and we love Mario in this house), the Zelda stories tend to be pretty indepth, with plenty of little hidden secrets here and there. This story is solid. I love that you see Link and Zelda together at the beginning of the game - that hasn't happened in awhile, not this way, and I love that there is still that little romantic spark between them, even though Link often seems oblivious to it. The idea of having two separate worlds, the one in the clouds and the one on earth, is intriguing and gives you plenty of places to explore! Also back, and fun, are the side quests! Newest feature that I like? The Bazaar. At the Bazaar you can get weapons, potions, your fortune read (is it a man or woman? You guess!), and you can even get your weapons fixed or upgraded or your potions tweaked and upgraded as well! A very fun optional part that makes the game even more of a time suck LOL.GAME PLAY: Now this is one thing I was looking forward to. I got Twilight Princess for the Gamecube - before we got a Wii - so I never got the Wii version. I'm kind of glad I didn't because this way I didn't have anything to compare it to. The game play for Skyward Sword so far in my gaming seems to be great. You utilize both the wiimote and the nunchuck - the nunchuck to move around the the wiimote to access your belongings, get in touch with your guide (who, by the way, I'm hoping will come out as hot as Midna in the end), and of course to use your weapons. Drawing the sword out of the stone is always one of those occasions in a Link game where you get a few little shivers. With Skyward Sword it's more then that, as you're actually drawing it out of the stone with your wiimote and holding it up to the sky. It had a little vibe of He-Man with the whole \"I have the power\" thing, but it was very cool.AND I'm also happy to announce that there are new tools/weapons! My son's favorite is the flying beetle - he's handy too - but I love that you are truly controlling everything using the wiimote. Gets a bit annoying when you're trying to snag an insect with your net, but it's much more realistic, which is, I'm guessing, what designers were after with this title.GRAPHICS: Anyone who owns a wii knows that you don't own it because of graphics, but the graphics for Skyward Sword are pretty decent. Now they're not up to the Xbox standard of graphics, but the graphics are good enough that you don't sit there saying, \"wow, these graphic suck.\" And the animation scrolls flawlessly so that you can keep your mind focused on the game instead of focusing on glitches.CON: The only con I've seen so far is camera control. You can either push C to look around (kinda freaky when you're straight over the edge of the island looking down into the clouds), or you can push Z to automatically adjust where you're looking. I found myself wishing that I could use the Wiimote to control where I was looking as I do on some first-person shooter games, but obviously that wouldn't work because it's your sword and weapon hand, so while the camera control is a bit annoying, I honestly don't see any other way the designers could have handled the situation.OVERALL: An amazing game. From the story line to the graphics, Skyward Sword definitely lived up to my expectations, and I've been waiting for it since it was first announced!! I love that you can fly in the game, and when designers said that they tried to change up the game play so that it's not just about getting to the next dungeon anymore, they meant it. Everyone in my household either loves playing it or loves watching it, and that's one thing that we all love about Zelda games - they're almost as much fun to watch as they are to play. Almost. Nintendo, thanks for this - we'll be playing it and trying to uncover its secrets for a long time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Scratchy","summary":"Not a Great FPS but it fun.","reviewText":"I have never played a battlefield game before but if this game is anything like it maybe i need to give it a try.  I was a bit worried about Medal of Honor seeing how any FPS without the Call of Duty title tend to be rather iffy.  But i was suprised at how much i liked the game even though i did not care much for the campaign mode (much like any other FPS out really).The breakdown:Campaign is fun in some parts but extremely boring for most of the game.  It is easy and extremely short.Multiplayer is pretty engaging in huge objective based battles instead of just kill kill kill.  It makes you feel as if you are really in a warzone instead of a virtual playground for 10 year olds with RPGs and Assault rifles.  The team based strategies involved in capturing bases and systematically pushing the enemy back to win the round were great.  No rambo-ism a whole lot of team based carnage.  Not to mention the levels are huge so Snipers will love that.Visually nothing special here.  It lacks any wow factor you might get in most other FPS out already (black ops / killzone / crysis) but it makes up for it in realism.Gameplay is solid seeing how it uses the basic COD standard button format with slight twists.  Hitting the cover button allows you to slide into cover after sprinting which is a cool feature.  And the other i thought was somewhat cool but rarely used it was; the ability to peek out of cover, shoot and quickly come back.  Great feature this is, but useless because you can only use it in the campaign and for another reason that im about to explain next.AI is horrible.  You can pretty much walk past your enemies and pick em off one by one from behind making the shooting from cover point moot.  Because of this i got bored easily of the campaign and went straight to multiplayer instead. Something that i rarely do.Replayability.  Not much in terms of campaign but the multiplayer is what i assume most people will like the most.All in all its a decent game that will distract you if you need a change of pace from the current FPS you already play.  And don't forget it comes with Medal of Honor: Frontline for free.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}

If you've enjoyed Bioware's previous games, and you like fantasy role-playing games in general, then Dragon Age is a no-brainer.  Here are some key points and highlights:-- Gameplay --Bioware uses many familiar elements, some taken from various games, to create a strong and flavorful interface for the game.  You'll notice some Mass Effect, Knights of the Old Republic, and even some old-school Baldur's Gate thrown in for good measure.  The control scheme takes some getting used to, but it's not too bad; once you get the hang of it, you won't even notice you're doing it.  From what I've read, the PC has more options and configurations pertaining to game controls, but that's to be expected.  The 360 version is slick: once you're used to it, it becomes background to the great story.-- Graphics & Sound --There's been some mud slung around about the \"shoddy textures\" and sub-par graphics of Dragon Age; even on [...], they didn't care for the graphics.  Well, someone needs to chill out and stop comparing everything Call of Duty Modern Warfare, or whatever other eye-popping, ocular-drooling game they hold up as the pinnacle of visual presentation.  Dragon Age looks great: the characters animate nicely, the backgrounds and textures are fine.  Please, please, please... If you're critical of graphics, take into account that Dragon Age is huge: it's a massive world with hundreds of characters, monsters, treasures, etc, etc... I'll take immense gameplay over 10.0 graphics any day, all day.  I love watching and looking as I run through the world.  I challenge you to go through the opening battle at Ostagar and tell me the graphics aren't awesome.Audio is mesmerizing.  There aren't too many games that compare to Dragon Age in music and sound quality.  I suppose your taste may dictate how you feel, but I can't see anyone being disappointed.  The title screen music is just plain enchanting.  I sat and listened for a few minutes, it's that good.  The in-game music and sound effects are incredible, well-arranged, and fitting to the scene.  If you dig on good voice-acting, then Dragon Age will leave you more than satisfied.  Every person I've met in the game has a few things to say: even people hanging out on the street have a couple of different lines.  If you've played previous Bioware titles, expect no less.-- Story & Value --What good is a fantasy game without a story?  Bioware is the poster child for immersive video-game storytelling, and they don't disappoint with Dragon Age.  If you're looking for a wide-open world like Oblivion or Fallout, you may be turned off.  Dragon Age allows you to move to different regions in no particular order, but the story is guided: you have a set goal to accomplish and quests to complete.  It is flexible, not free-form.  Again, if you've played Mass Effect or KOTOR, you already understand how Bioware works with story progression.  I enjoy the flexibility of a guided story in a big world: sometimes just wandering around looking for stuff isn't as fun as knowing what you're looking for.  There are hundreds of tidbits of lore to find and read; uncovering the history and details of the world is highly engaging.  The story itself is fantastic; if you like dark, heroic fantasy like the Elric books or even a little Conan, you'll dig the Dragon Age story.  I won't give out any details, you'll have to play it.There are few games that I feel comfortable paying more than $25 to get: normally I wait until the game hits the local game store's used shelves.  Dragon Age, however, I ordered from Amazon shortly after its release.  I'm very pleased with how much game is in this title.  I've logged 40 hours or so already and explored about 25% of the world.  I expect well over 100 hours of gameplay.  That amounts to less than 50 cents an hour.  You can't complain about that.  I'm sure with all the add-ons, DLC, and so forth this game can be extended another 100 hours.  If you take your time and explore everything, complete all the quests, you'll be busy for a very long time.-- Overall --Dragon Age is  a must have game.  If you like Bioware games (Mass Effect, KOTOR, Baldur's Gate) and you dig fantasy, then you cannot pass on Dragon Age.  All the elements are great and the story is highly satisfying.  It's easy to get sucked into the game, wondering about characters and their history, reading the hundreds of different pieces of lore, and battling the myriad different monsters in the game.  There's a few minor technical glitches, but those are so infrequent and minor that it really doesn't matter.  I haven't had any crashes, lock-ups, or other detrimental problems.  The game runs smooth on the 360.  Perhaps the only complaint is the attention-sucking nature of the game... What else is there to do, anyway?*** Update (after 60+ hours of gameplay) ***Well, I still recommend this game but with two warnings: be prepared for a lot of dialogue and disappointing battles.  I found myself running from one point to another only to have a 10 minute conversation, then running to another point only to have another 10 minute conversation, and then running... you get the picture.  I would guess that dialogue took up close to half of the time played in the game (or some form of passive game-play like cutscenes).  I enjoy dialogue--hell, I loved Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect, but Dragon Age has much, much more passive gameplay than those two titles.  Movies are for passive enjoyment, video games need a little less passivity and more interactivity; not necessarily action, but something that requires the user to act upon the world.  Dialogue is good, but let's keep it within reason.The other warning I bring is to encourage people to save the game frequently.  There are some very frustrating situations in this game that make little sense at all.  I turned off the game--exit to the xbox dashboard, take out the disc, done--because of the following: I defeated the High Dragon, the huge monstrous one on top of the mountain, and then several hours later (when I was stronger and had some better equipment, more tactic slots, etc) I was jumped in Orzammer by six goons and my entire party was wiped out in less than 3 minutes.  HOW do you defeat a massive, fire-breathing dragon and be wiped out in record time by thugs?  A lot of videogames experience this kind of disconnect in an attempt to scale the difficulty for the user, but that is absurd.  At least wait until I encounter something more substantial to boost the toughness!  Mass Effect and Kotor presented challenges without resorting that type of absurdity.In a nutshell: save often, be prepared to play passively (dialogue, cut scenes, etc), and brace yourself for ridiculously difficulty-scaled fights against creatures that have no business beating the snot out of you.  I removed two stars for the above information.  In the future, I will certainly give RPG style and perhaps specifically Bioware games more time to develop.Take care fellow gamers!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","summary":"Scared? Ha? Me? No... I'm terrified....","reviewText":"Wow... I was fourteen when I played this... 2004... sure, the PS2 was out for three years already and there were other scary games out at that time, but I was a little underprivilaged with my game systems. I had a PS1, and there were a SLEW of really good PS1 games out that I could afford. So I started my collection. I had played Syphon Filter once, so I thought I could handle everything. I went to a yard sale and saw this game sitting on a table for ten dollars. I thought, \"Sure, I can handle this.\" The guy said, \"It's really scary, are you sure?\" He looked at my mother, then to me. I looked at my mother, then to the guy, and confidently said, \"I can handle it. I've watched Hellraiser, Nightmare on Elm Street,\" ect.... I was full of my teenage self. Well, we got home and I put this in my PS1. From the very instant I removed the CD and saw, in the case, to menacing eyes glaring at me, I knew something was up. I put in the game, saw the warning, thought, \"Oh, it MAY contain graphic scenes? Big deal. It's like... melted lego block graphics. I can handle it.\"The game starts with your character waking from a crash in a foggy town. You walk around until you see the shadow of your daughter in the distance. You chace her through the fog and snow but can't seem to catch up. She heads into an alley way. YOu go down. THere's a fence that says, \"Beware of Dog.\" I was thinking, \"Well, I need to find a weapon.\" I look in my inventory and all I have is a lighter. I cannot attack and I cannot do anything with the lighter... \"Okay, let's go inside. Maybe there will be a gun there?\"No... Only blood... lots and lots of blood... \"Okay, let's do this.\" I say as I press forward. The camera pans overhead as I proceed down the darkening allyway. I go farther, see more blood... bodies... a lone wheelchair... darkness... I get to use my lighter now to give off faint light... deeper deeper... More fences and blood... no point in turning back... The music is insinuating that maybe I am making a bad decision... but it's too late now... And then I see it... and the end of the long alley way, a twisted mauled bodies hangs crucified and motionless. \"Okay... that's bad... maybe I can...\" I turn my character around and from the inky darkness looms small child-like shapes. THey come at me with knives and squeal in some sort of backwards laugh... They stab me in the knees and I CANNOT ATTACK. I look for weapons, I click on everything, I run back, dead end... they crowd around me, three or four or five or infinity... I don't know, I'm panicked and screaming at the screen, \"WHY THE HELL? WHAT THE HELL? WHEN THU-WHAT THU-THROW ME A BONE!\"Then I die. I turn of my console and put this at the bottom of my stack. This game made me it's bitch. FOr a year I did not tackle it. Then My mother urged me to play it (She is a horror movie fan and wanted to see the outcome, but was too much of a wuss to play it herself) so I did, died again, and then waited... I was SUPPOSED TO DIE AT THE BEGINNING! Way to psyche me out game.The game is fun, engaging, and frustrating. The puzzles are challenging without being inpossible. The graphics aren't pretty, but they set the tone for the game PERFECTLY!You have a kid that loves horror games and movies, give them this. Sure, they may complain about the graphics, but after a little while, they will not be able to tell the difference. In a few moments the game will be playing them, getting into their head and messing with them as they try to dig deeper into the game. Yeah... it's that kind of game.

{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"...","reviewText":"As the world awaits the next installation in Capcom's flagship Resident Evil series, Konami has stepped forth with Silent Hill, a horror concoction all their own. Instead of merely riding onto the gaming scene on RE's coattails, Silent Hill strikes out into bold new territory and clearly distinguishes Konami as a continued force to be reckoned with in the videogame world.Once you plop in the game, you're treated to a seemingly peaceful CG intro showing young widower, Harry Mason, on a tranquil late night drive with his seven-year-old daughter, Cheryl. The pair speed down the highway on their way to an aging resort town known as Silent Hill. But somewhere along the way, their trip is cut short as a young girl appears in the middle of the road, captured in the headlights of Harry's jeep. As Harry attempts to avoid hitting the girl, his car spins violently out of control and the world blurs. As Harry regains consciousness in the driver's seat of his wrecked car, he turns to check on his daughter only to find that she's missing. Where did she go? Welcome to Silent Hill, an adventure masterfully crafted by the use of sound, sight and even touch. Played mainly like an adventure game and not an action title, Silent Hill neatly sidesteps any obvious aping of the RE series by taking a more literary turn into the world of horror. With an emphasis on character and storyline, Silent Hill prefers to appeal to gamer's imagination by limiting their vision to a small range of light surrounded by inpenetrable darkness or by jarring any grasp of reality that the gamer might have on what exactly is going on in the game. In fact it's the storyline's refusal to adhere to a formulaic premise, with Harry confronting apparitions, chasing down demons and puzzling over diabolic visions, that makes the game so incredibly unique. Chills and shivers aside, Silent Hill is one strange trip into nightmares left untouched by the more action-oriented gameplay of Resident Evil. The most important factor of the game's immersive qualities ranges from Konami's depiction of Harry as a regular guy with whom gamers can identify with to the excellent use of ambient sounds to catch players offguard in their most vulnerable moments. Harry's plain appearance translates seamlessly into how he actually plays through the game. His aim is awful and his running pace, though quicker than most enemies, still keeps him only a heartbeat away from being mowed down by the demons running amok on the streets of Silent Hill. In fact, because of the limited amount of ammunition available in the game and Harry's inexperience with firearms, you'll find yourself evading enemies more often than confronting them. And this is one of the finest features in the game. Not only does this strengthen the adventure element in Silent Hill, but it also draws the player into the world of the game by mixing in enough realism into the madness. On top of this feature in the game, Silent Hill also refuses to ease up on the game in regards to atmosphere and mood. Backed by an ambient soundtrack, the game features some masterful effects that are sure to have even veteran Racoon City warriors quaking in their boots. From the inexplicable sobbing of an unseen child in a blood-stained school hall to the loud rattling of an invisible \"something\" underneath the floorboards that you're standing on, the game never sinks into predictability. Imagine all of this while never quite being able to see past arm's length into the darkness. Equipped with only a pocket flashlight, Harry is forced navigate pitch-black areas where demons insist on lurking just outside of the range of sight. Often, you'll hear them before you can actually see them, pushing the tension factor in the game to white-knuckled heights. But as masterful as Silent Hill is, it still can't claim perfection. In a completely 3D, polygonal real-time game environment, there are always going to be issues about control. Silent Hill slightly suffers from this. Maneuvering Harry in some of the game's tougher spots and getting him to go from dead stopped to run and back again can prove an exercise in frustration, especially when you find yourself trapped in a narrow hallway filled with murderous demons ? with only 15 rounds of Handgun ammo left. Visually, the game remains grainier than what's expected of a PlayStation game released in the system's fourth year. But the overall look of the game, with its murky fog effects and clever use of lighting makes good use of the graininess adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay throughout the game. In the face of Silent Hill's brilliant gameplay, these flaws only take so much away from the game and leaves us wondering how great the game will be on a next-generation system.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2003"}

Before hand what I knew was that the series had a reputation for teeth grinding difficulty. Not being one for hack n slash games I still ended up ordering it given the lack of games on the Wii U at the moment. After I got it I later learned that is actually a more recent edition of an older Ninja Gaiden 3, which was apparently an abysmal game. I was a little put off by that but was able to relax a bit with the knowledge that this version is apparently a lot better. Though I can't compare and contrast since I haven't tried the original third game.So right off that bat you are introduced to Hayabusa, a veteran ninja who seems most at peace when he is slicing apart hordes of faceless enemies. Working with the JSDF or basically Japanese military, he goes on the hunt against a terrorist organization that threatens global stability. The story really isn't the strong point as it's plot and characters come across as very over the top bordering on outright cheese. Something that the Wii U version offered that the originals didn't though were side missions where you could play as another character who some may recognize from DOA.Sadly the tablet is given inventory duty again but I don't think there was much else they could have done with the tablet anyways. At times it pretty convenient to simply swipe to a different weapon set but it seems thats all the Wii U tablet is given. Otherwise the controls are you standard hack n slash, you've got your faster light attacks and slower heavier attacks. You earn points for the amount kills and combos that you pull off and can use these to upgrade Hayabusa for things such as better health, more combos, etc etc. Graphically the game looks great. There is a real depth to it with a nice smooth frame rate that doesn't seem to drop even when things get very hectic. It complements the game play very well since a man cutting apart a battle tank should naturally just look spectacular. It also very violent with enormous amounts of gore to the point where Hayabusa himself will be drenched red.The game play itself is fun in a God of War way meaning that it's absolutely ridiculous. In the first part you probably cut down about 30 or so terrorists in one sitting. Since it's a Japanese game it also naturally has Hayabusa carving apart battle suits and dinosaurs with his trusty katana. Aside from those, your mostly cutting through hordes of balaclava wearing terrorists who are thick enough to think they can take on Hayabusa with a bayonet despite just seeing him tear apart an Apache gunship as though it was made of tin foil. All grandiose aside, this game is HARD. I usually like to tackle games on their hardest available difficulty first but I had to rage-quit on more than one bit in this one. It got to the point where I ended up bringing the difficulty down just I can manage and even then there were parts (especially boss fights) that were impossible.In conclusionThe Good,-Good hack n slash game play, controls nice with a good distance for dodging (which you may mostly be doing)-Very over the top and violent, like a lot of other hack n slash games the novelty is part of the charm-Looks great with wide backgrounds and plenty going on in the foreground where the action is atThe Bad,-The story is not going to win any awards anytime soon but it doesn't put me off in any way","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"A good game, but....","reviewText":"I really liked this game, but they are several flaws that stop this game from being great.The single-player missions were fun, especially for the side of good. In the good missions, there was alot more diversity. Not only did you have the big battles, but you also had missions involving the heroes. The missions also followed the movie pretty good.Also, you don't build buildings like typical RTS games. You capture a plot of land and they give you so many spaces you can build on. So if you capture a castle spot, you can get up to 16 slots or so to build (depending on what faction you are playing).the basics of the missions were a chance to power up your heores. They all start at level 1, but as you increase to a certain level (10 is the max), you get other special abilities that that hero can use. Aragorn has the power of the sword master, healing units around him, or calling in a small band of the Army of the Dead. Gandelf has a lightning attack, a shock attack, and an even stronger type of shock attack. Gimli and Legolas also have very cool special attacks. Also, each mission you can gain either an increase in resources (you get a percentage increase), command points (the command points you have the more troops you can create), or power points. Power points give you other special powers such as elven archers and rohhirrim horseman for a short time to you use for attacking or defending. There is alot of content in this game and several missions to play.As for the evil side, you only get 2 heroes and most of the powers you get are for resource production as you win with sheer numbers instead of strength. Saruman's abilities also aren't very good and most of the warriors you can build are either too slow or too weak. But, when you get enough power points, you can summon the Balrog. He is very strong. When he is summoned, he damages any units and/or buildings close by. He can do a short flight which damages anything around him when he lands, use his whip, and has a powerful flame attack which levels buildings in seconds. He also looks cool. For the most part though, I found the battles pretty repetitious on the evil side which got a little boring. As you play, you will see other little things that are annoying.The graphics were good and the sound (the voices were of those from the movies) was also very good. The cutscenes were ok, but nothing great.As for skirmish mode against the computer, you have several maps and 4 side to choose from. As you win a battle, you get allocated points. Everytime you increase a level, your starting units change and you get stronger units to begin with until you max out at level 10. You can either play a level 1, 5 , or 10 computer opponent in which they will start with those better units. It keeps track of your wins and loses and how long you played each side. It is pretty challenging so far ( I have only played leveled each side up to level 2 while playing level 5 opponents).Haven't played on-line yet, but they have had many different tournaments and you can see your rank on the web-site. If you can get ranked high enough, you will be invited to the big tournament.Overall, I have enjoyed this game alot and plan on playing skirmish mode alot more to see what all happens. But the SP for both side is very long play you have the mp, so lots of gaming for your buck. I definitely reccommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2005"}

The game is set in a fictional WWII type setting, and is completely original. This turned based strategy game can get pretty complex, and is a lot to swallow at first, but after a while you'll get the hang of it.The game is pretty menu heavy, especially before deploying into missions. You can level up your classes (instead of individual characters) as well as produce weapons for each class, and your tank. These are simple enough, but you have to unlock new weapons by leveling up. What disappointed me about this is that the weapon upgrades are very minimal and it's not until later levels that the stat boosts are large.Once you do all this you can re-arrange your groups because each missions requires the right kind of people. There are different classes like Lancers (anti-tank), Scouts, Shocktroopers (Heavy Machine Gunners), Engineers (medics), Armored Techs (melee) etc. You can only have 6 people deployed per missions, and only 5 for each area. While this may be a pain since you'll have 5 guys in one area and 1 in another there's strategic workarounds for this. Once you start a missions you get an overhead map that shows your guys and the enemies. Killing enemies is as simple as moving them around in real-time, but each character has a different stamina meter, so watch out.Each character uses one CP (turns) and tanks use two, so you really have to choose your moves wisely. While you're moving around to position enemies can shoot at you, but you can take cover behind sandbags. Killing enemies consists of getting the right amount of shots in before you reach your limit. Instead of relying on just draining HP you have a shot limit and when you aim at an enemy (depending on their type as well) another number will show how many shots it will take to kill that enemy. Head shots are always your best bet, but getting in close works too.You can also find shortcuts through out the map since most have you moving to different areas. Using a tank you can build bridges and flank the enemy or build ladders. Once you capture an enemy camp you can put your troops on standby and deploy them on captured camps in other areas. Be aware though because enemies and recapture those and render you unable to deploy in the new area unless you have at least one person there.The battles can be pretty intense, but they also require perfect strategy and it seems that most of the time only one will work. Certain missions have special requirements like escorting, or certain players must be deployed. If you find that you need other abilities you can retrain troops to different classes (if you're short on one class) or change their abilities like making a scout a sniper, or making a Lancer a Mortar. Some times perks will be activated on the field that do good or bad depending on the character. If a character doesn't like one it's near it'll have a negative effect. Details like this can really let you pin down a strategy, but most others can ignore it.Outside the battlefield you move around campus and talk to people to progress the story, but that's pretty much all there is to it. The game looks really good with a nice anime art style, and the voice acting is decent, but not amazing. The small map size will make fans of the PS3 original angry, but it's perfect for a portable system. The game is pretty stat and menu heavy, and the difficulty spikes may make you actually give up all together.

One of them powered 3D, while the other one had the sole purpose of unleashing its 2D powers at a great 29 MHz. Now here is where the problems begin. Because the system used two separate processors, it made it very difficult for developers to create games for the system, because both processors must be worked with simultaneously, causing the system to not have a great variety of titles like it should have.Unfortunately, you know as well as I do that the best game for the system, Panzer Dragoon Saga has the unfortunate disadvantage of being one of the most expensive games to obtain due to its very limited print run. Please do not misunderstand; the system is not terrible, it just has a somewhat limited selection. While there does exist good games such as Hexen, Tomb Raider or Gex, which can be obtained at fair prices, I can get those for other systems and the reason I would want a Sega Saturn is to play 2D fighting games, which I am not exactly a fan of, or RPGs such as Magic Knight Rayearth, which cost a fortune to buy as these games had very obviously  suffered from limited print runs. On the PlayStation, I can purchase similar titles for a fraction of the cost with the same gameplay value as their Saturn counterparts.Despite not being a fan of 2D fighting games, however, I can still see that they are a great strength for the Saturn as there are a good sum of 2D fighting games to go around, and they can mostly be obtained at a decent price, so that is certainly a plus, but I cannot see myself thoroughly enjoying this system if I must spend more than $50 to play some of the games I would enjoy such as the RPG I have mentioned above and some other RPGs for the system. Overall, I would recommend this system if you are a 2D fighting or platforming fan, but if you prefer RPGs, I would recommend steering towards the PlayStation, since they are far better priced with a greater variety than the Saturn itself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2012"}

While Medal of Honor is for sure a contender to the military based FPS thrown, COD: MW 2 is still the champ.That's not saying Medal of Honor isn't a good game but it's a work in progress and I'm sure the next installment will be a lot better with all the bugs worked out. Unfortunately it feels rushed as if EA was trying to beat Black Ops out of the starting gate, believing this move would increase their revenue and in turn neglecting the quality of the game. In my opinion they should have delayed the game and polished it a bit more.There are a lot of noticeable glitches in this game which may or may not be a deal breaker for you, but honestly all things considered still playable. Overall a good game, very similar to COD: MW 2 with a splash of Battlefield Bad Company 2 and a side of glitches for desert.Basically if you're looking for something to hold you over while you wait for Black Ops then this would be it but if you're looking for a successor to COD: MW 2 look else where.Xbox and PSN gamer tags are both MikeJMele.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life. Depending on the player, the dog will change appearance and assist him or her in various ways, such as alerting of impending dangers and attacking enemies.Players inhabit the world of Albion and are free to roam the land to as they please. Players can use different expressions to communicate with others, such as taunting and laughing, and even belching or farting.As the players grow, so does Albion, reflecting the choices that were made earlier in the game.

Players can buy up all the land in a town and can become mayor, king, and even emperor of the entire land.Fable 2 presents a dynamic and free-roaming world that doesn't demand a player to take any one set path. At the same time, players seeking a plot line will find an epic story and quest that they can follow if they wish, along with many side adventures.Fight Using Different Weapons and MagicFable 2 introduces a new combat system that allows for mastery of hand weapons, such as swords, long range weapons such as cross-bows and guns, and, of course, magic.

Needless to say, I was blown away by it! Maybe I've been deprived of a really good game for a while, but it's one the best I've played in the last year. Probably not the best, that would go to Metal Gear 4 and Bioshock, but it's still up there.I don't ever recall playing a game in a world this big with this much to do. There is so much to do that you will be lost for countless hours with all the sidequests, finding every silver key and gargoyle statue, finding all the hidden treasure and, last but not least, the awesome main quest. I still haven't gotten all the gargoyles. I have 49 and there's 50 total. You get a supposedly awesome reward in the Gargoyle Trove if you find all 50. Hmmmmmm.....I wonder what it could be. I find out soon enough.I think it's great that you can't interact with the citizens to obtain status and gifts and even get married and have kids. You can start a family, buy houses for them to live in and watch their progression. Probably my favorite part of the game is the dog. He/she is your sidekick through the whole game. Your companion who helps you find treasure and alerts you to evil. I can't say if your dog will grow on you in the game, but mine certainly did. When I was immersed in the world it made me feel like I wasn't so alone. You can command your dog, level up his/her treasure finding ability and even it's damage it can cause on fallen foe when it attacks them.I really like that they didn't make the weapons and spells systems to deep. If it had been more like Diablo I think it would have detracted from the overall experience and fun. I like the leveling up system too. It's not long and drawn out where you have like level 36 strength or some such. Instead, there is only 5 level ups(some are only 4 levels) for strength and so on for each of the other catergories, like magic skills, accuracy, toughness, speed etc. By the end, you'll be more than powerful enough to defeat the forces of evil. Also, of coolness is if you purchase a house you can rent it out and make gold every 5 minutes depending on the economy of the town and what kind of house you bought. You can even furnish these houses to make even more money on rent. If you want to be greedy you can adjust the rent up to 100 % for even more money.The story was a real standout, too. Very immersive and covers many years. I like the choices you get to make in the game. Should you be good or evil? The choice is yours. Choose wisely as it will determine the outcome of the game. It will also determine what rewards you get from citizens. If they favor you they will give you a discount on items to purchase. Sometimes if you're unfavored that will cause the townfolk to give you a gift, but more often if you're favored you will get a gift. It's neat that you can use expressions such as flirt, blow kiss, fart, and bunch of others to either sway the citizens in your favor or turn them against you. It will affect your renown in the towns. You can carry different titles, as well, which is super neat. Deep game but it's very easy to use and figure out for the most part.The graphics on my plasma tv look nothing short of stunning. A very colorful and vibrant cartoony look, but yet look somewhat realistic. You know, the sound I didn't really pay much attention to. There was one particular rock sounding beat I really liked when fighting those werebeasts creatures and I think it played again in some other quest(s). I guess I'll just say the music was okay, because other what I just mentioned, nothing really stood out. I was probably too absolved in the quest to pay much attention to it.Also, I wanted to mention that I thought the ending was really good, even if the boss fight was really lousy. It was cool that you could choose 1 of 3 wishes and you had to choose wisely because it will affect the world of Albion and you(I won't give away what those choices are, but will say it's tough to decide). The voice acting in the game is 2nd to none. Stephen Fry did a fantastic job with his role as Reaver toward the end of the game. He was hilarious!!!My gripes with the game are few and very minor, but do warrant me lowering the 5 star score only slightly, which I'll state at the bottom of the review.First, I definitely think the game could have been more challenging. The last boss you can could beat with the use of one button. It was just too easy. A 6 year old could beat the enemies in this game. However, this doesn't detract from the experience by very much. It's still a ton of fun!Secondly, this kind of a petty gripe, but it was ever so annoying. Some of the gargoyle statues are really tough to get even if you know where they are. Mainly because it's so time consuming to get where you can get certain statues. For instance, the one in Bowerstone Market in the carriage house is difficult because you have to somehow get the carriage out of the way so you can get to the gargoyle. I finally got this one after completing pretty much everything.On that same note, you can only get some gargoyles if you purchase a house that are really expensive. One house cost cost $1 million(Fairfax Mansion and that's the only thing I have to left in the game to entirely complete it. It holds the last gargoyle statue.) There's also a cemetery mansion that's $100,000 and a tower in Brightwood that's nearly $250,000. Even when you own a bunch of places that you're renting out/collecting money on it can a while to get that much money, especially the $1 million.I also think the mapping system on the d-pad could have been put to better use. It is used for dog commands and health, but you have to hit the left trigger to get it to switch and it often switches back on you when you're in a pinch. Maybe could have used one of the other non-used trigger buttons for health access.Lastly, I didn't much like the fact that you can't die, which kind of goes hand in hand with my first gripe. It sort of takes away from the realism and is why the game is a bit easy. Instead of dying, you can only be knocked out and you come to within about 5 seconds or so and the only thing you lose is experience, sometimes you don't lose any, though.Overall, I thought Fable 2 was a magnificent game. I didn't have any problems with the game freezing up or losing save data and such like I've been reading from other reviewers. That must be a major bummer to have played 20 hours or more and it mess up on you. I've played it about 35 hours so far. I'll keep my fingers crossed that it doesn't happen to me, because I've still got probably got a few more hours to invest in it. Plus I would like to play it from anew in the future.It's going to be tough this holiday season, more so than ever, to pick out the best games based on our budgets. Unless you're wealthy, you'll probably have issues with which games to buy in the next month or so. Afterall, we've got GOW2, Resistance 2, Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Call of Duty, and Left 4 Dead just to name a few that will probably be must buys. That's alot of hefty choices and prices.If you're wanting a game in which you can spend a ton of time immersed in it's world and be amazed at the same time, then you can't go wrong here. It would make an outstanding gift for any adventure/rpg fan. It's simple, fun and easy to get into. It may not end up being better than GOW 2, Resistance 2 and the like, but it will be a close race and a tough decision to make on what to buy for those who have limited incomes. I highly recommend you get Fable 2, if not now, then eventually. It's oh so worth it! I give it 4.75 stars or a 9.5 out of 10. It doesn't get a whole lot better than this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G500s Laser Gaming Mouse with Adjustable Weight Tuning","description":"","reviewerName":"Trent Steele","summary":"Hits the sweet spot","reviewText":"This is pretty much the ideal mouse for me.  If you are a fan of the Logitech G5, this is the upgrade you want.  Coupled with Logitech's new gaming software, this mouse is the new standard in my eyes.Like the G5, the mouse also comes with a set of masses you can install to increase the weight of the device.  The shape differs only slightly.  There is now a larger thumbrest that allows you to completely rest your thumb.  There are now 3 thumb buttons instead of 2, and the DPI adjustment buttons have moved to left of the index finger.  But the best new addition is the introduction of the free mouse wheel toggle from the MX series Logitech mice.  If you are not familiar, this toggle button centered on the mouse allows you to switch from a more discrete, clicky wheel to a smooth, free-rolling one.  This new feature allows the G500s to cross gaming features with production features, and it works great.  The wheel also has a more satisfying button click, and of course it supports left and right scrolling.The DPI is obscene.  It goes all the way up to 8200, which I suppose is great if you are superhuman or have a ridiculous amount of pixel real estate.  The gaming software you download from Logitech allows you to specify up to 5 DPI settings you can switch on the fly via the DPI adjustment buttons (I have 5 between 600 and 2200 for example).The software also allows you to configure a profile that you can store on the mouse.  Or you can choose to use profiles on the computer.  That allows the software to detect different games for which each gets a profile that  can be customized to your liking.  Customizations include mapping buttons to key combinations or macros, so it's very powerful stuff.  I have to hand it to Logitech for really improving their software over the past few years.  The new gaming software for their mice and keyboards (it's the same app) is done very well with lots of power and a simple interface.There's very little not to like here, but the laser unfortunately doesn't seem to work particularly well with glass.  It, however, seems to work great with any of the other surfaces I tried.  Overall, it's a great mouse that I'm very happy to own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2013"}

Don't get me wrong, the bosses were epic but to get through one circle (stage) to the other circle and to defeat the bosses was very repetitive. Furthermore, I felt the story was lacking substance, because it talks about his seven sins with a brief cinematic scene...that's all. Also, the way you collect a Judas coin, a relic or any other other object you do it in the same fashion: pull out your cross and hit circle several times.Having said that, I would recommend to get God of War 3, because the developers are known to add originality and better story lines for the God of War franchise--we all know that God of War III will be on a massive scale.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Infernal Labor of Love","reviewText":"Many people who hear \"Dante's Inferno\" and \"video game\" in the same sentence would probably assume a poorly put together, Hollywood-style rip-off that has little to do with the actual literary work.  Instead, \"Dante's Inferno\" (the game) does an excellent job of showing homage to the original material: we have a \"bonus material\" digital download of the \"Longfellow [translation of the] poem\" and the game world is an art-heavy graphic reproduction of the Hell depicted by Dante.  Unfortunately, this can also be like saying you're going to make \"Book of Revelation:  the Video Game\":  your source material is bizarre and disturbing, and you have to graphically paint what a reader heretofore could only imagine.It's a tough task, but visually the developers of Dante's Inferno did well.  Throughout the game, every step of the way is fraught with horrid monsters, planes of torment, and the feel of a true struggle through hell.  Unfortunately, \"struggle\" is also a good way to describe the gameplay.  While the feel of the game is extremely similar to the God of War series, it misses out on a few of the more important elements that make God of War more appealing.  When you have the chance to do a \"finishing move\" on an enemy, you're given the choice to either \"Punish\" or \"Absolve\" them--either choice fills a kind of \"good/bad\" meter that will level up skills you buy in the Punish/Absolve skill trees. These power meters are more ornate than they are readable.  Quicktime events, the first time you hit them, aren't always clear as to exactly what you need to do.  I've adjusted the game's color settings, but the pink square and orange circle, when laid on a shining chrome background, isn't always easy to make out.  When you're in the midst of a frantic battle, having to take a moment to interpret the colors can mean the difference between \"win\" and \"reload...again\".These are minor quibbles that simply add to your reload count, but then there are the bigger ones, such as first-time use instructions sometimes showing up right on cue, other times interrupting the heat of combat and freezing you, and still other times waiting until you've screwed up a few times to tell you that you were supposed to know about such-and-such button combination.  I don't need to have my hand held, but when I'm being given a new combination that's required for me to progress, I need to know about it when it is given to me and not some time later when everything else I knew to this point failed repeatedly.  I found levelling my skills unnerving because I worried that I might miss some sort of skill I was going to have to have later.The graphics of Dante's Inferno are vivid and they are extremely detailed.  I've seen some reviewers mention \"constant\" nudity and/or sexual themes.  While not \"every ten seconds\" (as one reviewer suggests), at times it can certainly feel that way.  The original \"Inferno\" was written centuries ago and life was very different then--there certainly was no ESRB ratings system.  Lest you think the game is fraught with symbols or representative imagery, you should know that these depictions are very anatomically accurate and are often doing hideously unattractive and/or anatomically impossible things.  Dante's Inferno is 100% not appropriate for children and if you have kids, chances are you don't want them accidentally wandering into the room and it all coming out 20 years later in their therapy sessions.  We get some hint at this in the beginning, when our Christian Crusader is painfully sewing a cross into his flesh and spends some time slaughtering Kurds running at him with long knives, but that's the \"clean\" part of the game, before our descent even begins.If you're looking for an interesting diversion from God of War, Dante's Inferno will please your eyes and chafe at your patience.  I truly wouldn't recommend paying a premium for this game, nor would I recommend it to someone new to this style of game:  while Dante's Inferno deserves credit for being artistically over-the-top, there are other games out there that are more fun to play.  The \"Punish/Absolve\" trick with the skill tree is different, but not in a way that I enjoyed.  I can't say whether having seen the animated video would have made the game more entertaining, but I can say that what I've seen of its look and feel in the cutscenes of the game don't give me that impression:  the somewhat cheap, gory 2D animation bears little resemblance to this game's eye-popping graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries.

Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action.

Excellent story and characters. 13 endings!I did not play the SNES version back in the day, so I don't have the fond childhood memories nor nostalgic attachment to this game that others have.  I enjoyed this game, but not as much as others.  I personally prefer Star Ocean, Tales Of ..., Fire Emblems, and Final Fantasy games over this.I love all the endings and combo moves.  What I miss is the ability to customize your characters (like FF3 and Star Ocean).  You are able to customize your party by choosing which 4 will come along on the adventure at given points which is nice.I was quite distraught at the loss of a certain character in the game.  I won the game without that character and was excited to find out that I could play it again and win the game with the character if I wanted to.  I say this since the story and characters were meaningful enough for me to feel bad about losing one.  The only game that tops the feeling of 'character loss' is Fire Emblem where any (other than the primary hero) fallen character can be lost for the rest of the game.Overall, I enjoyed this game and think anyone who loves RPG's should definitely play it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

I had this game sitting on a shelf for almost a year, and finally I took the time to fully enjoy it.Usually, the first games that come out with the launch of a new game console are  there to show off it's capabilities, but they fade away into obscurity very quickly.  Halo is one of the very few exceptions to the rule, and this is without a doubt, the game that built Xbox's reputation into what it is today, hands down.In my opinion, the main factor in keeping me coming back to this game was pure playability. I didn't admire so much the landscapes, the weapons, the AI or even the great vehicles available for combat.  What I really admired was the ease of playing (and I mean playing, not actually winning).  The controls are comfortable, the movements are smooth, the feel is just perfect.All games have room for improvement, for me Halo has its major flaw with the automatic checkpoint saves - The program automatically saves your progress at specific (I call arbitrary) spots during the game.  I found myself going way back to a previous checkpoint after spending almost an hour of tough combat.  This situation also brought another gripe, sometimes I felt that certain parts were supposed to be completed in a seemingly \"specific\" way, with no room for improvisation.  A slight deviation in tactics and you ended up flying in the air and back to the last checkpoint.  Also, if you did something wrong, such as wasting ammo or grenades, you had no way to backtrack into a more comfortable position.  A couple of times I had to restart a level after finding myself in an exceedingly frustrating impossible checkpoint because of the lack of weapons and ammo.Sound settings would've been a nice addition to the game.  I often noticed that the music and sound effects volume didn't allow you to listen the game dialog clearly enough.  Dialog is important to succedd in more than a few missions.After several days I was able to complete all the Campaign missions in Normal mode.  I recommend a new player to start with Easy.  I believe Normal mode is still a bit difficult for the average player.In the end, Halo for Xbox is a truly exciting action game, with many different combat options that will keep you hooked until the end.

To put it in perspective, I played 30 hours of FINAL FANTASY XIII and had nowhere near as much fun as with this game.I am only 20% complete with JC2, but have already surpassed 30 hours of game time!Am I bored yet?No.Why?-- You can do missions for 3 different factions at any time you want.-- You can liberate villages (and sometimes it's just a matter of finding all the powerup crates).-- You can liberate military bases.-- You can walk, extract, drive ground vehicles, choppers, boats, aircraft, motorcycles and utilize the parachute/grapple.-- You can hijack any vehicle, even if it's in motion!-- You can upgrade weapons and armor. Yes, the bad guys are hard to kill, but they do have body armor. The civilians die more readily.-- You can explore the whole huge map right from the get-go!-- You can find Easter Eggs like an homage to the LOST series.-- You can play this game for short bursts of time if you have a busy life -- and still have a blast!-- My top 5 things to do:1) Take off in a jet, towing a car behind me2) Making the bells fall down in the bell towers3) Driving a limo through the jungle during a mission, with baddies on your tail . . . and still making it to the safehouse intact.4) Headshots. About 1/3 of all my kills have been headshots. The other third melee and the final third is just plain sloppy shooting.5) Poke fun at BolO San TOE Si's craaaaazy accent!On that note, yeah, the storyline is nothing special and the voice acting is funny, but it was obviously meant to be that way. This game is not trying to be \"ueber-realistic\". The most realistic part of it are the graphics. My goodness! They really need a camera item for this game so Rico can take pictures of the game world.The flight controls are a little hard to get used to, but after awhile it almost feels like they grafted ACE COMBAT into the game!The only other cons I have:-- The HEAT levels are a bit inconsistent. And why is it that every time I walk into a village, even if I don't do anything, violence breaks out between the locals and the Panaun Army?-- I'm playing this on a 50\" screen projected by an HD20 Optoma projector. Even at this size, the text on the map legend is hard to read.-- A few glitches where you can't reach 100% for an area. This seems to be due to blowing things up from too far away.Well, I think that about wraps up this review -- it's cutting into my time with this game!

{"product_name":"B0009O7HVW","reviewerName":"Alex Honda \"onyx575\"","summary":"FUN BUT FREEZES DURING GAME PLAY!","reviewText":"The second version of X-MEN LEGENDS 2:RISE OF THE APOCALYPSE is really a fun game. It's pretty much like the first version where you take control of four heroes (x-men or brotherhood or both-and you can switch between them), solve mysteries like finding and talking to certain characters, and fighting your way to Apocalypse. And like the first version, each hero comes with their own unique mutant powers.One thing that was improved over the first X-MEN LEGENDS is that techbits(money) are plentiful and health/energy packs are usually dropped by every other enemy you defeat. Another improvement is that players have a choice of difficulty setting, so yes, there's an EASY setting, so the game doesn't get too frustrating. Also, the heroes and the enemies are more evenly matched, whereas the fist version had the heroes starting out at level one--while enemies seemed to be at level ten-- making it difficult to pass the early stages of the game.Another plus is that when you finally beat the game you can choose to continue a new game with all your gear, levels, and unlocked characters intact, which didn't happen in version one.However, the bad thing about X-MEN LEGENDS 2 is that it crashes/freezes when you get to ACT FOUR. This happens if you start carrying and stashing too much gear and is hateful! There's nothing that can bring you down faster than having a fun game suddenly freeze on you. It happened to me during a fight and I had no idea what happened. The game just froze and I had to start all over from the save point.Anyway, it kept freezing pretty much on or near the same spot, so I thought it was a defective disc. I exchanged it for another one and had the same problem. So I contacted Activision, via email, and they contacted me an hour later with the solution (I posted it in the forum section). That fixed the problem, so at least Activision has good tech support, but still...the freezing thing was not good!That's why I gave this game a 4/3 stars, otherwise it would have easily been 5/5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2007"}

The singers are NOT the real thing ( for some of the songs I knwo for sure in a video you can unlock ) but they sound damn close! Especially Bark at the Moon and Iron Man ( besides the beginning \"I am iron man\". ) Franz Ferdinand is also done pretty well.Control: 9/10. The game takes you from noob to pro pretty much. You start out with the first three buttons on easy, first four on medium, and hard and expert introduces the fifth. There is a little notch on the yellow key, just like there is on the F and J buttons on a keyboard.Fun: Over 45 songs, multiplayer, plenty of unlockables including 2 characters ( one is definitely cool, find out if you get the game ), a lot of songs, guitar skins, guitars, and the-making-of videos.

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Shaide","summary":"Stunning and breath taking","reviewText":"I just recently had the honor of playing the PS3 exclusive game &#8220;Uncharted: Drakes Fortune&#8220;. The game is fairly old, however you wouldn&#8217;t guess that by looking at the jaw dropping graphics. You might be wondering if it is so old, why did it take so long to play it? Well, to begin with I didn&#8217;t have any interest. I saw videos, and screen shots and to be honest, I thought it was going to be Tomb Raider with a male leading character, and I despised the TOmb Raider games, even more than I despised the Tomb Raider movies!When I finally played it, I learned quickly that the ame is NOTHING like Tomb Raider, which is a good thing. In fact, the game is really unlike anything I have ever played. Sure, the story might not be original, and some of the dialog might be a bit clich&eacute;, but the gameplay it&#8217;s self is truly unique and entertaining!Basically, the story follows Nathan Drake, who happens to be a treasure hunter. Kind of like a modern-day Indiana Jones, except not quite as cool. As you start playing, one of the things you will notice is the tutorial guides. They are extremely helpful and informative, and teach you how to manuever around the world of Uncharted. It is highly advised that you do not ignore these.The controls are simple enough so that anyone can pretty much pick up a gamepad and begin playing, and if you are having trouble, the game guides you into the action. You aren&#8217;t tossed head first into life and death situations. So, by the time you are in the heat of it all, you will be quite comfortable with the controls and play style of the game.Everything about this game is great, the Story, though not original is entertaining, and the voice acting os probably some of the best that I have heard in video games to date! There&#8217;s not a thing about this game anyone can complain about. Well, at least not til toward the end.You see, as you begin nearing the end of the game, Uncharted decides to introduce a new enemy type to the game. This Enemy is a melee enemy which just so happens to pack quite a punch. This means all of a sudden you are forced to break away from the controls you are used to. The method of combat that you have lovingly been introduced to is pretty much tossed out on its ear. Gone are the days of taking cover and aiming down the barrel for accurate shots. In order to survive you simply have to run like a maniac and shoot from the hip. Yea, suddenly, the game becomes a standard Run&#8217;N'Gun type game. To make matters worse, the game doesn&#8217;t give you any indication that, now might be a good time to change your entire play style.This sudden change made the game frustrating, however After I played it and finished it, and looked back at the game. I think it was a nice touch. Sure it was a pain in the ass, but it gave the game a sense of confusion and panic. It made the game seem to come alive.Over-all I would say the game is top-notch and is a must own, and am throughly impressed with this game title. Never before have I been this pleasantly surprised with a video game title.Looking forward to trying Uncharted 2 now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2013"}

Skip this review if you want feedback on online multiplayer, I'm all about single player campaign mode in FPS games & if they have a co-op mode available to play with a buddy in the same room then that's even better.  Killzone 3 was plenty long enough, the story was interesting enough and the game never became so hard that it wasn't fun like a few other games I've played have been.  The visuals are amazing, and when you're about to fight a MAWLR (I think that's what it was called) it is sheer chaos and completely amazing to just look around while you're running for your life to see everything that's going on.You can indeed play the entire game in offline splitscreen co-op mode (with a friend sitting next to you).  It is long enough that you will not be able to pass it in one sitting (unless your friend is equally good), which is great.  It is so fun and rare these days to be able to do that!The previous game I bought was Medal Of Honor, which was really disappointing with how short it was, so it was nice to see a longer game.  I still wish they'd release two versions of games - one for online gamers, and the other for people who just like to throw on a game and play the standard single player, since both versions would be better for it.  But this was a fun game, had remnants of what felt like Halo, but kept its own feel to it.  I was impressed and would say it's worth paying anything under $45.00 - the re-playability factor will be excellent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

I thought the 09 and even 10 versions of NCAA fell flat and were bland.NCAA 11 fixes all of that. After only a short week of play, I've totally gone back to the NCAA bandwagon and this is the best NCAA game yet. The graphics, and particularly the animations are the best the series has seen. The gameplay is super solid as well, making it challenging but not cheap. You can chose any type of play style or playbook and play anyway you want and it all feels legit and smooth.The dynasty modes are slightly unchanged but have a new interface which I think is again the best yet.I'm playing the online dynasty with a group of friends for the first time, and being able to recruit online from your P.C. to your online dynasty is an amazingly fun and addicting obsession to help you kill time during a lunch break or during Chemistry 101.While I am debating owning both Madden and NCAA in the same year (Have heard great things on Madden, including the addition of Gus Johnson doing the announcing) I am not debating getting Madden as a replacement for NCAA for the first time in three years.Madden might have to wait its turn.(EDIT: After playing it more and more the shine is starting to wear off. It isn't nearly as good as Madden 10, in my opinion, though the setup of recruiting, both online and offline dynasties is FANTASTIC and the best yet. Very visual and easier to follow along with.That being said, I have a major problem with the passing because it is so uneven. Some routes take forever to develop and your line, no matter their skill and if it is max protection, just don't give you enough time to execute.And many times I've fired a bullet to my WR, and out of nowhere a DB, who is not even on the same side of the field or aware of the fact that I'm throwing it to A DIFFERENT receiver than he is responsible for somehow makes an amazing break on the ball and flies across the field to knock it down. BS.There are ways to make the game even and fair, but that way is NOT to make the AI be superman.If this just happened once in awhile I would be ok with it... but, sheesh, it happens once a series or more. Not acceptable.After playing the Madden 11 demo a few times Madden is much more legit and fair in terms of not having \"superman\" on the field.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2010"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"A refined, honed Gears of War experience","reviewText":"Quick overview:  Gears of War 2 is, obviously, the second in a series of third person cover based shooters.  The events in Gears of War take place in the future when an apparent maligned race of underground dwellers are trying to wipe out humanity and dominate Earth.  Your character, a rather salty and grizzled war veteran, works with a small group of other similar characters to tear up the battlefield and ultimately save humanity.  The setting is dark, gory, and action packed.  Gears of War 2 seems to take place immediately after the events of Gears of War and while not knowing the context of the story won't really be a disadvantage, I would recommend starting with the original so you know the time line and can experience the story as it was intended to be told.  Gears of War may be a shooter, but it does have an epic back story that is enjoyable.For fans of the genre, Gears of War 2 definitely delivers.  This time around there is a bit more variety in the levels in regards to vehicles and gunride missions.  There are even a few parts that are almost platformy -- dodge this, run here, tag this place in time, etc.  The dialog is just as bad as the first one, but it is so bad it is entertaining -- like a campy B rated horror movie.  There is even a very out of place sorta-ish Love subplot...  although it is rather painful to endure.While they've added a bit wider of a variety of level play styles, I'll say the standard combat scenarios we've come to welcome in Gear of War have gotten even better.  They've really opened up the battlefield making use of the 360 degree style of combat the game is known for.  Flanking, alternative elevations, dynamic battlefields, and destroyable cover are some of the new factors now evident in the game.  Where Gears of War felt like a corridor with obstacles in a lot of cases, Gears of War 2 really does open the battlefield up a majority of the time.  The addition of new weapons just brings the maelstrom to a crescendo -- tweaks/adjustments on the existing weapons, the addition of new weapons, the addition of new \"heavy\" style weapons, and even a shield that you can plant as mobile cover.  Sometimes it is hard to decide what to pick up because all of them are so fun.  Speaking of mobile cover:  using a downed enemy as a meat shield is something no Gears of War fan should ever miss out on.Being able to crawl away while wounded is another entertaining addition to combat -- nothing like being peeled by something and frantically wailing on the A button while you watch your broken character bleed his way to cover in hopes of being revived.  The cover entrance and exit dynamics feel different and definitely work smoother.  Weapons have stopping power which really makes a difference when an enemy is charging you, as well as it makes it more difficult for you to barrel into fire headlong.The co-op play is fantastic and I highly recommend experiencing the game like that.  It adds another fantastic dimension to the game to play with a live partner as you work together to tear up the Locust.  There is a deep satisfaction in watching your partner, on the other side of the battlefield, hop over cover and run, chainsaw first, at some unsuspecting Locust Drone -- only to see the Drone get chainsawed, groin up, from behind, in a mesmerizing spatter of intestinal gore.I haven't had a chance to spend much time in the multi-player arena.  I buy GoW games for the single player and co-op stuff.  What I have played of the MP stuff seems vastly improved, but it is too early to tell, for me at least, if it will degenerate into a roadie-run and melee-smash/shotgun-blast fast like the first one did.  You get the opportunity to play against bots to check out the various game modes and for me that was a bonus.  That feature gives you a chance to get familiar with the game styles before you head out into the \"real world\" and get your face handed to you.  Lastly, there is an additional game mode, \"Horde\" which pits you (and your friends, if you'd like) against ever increasing waves of baddies.  I would recommend anyone who can try this mode out with their friends at least once.  It is a blast.Ultimately, the creators of Gears of War 2 did right by the game and the series.  They've refined, smoothed out, and honed the Gears of War experience.  Gears of War 2 is what, at least I think, everyone who played Gears of War was hoping the original would be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0011BE3KA","description":"The renowned Silent Hill survival horror series continues on the PS2 with a brand new adventure that reveals many of the series most hallowed secrets. Assuming the role of a lone truck driver who becomes trapped in Silent Hill, players must escape the city's horrific inhabitants and confront the strange hallucinations that have haunted him since childhood. Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Sanitised and unoriginal, Silent Hill for beginners","reviewText":"I was so delighted when this PS2 port was announced, it saved me from having to invest in a PSP solely for this one game: I would have, I have every other Silent Hill game and play them repeatedly, I wasn't about to let Origins pass me by on a relatively small technicality like a different platform.And I was encouraged by the screenshots on various gaming websites; the graphics, while nowhere near the standards of SH3 or SH4, certainly looked to have been heavily enhanced... ...and the reports of faithful SH-style gameplay and plot development left me with great hopes for this title. But now that I've finished it I find I am nonplussed... ...read on.GRAPHICS: 3/5The renders are beautiful, the lighting is very Silent Hill, and the upgrades over the PSP version are great - but SH: Origins still takes a backseat to the seven year-old Silent Hill 2 in terms of detail and character animation. Travis moves like he's wearing a spinal brace of some sort, but the creatures in SH move as fluidly as they ever did - if somewhat less scary, which is a shame considering their design is excellent. Human character design is blocky and basic, with Lisa Garland and Michael Kauffmann sharing more with their PS1 counterparts than anything else. Travis, Dahlia and Alessa are clearly designed and well-textured, but also somewhat flat and boring-looking. Level design is clever, and there are some lovely effects here and there (particularly the Artaud Theatre and Hotel levels), but SH: Origins has none of those ultra-creepy background vignettes (think Valtiel in SH3 or the giant Eileen head from SH4) to unsettle the player, and ultimately winds up looking a little generic.Visually, SH: Origins is a very mixed bag, but by no means unplayable or flat: the overall visual impact lacks the same melancholic punch as former PS2 releases though, and this is a real shame. But for a PSP port it's a great effort - just more of a sanitised Silent Hill than we're used to.SOUND: 3/5Again, not very creepy and not very engaging: the kindest thing one could say about the game's music is that it closely resembles other, better tracks from other, better Silent Hill games. The opening sequence is very engaging, with the title song playing as the player controls Travis' initial run into Silent Hill, but other than that there's no memorable tracks or noises to raise the player's hackles. Voice acting is so-so; it was more effective in SH 1.PLAYABILITY: 3/5Gameplay does indeed follow that tried-and-loved Silent Hill method of enter area/find clues/solve puzzle/leave area, and the controls themselves are responsive and clear. The Resident Evil-style grappling system is a nice diversion, and Travis' relatively low levels of stamina (he can't sprint for very long and often slows down to a panting crawl) adds greatly to the tension you feel when out and about on Silent Hill's monster-populated streets. Breakable weapons are a distraction: there's plenty of guns and ammo dotted about SH and the sheer volume of melee weapons left in your inventory by the game's end will make you wonder \"why?\". The difficulty curve is slightly easier than the latter half of SH4, so it's no pushover but certainly no Devil May Cry, either.The major downsides of gameplay come from the camera angles (as with all games of this nature, there are times when it's incredibly poorly-implemented) and a sluggish response time when you try to load the map or inventory screen during battle. But overall, SH: Origins is fun to play: deeply unoriginal but who cares about that?OVERALL: 2.5/5Even if this had come out on PS1 after Silent Hill 1 it would only be a solid 3-star effort: the story is not engaging enough and the gameplay too basic to make this a firm recommendation. For Silent Hill fans it's a nice addition to the canon but not really competition for any other game in the series: it's too generic. Still, it's not a bad game, not by any manner of means - if you can get it cheaply then definitely do so.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005NCCI","description":"Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, the first PlayStation2 installment in the Crash Bandicoot series, delivers the same mix of intuitive gameplay and elaborate adventure that fans have come to expect, offering many enhancements and all-new environments and missions. Neo Cortex is back, and he means to rid himself of Crash once and for all. To energize his most diabolical creation to date, Cortex channels the power of the Elementals, a group of renegade masks with the destructive power of air, earth, water, and fire. To stop the Elementals and Cortex's new weapon, Crash or Coco (a fully playable character for the first time) will face five game hubs, 25 dynamic levels, and five unique bosses, as well as a new character that will rock the Crash world.You can complete specific levels of the game to play as Crash's fiery sister. Coco will have a wide variety of moves and animations tailored to fit her personality. New free-roam sections will be implemented within certain levels of the game. These sections feature puzzles and hidden areas never before seen in a Crash game. New bosses and minibosses offer up a Noah's Ark-sized list of new creatures. The game also has an all-new graphics engine that brings vivid life to environments and characters like never before.","reviewerName":"GamerGirl","summary":"Decent Game, but Flawed","reviewText":"I really enjoy Crash Bandicoot games. The Wratch of Cortex was also enjoyable in its way, but there were too many frustrations for me to really be enthusiastic about it. There are 30 levels in the game, including the bosses. If you have ever played a Crash Bandicoot game before, then you will find everything you have come to expect from one. You are in a 2.5-D world, sometimes side-scrolling, sometimes a third person view from the front or behind, and sometimes using one of the game's numerous modes of transportation (i.e. biplane, mine cart, dune buggy, etc.). If you were expecting improved graphics, then your expectations will be pleasantly fulfilled. The game moves very smoothly through some beautiful environments.So what are my complaints? First, Crash seems harder to control than I remember from his previous adventures. I think one of the biggest factors in this are the camera angles. Sometimes it seems that the camera is too close so that you cannot see everything around you, and then sometimes it seems too far away and it is hard to judge the depth of your enemies. I think I noticed this the most on the levels where you have a front view of Crash and he is being chased by something behind him. The camera seems to be in way too close, so that nitro crates, holes, and other obstacles just jump out in front of you, forcing you to die a million times while you memorize the route you have to take. Second, some of levels tended to be repetitive. Granted, I did enjoy some of the newer levels. There were a couple of short sections of levels where you got to ride a mine cart, which was fun. There were also three levels where you were rolling through the level inside a sphere, giving it a marble madness feel. I would have liked to see more levels like these rather than the underwater and biplane levels that seem to pop up repeatedly in every single game in the series. Third, the bosses were just painful. I may be biased because I really do not like bosses, but these ones seemed more annoying than usual. Lastly, the loading times were the worst I have ever seen in any video game. You have spend at least a minute or so staring at a loading screen every time you enter and leave a level. I was actually discouraged from playing this game many times because I knew how much time would be wasted on loading screens.Of course a Crash Bandicoot game would not be complete without the gems and relics. After you beat a level, you can replay it and try to open every box in the level to win a gem, or race through the level and beat a set time to win a relic. Once you beat the final boss you are granted access to a secret room with 5 extra levels that are earned by winning relics from the levels. This could be interesting if you actually have the patience to play through all the levels over again.I might have given this game 4 stars had it not been for the hideous loading times. It got so ridiculous that I would start flipping channels during the loading screens because I got so bored. Aside from that, this is a pretty adequate helping of Crash if you have enjoyed previous games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2002"}

Touted as an open world game, it doesn't give the player the freedom of choice or branching narratives a true RPG would have.  You can't decide to be a psycho and massacre a town or kill innocents, etc.  To this I say big deal.  It's a first person shooter with upgradable weapons and cars.  The game looks good.  It's fast-paced.  Even the racing missions are pretty fun.My only issue with the game is that it employs the waning convention of the \"mute protagonist.\"  I find this unsettling and weird.  Personally, I'd prefer my character to be just that, a character.  With a guy who just stands there and doesn't say anything, we can't know what his goals and aspirations are.  Therefore, the game's missions feel a little disconnected.  I keep wondering why this guy has any interest in going on all these missions to help the townspeople.But don't let this prevent you from buying Rage.

It feels as if they tried to make this more like Uncharted, but unfortunately the story is weak and probably the worst part of the whole game.Creative dismemberment was so cool in 2. Now it's barely effective as you are swarmed and cornered constantly. Weapon upgrades are annoying and confusing and I didn't feel a real sense of satisfaction in performance from taking the time and effort to upgrade. After a while you can pretty much predict when the attacks are coming which defeats the whole purpose of this type of game completely.

I grew up on the MGS series, starting all the way back one the original for PS1. I remember playing it with my dad, and how I would get scared when the DARPA chief has his &#34;event&#34; (I am avoiding spoilers as best as I can), or meeting Liquid, and so on. Memories, nostalgia, hell I still own the game in it's original case. And with each entry, the series grew to become greater in so many ways; MGS 2 made the story much more complex, but also a hellava lot more interesting if you can follow it, and it also gave the series both a brand new protagonist to follow, a boost in graphics, and a range of new weapons and equipment to play with, along with new mechanics. MGS furthered all the above, went back in time to Big Boss's origins and how he became the man he would become, and gave us (in my opinion) the first truly emotionally charged MGS story. Hear me out on that one; Big Boss had to not only deal with his former mentor, a woman he loved and respected and admired, but also had to deal with another woman he started to fall in love with in EVA. That, and the events that transpire are so much more organic and emotional than anything prior; it is almost like each game wanted you on your feels, and this game upped that ante up quite a bit (MGS had Sniper Wolf and Otacon, Snake and Meryl, Snake and Gray Fox. MGS 2 had Raiden and Rose, Otacon and EE, Raiden and Olga.) MGS 3 also introduced a system which I hope they bring back = the Cure system. Broken bone? You can see it and even see the repair happen. It was graphic, but realistic, and really felt like I was fixing myself up versus always healing via rations all the time. I also personally love the eating animations of when Snake feeds on a snake himself; it's the little things for me. And then there was MGS 4, a polarizing game in many senses due to it being the heaviest game of the series to rely upon cutscenes (It was half movie, half game really, but I loved the story so I never complained). The story also became more and more close to convolution, and even I found myself becoming lost at times, but thank god for the Internet. Still, it upped the story, emotion, action, and all else to it's peak at the time, and also brought the Metal Gear Online system up, which I enjoyed.So with all that said, we are talking about the Fifth iteration of the series, specifically Part 1 of the Fifth = Ground Zeroes. I will say this outright: I liked it. The story was darker than normal, more graphic, and more real and moving, and yet it felt consistent with what was going on, and where the series was heading. Kiefer Sutherland did a surprisingly great job replacing David Hayter as the new Snake for this series of the games (even though I always will think of Mr. Hayter as Solid Snake, never will change). The graphics look amazing, with textures, lighting, and nature effects beautifully showcased. The sound and music is fantastic. The story and missions in the game, both main and side, are all great, and to get a feel of the overall story all of the side missions should be done. The gameplay is nice and feels good, and feels new yet with an old structure to it. However, I personally miss the original health system and stealth system; I feel like this game copied Conviction and Blacklist a bit from Splinter Cell, and although that isn't a bad thing, I wish there was an old school mode that played like the original titles. Which brings me to the main complaint: the game is lacking in serious replay ability. Don't get me wrong, the story, the missions, all of the game is fun and enticing to play, and even if it is only about a 5 hour experience (for me that is since I do everything, unless it's a speed run), it still beckons at least one more play through. The problem in the game is that once you beat it twice, once you find everything and do everything, all that is left is to beat it as fast and efficiently as possible, and really that in itself isn't terribly hard to do (it has moments, but it isn't incredibly hard compared to other titles). Now, I have read everywhere that this game has replay ability from all sorts of critics, while the fans are the opposite, and I am more in the middle personally; there is quite alot to play and see, and it is fun to replay again, BUT there could have been so much more done that honestly would't have been very hard to do. Did they consider doing Alternative Missions or a form of VR Missions from MGS 2, for those both could teach you skills and hone them, as well as make you understand the game even better. What about different modes, such as an Old School mode which makes the game harder and play more like the original titles? What about maybe even a Permadeath mode, to really push the gamer to be the best stealth killer they could be? They all require work, time, and effort, but each (to me) would make this game so much more viable as a $30 priced game. I do hope that they add a patch that adds a new difficulty, or maybe extra missions or something.In short, the game is fantastic, and even though I am biased at times in terms of the gameplay and it's new changes, the game plays wonderfully as a whole and looks great. However, the amount of things to do dwindles fast as you replay the game, and really there is not much to do after a second play through, and sadly there is really not a need or want to do so beyond trying to maybe 100% it. It is a great demo of what is to come, but it leaves much to be desired.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2014"}

It just felt like they threw a bunch of stuff at the wall to make a game that would be appealing during a particularly dry spell and came out with this.I think what got to me most was that it just felt tedious, I had no love for the character that I was playing, and it lost my interest pretty quickly. Not that you need to play an uber charismatic demi god for a game to keep my interest, but this just felt too bulky and plodding or something. I had really high hope for it and just left feeling underwhelmed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

This does what it says it does.  I got this at a video game specialty store for around $25 shipped.  I would not pay more for something like this.This mount is very adjustable and as sturdy as it needs to be to hold the Kinect on top of the TV set.  It uses gravity/physics to hold in place and does a good job of it.  It's easy to install.  You just set the front lip of the mount over the top and front of the TV and pull the rear part of the mount down (and if you have a thicker LCD, you can extend the back part of the mount accordingly) until you get a flat surface on which to mount the Kinect.  Then you place the Kinect on top flush with the front of the mount and use the hand-operated screw to tighten the mount to the Kinect (there's a screw hole under the Kinect just for things such as this).  Then test it for stability and adjust as necessary.You can slide the privacy cover into place as necessary, but it always makes me laugh how people are so afraid of keeping privacy on their Xbox while on the other hand their laptops, tablets and i-devices/phones with cameras are far more of a threat when it comes to privacy than any Xbox.I like this mount particularly because it doesn't display some cheap brand name across the front (like other mounts) that you'd otherwise have to stare at.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube.

The shadows/shading is great and has never been done to this high quality on the ps2 before. 16:9 widescreen is also included.9/10SoundThe music is brilliant and varies from hard beat to rousing operatic styles that really capture the mood and stir the emotions.

The original GoldenEye on N64 introduced me to first-person shooters when I was 11 years old. Obviously, I have fond memories of playing the original (I still have it), which means I was already sold on the idea of a re-imagining. I had faith in Eurocom, and am happy to report that they did NOT disappoint. In fact, what they've done is taken the spirit of the original, and make a game that, honestly, is better than the original. GoldenEye 007 on Wii is, quite frankly, the best first person shooter for Nintendo's system, and is even better than anything I've played on the other systems, Modern Warfare included. Yes, this is the new king of first-person shooters!Goldeneye on Wii as we know is not a remake of the original, but instead a reimagining for a new generation. I think Activision chose this route due to the impossibility of completely capturing the feel of the classic. Here's the great news however, Goldeneye Wii has enough resemblance to bring back the nostalgia of the classic but enhances the gameplay enough to bring you in to the modern day FPS.Story: 9.5The story at it's core is basically the same, but with the exchange of Pierce Brosnan for Daniel Craig things needed to change to fit the new style of our current Bond. Activision brought in the original screenplay writer to make the adjustments for the new game and it's brought to life fantastically!Gameplay: 9.5There is no reason for anyone to have complaints about the gameplay in Goldeneye Wii. Activision has done a great job adding in melee, cover, and anything else you might expect with a modern day shooter. On top of that they've included every control option imagineable to suit every gamers need.Graphics: 10This game is gorgeous on Wii. Activision did a nice job polishing this game up, and it helps enthrall the gamer in to the universe.Replayability: 10Not only has Activision included 4-player split screen multiplayer for nostalgia, but they've added in 8-player online matches to boot. If you finish the single player campaign the multiplayer will keep you busy.Overall Value: 10This game needs to be a part of any gamers library. If you haven't picked this game up yet then go get it. This games does a great job seperating itself from the classic, but shows that it's a love child of the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Introducing Simon Belmont to the world! The game is short and brutally difficult.","reviewText":"\"Castlevania\" is one of those major franchises still active today that began life in the NES era.  `Castlevania\" shows Japanese developers offering their interpretation in glorious 8-Bit of the tropes of the horror genre, featuring such disconnected monsters as Mummies, Frankenstein and Igor, Medusa, the Grim Reaper, and Dracula himself.  The game is scary, brutally difficult, and just plain fun.\"Castlevania\" is the first title in the series.  Like other NES games, there isn't much in the plot.  You, as Simon Belmont (aimed initially with a whip), must set out to slay Dracula by entering his castle, transvering six stages, and then showing the Count that the Belmonts mean business.The game is a typical platformer of the era and is on the short side, at only six stages.  However, the atmosphere and setting is truly what makes \"Castlevana\" special.  At the start of the game, Simon walks to the gates of the Count's Castle, enters the gate, and prepares for an epic showdone.  The eery setting is just fanstatic. You go through the delipated portions of the castle, underwater passages, outside sections, etc.  The enemies are spooky (knights, skeletons, mermen, skeleton snakes that breathe fire, demented monkeys, Medusa heads, you name it).  What's really awesome is, although the game is linear, once you beat the first stage, you get to see an overall map of the Castle and the path that Simon is trodding.  This touch is quite unique for a game of its age.\"Castlevania\" features several special weapons. You can get a whip upgrade, a throwing star, an axe, and holy water (which Konami puts to infamous use in the vastly inferior sequel, \"Castlevania II: Simon's Quest\").  Unlike other games come to the era, \"Castlevania\" uses hearts as ammunition.  Each time you use a special weapon you spend one heart.  Roast Beef (or a pork chop) also gives you health.The game is famous for two things: its difficulty and its stiff controls.  Simon controls like a rock, and a heavy one at that.  There is no fluid, fast movements like Mario.  Simon moves slowly and is rather stiff to control.  The biggest challenge about the controls is when Simon gets hit by an enemy he jumps back several feet.  Often times, you will get hit and then Simon jumps backward, falling a bottomless pit.  This can get frustrating after a while.Some manuals don't give you much to go on as far as strategies or even information regarding the villains of the game.  Castlevania's manual only lists the points each boss is worth.  Here is the information.  \"Grim Reaper: 7,000 points; The Count!: 50,000 points\".  The manual also states Queen Medusa is worth 3,000 points and Frankenstein and Igor are worth 5,000.In addition to the settings control, we then have the enemies and bosses.  Although Simon has several health bars, a lot of the enemies will take four of his bars at a time, giving Simon only a few hits.  There are a lot of sections where the enemies are coming fast and furious, especially the corridor leading up to the fight with the Grim Reaper.Then we have the aforementioned bosses themselves.  The first boss is a Giant Bat.  Not too difficult, and a fairly simple battle.  Next up is Medusa's Head.  I remember seeing the Medusa head in an early issue back in the 1980s; when I played through \"Castlevania\" for the first time years and years later, it instantly brought back memories of Nintendo Power.  Anyway, that one's pretty easy too.  Third up is the Dual Mummies.  Slight increase in difficulty but still managable.  Be thankful.  That's the last time you'll get a fairly manageable boss.The next three bosses are nightmares.  Next up is Frankenstein and Igor.  This is where the difficulty really gets ratched up.  First, you have to go through a narrow corridor with these skeleton snakes that shoot fire and move and wind around, taking away precious life before the battle ahead.  Once you beat those and get to Frankenstein and Igor, you then must content with Igor's rapid speed.  Without Igor, Frankenstein isn't that difficult.  However, due to Igor's speed and how he jumps around here and there and everything, he can be difficult to dodge given how sluggish Simon moves.And then we have the Grim Reaper.  Blue Oyster Cult lied to you.  Be afraid of the Reaper.  Be VERY, VERY AFRAID.  Forget Dracula, this guy is an absolute nightmare.  For most players, this will be the final boss, because they won't get past him (if they even get this far).The NES is home to some of the most difficult boss battles of any game system . . . and this battle with the Grim Reaper is easily one of the most difficult boss battles on the NES.  It's utter horror.  What's worst, to get to the Grim Reaper, you most navigate a long cooridor filled with knights throwing flying axes and Medusa heads that weave in and out of Simon's path.  This cooridor is hell to navigate without getting hit, and believe me, you'll need all your health you can get to survive Death.  The Grim Reaper throws all these different scythes at you and disappears and reappears throughout the confined room, making him difficult to hit.  Your best bet?  As soon as he appears, start spamming him with holy water.  And if you don't have holy water?  Well, good luck, because in the words of Han Solo, you're going to need it.  Only skill will keep you alive.Then we have the Count.  The last stage has these spinning wheel platforms, with giant eagles (who are the bane of some many NES gamers, especially for those playing \"Ninja Gaiden\") throw these enemies at you.  Once you get past the final stage, you find yourself at the base of moss covered stairs.  Victory is within your grasp.  Perhaps.The time has come to face Dracula.  He has two forms: a human form, and then a giant demon form.  He will kill you in four hits.  With only four hits at your disposal, your timing must be impeccable.  He disappears and reappears, causes fire columns to rise from the flood, and shoots fire at you, all the while teleporting.  Once you beat the first form, then he turns into a giant bouncing demon who can be difficult to avoid.  Use all the Holy Water you can against the second form.And there you have it.  James Roolf, the Angry Video Game Nerd, said it took him twenty years to beat \"Castlevania\", and I believe it.  Just like life in the Middle Ages, this game is short, brutal, and monstrous.  But it's also a lot of fun if you can get use to the quirky sluggish controls and the (pardon the pun) monstrous difficulty.  However a lot of players may not put in the time required due to these issues.*The original \"Castlevania\" came out in 1987.  For those real masochists out there, there was an arcade version that doubled the damage you took by enemies, in order to eat as many the gamer's quarters as possible.  This arcade port was actually my first exposure to the original \"Castlevania\" back in the 1980s.**The game came out in 1986 on the Famicom Disk System.  A sequel called \"Vampire Killer\" was released in 1986 for the MSX console (home of the original and vastly different \"Metal Gear\" and \"Metal Gear 1\"), which is more RPG and exploration than a straight linear title, similar to \"Castlevania II\".  This game has NEVER been released outside of Japan. For shame, Konami!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2012"}

Melee and Metroid Prime. Pikmin was very fresh and innovative, though, because the concept was different than your usual game, causing it to stand out a bit. Commanding an army of little creatures called Pikmin to help a very small man when he crash lands on a strange planet just hadn't really been done in games before. Pikmin sure got it right the first time, though, in a great, creative game that earned a pretty strong fan base. Now, with Nintendo's New Play Control, Pikmin has come to Wii with new controls and... new controls. Is this Wii rendition still a great game or just a tired concept?Pikmin's story involves Captain Olimar crash landing on a strange planet on a trip of some sort. His ship is in shambles, and he is able to locate 30 parts from the ship that he needs to get home. His life support will only last him for 30 days, though, because a toxic substance called 'oxygen' exists in the air. He quickly encounters a small creature which he names Pikmin, and this interesting species of little beings help him find the 30 parts of his ship and return home, and along the way the Pikmin learn independence and gain the ability to survive on their dangerous home planet. The story is very unique and that's what makes it great. The game is all centered on these concepts and they work extremely well in every aspect of the game.Commanding Pikmin is easy enough. Simply press A to throw one or pick one out of the ground, press B to call them to you, C to sort them, and down on the control pad to direct them. The Wii's unique controls come into play with the pointer; you point at the screen to direct your throwing and where your Pikmin will go. All of these functions work almost perfectly; all potential frustrations are very few and far between. The Wii's small additions to the controls are quite good too, and the game fits perfectly with the new control scheme.The gameplay is all about getting the Pikmin to carry parts back to your ship and create even more Pikmin (they carry things back to their 'Onion' which spits out new ones). Getting your Pikmin to do what you want them to is the key to your success, and there are many strategies involved with that. Strategy comes in especially with the three types of Pikmin: the reds (resistant to fire), yellows (can be thrown higher and can also use bombs), and blues (weaker but able to go in water). There are many challenges involved with using the different types of Pikmin, which at least keeps the game from being a walk in the park the first time through.Once you've beaten the game, though, it truly is a walk in the park to beat it again. This is where all the replay value lies: seeing how fast you can beat the game and how many Pikmin you can produce within the 30 in-game days. Aside from the main story there is a challenge mode, in which you see how many Pikmin you can get in one day, but that feels like a waste of time when the real game is so much more fun. Overall Pikmin suffers from a lack of content, even if the bulk of what it has is simply fantastic.Pikmin looked pretty good on the GameCube as a launch title; the difference between it and games from the generation before is pretty drastic. Nowadays the graphics still look passable and sometimes pretty nice (especially the water) but there isn't any improvement from the game that came out so many years ago. With the New Play Control version there are supposedly HD graphics, but HD always makes even the sharpest of Wii games look like a mess.Pikmin still sounds great, though. Everything from the gut-wrenching death sounds the Pikmin make to the sounds they make when they triumph are just great. All the effects fit very well with what they go to and sound great all the time. The music is also awesome, especially the unforgettable theme from the Impact Site.Being a total rehash with updated controls, New Play Control Pikmin has its ups and downs. The bad part is just that: it's simply a rehash of a 7-or 8-year-old game with new controls. The good part comes to the people who don't already own the game, though: they get to experience a fantastic game in a new way, and those are the people who should buy this Wii version. If you own the GameCube game then don't bother with this, just play through that version again. But if you don't own the original game, I highly recommend you give New Play Control Pikmin a shot, because you don't want to miss out on this fun, innovative, and high quality game a second time.Positive:+ solid, fun gameplay+ commanding 100 little Pikmin is pretty awesome+ new Wii controls suit the game nicely+ great replay value+ plenty of challenges along the wayNegative:- no graphical improvements from GameCube game- very little content","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2009"}

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"Fun game for fans of RF or Harvest Moon","reviewText":"This was a fun game that both me and my girl enjoyed.

It&apos;s been decided that only a combination of ancient and modern combat can beat the se creatures. Alicia is a highly-trained soldier who also know ancient magic.

Manage Alicia&apos;s health &amp; magic meters to avoid running out of ammo or power -- be strategic &amp; play it safe, or the world dies with her.","reviewerName":"Gradient Vector Field \"subjectedtometal (dot)...","summary":"An average time killer","reviewText":"I seriously picked this game up on a complete whim.  The games concept, to me, was hilarious, at best, and this game would either be very sad or mediocre, again, at best.  I will admit I was mildly drawn in by the main characters looks and costume; I was actually looking forward to battling my way through hordes of enemies with her, much like I did with Blood Rayne.  On that note, I think users can expect a bit of influence from the Blood Rayne concept that has seen a good amount of success.You play as Alicia, who is a scantily clad witch that also happens to walk around in stiletto heals and carry an oversized gun.  I really don't understand this penchant with oversized weapons like we see in Final Fantasy, for example.  They're just unwieldy and no one could logically use these things.  I realize the developers want it to look like her \"broom\", but that's just kind of goofy.  Ah well, either way she is definitely the best developed character in this game and basically the best scripted during the video sequences.  You end up learning about her history as the game goes on, but when it starts you're in a small suburban town on the outside of New York City and it's being attacked by these undead looking creatures.  Apparently demons are attacking the world and when the army was sent in they were possessed or something, because there are vast amounts of soldier demons.  However, Alicia certainly isn't defenseless for she has magical powers and a gun rod at her disposal.  Basically you fight your way through the stages, meet up with some other human defenders, and learn more about the story behind why the demons are attacking.Yeah, it's a pretty basic game, but it was decently fun while it lasted.  There are some really cool things you can do in this game, but there are some major hang ups as well.  Character control was pretty decent, I really like the fact that Alicia can jump really high in the air.  She manages to execute some really intense jumps; similar to what we saw on Blood Rayne, but it naturally makes me wonder how she lands in those high heels...  Anyway, the user view feels a little weird because you're basically always focusing off to the right and even more so when you use the zoom function.  The zoom function is hugely necessary, but it has some serious problems too.  Such as if you're trying to hide or have some sort of cover and there's something behind you don't expect to be looking at the enemy you're aiming at... yeah the camera doesn't compensate for objects behind you so you see the inside of them.  This is even more frustrating with some of the human defenders that follow you from time to time, they constantly step in front of you while you're trying to aim at something or stand RIGHT in the way blocking the camera.  They seriously need to adjust some parts of the AI for this game, because it's pretty twitchy.  Like the game should know I'm trying to zoom because the view is so limiting so get those extras out of the way!  I was pretty glad when they were eventually killed off half the time.  The same goes for the enemy AI.  A lot of times you're in a situation where you need to completely kill all the enemies in the area before you can progress only to find out there's some random soldier demon too stupid to realize he's walking into a box.The world you're put in is very lush and well developed.  I would put it on par with Half Life 2 even, in terms of quality.  However, it's much less interactive.  I really wanted to be able to go into houses and explore many different areas.  You really don't get to do any of that with Bullet Witch, unfortunately.  The world and levels is actually surprisingly large and there are a lot of places your character can go, this is especially good in a city setting because you get to explore a lot of cool alley ways.  However, Bullet Witch left out some very important things for maps this large.  Basically, there is no map function.  I have basically no idea where I'm going or what my position is and when you're in the forest it's sometimes hard to tell if you've gotten turned around until you find that tank you blew up.  It looks like the developers learned from Halo only half the time, a Nav point does show up from time to time to help you out, but it's quite a rarity.  With levels this long and large where there is a lot of walking, and you have no map, a Nav point is almost essential to your success without wandering around for an hour like I did in some cases.  Don't get me wrong, I like to explore the game; I just don't like it when it's forced on me.Another part that was really cool about this game was that it has a degree of Role Playing feature in the fact that you get points and you can upgrade your weapon and magic abilities.  I thought this was a great feature and I'm really glad they included it so I could choose what I wanted.  These options and the different feel of guns or magic that you could use was probably the best part of the game.  My favorite magic weapons were the \"rose spear\" and \"lightning\".  Lightning was absolutely essential for this game when you came across tanks or large enemies.  Meteor Shower was awesome in concept, but somewhat impractical because it caused so much destruction.  However, the destruction it wreaks is quite awesome.  The one problem with the magic is that you have to go through a menu of sorts to pick out what you want to use.  However, the game isn't paused while you choose your spell, things just keep going.  The most annoying aspect was when you use a big spell like Lightning or Meteor Shower it goes to a cut cinematic every time when you summon the power.  Again the enemies don't pause they keep shooting at you and they keep moving, I realize that's more realistic, but it's not useful in a game.  This is immensely frustrating with Lightning because after the cut sequence you then have to aim where you want to fire the lightning and the enemy you want to shoot may have moved by then and is now out of range!Overall this game had its good moments and its bad moments.  The story wasn't anything spectacular and the script during the cinematic sequences was pretty terrible at times.  Like the guy playing the male love interest (which I don't know why that's even in this game) he has the worst lines.  To the point where he just sounds stupid and annoying!  Regardless the graphics during the videos was great and rather akin to Final Fantasy's \"The Spirits Within\" movie.  As a gamer I wouldn't expect a huge amount out of this game.  It can be frustrating and challenging at times (especially that lengthy final boss battle), but I think the degree of fun I got out of it outweighed those poorer moments.  The length is pretty decent and took maybe ten plus hours on easy, granted a lot of that is because I got lost in some areas for a while.  Either way, I'd recommend this if you're really itching to play a game of this style.  The closing scene kind of left it open for a possible sequel, I can only hope they improve upon some of the parts that made this game annoying, because it certainly has the potential to be quite good.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0001AVZ5I","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"\"Can you count suckas?\"","reviewText":"What do you get when you take Walter Hill's 1979 cult classic the Warriors and combine it with the folks behind the controversial Grand Theft Auto series?  You get this PS2 beat 'em up masterwork from Rockstar, that's what.  The Warriors is a brutal, intense, and above all fun and addicting, video game that must be played to be believed.  You don't need to be familiar with the film to get into the game, as it is easily accessible for anyone looking for some great beat 'em up action.  The game begins months before the murder of gang leader Cyrus, and you must fight, maim, abd rob to achieve the street cred needed to be a true Warrior.  And, as mentioned before, this game is a pure beat 'em up, but unlike other games of the genre, it rarely gets repetitive or boring.  Throughout the game, you'll also get to collect protection money, looting shops, and being involved in chases with rival gangs.  The enemy AI is actually challenging, but there are some spots where the Warriors does come up a bit short.  There are situations in the game where stealth will need to be relied on, and it isn't utilized here well at all, but it's not too big of an issue.  The graphics aren't anything special either, and there are plenty of noticeable graphical glitches throughout the game, but they don't detract from the gameplay.  The controls are relatively easy to get ahold of, and the sound and score are excellent throughout.  The dialogue (which features many of the film's returning cast members) and story aren't for the faint hearted (and that is to be expected with a game of this type), but it perfectly fits the tone of the film and gives the game an intense \"kill or be killed\" atmosphere.  All in all, fans of the film will no doubt love this game, but for those who never saw the Warriors but enjoy games like the GTA series or Max Payne, it is still suggested to pick this game up, because it is highly unlikely you'll play a better beat 'em up on the market today or in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2005"}

In fact, I would probably trash someone else for doing it.  The camera's cable is as long as it is and there is no promise that it will ever be extendable.I have to break my own rule here since I think this needs to be said.  Most people (myself included) who may need an extension for their camera didn't even give it a 2nd thought since the PS3 camera is so easily extendable with a standard USB 2.0 extension cable (available everywhere in every length and color imaginable).  Then we come to find out that they changed the connector end and have no official or unofficial statement about how they plan to handle the considerable amount of customers who need an extension for this device.  Many have returned the camera for this reason or have it sitting unused until someone steps up and solves this problem.  Others (like myself) are a little luckier because I can plug my camera into my PS4 BUT I have to plug it in every time I want to use it because all my equipment is inside a cabinet and also have to unplug it when I am done so the door will close.  With an extension, the cable will run behind my TV into the wiring channel that leads to inside the cabinet and I can leave it plugged in all the time.  Anyone who wants to trash me for this, I consider it fair game.  I won't defend myself.Please note that I waited until a month and a half after the release date to post this.  I wanted to give them some time to address to the issue.  I can excuse the fact that they (Sony) may not have been aware of how many people extended the PS3 camera since they didn't even sell extensions and tracking the sales of any USB extension cables would be silly since they can be used for tons of other reasons.  But they have certainly heard more than enough about this need by now.How about just a little hope (&#34;We are planning on releasing an extension cable for the PS4 camera in the near future&#34;).","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

I was relieved to hear that the game was a moderate success, but much to my dismay the next Tales game will be a PS2 title, but there is a GBA and a DS Tales on the way as well, which will be nice.The story revolves around a young human named Lloyd Irving who was raised by a dwarf in a village where his best friend and his teacher are both elves (Though we later discover they are half elves). The town he is growing up in is in the world of Sylverant, a world in decline, and highly oppressed by a race of half elves called Desians. Every so often the Chosen of Mana arises to regenerate the world and restore it's Mana supply. The previous chosen was killed, and now, Lloyd's close friend Colette has been called to serve as the Chosen. Lloyd and his (half)elf friend Genis join her in her quest part to protect her, and part because a spat with the local Desians cause the village mayor to banish the two.At first the story may seem a little clich&eacute;d, and at points when the Church of Martel (which eerily resembles Catholicism) is revealed to be the bad guy then one can raise concerns that there may have a bit of an anti-religious tone, but there is, thankfully, a plot twist at the end which nullifies anything which may come of as such, and the game never addresses religion itself as being bad or harmful as some individuals out there have been of late. In general the game remains passive in it's political and religious themes.The tale gets better the more you get into it, the more you learn of alternate worlds, cool summons, intricate characters with a detailed back story that is learned in the main story line without the need for excessive side quests, and a story that bests the best efforts of rival Square-Enix for the moment.The game play is where Tales really shines, as the game incorporates a linar motion active battle system which lets you combat the monsters in real time, a revolutionary step (I haven't played a Tales game before) eliminating the frustration that turn based RPGs have begun to give me lately. The game also eliminates the nightmarish and sluggish random battles. Nearly every non-boss battle in the game is avoidable as the fights are represented by moving icons on the screen which can be maneuvered around. This makes progressing through the game much less headache educing than other RPGs which can't seem to let go of the archaic random battle, or worse turn based combat. The combat engine here is what I've been waiting for, for what seems like a lifetime.The graphics do disappoint a bit. The characters are sadly inconsistent with their anime cut scenes and there is a bit of a blur effect that is supposed to create the illusion of depth, but just makes the characters look smudged. It would have been nice if the characters were drawn to be more like their anime counterparts, less \"super deformed\" but considering that there's only like 4 anime cut scenes in the entire game, and 2 depicting mass destruction and not featuring the characters it's no where near as annoying as the inconsistencies in the artwork of FFVI.Music is kind of bland from what I'm used to, and the sound effects are sorely lacking, worse yet as inconsistent as the art may have been the flow of the game is interrupted by a minimalist approach to the amount of voice over work featured in the game. Only the most critical of cut scenes feature voice-overs, sad when you consider that many competing RPGs are fully voiced. Namco really needed to take the FF X approach where all the leads were fully voiced, and only irrelevant towns folk would be text only. That would have been better. The good news is that the voice overs that do appear are pretty good, and don't disappoint. I just wanted more.Over all Tales of Symphonia is hands down one of the best RPGs I've played of the current generation, if not one of the best games (sans disappointing graphics and sound). It's truly an epic game that takes about 50 hours to complete and should be a welcome addition to every GameCube owner's library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2006"}

(Isn't this the only game with two discs. :P) Plus it was one of the few RPG games on the GameCube and you we all know that the GameCube era was one of the best eras in gaming. I think this game is still on the top 20 Game Cube games of all time.But enough with me fangirling, the plot of the game SEEMS generic at first. The Chosen One named Colette is out to save the world by completing her pilgrimage (sounds similar to FFX) with her childhood friends Lloyd and Genis, her teacher Raine and a mysterious mercenary Kratos by her side. That's like only 1/4 of the game right there before the plot twist. From there, it's plot twist after plot twist (and many of them are foreshadowed if you were to play the game again so nothing comes out of nowhere.The gameplay is probably weaker than recent Tales games but this and Legendia are the last games where the battlefield is 2D making it impossible to run around many attacks (like in Dawn of the New World). You have 4 party members (and the main character doesn't have to be in your party for once) and you can play any character with Lloyd as the default player (though people play others given their different fighting styles and combos). You can command the magic users to stay in the back (alas not all of them are smart enough to do that when they run out of SP.)It's hard to talk about the game without mentioning a plot twist and a spoiler. Then again, the fact there are two worlds (says that on the back of the game cover) and two discs, you know there's going to be A LOT of things to do in this game.I think the best thing is the relationship value. This is the only Tales game where Lloyd can decide who who is the most important person to him and this is determined through the many dialogue choices and side quests in the game. The relationship values actually determine many of the plot twists in the game mainly near the end where it plays a huge role. There a fortune teller in the game that tells you who is in the lead and how everyone sees you. Getting the Colette and Genis ending are relatively easy because Colette starts with the highest relationship and if you play the game without knowing that, she ends up with Lloyd at the end. Same goes for Genis given he's the best friend. Everyone else you have to work a little harder. Sheena and Raine as the love interest aren't hard because Sheena has the third highest affection. Raine on the other hand is easy if you choose all the cynical options given to you in the game. The last three characters, Presea, Regal and Zelos ESPECIALLY ZELOS are the hardest people to get to the top of the relationship latter (Presea being the love interest is dismissed given her appearance). Also Kratos isn't hard...but will it be worth it when you choose him...to increase their value, you can also go to all the z skits on the overworld map and choose the correct option (learning more about their character as you do).Just pick up the game when the game isn't this overpriced. Seriously, yes this game is rare but the game should not be this high of a price. Then again, almost all the Tales games are like this given how popular they are. It's quality RPG games, so it's worth the buy though given you DO get 40-80 hours for this game plus replay value of wanting to get all the items and getting all the endings (there are 8 endings and its just a minor difference but still the most ending of all Tales games).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"SRS47","summary":"One Soulless game","reviewText":"Hi,I have played all COD titles from the first one on PC till this one. Also, I have been a fan of Battlefield since the first one as well. The point of saying this is that I'm not a noob nor I'm afraid of huge maps and trying new things. This game couldn't hold my interest at all. The first few matches everything looked cool and big maps were not an issue for me, but after spending 12 hours on it, I realized how bored I get during every match. Here are some negative points that I can think of:( MP & SP )1- Color: Everything looks gray & light brown. You can hardly see enemies.2- Maps: They are huge and have tons of covering spots & camping areas in every corner. ( I think 100 more reviews said the same thing). Here is the deal, we ( or at least I ) always hated small maps like Nuketwon, and I was looking for bigger maps. But these maps are designed for campers and snipers. Battlefield has big maps, but it's easy to manage and have fun in them. 6 Vs 6 is not enough for these maps. You find yourself running 40% of the time just to find someone. Unfortunately, that means camping for lots of players. When a match starts, some people just sit in a corner and aim down the sight till you pass by. Obviously, when you respawn you can go back and kill the guy, but this is not how I want to play the game !3- RE-SPAWN POINTS: HUGE ISSUE ! How on earth I respawn in front of my enemy at least 4-5 times every match?? Maps are big and there are lots of free areas that I can re-spawn. I swear to my mother's grave that it happens every single match. I start the match, get killed from behind by a camper, re-spawn and take two steps & get shot by an enemy.4- Knifing: is an issue again ! We had issues with knifing in MW2, now it's back again. It was pretty good in BOII, but this one is really bad and annoying. I usually drop shot, but people can knife me even when I'm on the ground while they are looking up !!5-Everything is pointless ! Not kidding. Kill-strikes are BS. Support is useless. For example, ground jammer ! It jams enemy's radar for 15 seconds and destroys the useless Sat-Com. I managed to get a heli in one game, and after that I totally gave up on it ( you may get 2-3 kills with it if you are lucky ). Most maps have covered areas, so it's useless. I really like how BOII managed Score-Strikes.6- Gun selection is weak: I expected to see more weapons and more attachments and even more colors ! Where is AK-47? Desert Eagle? UZI?7- LAAAAGGGGG. I don't need to explain this one ! I have 25 down 5 up speed. But still have problem with this game.8-Extinction mode: fun till you reach lvl 14-15. It gets incredibly repetitive and boring. I rather zombies in BO.9-Squad mode: Fun for people who want to train, and have some fun with their friends. There is a score limit in every match. So, don't expect to score easily by killing bots !10-I finished Single player, but I felt like I just wasted my time. It has nothing new except the controllable dog. We had RC-XD back in BO1, now dog ! COOL. You fight in space, under water, and tanks, heli,... as usual. What I liked about BOII was that I could select my gears before every mission, and that made me play some missions over & over again. But Ghosts dosn't have anything like that. Just follow  the guy, take cover, shoot 10 enemies and go to the next level.I really wanted to like this game because COD is my fav game. As I said before I play BF as well, but enjoy COD a little more just because of the adrenaline rush that I used to get when I was only one kill away from getting my Orbital V-Sat or dogs, but Ghosts perfectly managed to kill it all. No more encouragement, no more rewarding good players, no more fun ! Only camp in corners and get 5  kills and get shot in the back by the person who re-spawnded 2 steps behind you.I would avoid the Xbox 360 and PS3 version. Probably ps4 and Xbox one can solve some of these issues.If you have the ps4 version and noticed some improvements, please let me know. Thanks","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"game play addict","summary":"The best shooter game and very addictive","reviewText":"I usually don't write reviews, but this game deserve a three thumbs up for its exciting, addictive and easy to learn game play and controls.

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"I approve this remote control","reviewText":"I did not think I needed yet another remote control because I thought the six-axis had everything it needed for movie playing on the PS3 and, yet, I bought one. There were 2 initial reasons:- my wife was missing a 'magic wand' shaped remote for playing movies- Amazon had it at a great price in one of them lightning dealsI ended up using it myself and, in fact, using it for more than just movie playing - see below.But, let's do a quick inventory of features:= It's blue-tooth enabled and, therefore, it's not taking any ports on your PS3. This is probably important for anyone who has a \"2-USB ports console\".= It's wand-shaped, allowing the non-gamers to control their movie-watching activities while holding a familiar-shaped device in their hand.= It maps ALL the six-axis buttons and performs everything a six-axis would do, except for the joystick features of R3 and L3 (but you do have the push-down or 'click' abilities for them).= 2 AA battery powered (still with the original Sony batteries after 4 months of use)= Includes additional buttons that the movie-only users would expect on a remote such as:+ a number pad+ eject+ red, green, blue, yellow buttons+ play, stop, pause+ slow(step), scan(left/right), prev/next+ display, top menu, pop up menu, return+ subtitles, angle, audioWhat is interesting about this remote is that you can use it for much more than movie-playing. Given that it has all the six-axis buttons, guess what? You can use it, and I do use it to:- surf the web- play music- shop at the PSN store- play certain games such as Sudoku- turn the PS3 on/off when your six-axis controllers are in the charger and I am playing GT5 that is using a racing wheelAnd, yes, you CAN turn the PS3 on and off with this remote. Turning it on is easy - you simply press the PlayStation button and the PS3 turns itself on. To turn it off, you either go as far to the left on the X-bar and all the way up and press Enter (the turn-off PlayStation icon will be highlighted) or you simply hold the PlayStation button pressed for a few seconds and then select 'yes' and press the X button a couple of times.Overall: I am happy with this peripheral. Yes, it's one more remote control but it's a pretty good one, for the reasons I stated above._______________________________Notes - Aug 29, 2009, after 16 months of useI find that I'm using the remote more and more, not only for playing movies but for navigating the XMB and at the PSN Store, also when playing music or slideshows. Due to its very convenient arrows wheel with an 'enter' button in the middle, navigating the PS3 and doing just about anything other than playing games is a lot easier than using the PS3 game controller. Unlike the controller which normally requires two hands to hold, this is basically a one-hand operation where you hold the remote in one hand and operate the wheel with your thumb. And because it's Bluetooth, not IR (Infrared), you don't even need to point it at the PS3.And, one word on battery life. After about 15-16 months of operation, this is probably the third set of batteries so I'd estimate battery life to be about 4-6 months. Not too bad.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}

It captures the desolate destruction of post nuclear disaster better than any game I have played.  The music is perfect, the gritty darkness is mesmerizing.  However, be forewarned.  I think some people may assume this game to be the next reincarnation of the doom franchise, however this IS NOT a traditional FPS.  Above and beyond that there are the RPG elements.  You create a character, specialize him in areas you like - i.e. stealth, explosives, speech, etc.  However the combat is much different than your traditional shooter.  The FPS - utilizing the VATS system - tries to implement the turned based, action point system that anyone who has played the previous fallout titles would be accustomed to.  If you are looking for a doom clone than I would not suggest this title.If, however, you liked Oblivion or have played the previous fallouts than I would very strongly recommend this title.  I for one think the VATS system is a great improvement over the combat in oblivion.  I like the option to pause, target, and engage at a timed pace.An example would be you are trying to sneak past two super mutants on an overpass.  One has a rifle the other has a rocket launcher.  They spot you and begin to fire.  You pop your V key to engage VATS.  Immediately the combat freezes and you get to target your opponents.  My character is a sniper, so I use my sniper rifle and attempt to hit the rocket launcher mutant in the head.  I have enough action points - based off how much agility your character has - to fire 2 shots in VATS.  I hit engage and the slow motion portion of VATS begins.  I had a 55% chance to hit - it varies off of your weapons skill (you can use it for grenades, big guns such as your own rocket launcher, small guns such as my sniper rifle, or melee weapons) and your perception skill.  My first shot zings past the mutants head but my second one smacks him square in the noggin, stunning him as he steps back and clutches his bleeding face.  I am now out of action points so go into regular paced combat.  I frantically aim again in real time and squeeze off a shot but miss widely.  All this time my action points slowly repopulate the bar.  The rocket launcher mutant gets a rocket off that explodes nearby all the while rounds from the other mutant zing all around me.  Finally enough action points repopulate for 1 shot so I pop vats again and aim again for the mutants head.  I cross my fingers and hit engage and get a birds eye view as the round flies from my rifle and hits the mutant in the eye, causing a critical explosion of gore as his brains and eyes splatter on the wall behind him....One engagement out of many, many you will have.  You can stealth around putting grenades in unsuspecting enemies pockets or can use your minigun to blast the snot out of all the raiders as they attempt to storm you through a door.  You can do all of which in either real time, or engage VATS whenever you want - and use it as long as you have the action points.You can also be a paragon of virtue and save, help, and assist all that you meet.  Or....you can be a dirt bag and blow holes in all the little kids you run into.  Either way, your kara goes up or down and people treat you accordingly.How about quests?  There are tons and tons of them.  Which to do?  Where to go?  You can fast travel to a location only if you have been there before, much the same as oblivion.  Much of what I have been doing in the last few hours is wandering the maze of blasted streets between collapsed buildings and the pitch darkness of the subway tunnels of the greater DC area.  And yes, the Mall is there, the monuments, everything is crazy with the amount of detail they put into this thing.  Do you try to fight your way through the raider encampment ahead to get to that quest marker on your map?  Or go down into the pitch darkness of the subway system and try to find away around them....  Super mutants, ghouls, raiders, rad scorpions, all the enemies of the previous games are here.  They talk, they cower in fright and run away after you blasted a hole in them, and they shout obscenities as they charge you with a sledge hammer.  And it all looks AMAZING.  I have a pretty nice system and have all the settings maxed, and it is MUCH prettier than oblivion ever was.  In addition, the load times are surprisingly fast.All in all, I am very, very pleased with this game.  I think I will play this for a long time and am already looking forward to any expansions they come out with.Very highly recommended for RPG/fallout/oblivion fans.  Moderately recommended for FPS fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2008"}

The shooting calibration using the Wii remote is nearly perfect, while Extreme Mode is also included as a bonus of sorts.  Sadly, that's the only real bonus that Sega included in this package, which really would have benefited from other extras or at least enhancements to the games themselves.

Right off the bat this game is big in variety but no so much in depth. When you enter Fable don't start expecting the depth in games like Final Fantasy or even WoW because it's not there. The game is actually absurdly shallow and linear. What makes the game so great is the presentation, story, art design, and variety of game play mechanics never seen in an RPG before. You are a boy only known as the Hero who's family is killed in a Bandit raid and a powerful wizard, Maze, comes and saves you. You start the game as a young boy before all this to get a hang of the main game mechanics. After the fire you do the tutorial which is cleverly disguised as part of the story.Once you finish you're training you can go out on side quests and main quests in typical RPG fashion. Leveling up is a bit different since you have Strenth, Skill (bows and stealth), and Will (magic), but you can only level up in the Mage's Guild. The game has a teleport system for easy transfer but it's not hard to get lost do to the game's absurd linearity. Unlike most RPGs there really no exploration here since you're stuck on a one way path everywhere you go. You can go through Demon Doors to find super special items under the Door's parameters and what not but there is only maybe 30 different types of armor and weapons and you can get the strongest half way through the game. There are little quirky ideas like mini games to earn gold such as Black jack, memory etc. You can show off your trophies from main quest missions to earn reknown and make yourself the top of gossip. All of this is grand and all but there is still little depth to the game.The combat is satisfying yet oversimplified. While you can parry, attack, and use magic all in real time it just always feels too simple. You don't learn new combos but only new magic powers which always seem to feel weak. With ALL of this aside the best aspect is the morality engine in here. You can veer down a dark path then in key moments through the story suddenly alter that. It really does make a difference such as people will scream in your presence, cower under your feet, and praise you for your good deeds. You can even use expressions to attract ladies and get them to marry you for more gold income.While all of this is great it's enough to be declared the best Xbox RPG ever made. I can't wait for Fable 2 and if you have an Xbox system you must own this. While The Lost Chapters doesn't have enough for people who beat the original new comers are warmly welcomed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

A. BADER \"Q8  AL BADER\"","summary":"BLACK FLOPS","reviewText":"First off: The zombie mode is a joke, the voice acting is absolutely lame even if it's meant to be a parody. I put about 20 bullets into a zombie (deliberately no headshots) and it didn't die. I then walked up to it, and slashed its leg with the knife and it died! I ran past hordes of zombies, went to the point of red screen imminent death...survived every time. Then I ran past a single zombie, who must have just scratched me (as I was already a metre past it)... and I died. I threw a grenade and it exploded 3 metres to the right of where it landed it! (and it didn't bounce off a wall) Frustrating, and very inconsistent.The campaign mode is mind numbingly boring.Control: You have very little control over the actions, it's simply Treyarch holding your hand in guiding certain actions through crappy cutscene after crappy cutscene. Absolutely frustrating, when you move two steps and lo and behold you have lost the ability to aim, crouch, run, shoot...etc and the weapons you are given are fixed for certain events. I agree with the poster who wrote even if you shoot a foot away from the head in a particular scene - it will end up between his eyes! Total Joke.Graphics: The graphics are awful, jarring, blurry and glitchy. So much of the 'action' happens so quickly you don't have time to appreciate any of the scenery, it's very manic. Perhaps they designed the gameplay this way so you are distracted away from the poor graphics, and landscape. Explosions are unrealistic. The worst aspect is when you are in 'interrogation' and Treyarch decided to SCREW PEOPLES MINDS with an explosion of light flashes, random images of war, more flashes, jarred sounds, more flashes, pictures for a few split second, more flashes... AHHHH SHOOT ME ALREADY, THIS IS KILLING ME! It's not a safe game for people to play that have sensitivity to light, are epileptics, or generally anyone that is prone to migraines, severe headaches or motion sickness. It's totally exaggerated. I understand the idea that you are traversing someones memories - which is fine, but we don't need to be mind-raped in this way.Sound: The grenades pop, and it feels like you are shooting with a pellet gun. The music has been compiled in a terrible manner. There is music where there shouldn't be and none where there should be. Good (appropriate) music makes games feel epic, and what did Treyarch do? They had a Rolling Stones song (Sympathy of the Devil) 'Pleased to meet you...hope you guess my name' playing in one of the scenes. Are you kidding me?! Out of place or what, and crucifies its sense of epic.Characters: Honestly, you won't care about any of them. They are so annoying, and the dialogue written for them is woeful. They all seem to sound alike as well, the husky I-sound-like-batman put-on marine voice. I had to put subtitles on, so I knew who was actually speaking! The russian 'Reznov' is irritating and it gets so boring hearing what a fantastic patriot he is, and how we should fight for freedom bla bla. This has all been done before in MW2 right?! What really irritated me was how everyone you are working with seem to treat you like a low life scum. I am cool with swearing, but the use of expletive F word was excessive and at times unnecessary. // Minor spoiler alert: You are asked about the numbers, 'what numbers?' you reply, then several scenes later 'ahhh these f'ing numbers are killing me! can't get them out my head' End of minor spoiler alert/// No, awful dialogue and woeful storyline is killing you!Glitches?: I shot and killed a few people and they remained frozen in that same firing pose. I thought they had godmode enabled until I looked closer and realised they were already dead. Sergei, the 'big guy' will endlessly try and break down a door if you stay to watch - it's funny. The ally AI, should have been more interactive. Maybe they should have spoke to you if you went up to them, wondering why they were repeatedly trying to barge a steel door! not a glitch as such, but yes you can run through the entire game without killing enemies to reach the checkpoints and unlock the next objective. Pointless having enemies in front of you if you don't actually have to kill them.Black Ops? Stealth? What steal...? the two or three times you are invited to walk up behind someone and activate a cutscene of strangulation, or stab in the neck?! The game is mis sold. I feel the Call of Duty franchise is better off without this addition. It adds nothing but frustration. You have all the ingredients, and resources to create something that will raise standards in gaming but fluff it big time. I can not believe how rushed this game feels. It should read: Black Ops: Beta Version 0.917171923.Online Mode: My experience was totally ruined by lag issues and awful awful choice of maps. The guns are just pellet guns! I dislike the exclusion of XP points to unlock weapons from previous games.If you want my opinion, Modern Warfare 1 is the most polished and realistic game of the series. The single player campaign mode is also the best, but very short. Still, it's infinitely better than this pile of garbage. For online play, go with Modern Warfare 2, for the fun, fast and responsive play and better online servers.In short: Don't buy it, take it off a friend, then get rid of it. Buy MW2, or Battlefield 2, or just wait for Gran Turismo 5 to just sit back and enjoy the stunning ability of the ps3 graphics core.Sorry the frustration of playing this game bled into my review. I need some paracetamol.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

I was a little worried that the cover mechanism would feel gimicky and unatural, but it turns out to be a crucial and fantastic element of the gameplay. I don't have much experience with using cover in games and when a game does include it I only use it sparily, preferring to run and gun. But in this game where using cover is crucial to surviving, it feel instinctual. Using cover becomes a instant reaction that feels natural.The graphics in this game are hands down the best ever. Period. End of discussion.Obviously many people will compare it to Halo and it is a fair comparison, but do not expect an identical game experience. I loved Halo and I think the two things that elevate this game above Halo are the cover mechanism and the graphics. With the cover mechanism the gameplay is significantly different than Halo. The pace of the game is changed and is more brutal but less frantic. It is not a matter of just outshooting and outgunning the opponent in this game. One must learn to keep his head down and use the environment to his advantage.Overall this game show what the next-gen hardware can do. It will raise the stakes for games in the future and hopefully is an example of what is to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2006"}

Durs \"ddurs\"","summary":"Great shooter","reviewText":"I have wanted to play this game from the minute I saw the first tv commercial for it years ago -- it took me a while to get off the PC and get an xBox360. I have played just about every FPS out there and had recently played Halo3. I really enjoyed playing GofW. The way its designed to duck, dive, and cover is quite unique -- rarely do you get the opportunity like many shooters and just run into a room and start shooting up the place. The AI was well done as well. The enemies are smart and unlike most games, your teammates work with and for you and actually do quite a bit of damage on their own. The graphics and game play were excellent. Having said that, I was a tiny bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it was because I had waited several years to play it or had also played Halo3 and CoD Black Ops recently. It was a bit redundant -- another grey, blown up hallway or street to walk down. It was a little like Doom3 -- fantastic game, but please not another hallway! And it would have been nice to drive around a bit more (again, perhaps I am spoiled by Halo). But these are minor complaints. The game looked great and the game play was very entertaining. I highly recommend it and look forward to playing the sequels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Judah","summary":"Funny Story, Unforgiving Game Play","reviewText":"Not even the Disgaea branding could cover up that is the a side-scroller with an extremely linear progression and high rate of repetition.

Even normal mode was too difficult, and my thumb started to hurt from pressing buttons during a huge robot boss fight where I lost 200 lives before finally winning.  Unsure if I will complete, despite liking the atmosphere and tone.  The level designs are fiendish, especially the boss fights where you need to figure out how to do damage before you can even figure out a strategy.Edit:  I got to the final boss with less than 100 lives, and I jammed my thumb button-mashing the attack button.

Anyone who complains that the \"graphics should have been better\" should be tortured.]With the Super NES becoming every kid's favorite Nintendo system in the early 90s, it was only a matter of time until Nintendo decided to \"remaster\" their beloved Mario series and place them onto one cartridge. This not only helped propel the Super NES's popularity, but it served to remind the next generation of gamers of where Mario first came from! Read on:THE GOODThis cartridge contains four Mario games: The original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 (my personal favorite), and Lost Levels. Lost Levels is actually the \"true\" Mario 2, but they never brought to the U.S. in a cartridge; instead, the Mario 2 that we came to know was originally an arabian-knights-adventure-type game (I'll get back to you on the original game title) that was refitted to fit Mario's universe. With that said, I'm glad it's here. The graphics and music have been greatly enhanced, but the nostalgia factor of the games are still there (the most important aspect of the game, in my opinion). This also allows you to save your games and warp to a different world as well. I don't see this as a huge improvement, but it's a nice addition.THE BADThe ONLY bad thing I can say about this game (and thus, keeping the full 5 stars this game richly deserves) is that some of the sounds have been dumbed down a bit (an example: instead of the BA BOOM BOOM sounds the cannons make in Mario 3, they make a more \"popish\" sound). Other than that, a perfect game.OVERALLWhat can I say? These games are classic and vintage Mario. All four games are terrific. They also manage to keep the difficulty levels, so these games are certainly a challenge. I'm not Nintendo biased, but I love this game. These are the games we old school gamers grew up on. I hope these games live on through infinity.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0002I0UIC","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"A Multi-Player Favorite of Mine","reviewText":"WWE Day of ReckoningThe Gamecube used to have the Wrestlemania franchise on it, but the franchise was moved to theX-Box. This was the first game in a new series for the Gamecube. The game quickly caught on and became a huge success with wrestling fans. I was one of the people who loved this game. Often times I would have four friends come over just to enjoy the multiplayer madness. The only things I can say was wrong with this game is that the Story Mode is the same every time you play through it. It really hurts the replayabilty of this title.Graphics- 7/10The graphics in this game are top notch. The moves in the game are all very well animated. The arenas and crowd are fairly well done. Most of what you see is really good. The problem is that there isn't much of anything to look at. The game lacks in arenas and backstage areas in general. Still, what you see is nice.Another problem is that the wrestlers don't exactly look perfect. Most of them are too glossy and have abnormal muscles. Even Andre the Giant has abs. Most wrestlers seem to be a bit overly muscular. The characters aren't all that bad, but there are things to nit pick at.Story- 7/10This game has a story mode much like all previous WWE games. The story mode can only be played as a created wrestler though. So for all you people hoping to live out your WWE career as Triple H, too bad. The storyline however is a good one. You build a created character and you start at a WWE Developmental Territory. Jonathan Coachman will teach you're the ropes. You will mostly fight other developmental talent like yourself. Once you have proved yourself, you will move onto Sunday Night Heat. Once you have finished Heat, you will move into the big leagues of either Raw or Smackdown. You surprising will take major interest from factions on the brands at the time and quickly become a top talent.I actually truly enjoyed this storyline. There is one huge problem though; it's the same story every time you play. Sure, there are a few minor tweaks that will slightly adjust how you play, but it is still mostly the same game. It doesn't even matter which brand you pick. The storylines are the same, just with different wrestlers. Playing through the game once or maybe even twice will have satisfied any craving for this story mode.Sound- 8/10The game's soundtrack is made up of licensed music. You will hear it in matches and in menu screens. I will say that the music is a good selection though and matches what is going on during gameplay. There are actually only about 7-8 songs, but the never really lose their touch.There is no voiceover or commentary in the entire game. You will be forced to read texts. However, considering how well the voiceover worked in future titles, I will say that this is a good thing. The only thing you will hear during your matches in music and your opponent slamming you into the mat.Gameplay- 9.5/10This is where the game makes a serious impression. The gameplay mechanics are near perfect. You can break up pin falls, submissions, and any other move. This is very realistic. If you do a move of the top rope and hit other people in the progress, they will be hurt as well. There are a vast amount of moves available in the game, including some that were not in previous titles. There are also tons of match types to choose from. There are cage matches, hell in a cell matches, ladder matches, and tons of other goodies including the new Bra and Panties match. The only match that is missing is the ominous Elimination Chamber match. That is due to the fact that there can only be four people in the ring at once.Multiplayer is probably the most fun you'll ever have in a game. The game is set up so that anyone can win at a moments notice. I suggest buying afew controllersand having many fatal four way matches. Considering the fact the reversing is so easy and that moves can be broken up, every one has a chance at winning.Create a Wrestler is decent in this game. You cannot make the most detailed character in the world, but it is fairly easy to use. You can even choose your reversal style, which is new to wrestling games. There is also a new Create an Entrance feature that allows you to create detailed entrances. This allows you to create nearly the perfect created wrestler.The roster in Day of Reckoning is very small. You will get all your top stars like Triple H, The Rock, and Undertaker; you will also get a few Legends like Andre the Giant. However this game lacks bringing us a great undercard of talent. You get the around 7-8 lower card talents and that is all. Not to mention the fact that they left out Mick Foley, who had more influence on television than The Rock.There are also unlockables in this title. You can buy weapons to appear under the ring, character creation parts, and many other things. This is one of the few reasons to actually play through the story mode more than once.Difficulty- 8/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)The game has a great difficulty level. Most anyone can pick it up and have a fair chance of winning. My girlfriend picked it up and played it just fine, and she is not even much of a gamer. One problem exists in the fact that Multi-Man Cage matches and Ladder Matches are insanely hard in this game. You will often find yourself losing the match over and over again.Another problem is in story mode. If you lose a match, you will have to replay the match. You will repeat this process until you win. This is annoying especially when trying to win a multi-man Cage or Ladder match.Overall- 8.5/10This was not the perfect game, but it was one of my favorite wrestling video games. I think onlyWWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Painsurpasses it in my mind. Then again, I haven't played every wrestling video game out there. This is definitely worth picking up if you love wrestling and enjoy video games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2008"}

I liked this game fine; it was a bit scary and fairly entertaining. This has the good graphics, but that's not all there is to a game. The new monsters aren't very scary looking at all, but they do have strengths and weaknesses to keep a variety in fighting them. For example, the Mandarin is big and slow, but does a fair amount of damage and takes more hits to kill. The double-headed dog thing is fast and tough to hit unless you shoot it, but it does less damage. Each monster gives some of a challenge, and you may dread hearing the radio squeal because of it. The bosses were not very challenging for being the big battles of the game. They didn't have any weaknesses or anything like that; you just dodge and shoot. A couple of examples are a giant worm and a guy with big knives for arms. Not very creative or spooky. A few of the monsters are somewhat scary, however, such as the nurse. I guess because it was once human, or because it is fairly powerful and may wield a gun. I was worried every time the radio went off and hid in a corner with my gun until the creature came to me, but I am something of a chicken... The music in this game is enjoyable; I especially like the song at the beginning. I actually listen to it outside of the game. There is a CD with music on it that comes with the game, most of it is music without much lyrics or just gibberish, but it's more than you normally get. The music adds a good effect during cut scenes and when you're in a scary room. Some of it sounds like monsters or screaming. There are nice little touches in the game, such as the connection to the first and second games. The plot is based partly on the first game and there are posters and such that refer to SH2. Also, you get special weapons for playing through the game once or twice, for example, the beam sabre (for fans of melee weapons) and the flamethrower (for playing through the game 3 times, I believe). I am currently playing the second time for things I missed, such as the katana (a fairly powerful Japanese sword) and I want to get the flamethrower near the beginning in my third play through. The extra weapons are fun, but they deduct from your total points at the end if you use them. There are also ways to make the game easier, especially for playing multiple times. If you die 3 times (?) then you can have a beginner mode, which is quite easy. You can also increase ammo yield from each box (x2, x3, etc.), after playing through. The documents you read during the game are usually interesting, with hints or dark tales. The characters are not very interesting, with Heather yelling at random people instead of getting help from them, and Claudia repeating things and making no sense. But the plot does get revealed, and it is fun along the way. This series is great; it has hidden meanings and disturbing stories. This game lives up to that, although it isn't the best of them. The controls are pretty much the same as SH2, and can be a little difficult. Heather is not very agile, and she can't really dodge. Fighting is pretty straight forward, you just face the enemy and attack. You can change between 2D and 3D controls to make it more like what you're used to. If in doubt, rent this game. But I was happy with owning it. And get the other three games if you can.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2004"}

This review is in regards to the multiplayer as I have not completed the single player yet. I'm sure most people are primarily getting the game for multiplayer like with COD.I'm sure there will be an influx of reviews giving the game 1 star and complaining about the graphics or comparing it to MW2. Here's a few things to remember:1) The environments are gigantic2) There's vehicles being used all throughout the map3) Destructible environmentsWhat does all that mean? It means that the game just isn't going to look quite as good or have a comparable framerate as MW2. The Xbox has finite resources and when they make a game of this scale without any loading taking place during gameplay, you have to sacrifice something.However, I wouldn't necessarily say that a sacrifice in graphics or framerate is a bad thing. When you experience the magnitude of the giant playing fields and the destruction taking place, you should be able to quickly forget all about the smooth polygons in MW2.Probably the biggest pro for me in this game is that it encourages teamwork. In MW2, most people are just worrying about their K/D ratio and trying to complete challenges by getting the most kills. In BC2, more points are rewarded for assisting the team an completing objectives. If this is something that intrests you and you're sick of all the \"lone wolves,\" then you should definitely check this game out.BREAKDOWN:GRAPHICS: 9/10AUDIO: 10/10 (It's really quite impressive)GAMEPLAY: 10/10REPLAY: 10/10TO sum it up, the graphics, gameplay and audio are really quite impressive for a game of this scale. The most important thing about this game, it's fun. I love MW2, but sometimes I just don't have fun playing it. Everyone gets so angry and frustrated and worried about their k/d ratio or getting their killstreak. In BC2, I feel like I'm just having a fun time and I'm getting a lof of points regardless of my kills. The only thing I'm worried about is trying to win the game rather than reaping carnage without purpose.Also, the knife melee function is really sweet. It's an overhead stabbing motion that feels a lot more real and intense than in MW2.If you're a fan of the BF series or just looking for a break from 5th prestige in MW2, you've got to check this game out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Best version of the system so far, for both DS and 3DS games","reviewText":"After buying all the DS variations in the past (besides DSI XL) I decided to take the plunge and pick this version up. It has great backwards compatibility with all the DS games working on it, along with some good games out so far, it's the ultimate version of the DS.Backwards compatibility:So far all the DS games I have played on this game work with the Nubstick and the D-pad. The Nubstick only moves in four directions like the D-pad, but I find it more comfortable that working with the D-pad, and since the D-pad is located below it, you can tell they wanted people to use the Nubstick over it. 3D is turned off automatically for obvious reasons.When you load a DS game it plays it a bit stretched on the top to a bigger square than the native DS resolution (Not full screen though, left and right have black bars but it's not noticeable) and the bottom is stretch the entire square, and the touch controls work just fine and I didn't notice anything wrong with them even though its stretched.You can also hold Start + Select when you load a DS game to play in the native resolution of the game, which plays them in a really small square in both the touch screen and top screen. The touch screen works with the smaller screen as well, but with at least 358/2 days I was able to control the camera past the screen size in the black areas, so this might affect DS games that rely on precise touch screen controls.While it stretches the DS games, I only noticed minor pixelations that were noticeable but didn't take away from the games. I prefer playing the games in the stretch mode, and even the originally DS didn't have the native resolutions the games were made in, so those are stretched as well. Since all the DS games work with the Nub stick, I think this is the best version of the DS to play DS games on. They even included the original DS wifi setup, so that you can play online with your DS titles as well.Hardware:The 3DS has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel like it will break any time soon. All the parts of the 3DS are fingerprint magnets, with no 3DS option out there so far with a matte finish, so you will be wiping your 3DS a lot. The stylus has gotten an upgrade; the stick part pulls out in a longer stick and is metal now. The tip still is rubber plastic, so you won't scratch your screens. It folds up into a smaller version and is stored in the top bottom part of the DS now, and is near the game slot.Just like the DSI you can add a SD memory card and the 3DS comes with a 2 GB card for free. With this you can add music to the 3DS, download the official emulator games on the marketplace, along with all the new features to the 3DS that I will talk about shortly. Unlike the Vita, the memory cards are not proprietary. So you can buy a cheap 32 GB micro SD card, get and adapter for it and use that, instead of being forced to pay 100 dollars if you want a 32 GB's. If you want to transfer music or other things to the DS, your computer will need a SD memory card slot since the 3DS doesn't have any USB connection. Unfortunately most games still only keep games saves on the 3DS cartridges, and not save to the memory card.You can charge the 3DS on both a cord like the DS and GBA chargers, or you can put it in a cradle where you put the cord into. The cradle itself allows you to just set the 3DS in it and charge away. The cradle is pretty cool since the 3DS just slides into it, without having to hook anything up directly to the system, just the charger dock.The 3DS comes with three camera ports. The rear facing camera has two slots since it can take 3D pictures. It isn't the best quality out there, but it is nice to have just in case you need it. The 3D pictures are cool, but will only be viewable in 3DS itself. Along with that, you can take capture AR pictures for various games and software titles and augmented reality cards. The front facing camera isn't the greatest quality as well, and is really only used for games that capture your face.The headphone jack is on the bottom of the DS now (where the GBA slot was), which makes for more comfortable gaming experience when you're playing with headphones on. Like the previous DS's, they also have a microphone slot for games which require you to talk into. It also spins the icons at the main menu when you blow into it. The battery life is pretty low though, running at 3-6 hours depending on settings and if you're using 3D or not. They do have a battery saving mode and you can reduce the brightness for longer battery life.Software:A web browser has been added as well, and actually works pretty well. It doesn't have flash built in, but the sites do load pretty fast and can switch through multiple tabs and zoom in with the touch screen. Just like a regular browser you can save favorites and it saves cookies on your system for sites you visit often.The store application allows us to finally be able to download DS games through wifi now. They currently have RE: Revelations and MGS:3 as the main demos, but they only have 30 uses each. You can also download a bunch of free applications as well. Netflix is available, but you need an active subscription for it and I think in the future they will have 3D titles available to watch.A 3D pokedex is free to download as well, and you can unlock new pokemon through the AR reader and reloading it every day. A free 3D note writer is downloadable as well, and it works with streetpass with other people. A video player can be downloaded as well, and it updates every week with 4 videos during that week that range from random videos to music videos. They are all in 3D.All the DSi-ware games are downloadable on the 3DS and they have been releasing Gameboy games with the built in emulator they have. This could lead to GBA games being purchasable; I personally would love to be able to buy the older pokemon games for the 3DS. NES and Gamegear have emulator games downloadable in the store, which could lead to so many other systems getting an emulator for the 3DS.Setting up wi-fi is really easy this time around, even if you have a WPA-key router. I didn't have to set up the ip address and the other settings for the 3DS wifi (Had to do this for the DS wifi settings since it still messes up) and this is a nice relief with a bunch of wireless games coming to the 3DS. I haven't noticed any lag so far for multiplayer gaming.Streetpass is something new they added with 3DS, which is a wireless function that interacts with other peoples 3DS when you go past them. This could range from trading Ghost racing data in Mario Kart, to trading notes you set up to send to other people. It has a pretty far range as well (I live near a road, and left my 3DS on and got some people with streetpass that drove past my house) and it's a pretty cool way to interact with other random people.Verdict:I know I talked a lot in this review, but I wanted to cover as much as I could during the course of this review. The 3D effects are really cool in all the menus and applications you can get and if most games are going to be like Mario Kart 7's 3D effects, I am really looking forward to the future of this system. Definitely not a DS I will sell anytime soon and I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap portable system, especially if you haven't had a DS before. Also Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance coming out for this doesn't hurt either.~ Written: April, 2012Positives:* Great backwards compatibility that is actually improving over the original DS* Upgraded stylus* Browser is well made to the 3DS* Better spot for a headphone jack* DSi-ware works* Gameboy, NES and gamegear emulator* Wifi is finally easy to set up* Game time tracking in daily, monthly and yearly segmentsNegatives:* Not the greatest camera* Semi low battery life","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2012"}

Antonio \"CMDTA\"","summary":"Not Compatible With the PS4","reviewText":"These headphones are amazing at times and not so hot when there is an explosion.The sound from these headphones is very nice. You have a hard time finding some headphones with better sound but there is a problem.  When there is an explosion nearby the bass breaks no matter how low you turn down the bass.  When the bass breaks, instead of sound you get an odd waffling sound.  It's almost like the instead of a sound you get a puff of air.  The volume just goes away when this happens.The other reason I am giving these headphones three stars is the fact that you can only use them on the PS3.  Right now they are not compatible with the PS4.  I can plug them into my PC and get them to work but not my PS4?  That's not cool.  They should at least show up as generic Bluetooth headphones on the PS4.  Instead you get a \"not compatible\" error message.  I really hope Sony fixes this.**** Update ****Sony has patched the PS4 so this headset now works as intended.  It functions differently than it does on the PS3.  When you turn it on with the PS3, it takes over for the speakers and activates the microphone.On the PS4, only the microphone is activated.  You have to go into the settings to make the headset take over for the speakers.  That's really annoying.  I'm knocking it one star because of that.  If Sony patches it, or makes it easier to switch the sound output I might bump it up to 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Even though the Wii was not technically capable of producing HD graphics I was certainly impressed by how pretty Mario Galaxy games looked and now that the WiiU can produce HD graphics I&#8217;m so happy that I can finally enjoy a 3D Mario game in all its High Definition glory.The level of detail they put into every level makes every world feel differently and you have many ways to approach the situation, especially with this game and it&#8217;s first entry into the 4 player co-op game in a 3D Mario game giving you the chance to play as Mario, Luigi, Toad or Princess Peach, each with their own characteristic &aacute; la Mario Bros. 2 for NES.The main new thing is the cat suit which will let you control your character in a very different way that you&#8217;re used to. You can climb up walls and slash at enemies instead of the usual stomp and it will also let you reach new and hidden places or collect new stars too.As always, you need very precise movements to achieve whatever&#8217;s necessary to get your goal, be it a star or a powerup and things might get as chaotic as you&#8217;d expect just as when playing New Super Mario Bros.The variety of puzzles will make playing through a game a breeze since there is rarely a repetitive mechanic in other levels, and if there is it&#8217;ll include some clever twist that will make it feel only vaguely familiar.After playing most of the new games in this new generation you&#8217;ll notice that a lot of them require you to go through a lengthy tutorial of explanation of every single thing you need to do, and Mario (or most of Nintendo&#8217;s) games guide you by gameplay alone through all the tricks you can do naturally that you won&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re teaching them. Every level feels familiar as you&#8217;ll notice homages to the history of Mario games, from the music to the world where you choose the level, but always with something new. It&#8217;s such a joy to play this game it&#8217;s hard to describe.If you own a WiiU, or thinking about getting one, this might be the main reason to do it in the near future (Smash Bros. and Mario Kart will come out next year). You will not be disappointed. Whether you play single player or co-op, this is a game you will not soon forget.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7G0GG","description":"","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"surprisingly innovative","reviewText":"On the surface, Super Mario 3D World looks like a rehash of old ideas from Mario games past. I for one was extremely skeptical of the game. However, having gotten to World 6, I'm shocked at how rich this game truly is. Almost every level has some new innovative mechanic or design aspect. Some levels are timed at only 100 seconds and intended to be completed quickly. Others rely upon new types of platforming, such as having to jump on moving ants. The Captain Toad levels require you to control a Toad, but take away your most basic ability: jumping. There are also random enemies and even some bosses scattered throughout the map.Another thing I like is that you can play as Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Toad right off the bat. You can also tell the game to select your character at random.So far, I've found the game to be a bit on the easy side. I've played for just two nights (for a total of around 6 hours) and am already on World 6. It even hasn't been particularly difficult to get most of the Green Stars and Stamps. Obviously, alter worlds are more difficult, but gamers looking for a real platforming challenge might be better off with Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Welcome to Liberty City","reviewText":"Lets skip all the video game politics and ethical diatribe, Grand Theft Auto IV is some serious fun. That is, if you can handle heavy satire, hours of enjoyment, and a massive city as your personal playground.For its very first foray into the next generation of gaming, the Grand Theft Auto series goes back to a wholly different Liberty City. Modeled after New York City (catch the funny play on names like the GETALIFE building), Liberty City is a living, breathing world that is detailed like never before. In fact, one of the most impressive aspects of GTAIV is its realistic portrayal of human beings. Of course, there is a huge layer of stereotyping and satire involved, but as far as their actions and movements go, everything feels so real that it is quite hard not to get sucked into the game.For the 4th installment in the Grand Theft Auto 3D universe, Rockstar trimmed the fat and injected more realism and emotion into the game. Gone are the heavy handed quasi-RPG elements of 'San Andreas' (I kind of liked  them, but oh well). Planes are also gone, as are bicycles; GTA IV feels more like GTAIII, eschewing most of what 'Vice City' and 'San Andreas' brought to the table, much to the chagrin of many fans. I think this is a good thing. Instead of a mish-mash of half baked concepts and ideas thrown together, we get a very focused and in depth game with a variety of options. The Story lines in GTA games have always been lacking, but GTAIV aimed to change that. It did.You are Niko Bellic, a foreigner seeking resolution and the American Dream. You come to Liberty City and immediately find yourself in the midst of crime and betrayal. I'm not going to say anything else about the story other than it is actually really good! The dialogue is really good, the voice acting is really really good. Ever since I got this game I have been completely engulfed by it, absorbed into the world of Niko Bellic and Liberty City.Like in 'San Andreas' your character has his own voice, his own emotions, motivations and mannerisms. Niko Bellic feels, acts and sounds like a real person. He gets angry, he gets happy. And the really cool and nicely  done cut scenes show off all of this. In fact, this game would have been a snore fest had the main character been a cardboard cut out or a voiceless murderer. Giving the main character a true sense of purpose and identity is what makes this game a very enjoyable experience. You get a grip of what Niko wants, and you can really connect to him. That is something that is unfortunately missing in most of the games flooding the market today.Your in game cell phone plays out like your menu. From your phone you can contact friends, get work, get to the options menu, take pictures, and access the multiplayer feature. Its a neat way to hide a menu, and it can actually work as a phone as well. You can call the police, the fire dept and the paramedics. These can work to you advantage if you find yourself in a jam with the more seedier folk. Being chased by some gun totting gangsters? No problem, just call the police, and they will take care of it. But make sure you are not shooting when they arrive, or they will probably chase after you.Friends play a crucial role this time around, and to be honest you will spent most of your time pleasing your friends. They will call you wanting to hang out. Chill with them enough and they may even grant you special favors (i.e helicopter rides and gun trafficking). Ignore them too much and they will lose respect for you and may even start to dislike you. They also have various side quests for you to tackle. Your friends have their own personalities, their own attitudes, beliefs and interests. Rockstar did an awesome job fleshing out each character. However, there is a downside to the whole friends business, they never leave you alone! They always seem to call you right when you are in the middle of a mission. It can get really tedious at times trying to satisfy both friends and a girlfriend, but hey thats life. And GTAIV certainly does feel like a second life.One thing that GTAIV does borrow from 'San Andreas' is the dating sim, which has been drastically improved. Not only do you meet various woman through the main story line, you can even go online (yes, this game has an in-game internet!) and meet people online. There are a host of things to do with your date as well, such as bowling, comedy clubs, strip clubs,  dining, pool, darts, and drinking. You can even get intimate with your dates, which results in a semi-funny cut scene (no they don't show you anything).Hookers are still in the game as well, and I still have a heck of a time using and abusing them. Which leads me to another fun aspect of GTAIV; playing the game how YOU want to play it. Sure during missions you have to complete the objective, but outside of missions the city is your playground. You can pretty much do anything you want, within the limits of the game. As always, you can go on killing sprees, see how many stars you can obtain, see how many police you can kill etc. These can sometimes be fun, however you have to take the violence with a grain of salt. Its a video game. Remember that.Graphic wise, GTAIV is definitely a step up from its predecessors. Is it true next generation graphics? Not really, but for the sheer size and scope of the game they more than serve their purpose. Details is where this game shines. From murals painted on buildings to the glitz and glamor of Liberty City's equivalent to Times Square, everything is heavily detailed. Every time I play this game I am amazed at how realistically detailed the city and its inhabitants are. Kudos to Rockstar for such a fine job.Not only are the graphics a definite upgrade from its predecessors, but the A.I is much improved. Pedestrians act more realistic, answering their cell phones, on their daily routines, drinking coffee, causing trouble. You can even spot civilians getting into shootouts with the police, or resisting arrest. The pedestrians and enemies in GTAIV are some of the smartest and most realistic in the series, and part of that has to do with the new physics engine used for the game.Dubbed the 'Euphoria' engine, this powerful program causes every single object in the game world to react to real physics laws. This means that every single character in the game moves with a realistic sense of weight. Get hit by a car and your body will go ragdoll, smash into something head on in a car and watch your body fly through the windshield and onto the pavement. When you shoot someone their body reacts to the specific spot where the bullet hit them. Overall the new physics engine is something to rave about, and I am willing to bet we will be seeing that engine in use in the future (Star Wars: Force Unleashed will be using the Euphoria engine as well).The combat has been greatly improved as well, though the auto aim is still rather annoying. Thankfully you can now toggle the auto aim on/off.  The new cover system, similar to Gears of War and even more so Metal Gear Solid 4 really adds new life to the combat. Being able to duck behind virtually any object and wall in a heated battle is a godsend. You can even peek around corners and fire. There are still times when the whole ordeal gets a little clunky, but its a much needed improvement over the previous GTA titles.At last, we come to the most interesting aspect of GTAIV, the multiplayer. For the first time gamers can roam the immensely detailed streets of Liberty City via Xbox Live. You and some friends can start a Free Roam game and do whatever you want. You can reign terror on the city, have death matches, races. Quite literally, you can do what you want. If the Free Roaming gets boring, you can always join in on a Ranked or Unranked deathmatch and the even more exciting Team Deathmatch. I have to say that team deathmatch in the sprawling Liberty City is epic! You can even have up to four or five teams battle each other at once!If online shootouts aren't your fancy, you can take to the streets, racing style. Since the courses all take place in the streets of the city, there are no designated paths that you are forced to take. You can get through the check points any way you want (except backwards of course). And if you decide to give up you can always work towards making the other drivers lives very miserable by setting up roadblocks and causing all kinds of trouble.Speaking of online, one of the coolest things about GTAIV is the level of developer support it will get. Rockstar have already promised gamers some downloadable content this fall. As to what it will be is anyones guess, but suffice it to say the the options are literally limitless. They could do anything from add new missions to new sections of the city. They could even add new weapons, stores, songs on the radio, and a whole host of stuff. This is most beneficial to the gamer, especially if this content is cheap or free. I am very excited to see what Rockstar have cooking.Oh yeah, one more thing. The radio, as always, rocks! On it you will hear the classic talk show radio stuff that hilarious, and a multitude of music that spans across all genres and styles. Some songs you will recognize, and others you may not.Grand Theft Auto IV is THE controversial game of this generation,. and in many ways it is also one of the best GTA titles in the series. With endless fun, endless options, an amazing A.I and physics system, and a whole host of missions, side quests, friends and relationships Grand Theft Auto IV brings the GTA series to the next generation. As always, this game is rated M, as this is a very violent game. But there is always a tinge of humor to every action taken.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2008"}

Roberts","summary":"Finally a great RPG with a great story","reviewText":"I'm a fan of RPGs and after playing Final Fantasy Tactics years ago I became an even bigger fan of these tactical RPGs. What always bugs me is the cheesy dialog and whining Japanese anime style acting. In Jeane D'Arc there is definitely a bit of this but its greatly overshadowed by a creatively twisted plot, serious dialog and somewhat more succinct delivery. It's still got plenty of reading but not as long winded and it's Nintendo counterparts.I first noticed the graphics are bright on the PSP and really pop. The music and sound are also top notch but most importantly the gameplay is deep and intuitive. The game constantly rewards you with new skills, magic, weapons, etc.. but it never becomes a grind and the story always stays center to you're attention.The characters offer a good amount of diversity and so do the enemies and levels.Overall I liked it more than Final Fantasy tactics. I found it less overwhelming, and more intuitive but the game does feel a bit smaller. Maybe not in length but just in the amount of things that are thrown at you which might be a good thing.I took my time and the game took 41 hours to complete. I never considered not finishing it either. I highly recommend.One last note, I played the DD version of the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}

FFVII was released in 1997, became possibly the best-selling RPG ever, has been lauded by most critics for years, and this is 2004. I think the ship of destiny has sailed.Anyway, I love this game. I have played it multiple times, and while it isn't my favorite FF title (that honor is shared by FFVI and FFVIII), it holds a special place in my heart. I read in the spotlight above that one reviewer gave up on the game because Aeris died; this seems odd (I mean, really, these are only video game characters, and can someone really get worked up that much over the merely-physical death of a single heroine?). I myself found this a bit silly (characters get killed all the time in RPGs; didn't Cloud have a Phoenix Down on hand?), but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game. The gameplay, the sidequests, the graphics (for their time), the Chocobos - all come together quite well in this title. I particularly enjoyed the frustration (and ultimate satisfaction) of defeating Emerald and Ruby, and the storyline is OK as well.

Rhodes","summary":"In Space No One Can Hear You Scream","reviewText":"Pros:+Very absorbing atmosphere+Fantastic voice acting+Simple to learn gameplay+Interesting gameplay concepts+Good music+A Pretty Scary GameCons:-The camera stays a little too close to the action-Sometimes clunky controlsDead Space takes the genre of survival horror to new heights.  It's atmosphere help it become a terrifying game that will keep you fully immersed, and maybe keep you up at night.In Dead Space, you play as Issac Clarke, an engineer.  Along with two friends from Concordance Extraction Corporation, you receive a distress call from another ship and decide to investigate.  Upon arriving, however, things have already gone awry.  Aboard the ship is a deadly alien race that has apparently killed much of the crew.  Within minutes of arriving, you're separated from your allies.  Your job is to survive on this ship, reunite with your crew and find a way to escape.  Dead Space won't get any points for having a creative story, but what it lacks in story it makes up for in other areas.There's one thing Dead Space does right immediately.  It sets the tone and atmosphere of the game right away.  The environments are dark and moody and the enemies are horrifying and scary.  From the start, Dead Space is instantly absorbing as a result.  The game does such a good job in its dark atmosphere that it's easy to be absorbed into it and scared.  Needless to say, the game is not for the squeamish.  There's blood and lots of it.Despite its dark tone, Dead Space isn't very hard to pick up and play.  As Issac you'll come across a few helpful weapons and tools to help you out.  However, Dead Space takes the idea of gun toting to a new level.  The enemies in Dead Space are not killed by taking mere shots at them.  Instead the game forces you to shoot off the enemy's limbs in order to kill them.  There's a bit of strategy involved in it as simply aiming for the body doesn't do at any time.  You'll be forced to shoot in the arms and legs in order to kill your enemies. It can take time to get used to the gameplay, but once you do, you'll come to enjoy it.  There's a definite strategic feel as to how to sever your enemies.  In short, it's a widely different approach.  You may find yourself scrounging for ammo from time to time, but for the most part ammunition for your weapons is plentiful.The most interesting aspect of the gameplay, however, may be that everything takes place in real time.  When you're listening to someone's radio transmission or even just browsing the menu, everything is still moving.  This means you could be attacked while selecting a weapon to use in combat or even if you're trying to heal.  This would be a problem if there weren't hot keys for doing the two most important things: healing and reloading.  It keeps you on your toes for the most part.  You can pause the game, at least, but you won't be able to take a look at your items, weapons, objectives or maps while you do it.  There may be times when this can be frustrating, particularly if you get lost or need to know what you're supposed to be doing.  Even when one of the game's tutorials pop up it's in real time.  In the long run it isn't too big of a problem.  In some ways it enhances the games sense of urgency.  Luckily there are plenty of save points scattered throughout the game.Graphically Dead Space is incredible and easily one of the best looking games of this generation.  The action never slows down and there is a lot of attention to detail.  If it weren't for enemies roaming around and trying to kill you, you'd probably stop just to look around and marvel at the visuals.  It really draws you in and makes you feel as though you're part of the game.  The game also has some good physics.  You can kick boxes and containers around on the ground or move bodies.  It's amazing just how much attention is given to the game's environment.The music is also very good.  Just like the visuals, it's dark and moody.  The sound effects are perhaps the best thing going for the game.  The monsters sound just as terrifying as they look.  The voice acting is also a treat.  In terms of production values, Dead Space is a masterpiece.Dead Space isn't a perfect game, however.  For starters, the camera stays a little too close to the action at times.  Beyond that, the controls also feel a little clunky at times such as when you have to turn or when you need to maneuver the camera to pick up certain items.  It isn't a huge hindrance, but it can cause you to take unnecessary damage at times.  Luckily, too, there is plenty of health scattered about.In the end, Dead Space is a masterpiece and raises the bar for the Survival Horror genre.  It's dark, absorbing atmosphere makes it, by far, one of the greatest games in the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2008"}

The Wii is on a different level, so I'm giving the PS3 a 2 star review when compared to the Xbox 360.  Why?  I think the consoles are very similar, but I think there are a few key ways (at least for me) the PS3 falls short:1.  There aren't as many of the 'older' games available for the PS3 as the Xbox 360. I'm not sure about anyone else, but we have trouble paying $60 -$70 or more for brand new games all the time. We do occasionally buy used games, or buy games that are 2-3 years old.  You can get those often for about $20.  The PS3 simply doesn't have as many of those games as the Xbox 360.2.  The quality of the games/graphics. Once again, in most cases, the consoles are very close. But in the older, bargain games, the Xbox 360 seems to have better graphics. In some good older games (like Marvel Ultimate alliance), the PS3 is very choppy, where the 360 is smoother.3.  The motion sensing controller of the PS3.  Is it a good idea?  Yes. However, there are some ways they seemed to 'force' its use into a game where it doesn't fit. Using Marvel Ultimate alliance again as an example..to get by some parts of the game, you MUST shake the controller a certain way. Sometimes, it works, sometimes it doesn't...but bottom line, you can't get by certain parts of the game unless you do it.  We bought a PS3 first (for the blu-ray player), but issues like that in the game (controller and frame rate issues) are the reason we ended up getting an xbox 360. Some of the games are just less frustrating to play.Is the PS3 a good console? Yes.  Do we have one? Yes.  If you want a blu-ray player and don't have one yet, and you also don't have any gaming console is the PS3 a good choice? Yes. But if you are looking for a console simply for gaming, In my opinion, the Xbox 360 is less frustrating and a better gaming choice.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"\"What is it Barry???\"  \"...BLOOD!\"","reviewText":"Resident Evil(2002). The Gamecube remake of the classic 1996 survival horror game for the PS1.Reworking older video games can be a very risky move on the part of Game companies, especially if the originals are considered by the fans to be highly regarded classics. Sometimes the remake turns out to be a major success and outshines the original. Just look at Super Castlevania 4 (SNES remake of the first Castlevania game) and the new Prince Of Persia games for prime examples of what to do right. Then there are the ones that end up ruining the franchise and disgracing the originals (I refer you to the legions of Tomb Raider sequels and 3D Contra games). Now this isn't the first time that Capcom has done remakes. In fact, they're quite notorious for it. This goes back to their SNES days when countless \"Special Edition Turbo Alpha X\" releases of Street Fighter 2 had seen the light of day, showcasing very miniscule improvements over the previous releases. Now we have Nintendo Gamecube reworking the classic RE1. Can they truly succeed in actually \"rebuilding\" a game where all the other director's cuts and annual editions failed, or will it disappoint like the others?I've been a HUGE fan of the Resident Evil games since I first played RE2 upon its release in 1998, and have come to enjoy most all of the other games in the series. With this new version of the original I had low expectations of them actually redoing the game, but thankfully I was pleasantly SHOCKED beyond belief at how well crafted the game is now! I'd go so far as to say that it certainly beats out RE3 and Code Veronica for sure and even much of RE2 (my favorite one!), though RE4 is still the best game in the series. They basically took everything that was good about the original game and got rid of (nearly) all the bad and cheesy parts and produced a genuinely solid RE entry. I'm going to spend the review going over the changes between the original and the remake, and since the basic story and play mechanics are identical between both of the games, go read my PS1 \"Resident Evil: Director's Cut\" review for most of the game info.The first thing anyone will notice are the Graphics. WOW do they ever look detailed and creepy now! Easily the best looking RE game up to that point. It puts the blocky, bland Scooby Doo-esque visuals of the original to shame (no offense to any Scooby Doo fans out there). Most locations have been faithfully kept the same in size and location, yet the look of each place has been effectively redesigned to achieve maximum eerieness. In fact, the in game visuals look so good that the CG movies seem almost EXACTLY alike. Water and blood reflects and flows fluidly, zombies and other monsters look gorily disgusting now, and Characters show genuine expressions. They even took note on the cult success of the PS2 Silent Hill games and opted to reinvent RE's scare factor through grittiness and effective shadowing. There is a lot more graphic blood this time, which is a major shock considering this is a Nintendo game (I have a huge rant about Nintendo and its censorship tendencies, but I'll spare it for now). Not even the most die-hard oldschool gamer can scoff at the amazing graphics.Of course none of this brilliant eye candy would mean anything if the game were no fun to play. I'm happy to report that RE is still the same fun survival horror game, controls, and camera angles (love them or hate them, your pick). It was cleverly built so that new fans can pick up and enjoy the game, but veteran fans of the original can also still get the most out of it. Scare spots, items, boss locations, and other factors have been changed, so it isn't the exact same game as before. Another thing that older fans will immediately notice is that there are now new locations and puzzles that blend in with all the old. This makes the game even bigger than the original already was.Other cool gameplay additions are the defense weapons and the \"Crimson Head\" zombies, which come to life after you dispose of normal zombies. This adds a new scare factor and strategic element to the existing gameplay formula, and forces you to think about what you're doing. That other new \"chained thing\" was VERY CREEPY as well and reminded me a lot of the Silent Hill games. There are many modes to unlock after you beat the game, and each one is quite different, so I'll leave you to discover those.The newly arranged soundtrack builds vastly on the original's and it effectively compliments the scary visuals. Then there's the voice acting... MUCH BETTER PEOPLE THIS TIME. Though all of the general dialogue has been kept the same, the characters are all A LOT MORE BELIEVEABLE, and just about every line has been changed for the better. There are a couple of exceptions, such as when Jill gets the lockpick from Barry, and also the part near the end when Chris gets really ticked off at Wesker. But sometimes you can't get rid of goofy parts without changing them completely. Oh well. This small quibble is the game's only downpoint.Overall, I am extremely pleased with the remake, and I recommend this one over the original anyday (still, it's worth digging up to hear all the hilarious dialogue!) 5 stars hands down. Some have stated that RE2 and RE3 need to be remade like this one, but the look, atmosphere, and voice acting were so much better in those ones that they don't really need it (although in RE4 seeing Leon in the unlockable RPD uniform from RE2 kinda makes you wonder...). This game is solid proof that sometimes a remake can rebuild your view of an older game for the better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Finally Resistance delivers on its potential","reviewText":"Well, here we are, almost half a decade has passed since Fall of Man came out as the PS3's killer app, and now Insomniac has released Resistance 3, their final game in the series. They've made a lot of changes to the third installment over its predecessors, refining and changing until this final product came to be. I'll be honest, when it comes to shooters, I've always considered the Resistance games to be 2nd-tier. That isn't to say I think the first two titles are bad or \"meh,\" I found them both to be pretty fun shooters (Fall of Man especially because of co-op campaign, R2 was alright but not as good as the first). Still, I've always preferred Halo as a sci fi shooter, or the PS3's other flagship franchises such as Uncharted and Killzone. Well, I can honestly say that with R3, we have a game that finally delivers on the promise of the series. This review will mainly be about the campaign, as that is pretty much all I play games for.The Resistance series has always had the potential to be spectacular with regards to story. The premise of the series is awesome, mixing a 1950's alternate history setting with War of the Worlds. However, the first two games felt more like militaristic popcorn sci-fi action thrillers, with only minimal exposition and character development to excuse all the action, rather than poignant tales about mankind's indomitable spirit despite staring down the barrel of impending extinction by a vast, advanced alien enemy. This game feels like the latter. Finally, we see just how bleak of a situation mankind is in, with only 10% of Earth's population not killed by or converted into Chimera. We play as Joseph Capelli four years after R2, who has been dishonorably discharged and settled down with a family. Dr. Malikov shows up and asks for Joseph's help to go on a 1000+ mile trip to New York with an ambiguous promise that what awaits there will give humanity a fighting chance to survive. Joseph reluctantly agrees, but mainly for the sake of his beloved wife and son.In my humble opinion, this is the best storytelling of the entire Resistance series, hands down. Joseph is a great lead character, the kind you sympathize with and root for. For the most part, all character development is very well done, the characters are by and large likable and relatable, and the Chimera are extremely disturbing and fascinating (Even after three games, we still know nothing about the Chimera or understand them, which helps make them so creepy). This is a much more intimate story than what Resistance has ever delivered, and it is all the better for it. It's also a lot more cinematic. That doesn't mean it isn't exciting or that epic set pieces have been left out. There may not be anything to the level of the Leviathan of R2 (which is a disappointment, but makes sense given the tone of the story), but seeing the massive Goliath return, or a stampede of feral widowmakers (think massive leapers) comes pretty close.The art and sound design cannot go unmentioned either. The graphics definitely aren't on a level of Uncharted or Killzone technically, but they're good enough to deliver on the art design's promise. That's a very good thing. A besieged 1950's rural america REALLY looks good here. Vistas, environments, character models, weapon models, they all add to the experience quite well. The sound design is equally compelling, as the soundtrack is pretty good, and the sound effects are exceptional. You'll never mistake a Chimeran dropship for anything else, and the guttural roar of the various Chimeran types is very well done. It's all very iconic. Everything in the visual and audio department *really* immerses you into the bleak War of the Worlds worse case scenario, and that is high praise indeed. The cinematics, while looking really good, do have some issues such as weird lip syncing issues that can distract.Honestly, the gameplay is where the series has always shined, and it shines very brightly here. R3 almost feels like a hybrid (no pun intended) of the first two games. You have many gameplay mechanics from Fall of Man returning here, such as health packs and the weapon's wheel, but you also have the tighter, refined controls from R2 making a return as well. It's a perfect mix of both R1 and R2 that Insomniac has been tinkering with for multiple installments, and finally R3 gets it right. The weapons are as imaginative and satisfying as they ever were, AND there's an awesome new mechanic here that borrows heavily from Insomniac's other flagship franchise, Ratchet & Clank. You see, the more you use a weapon, the more experience it accumulates, and eventually you'll be able to unlock three upgrades to the weapons. A shotgun leveled up once makes it able to light enemies on fire by chance, and a final upgrade makes its secondary fire launch a massive grenade that can light a massive radius on fire. The weapons also undergo aesthetic changes as well with each level. This simple leveling system was incredibly awesome, and really added to the game's value to me. It forced you to use all the weapons in the addicting quest to upgrade them all. Very nice. The AI was also greatly improved over the first two games. Different Chimera types have their own unique strategies, and each feel pretty formidable. I wouldn't say the AI is any better than other FPS franchises though, but still decent.There is no 8-player co-op mode like in R2, which is a huge bummer, but I have to give thanks for the fact that you can play the campaign with a co-op buddy again. This feature is what made Fall of Man so fun to me in the first place, and it was a major disappointment that its sequel did away with it. It was great playing this with my brother-in-law. We actually played it all in one sitting, which took about 7 hours, a disappointingly paltry campaign lenth. It may not be as inexcusably short as the Call of Duty series, sure, but it's also not as long as I'd prefer from a FPS (I prefer at least 8 or 9 hours and hope for 10+). With such a fun campaign, the shortness is disappointing. At least those few hours are packed with variety and excitement...Multiplayer: Insomniac did away with the massive multiplayer matches of R2 and honestly, I think it suffers for it. It's not that 16-player matches are bad, but the big player pools of R2 really made that game's multiplayer component unique and frenzied compared to other franchises like Halo or Killzone. Now, it just seems like all the rest in terms of gameplay dynamics. As I said earlier, I don't care too much for multiplayer to make this that big of a problem, but it is worth mentioning. Maps are designed well and the gameplay is great though, so if you're a multiplayer sort of gamer, Resistance probably will please you more than it will disappoint.I've always loved the idea behind the Resistance series. I've always wanted to consider it a top-tier series, but for various reasons, I could never bring myself to do it. Resistance 3 is the game that has fully won me over with only little reservations. I had a blast playing this game, getting lost in its atmosphere, story, and action. It has its problems, sure, but overall my experience with Resistance 3 was a good one, and one I would recommend to others with only the slightest hesitation or apprehension. I can't say that about the first two games, where I always felt the need to explain qualifiers for. This is a great game. Buy it, go on a wild, compelling journey, and be the resistance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2011"}

No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character).

Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations.

B)volley's damage has been cut by %50!!it USED to be one of the best AOE moves any hunter could have but now it's somewhat worthless!! etc...5)repair expenses are just SO HIGH in wow,ALL my plate armor-wearing friends complain of how they NEVER have any money.as a hunter,mail armor repairs are expensive too!!is that blizz's concept of \"fun\"??a friend of mine told me that repair expenses are so high he actually knows some players who adventure without armor!!i'm sorry,but i'm honestly not having much fun with wow anymore,thank you blizz for screwing up your game,and turning a deaf ear to your players.if you want your game to succeed,you will have to please US,not YOURSELVES!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2009"}

They put so much quality and effort into their games you can't help but to smirk and think \"wow, that is awesome\" when you play their games (Oblivion, Fallout 3) and see how much work went into the presentation.Skyrim: what can I say that hasn't been said? It's a fantastic experience, packed with so much detail, people, locations and quests you could play it just to sight-see. It is worth every cent to play and makes me wonder when the day will come that companies like Bethesda realize they're giving away too much value.Graphics: incredible; they pushed the Xbox to the limit. The draw scale is farther out so mountains and major landmarks and water are visible. The snow and shadows look terrific and create a cold, moody atmosphere as is fitting for a game leaning heavily on Scandinavian culture. The interior of buildings are filled with objects (so many you often forget your quest in order to examine them) and exceptional attention to details.Sound: awesome music that underscores the content; FX are perfect (although I do hear repetition in certain character voices)Playability: outstanding; certainly with so much going on in the game you'll see texture flips and some hiccups here and there but these guys are pulling off a masterpiece here. Forgive the small stuff for the bigger picture. I'm just amazed how much performance they continue to get out of the Xbox's processor.Buy it. Play it.

{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Instant favorite","reviewText":"From the opening sequence to the end of the game, it's a solid action/adventure game. It plays very much like Legend of Zelda or Castlevania in that you have to collect certain items and can revisit previous areas to explore for hidden or previously unattainable treasure. The graphics are great, if not outstanding, and the enemies are well-animated. There's never any slow-down, and the character models move smoothly.The voice acting is very well done given the at-times corny script, but overall the story is delivered solidly and in-tact. It's a very fast playthrough. I completed the game in a single weekend in my spare time between home improvement projects. But it's very satisfying and replayability stands on its own merits. I almost wish I hadn't chosen the hardest difficulty for the first playthrough just so that I would have had to go through the whole game again. If you don't want to have to play it a second time, choosing the highest difficulty won't really affect game play: combat is simple and straightforward and once you've seen an enemy enough times you can take it down quickly without taking much damage even on harder settings. The final boss is pretty much a push-over if you've taken the time to collect everything and learn how to effectively use War.The setting of the game is also epic. You're playing as War, one of the Four Horseman, and you eventually meet up with his horse, Ruin. You're travelling through a post-apocalyptic city, kick butt and leaving the names as you try to find out who betrayed you. It's a new and interesting take on Angelic mythos.The world itself could have been a bit bigger and longer, but for what it was it never lost my attention or disappointed me. There were a few frustrating areas where it took me a little too long to figure out what to do, but only because I missed something that should have been obvious. The puzzles themselves aren't terribly difficult, and you'll breeze through most of the game. The platforming sections can be frustrating at times, but fortunately you're treated to a number of do-overs if you fall, at the cost of some health (until you run out). Item collection can be very straightforward, with only a few tricky locations that you may not notice if you don't always take the time to do things like turn around and look up.With its debut, Darksiders has definitely landed itself a spot among my favorite game franchises. I'm hoping they continue to build the story and give us a look at each of the four horsemen. As it is, I'm really looking forward to get a chance to sit down and play through the sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Cover and Shoot... with Friends!","reviewText":"Epic saved the best for last.  In the final installment of Gears, there's more of everything.  More Weapons, more creatures, more Multiplayer Modes, more Co-op Options, and a longer Campaign.  But the basic cover and shoot gameplay remains the same.Concept:  9/10The Gears Trilogy Concludes with more of everything and significantly expanded Multiplayer.  It's definitely the best game of the series.Story:  8/10As in the other Gears games, the story is told through cutscenes and character dialogue.  The overall pacing of the game is cutscene, encounter, cutscene, encounter, repeat.  The story is simple and to the point, and basically explains where you need to go next.  You progress through an adventure to kill alien invaders.  The dialogue is typical tough guy stuff with as many curse words thrown in as possible voiced by actors who sound like they've smoked about 4 million cigarettes.  Like the other Gears games, there are a few dramatic moments in the cutscenes that you'll remember.  The story would have been better if it went into a bit more detail about the Evil Queen or the Lambent.  As it stands, they're just things to kill as you save the world.Gameplay:  8/10Gears of War gameplay revolves around cover and shoot.  Take cover, shoot at enemies, duck down if you are injured, wait to heal, repeat.  If you want to expand on the strategy, flanking enemies will take away their cover advantage and allow you to easily gun them down.  If you get seriously injured, you fall to the ground, and you can crawl around for about 10 seconds before you die.  In that time, an ally can `rescue you' and you're back on your feet at full health.Weapons:  8/10You can categorize weapons by distance, accuracy, and cover.  All of the rapid fire weapons have a preferred distance where they are most effective vs. other weapons.  Shotguns are close range, Lancers are medium range, Hammerbursts are good at long range because they have a zoom.  The right weapon at the right distance vs an enemy with the wrong weapon will usually get you a kill.Single Shot Weapons reward accuracy.  The Long Shot rifle is a sniper rifle that insta-kills on a head shot.  The Boltok Pistol has a zoom, and is also good at head shots.  The torque bow is a slow winding mechanical bow that fires a single arrow with an explosive head.Other weapons are great at making the enemy move out of cover.  Grenades explode, Incendiary Grenades leave an area of fire, Ink Grenades leave a toxic cloud, the Digger fires an explosive grenade that burrows underground...  If you can make your enemy move, you can either get a clear shot at him, or advance on his position and flank him.The weapon selection is very straightforward and easy to understand.  If you have the right weapon in the right situation, it's almost like rock, paper, scissors.Melee attacks are a bit clunky because the characters' turning radius is quite slow.  The exception is the Retro-Lancer, which allows you to perform a bayonet charge in a straight line.  The Lancer and Retro Lancers can insta-kill.  Grenades can also be stuck to a wall which will detonate when an enemy comes in range, or Grenades can be stuck directly to an enemy... and they explode.The Meat Shield is still in the game, too.Levels:  8/10The levels are fairly straightforward and consist of an arena with some cover areas and enemies typically coming from one or two sides.  You and your friends or AI's, engage them.  The levels look beautiful and they're exciting as parts of them explode during the battle.  Gears 3 does an excellent job at making you feel like you are in a war.  A few of the encounters of Gears 2 were more exciting than anything that Gears 3 had, but for the most part, Gears 3 delivers.As I was playing the levels, I had a few problems with them:- My AI buddies were too powerful.  It seemed like they'd kill 30% of the bad guys before I figured out where they were coming from, found a good cover spot, and equipped the right weapon.- Melee attacks killing me through walls from a sub-boss.  One particular enemy has a very long tentacle attack that just passes through level geometry, so you just have to blast him from a distance.- Poor Timing.  When I was injured and got \"Downed\" I was often the victim of bad timing.  I would get knocked to the ground by a lambent blast, an AI would help me up, as soon as I got to my feet, I would get knocked down by another lambent blast, an AI would help me, as soon as I got to my feet, I would get knocked down by another lambent blast, an AI would help me, as soon as I got to my feet, the encounter was over.-  The AI's don't really try to flank you and take full advantage of the encounter's cover.  They basically just hang back, duck, and shoot.  I think Gears would have been much better if there was squad AI on the harder difficulty settings, where they actually did flank, and drive you back.Multiplayer:  9/10Gears 3 has a ton of Cooperative Modes and Versus Modes.The Campaign is now playable with you and 3 friends.There's Horde Mode, where you fight against waves of enemies.There's a Beast Mode, where you and some friends play as the locusts (tickers, grunts, beast riders, boomers, etc...) and try to kill a squad of humans in a time limit.  You get more time during the battle by killing them or destroying their defenses and bonus time at the end of each round.  When you complete the 12 rounds, you win.There are a plethora of Versus Modes that are all pretty fun.  Each match lasts 2-10 minutes and you can join in, play, earn XP, and leave at the end.  Because the games are short, fun, and rewarding, it gets pretty addictive.There's Team Death Match, where each side gets a pool of respawns and you battle it out.  However, if the teams aren't balanced, this is NO FUN.  The last time I played, we got a Level 1 Noob, on our team that got NO KILLS and used up almost all of our Spawn Pool.  Unfortunately, all it takes is one bad player to ruin this.  If the Teams are somewhat equal, then you'll have a great time.There's Team Death Match, where everyone gets 1 life.  When you're dead, you stay dead until the next round.There's an assassination game called Wingman, where you hunt down and kill enemy players.  The first two man team to 15 kills wins.  This mode encourages aggression and team work.There's a game called King of the Hill where a ring spawns randomly on the map.  The first team to touch it, gains points for every second they hold it.  The opposing team must kill them and move into the ring to take it over.  After a specific amount of points are earned, the ring respawns in another part of the map.  This mode really encourages team work and good defense.There's definitely enough modes here to keep you busy.And when you play any mode, you gain XP, go up levels, and unlock new character skins.  Your level shows up on all of the stat screens too, so it is a good indicator of who has skills.Graphics:  10/10Graphically, Gears feels like it squeezes as much power as it can out of your Xbox.  The game looks fantastic!  There's good variety in the levels, the characters and enemies look great, and the visual effects are outstanding!  There are giant enemies, epic vista shots, and some impressive looking levels.Sound:  10/10The music sets the atmosphere and the combat effects punctuate the action!  If you're playing Gears 3 right, your neighbors will complain about the noise.Replay Value:  8/10Gears offers an 8-10 hour Campaign with 4 difficulty levels, and a ton of Cooperative and Versus Modes.  But because the game mostly revolves around cover and shoot in arenas, there isn't a great deal of depth to the combat.  The game starts to feel stale after a while.  You can only cover, shoot, shotgun, so many times before you are ready to move onto the next game.Maturity:  Older TeensSwearing, War Violence, Gore, and you Chainsaw guys to death.  There is a maturity filter that tones down the violence and gets rid of the language, but this game will never be suitable for all ages.Overall:  8.5/10This is definitely a very good action game and the most complete Gears game.  The atmosphere is crazy-over-the-top and the structured gameplay makes it very easy to learn.  The multiplayer modes will also keep you busy for days.  Unfortunately, the gameplay never really breaks out of the cover-shoot-flank pattern and it does start to feel stale after a while.Buy it if you love the Gears series and you want more.  This one has the most to offer.Buy it if you like very polished levels with over the top action.Buy it if you love great graphics and the sounds of battle!Buy it if you will take advantage of multiplayer!Rent it if you have about 8-9 hours to complete the campaign and you aren't interested in multiplayer.Avoid it if you want a breakout game that turns the Gears Universe on its head.  This game is more of the same...  Better... but more of the same.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2011"}

Although Civilization loses some of its depth, games go much faster, which is especially nice if doing multi player.  The lack of customization options like the ability to turn off the annoying animations that frequently pop up during play was the biggest drawback.

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"A Great Game Living in the Shadow of Skyrim","reviewText":"I kind of hate giving this game 4 stars, because I did have a lot of fun with it in my 100 hours or so play-through. However, I just feel like too much of it was busy work. The world is absolutely huge, but it's separated into sections, each one having new quests and some sort of hub-city. The problem is that almost every new quest you get is some sort of uninteresting fetch quest. The only reason I completed so many of them is because of my slight OCD completionism when it comes to video games. Also, each new area while it has different color pallets, they are all very similar.With the main gameplay, the fighting, it is relatively fun and deep in the beginning, but by half-way through and especially the end, it will just feel like a chore. I only died once in the game, and that was due to an apparently malfunctioning trap that took out my 2,000 or so health in a few seconds when I wasn't paying enough attention. The only challenge is when you have a bunch of the larger types of enemies surrounding you, as their actions cannot be halted by any attack, while every attack they do sends you flying. Related to this, it is incredibly annoying how every little attack against you completely halts your action, even when you're in the middle of a high XP attack and some tiny monster strikes you from behind. This can be slightly halted by some of the abilities, but you still have to worry about being interrupted while you're activating the ability. I really wish that there was another set of actions that you could set up in the right bumper, instead of it being taken up by the sneak ability which I almost never used (and could have been placed on one of the analog stick buttons). Since you can only have 4 abilities available at a time, I had many that I couldn't use. Because of this I really just had a go to set of moves to deal with every enemy. Also, they try to say that you can be anything you want, but if you want the best abilities you really have to focus only on being a Warrior, Mage, or Rogue. I would have tried to experiment later, but it was halted when I hit the level cap relatively early, and that made my last hours with the game really a chore, as I didn't have the positive reinforcement of leveling up.With the crafting, parts of it is really well done. However, it was frustrating when many times you couldn't get some of the parts that you wanted to have to make the best weapons and armor. Related to this, you arbitrarily get access to a main type of material either attached to your space in the story or your level, and it really makes any previous armor or weapon useless. Also, all of the unique armor and weapons are useless, and always weaker than what you can create. I wish that they would have let you dismantle them, and rebuild them to make the special items as powerful as the ones you can create. One more thing about the crafting, I liked how all of the items could be dismantled into parts, but it was very strange where even if you've maxed out your Smithing, the number of parts you get from the item is completely random. I probably lost a lot of useful parts, and there were multiple times where I'd have to save right before I dismantled them and then reload to get the next important main building block. It was really just frustrating, and didn't make any sense.For the story, this is where the game completely fails. I was hopeful after I saw one of my favorite authors R.A. Salvatore was helping craft the world or the story, but all of my hopes were smashed. The story doesn't make any sense, and it isn't suspenseful at all. Thankfully I didn't get attached to any of the characters, because many of them would just be randomly killed. I could sum up the story with this: You wake up after being killed by the end boss and you are stricken with amnesia with the new ability of changing everyone's fate, you travel around the country getting stronger while doing random jobs, in the end you attack the dark fae (or whatever they're called) and go to the leader's home and kill him, then you kill the god he was trying to raise, the end. It's extremely basic, with random plot twists that I didn't care about at all. None of the missions really had much of a separate story. However, some of the group missions were better than all of the other ones. Also, the two best sets of missions were the DLC, which is kind of horrible. I actually wish that I would have played the DLC earlier, as it's the best part of the game, and might have kept me going stronger in the main part of the game. Instead, it was too little too late.Overall, this is far from a bad game, there's a lot of excellent parts of it, and I would recommend it, especially if you're looking for a lot of bang for your buck. It's just too bad that the developer went under after releasing the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"D_Strasse \"D_Strasse\"","summary":"Rockmith Improved","reviewText":"Edit 1/2/14:Ughh, tuner while more stable is still pretty messed up for any tuning other than E standard, and that isn't even perfectly fixed.  And I have verified this against 3 tuners and know that my guitar is set up correctly.Edit 12/6/13:Update 1.0.2 is out and that seems to have stabilized the tuner somewhat.  Still isn't perfect but I'm upping my rating because the tuning and tune lock is improved enough to make this huge annoyance that much more bearable.Edit 11/21/13: Game tuner _still_ isn't patched.Newly found pluses & minues:* Ability to focus on a tough section with Riff Repeater without having to leave a song selection is just so awesome.  Can't imagine having to go back to the old Rocksmith way to do this.* Focus on lead or rhythm is too stifling.  What if you want to check out a lead arrangement for an easy song but generally would like to focus on rhythm?  Have to change lead/rhythm path selection entirely instead of choosing a non-highlighted arrangement.  That is a serious pain.Original Review:Caveat:Currently, the in-game tuner appears to tune a quarter step low.  Additionally, there are issues with getting a pitch \"lock\" on the upper strings.  These issues can make getting past the startup screens difficult not to mention having the game sound \"off\" and make each tuning more difficult than it should be.  This game deserves 5 stars, it is mostly a massive improvement over the previous Rocksmith game but these glitches are a killer until they are patched.  Therefore this game is difficult to recommend right now despite my 3 star review.Game beyond the patchable glitches:The original Rocksmith is one of my most favorite \"games\" of the PS3/360 era.  I put more time into that game than any other I have owned - ever.  And while I loved that game it was also a love hate/relationship.  Sometimes the fret board would be hard to decipher, sometimes it felt like certain notes or techniques just wouldn't register.  And sometimes I could mash my way through chords to get a higher score than I deserved.  Finally, loading screens and excessive saving and tuning were a noticeable irritation.Rocksmith 2014 has generally fixed all these issues while dropping it's game pretentions and fully embracing the \"guitar teaching tool\" ethos.  No longer is Rocksmith a Rock Band knock off.  Gone is the career mode and practice, gig, unlock gameplay.  Songs aren't locked and behind arbitrary skill walls with the game focusing on technique, learning songs, and playing with a band.  I do kind of miss the career mode but as a learning tool the \"game\" is better and more focused.  Some improvements:* Fret board is easier to decipher.* Ability to focus on lead or rhythm arrangements.* More skill tutorials* Sessions mode - add instruments and jam in virtual band* Game is more sensitive to your playing.  It's harder to fudge your way through a song forcing you to work harder to improve your playing.* Original DLC is compatible with the new game.* Bass mode is included out of the box.* Original cable is compatible with new game.* Loading screen negligible outside of game startup.* Riff repeater is completely overhauled and much improved.  Now you can hear what the passage sounds like rather than guess before selecting it.  Plus when you done you can drop right back into the song.* Original game content is available as a download for $10, a la Rock Band.All in all this game is very much improved over the previous game and I would love to heartily recommend it but the tuning issues are a borderline deal breaker until they are patched.  I will be sure to update this review as soon as they are.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Dojo Master","summary":"FUN","reviewText":"I was new to Ratchet and Clank so this was my first experience with this series of games, but after having played for a couple of hours, I have to say the following: it's fun.

As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches.

It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort.

This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

I purchased the original GBA last year to take with me on a cross-continental flight.  I had never owned a portable system before.  I bought Golden Sun with it, and played through it over the course of my trip.  The Game was fantastic, and it really impressed me how much game-play could be squeezed out of such a little device.  After the trip, it collected dust, not because the game library didn't have anything to offer, but because the screen was so hard to see.  It is dark, and when dealing with trying to get the proper lighting conditions, glare on the screen can often be very distracting.  The SP with its built in light and re-chargable battery have single handedly renewed my interest in this platform.  I played Wario Land 4 on it, and had a fantastic time.  Yes it is not quite as comfortable to hold as the original, but the pros here far outweigh the cons.  An aspect that almost no reviewers have mentioned is that the buttons have changed... for the better.  The buttons are easier to press, specifically the directional pad. They click easier, and you don't have to press as hard.  The only button placement that is less helpful are those of the L and R shoulder buttons.  They are smaller and less easy to access, but don't let this discourage you.  The light and battery and foldable screen and easier D-pad, A and B button pressing are 4 pros. to the one con of more difficult L and R button access.  The extra money is well spent.

{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"The best (but not the last) of the series","reviewText":"Onimusha 3: Demon Siege takes the series to a whole new level of awesomeness. Players once again take control of everyone's favorite demon slaying samurai Samanosuke Akechi... and he's got some help from a very unexpected ally. After watching the beautiful and supremely epic opening cutscene where Samanosuke kills a bunch of demons (now being referred to as genma) and destroys a freakishly large living, demonic tank, he challenges the infamous Nobunaga Oda. The king of the genma has become more powerful than ever and is about to put an end to Samanosuke when a time portal opens up and sends the samurai to France in the year 2004. Crazy huh? After that, a french soldier by the name of Jacques Blanc is then transported to Samanosuke's time in the feudal era (10 days before Samanosuke battled Nobunaga). The genma have also crossed over to Jacques's time, so the two warriors have to battle the monsters and defeat Nobunaga in order to return to their own times. The story is obviously much more outlandish this time around, but it still works in a very entertaining way. It even affects the gameplay. Samanosuke and Jacques are aided by a fairy-like being named Ako who floats around the player character's shoulders (like Navi the fairy in the Zelda games) and shows which enemy you're locked onto. She can also fly to certain treasure boxes that are out of the player character's reach and bring them their contents, usually health items or arrows for Samanosuke's bow. But more importantly, through certain time warp devices, the player can send Ako back and forth between the two time periods and allow her to help Samanosuke and Jacques trade items with each other, which is actually necessary in order to solve many of the game's even more in depth and challenging puzzles. Whichever character Ako is currently with is the one the player controls. Samanosuke and Jacques are the two chief characters and both wield the same Oni power with their own special gauntlets and magically imbued elemental weapons. Jacques' weapons are more unique: a whip, sword, spear, and mace that are extendable, allowing him to attack enemies from further away than a regular blade, as well as bind them and then either throw or attack them with magic.The player will also occasionally control Jacques's fellow soldier and fiance Michelle Aubert, who uses modern day firearms and grenades to kick genma butt, but her lack of magic and strong stopping attacks make her scenarios a little less enjoyable than the other main characters'. A mini-game that you unlock after the game's completion called The Adventures of Heihachi lets you play as Heihachi Honda, a samurai wielding a genma spear that you encounter in the main game twice as a boss encounter. The mini-game shows his point of view in the main story and is a little extra dose of demon slaying fun. All the characters have their own strengths and weaknesses, making the combat very enjoyable and not too repetitive. The controls themselves have changed little since the previous games, only now you can move the characters with the analog stick as well as the D-pad. The camera still shows the characters from fixed positions (although it does move along with them every now and then) and since the environments are now full 3D and more open, this makes moving the characters with the analog stick a bit of an awkward chore, at least for me. I personally prefer the D-pad. Like I previously mentioned, the background environments are now full 3D instead of static 2D, which looked fine in the previous games, but were a little less cohesive with the characters. You'll notice I've said nothing negative about this game and that's because I can't think of anything negative about it. The graphics are still great, the controls are still tight and responsive, the combat is more varied, the enemies are more challenging, and the story is more innovative. The game is also not as incredibly short as the first two, running at about 10 to 11 hours. Onimusha 3: Demon Siege will keep you hooked from its epic beginning to its memorable end.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

And to be honest, this review is only based on three hours into the game, but based on heuristics, I've already made up my mind.  I am bored stiff.  I don't mind the long cutscenes as I was expecting it, but the gameplay is so slow. The gunplay is really outdated and the enemy AI is non-existent. Does the rest of the game deviate from this?  I assume, rightly or wrongly, that it does not.  I know it's a tactical espionage game and I've played 2 of the older metal gear games before, but wow, something about having an oil drum and cardboard box in your inventory just doesn't seem right anymore.  That was the same formula used in the first metal gear.  They're going for such realism with their overdrawn cutscenes and yet they fail to update their gameplay to match.  I've read reviews saying this is the reason for owning a PS3 which imo is furthest from the truth.

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation.

This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait.

I have spent almost as much time in this game as oblivion. the comparisons to GTA are inevitable when it comes to saints row, but i dont feel like they're ripping them off. they took the good ideas and moved them to the next level. to hold a lack of originality against this game would be completely insane. you might as well cast out every FPS for the last 10 years. now THOSE games are clones.Graphics - some pop up occurs when you're driving fast, but other than that Saints Row has a smooth framerate with nice textures and lighting effects. not the best looking game on the box, but it deffinitely doesnt look out of place.Gameplay - WAY better than any GTA ive played. ive grown so tired of that nearly broken auto-targeting of GTA. Saints Row decided to go in an fps direction. the game plays almost exactly like an fps with the aiming reticle in the center of the screen and all that but in a 3rd person view. all the cars handle well. everything in this game works very well.Story - meh... its decent, but the characters dont have that same draw as many gta characters and the stories surrounding them. there is a major plot twist toward the end, but you'll have to play through it to find out. basically there's 3 gangs, one ruling each part of the city, and its up to you and the Third Street Saints to clean up the town.Sound - GREAT soundtrack. classical, 80's hair metal, techno, rap, rock, and a little pop punk all thrown in the mix. its also really cool how your character has an MP3 player you can store songs on you buy in the in-game music store. its kind of pointless b/c if you want to listen to music the whole time you play you could just use whatever you have saved on the system.there's so much to do between missions other than killing hundreds of pedestrians. side missions include: saving ho's from mean pimps, driving one around while she does business in the back, racing, demolition derby, causing mass chaos, stealing certain cars and delivering them, kill certain people from a hit list, and others i cant remember right now.theres tons of stores to visit as well. Clothing stores have hats, shoes, belts, pants, shirts, coats, ect. you can get tattoos and the tattoo parlors. you can get piercings and bling at the jewelry shops. of course you can buy guns and such at the gun stores. theres liquer stores scattered through the city (you can get weed there too!). theres a few barber shops and plastic surgery centers. theres a couple car dealerships around too.another thing that needs to be mentioned is the character customization. you can choose from black, white, hispanic, or asian to start things off, and from there you adjust everything from their weight to the distance between their eyes and the style of hair.i was disappointed in the lack of aircraft. thats my only complaint about the entire game, and a very minor one.if you like the open world genre at all, and you havent played Saints Row yet, you need to right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"mark twain","summary":"it's pretty good","reviewText":"It hasn't revolutionized anything as reviews would have you believe.  It's another GTA game, albeit prettier than ever.  I've preordered every GTA since GTA III and the only one I really liked was Vice City but this one would come in second.  The music is a lot better than GTA IV and that is a big bonus for me, as one reason I really couldn't get into IV was the radio stations full of music I'd never heard of (and didn't want to hear).  The music is real good but instead of 15-30 songs each station seems to have about 6, so you'll be hearing them over and over.  Just like every GTA and Rockstar game, the controls still are not very good and mostly clunky.  You'll also be frustrated when you are deep into a mission and the guy you shot 22 times somehow is still alive on the ground and takes you out.  Probably the best and worst part is the biting sarcasm that has to go into everything in the GTA world.  You'd better agree that Microsoft's Cloud for the Xbox One is nothing but BS, and you'd better agree that the unrestricted illegal immigration of millions is A-Ok with no possible negative outcomes, because Rockstar is going to make sure that you think you're stupid for not agreeing with them and they're happy to brainwash all the people who have no opinion about these things.  Along with this is the regrettable characterization of everyone in the game: if you are a woman, black, white, hispanic, etc.  you all fall into your designated zone of what you are and what you represent and that's very unfortunate.  But if you just take GTA V as the video game that it is (the heists are probably the best part of the game), it's pretty good and worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Not a solo experience, but a shared one","reviewText":"The obvious thing to state is that you shouldn't play this game alone. By yourself, this will not feel very engaging, and will certainly not please die-hard R&C; fans. After all, this isn't your average R&C; release. So if you have no friends to play this game with, then you should probably skip it altogether. The writing is great and there are some fresh mechanics which this franchise was beginning to need, but it just isn't a wonderful experience unless you're sharing it with other people.But if you DO have at least 1 friend to join you then I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. The designers did a fantastic job of making this a hilarious and addictive experience when it can be had with other people. There are a multitude of ways to play through each stage in an attempt to come out as the top player, teamwork is also a requirement though. And not many multiplayer games of this nature pull both of those things off in any way that is constructive enough to make for a good experience. But this one succeeds. Some players will want to kill everything that moves, others will want to solve every puzzle. You could collect the most bolts, purchase the most weapons, have the strongest weapons, save other characters from dying, be out to collect the most creatures, and on and on and on. This is as varied as a multiplayer experience can get. The added run mechanic is great, and will make you the top player if used appropriately. Many of the older mechanics (such as gravity boot walks, rail sliding, ziplines, and such) are still used as heavily as ever they were. And battle is still the same strafing beast which it's always been. Fans of the series will feel at home with all of this.As far as drawbacks are concerned, it's worth mentioning the game's biggest flaw: weapon changing. The system they give you is the system present in all of the other games. You hit triangle, then move to the desired weapon. Sounds great until you realize that 4 players attempting to do this at once just creates a nightmare on screen. Add to it the fact that you'll have THREE pages to cycle through and (unless all 4 players change weapons at the same time) the gameplay does not pause while you're changing weapons the way you're used to with the other games, and you will quickly begin to hate this mechanic. You'll find yourself wishing that you could cycle weapons using the left and right arrows on the D-pad instead. This is one case in which trying to appeal to long-time fans has cost the game a lot in functionality. And that is this game's biggest flaw.There are a few others as well, but they don't do much to hurt the experience. Nonetheless, let's cover what I've seen. Even without the weapon changing issue, it can still be hard to track yourself on the screen at times; especially in busy battles. The game gives you a vacuum mechanic that ends up being overused by everyone, because it breaks boxes and sucks up bolts. Had it only sucked up creatures and functioned as the occasional tool it's meant to be, then I'd have no problem with it. But it's the quickest way to grab bolts, so almost no one will be breaking boxes with their ratchet-like tools. Instead prepare for vacuum overload. I could complain about the camera not splitting to allow you to venture into places your teammates don't seem interested in, but it's also nice to not have a screen splitting into confusing pieces just to come back together or being panned so far out that you can't tell what's what anymore. The grappling mechanic is another thing which has its pros and its cons. Most of your laughs in the game will come from the grapple, even if everyone's dying because of it.This game is not ground breaking. It's a quirky little multiplayer experience; geared more for fun and laughs than for the ultra-refined platforming you may be used to if you've played any other Ratchet & Clank games. If you can accept that and play the game for what it is, then I think you'll find it highly enjoyable in most places. If nothing else, you finally get to play as Qwark and Nefarious. And if hearing Qwark deliver his ammo dialogue line doesn't continue to bring a smile to your face 10+ hours into the game, then I'm not sure there's any pleasing you to begin with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well.

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch.

There's no bad Mario game that Nintendo has ever created! But have you ever noticed that other than Super Mario 64 DS (Which is a remake), there's no original 3D main Mario game on a portable system? Well, now that Super Mario 3D Land has arrived, I can easily say that this is the best 3DS game by far.Don't let the videos fool you. The game is incredibly fun, like any other Mario game. While the environments aren't as wide to roam around as games like Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine, they still triumph in level design and enemy/obstacle variety (Goombas on top of each other, floors that flip when jumping, etc). The game also feels a bit like a combination of New Super Mario Bros, Mario 3, and Mario 64.The power-ups are also very handy. The Tanooki Suit, while you can't fly anymore (Sad face...), you can still flutter and whack enemies with your tail, making for some very fun platforming moments. The Boomerang Suit and Propeller Suit also adds to the fun, as you can hit enemies with boomerangs and be able to fly upward for a bit, respectively.The graphics are extremely colorful and crisp. The 3D makes it look all the more better. The music is not unlike the other Mario games, yet some tunes are all-new and manage to fit well with the existing ones!At first, the game would seem fairly short, as it appears to be only 8 Worlds long with about 5 levels in each. Fortunately, it turns out that there's much more to it. You would actually have to go find Star Medals (Which are somewhat like Yoshi Coins in Super Mario World) in order to unlock certain levels (50 Star Medals for World 5's castle level). Furthermore, special levels are unlocked once beating the 8 worlds. It's surprisingly long when you want to do everything.But overall, this is a very awesome game, and it is definitely up there with the other greats Mario has to offer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Sun Jian \"Tiger of Jiang Dong\"","summary":"Haven't been able to put it down since I got it","reviewText":"It's been years, probably over a decade since I've last been this excited about buying a new console. My first hand-held gaming console was the SEGA Gamegear, which I still own and still works! I've owned most incarnations of the Gameboy but I never bought a PSP because I was just too poor when it came out and kind of forgot about it later on. When I saw the Vita on the PSN unveiling I couldn't believe how far hand-held gaming has come. The graphics on this thing are sick, it makes the Nintendo 3-DS look like it's 10 years old already. There is so much potential for developers of Vita games, with a six-axis rotation, back and front touchpads, two cameras, and dual analog sticks the possibilities are damn near endless. The whole experience feels very interactive which is a great change since gaming has gotten a little stale in the past few years.I bought the Vita with three games, Wipeout 2048, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, and Dynasty Warriors NEXT. I kind of expected the release day titles to be crap, since that's what usually happens, but they're actually amazing! All three games offer unique play styles and incorporate the new Vita controls in their own way. My family probably thought I looked ridiculous when I was tapping the screen like a lunatic while dueling in Dynasty Warriors, but I was loving every second of it. Sure the games can use a little polish, especially with some of the new controls but that will just take time. I've been slacking off at work and using every opportunity to play on my Vita and I honestly feel like I'm a kid again.Set up was a breeze, connecting it to the WiFi is simple, buying stuff off the PS Store is fast and easy and so far I haven't had a single error or problem with my device. The battery life seems fine so far and the power saving options are actually really good. The screen is gorgeous and the layout of the Vita is practical and ergonomic, I was expecting heavy cramps since I have really big hands, but I'm fine so far. My right hand does get a bit painful when playing Wipeout, but that's probably because racing games make me quite tense and I tend to squeeze the buttons just a wee bit too hard. The Vita is incredibly light for its size and even fits in the front pockets of my slacks.Once Sony adds the Playstation One classics to the Vita Operating System I will be a very happy camper. Hell I'll probably stop using my PS3 since the Vita is so much more comfortable and I can take it anywhere. If you're looking to buy a Vita but you're not entirely sure yet, maybe it's best to wait a bit when there are more games and peripherals available. Still, I'd recommend it to anyone who has the money to waste on gadgets, it's way more fun than anything you can play on the iPad or Android and it blows the 3-DS out of the water as far as I'm concerned. Definitely worth the money I spent!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Poshu Oshu","summary":"fun gameplay, poor execution","reviewText":"having played the x-men legends games and the first ultimate alliance i gotta admit i don't know what to think about this game. the levels are well done and much more fun with replay than the earlier games. the story is pretty well done. i really like the change to most people's power sets it's a great streamline and the interface is much more freindly this time around.however, this game needs more polish, it coulda really beneifited from a few more months in the oven. you have 4 powers with each character instead of the 6 or so you had before and no more ultimate attacks. which mean all your characters are going to play pretty much exactly the same as everyone elses. i liked that depending on how you specked him, hawkeye had two very distinct play styles in ultimate alliance 1. now everyone has one path to follow. though they brought back character atributes instead of costume bonuses which to me is a big plus. however the alternate costumes (one per character) are pretty lame. aside from thor we never really use anyone's alternate.the other thing that becomes painfully evident after a short time playing is that the new developers know relativley little about comic books. storm has no unique dialogue with black panther(her husband), and the character roster is composed almost entirely of people they thought would be \"cool\" to throw in rather than apropriate. gambit got chunked in due to that awful movie and he's always sucked in these games they have never done him in a way that really makes him usable. jean grey? dead, dead for a long long long long time. they have your basic players here, the fantastic four, the avengers, but aside from the major characters the roster is pretty weak. when faces with an oportunity to throw some fresh faces into the game they used none. the young avengers played a major role in civil war, and we get patriot involved in a few cut scenes and one boss battle. the thunderbolts consisted of the majority of the pro-registration soldiers and we have 3 of them to use in the last 2 levels.the storyline here is ok, but they lost all the nuiances of civil war, rather than trying to make it anykind of a grey area or put some positive spin on registration they basically boil it down to obeying the law or doing what's right. which is a shame.also the trick to this game is that once you've completed it, you can replay on legendary difficulty, but with the level cap firmly lodged at 60 you will always be underpowered in this game. in ultimate alliance 1 my characters became strong enough where my friend and i ran the whole game with just 2 characters. in this one having beat it three times i still occasionally have my whole team wiped out for no reason.the fusions are a fun little addition but after the initial \"aww cool\" wears off, most of them are pretty generic and not that great. the ultimate attacks were a better system in all honesty, more than once have i found myself with only one character left in my team and no way to revive the others because i need 2 people to do a fusion attack.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G47U","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Silent Hill is Back... With Some Slight Flaws...","reviewText":"If you like the Silent Hill series, you've probably played Silent Hill 2.  Silent Hill 2 is one of my favorite games of all time and has one of my favorite game stories of all time.  It's dark, creepy, and a multi-layered story unfolds as you play, giving you a memorable ending based on what you did.  The combat always put you at a disadvantage and the enemies and world were all manifestations of your character's guilt.  The series has had some ups and downs and many of the games missed the entire point of Silent Hill.  Many of the games are just creepy games with weird enemies and bad combat.  Silent Hill Downpour is a solid return to its roots.Concept:  9/10A return to Silent Hill with an escaped convict who brutally murders someone in prison.  The story unfolds and explains why \"Murphy Pendleton\" did what he did.  There are some areas that are open ended and you must wander through darkened streets as vile creatures emerge from the fog.  There are optional side quests and multiple endings based on your morality choices.Story:  8/10With the help of a corrupt prison guard, Murphy Pendleton, a criminal with a fairly clean record and no criminal history, brutally murders another prisoner in the showers.  This prisoner finds himself in Silent Hill, a dark world of violence, and sudden storms which bring out vile creatures.  As Murphy progresses through the story, questions are answered and those answers are disturbing at times.  There are multiple endings based on simple YES/NO morality choices made through the adventure.Graphics:  7/10The game is definitely scary and the graphics provide a dark and creepy atmosphere.  Murphy carries a flashlight and the dynamic lighting casts eerie shadows.  The characters and enemies look pretty good, but not great.Gameplay:  7/10Silent Hill Downpour consists of Exploration, Side Quests, Combat, the Otherworld, and Bosses.Murphy wanders through Silent Hill and finds clues to the story, keys, and useful tools to open doors and get past barriers.  At times, the game feels like a terrible scavenger hunt in a very dirty haunted house where you wander aimlessly.  In the Options Screen, you can set the game to highlight important objects.  Health Packs, Keys, Weapons, and Ammo will shine in the dark.  This is VERY HELPFUL!As Murphy wanders the desolate streets of Silent Hill, there are some houses with their lights on.  These houses contain puzzles and/or side quests.  Some of the quests are simple and others are multi-staged and require combat.  The puzzles all make you think and they're memorable, but none of them are too frustrating.  Some of the Side Quests are confusing and cannot be completed until much later in the game.The combat is simple because this is a horror game.  If the combat were complex, it would be an action game, right?  Murphy can pick up an object like a knife, brick, crowbar, shovel, axe, gun...  and use it to bludgeon enemies or throw the weapon at them for some extra damage.  All of the weapons have a durability stat and they do break...  often at the worst of times.  There is a block button, an attack button, and a throw button.  The enemies move around you and attack.  You can block and counter or if you attack, the enemies will counter and you must block.  Some of the enemies have special moves too, so be careful.  There are only a few different types of enemies and they mostly reflect Murphy's past actions.  For example:  One enemy is a psychotic convict with a mechanism on his head to stretch his eyes and mouth.  This alludes to the fact that a prisoner may have seen what you did and they're gonna tell.  There is also a giant humanoid bat monster... because...  umm... someone making the game thought it needed giant bat monsters.Some of the game takes place in the Otherworld.  The city will fade away, leaving Murphy in a hellish place, often running from his life from The Void.  The Void is a slow moving invincible ball of pain that damages Murphy.  If Murphy is too slow, he is engulfed by the void.  Speed is the only way to escape.  Unfortunately, Murphy will sometimes have to run through traps and guillotines to escape the void.There are boss battles and they could have been much better.  One is very simple, the other is more like a puzzle / level.  That's it.World:  8/10The world of Silent Hill is incredibly creepy and it reflects Murphy's guilt.  The settings, the enemies, the items, all tie into the story.  Unfortunately, there is some slowdown at times and that hurts.Sound:  10/10The sound effects are creepy and the music sets a grim atmosphere.  Occasionally, something will make you jump.Replay Value:  4/10Aside from different difficulty levels and multiple endings (3 of which you can get from your last save) there isn't much reason to replay the game.  It will take about 12-25 hours to finish the game, depending on how much you get lost and how many side quests that you do.  You cannot Save!  Instead there are autosaves at the last checkpoints and you can load the last 5.  This helps if you find yourself in an unbeatable situation, but for the most part, this game is a one-way trip.Overall:  8/10It's great to see a Silent Hill game with a disturbing story and a creepy atmosphere again.  Every element of the game ties into the story, too.  The game is a bit flawed because there is an awful lot of wandering, some of the side quests are confusing, and the slow down is bothersome.  If you really like dark stories, than this is a game for you.  It's not a Great Game, but it is nice to see the Silent Hill series right its ship.Buy this game (cheap) if you liked Silent Hill 2.Buy this game (cheap) if you like horror.Buy this game (cheap) if you like an engaging story.Rent it if you have 12 hours to blow through it or 25 hours to solve all of the side quests.Avoid this game if you hate being lost or wandering through open areas.Avoid this game if you like sophisticated combat and combos.Avoid this game if you need great graphics.If you liked this game definitely check out Alan Wake, Condemned, or Dead Space 1 or 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K1Y0","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Rough around the edges","reviewText":"The Good: Fantastic graphics, intense combat, many different weapons, memorable and well written loreThe Bad: Weak story, repetitive battles and repeating arenas, can be way too hard, sacrificing gameplay not at its full potential, overall lack of polishSoul Sacrifice is one of those games that looks cool but when you start playing you will be completely lost for a while. The game starts out with you being captured and put into a cage with bones everywhere. A book wakes up and starts talking to you. It's a journal of a mad sorcerer, and he later explains you need to stop this powerful sorcerer, but in the mean time you need to level up, gather strong weapons, and learn about his past. The story never really pans out and it just stretched so thin that you lose track of what's going on. The presentation is interesting with literal storybook pages and an ominous narrator, but I would have liked something more.You basically just select a mission and it will tell you what you're supposed to kill. There are tons of fantastic and memorable lore wrapped around every enemy and battlefield. These stories read out like Grimm's Fairy Tales and I was really hooked and couldn't wait to read the next one. The enemy designs are really neat and unique as well as the bosses. You can customize your character's looks, albeit not by much, and then it's off to equip your weapons. Weapons are arranged in several categories from armor, arm, blood, power, shield, etc. You get weapons why defeating monsters and they are awarded to you. These weapons can be combined with dupes to give you a higher cast count, or they can be fused into new weapons. This is a great idea if the game didn't constantly throw crappy weapons at you. Half way through the game and I was still dying several times per boss because I just couldn't get any powerful weapons. It's like they all did very little damage. Some bosses and enemies are weaker to certain elements and types. Some bosses you can't get up close to at all so you need powerful projectile weapons. If you don't know that going in, you have to restart and re-equip. This trial and error is frustrating and one of Soul Sacrifice's many flaws.If that wasn't enough you are limited by how much you can use each item. You can equip up to six different weapons for each match. Some can be passive for healing, but if you run out of casts you break your weapon and it's gone  forever. You have to use a special vision mode to find hidden regen points for your weapons but they are limited. Several times I ran out of casts for all my weapons and had to restart because I couldn't beat the boss. Thankfully a special sacrifice power allows you to do massive damage but at the cost of sacrificing something. One power lets you burn everything around you but your skin becomes burned and your defense is halved. To get rid of these conditions you need Librom's tears and these are only granted every so often by exiting the book and checking his eye. A neat idea, but frustrating nonetheless.That's the combat and that is the sole focus of the game. It's great and fun at first, but very frustrating and monotonous early on. You just fight the same types of battles over and over again and the same enemies as well. The only thing keeping you going on is to see more of the story. I honestly got tired of the side quests and just stuck with the story to get it over with. Another major part of the game is leveling up your health or magic. You can sacrifice or save enemies after they fall by holding L or R. This is a unique idea, but you can be stunned and killed while doing this. Your team mate can fall and you have to resurrect them or sacrifice them for a boost. Once you do this you need Librom's tears to bring them back. They can revive you thankfully, but many times they died right when I did or vice versa. There's also online co-op to solve this issue which really helps, but most people aren't going to do this.As it is, Soul Sacrifice suffers from constant repetition and a lack of polish. Not having powerful enough weapons, lackluster customization features, and a weak story kind of hurt this game. The graphics are fantastic, but that isn't what makes a game good. I was hoping for more variety and more of a cinematic story, not a menu driven battle selector. If this game had more variety and something else besides killing the same enemies forever it would have been one of the Vita's best games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Very high replay value","reviewText":"What I love most about this game is the replay value. After doing various tasks (like finishing the game under 5 hours or on whatever difficulty or shooting the bsaa medals or upgrading weapons to max), you are treated to various goodies. These vary from new costumes to new weapons to unlimited ammo and more. I love it when a game allows me to go back and have fun with it after beating it and fun I did have. I also love that you can shoot various body parts that cause the enemies to react convincingly (like shooting a running zombie in the leg causing them to trip and fall).The controls are outdated and awkward though. Turning around takes forever (though there is a quick 180 degree turn around feature) and there is no dodge button (except in boss fights). You also cannot move while aiming which is just stupid. All this can be a real pain but you do eventually get use to it.This game was a blast to play (and replay) and it's not very scary (thankfully) nor is it very difficult. If you like 3rd person shooters then this would be an excellent addition to your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2010"}

You're a schoolboy taking on the stereotypical cliques.It's pretty clear why you're a depressed teenage boy when the game starts. Apparently your dad has died, and your mom has remarried an elderly, grumpy old man who wants you out of the picture. Your mom is more than happy to dump you off at a stay-all-year school while she goes off with Mr. Moneybucks.On top of that, the school officials are pretty nasty to you right from the start. Hogwarts this is not! Then as you go into the run-down dorm, other kids start beating up on you! It's time for you to stand up for yourself and make a stand.There are various groups of kids in this school - the nerds, the jocks, the greasers and the preppies. Activities you do raise or lower your respect level with each group. You have to go to class too - and be there on time! If you're able to manage your schedule properly, you can participate in some pretty fun mini-games (the word scramble can be challenging!) to earn you new skills.There are girls to court, and usually they want a specific item. So you have numerous quests to go on. The bully activities range from escorting a nerd safely to his locker, to running races and protecting yourself from attacks. You get clothing along the way, and can customize your look (within school regulations, of course).It's a bit depressing, sometimes, to see how these mid-teen guys treat each other, but this does actually happen in many schools. I'm sure pretty much every person who was once a teen can name the cliques that existed in their school.The graphics are rather good for a PS2, and the sounds, while again a bit depressing for a teen environment, work well with the game too. On one hand I can not really like the swearing in the game, but certain teens do in fact swear far worse than this game does!I'd even say this is more like Fable than other Grand Theft Autos, with some of the ways that you can choose how you react in situations.This game won't be enjoyed by people who are squeamish about violence - it does, after all, involve teen guys all bashing each other for very inane reasons. It also involves a lot of bullying - as you might imagine. Still, if you can deal with those issues, you'll find a really involving game that might actually make you think about how to treat others well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2006"}

However, this particular game isn't the winning racer for me.  The variety of luxurious cars was pretty good, however it was the game play that really bombed.  The hits cars take from each other was a little bit too \"weak\" and unrealistic.  When a car bumps into another it wipes out very quickly, which seems unrealistic again (unless someone can verify that realism by driving over 170 mph on the streets).I wasn't impressed much, the online game play against other races wasn't too bad and might be worth added to how the graphics are to score some pointers for the game, but it just wasn't all that.  One thing that would be great is if the cars were customizable.  But in this game, what car you buy is what you get, nothing to customize.  Even a Grand Turismo (best racing simulator in my opinion) you can customize some aspects of the car, but not in PGR 3.This game wasn't a seller, so I traded it back to get Need for Speed Most Wanted, which I must say would be much more my type of racing game.

Poorly put together!","reviewText":"Let me start of by saying that all ratchet and clank games are a 5 out of 5!But this collection is lacking. The company \"Idol minds\" who put these 3 ratchet and clank games together did a poor job. There is frequent lag and some different, or completely missing details in the games. I will start off with \"Ratchet and Clank Going Commando\" since it is the game I am the most familiar with on the PS2.Going Commando will occasionally lag especially when there are multiple explosions at once, the original PS2 version never lagged for me no matter how many explosions were going on at once. But the lag doesn't happen too often.The original version had very few glitches, this version will glitch occasionally. A few times the camera will get stuck under the floor or in front of the character making it impossible to see what you need to see, and then you will need to completely stop the game and go back to the PS3 home menu before going back to normal gameplay.  The trash cans in one level will often dissapear when you hit them instead of breaking and falling over. One time the mini gun menu dissapeared and didn't come back until I restarted the whole game. But enough about lags and glitches, lets move on to the parts of the game that they removed!! On one planet there is a missle yard and there are tourists. The leader robot takes them on a tour. In the original game the robot would actually talk about each missle, however, in this collection the robot says nothing!!!! he just keeps moving.Now onto the other two games that I am less familiar with.Ratchet and Clank lags very often from explosions... try to remember that the whole point of this game is to blow stuff up! Every single time you use the missle launcher it lags!! This is hard for me to comprehend since the PS3 can easily handle a PS2 game... Darn you Idol Minds!I have played Up Your Arsenal the least, but the spaceship sounds on the loading screen aren't even synced properly!!Overall, I am not discouraging you from buying this collection, just be warned that it comes short of the greatness of the original PS2 versions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}

The game communicates the spirit of the scene very effectively (action, sorrow, tension). It was an interesting murder mystery story laid out in a game, where there are some significant variations based either on choices you make, or on (d'oh) how well you press timed sequences of controller buttons. One way or another you do end up shuffling along towards the conclusion. In a respect, the button-mashing frenzy is annoying and tough to pull off, and leads you to outcomes you may not really be interested in. However, overall, as stated, it is a great game and lots of fun. Well worth it.One thing, as a fair warning: definitely not suited for watching or playing by young kids.

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"Loses it's flavor fast...","reviewText":"If you made it through the other reviews you probably heard plenty enough about this game. It's all true, Guildwars is a beautiful game more along the lines of FF12 graphicly. The characters and the environments are well designed, but the game play is the weak point of guild wars.For starters this game is more like an online single player game than an MMO. You of the option of playing with other players but it's not necessary. Most of the time the only reason to be in a guild or to actually need to interact with other players is if you plan on getting involved in pvp. Again it's not at all required in order to beat the game so grouping with other players in combat, joining a guild...it's all up to you.The overall game is pretty much an open world. Take some quest do the task and progress in the story. Pretty much like any RPG game just with a larger enviroment, and the option of chosing real players or ai to fight along side with. There are basic henchmen that will be given to you and some that play a larger role. Some have well developed back stories and some have pretty shallow ones (unfortunately Eve as featured on the box art is one of them).The game with its concept of being non MMO like doesn't force you to grind for armor or weapons. They are pretty much rewarded to you for completing the game and aren't that much different from your base weapons. The problem with this is that while looking special your really just the same as everyone else. It's a good way to balance out the game for pvp reasons but it doesn't give you anything to work hard for and brag about since everyone pretty much has the same thing. Which can be either good or bad personally I'm not into grinding harder than needed so for me it wasn't a bother.What's unusual about this game is that you don't grind for armor or weapons but instead you grind for skills. Everything is based around skills and putting together the right set. You can only use 8 skilsl at a time and you may have 30+ skills to select from per class. Mostly this part of the game I can do without as it takes the fun out of fighting the way you want to. It's done to make pvp enteresting but really it takes away from it. Some people like this...I however just could not get into it at all. It was a real turnoff for me as most players figured out skill sets that dominate over others it can be difficult to overcome pvp opponents.All these elements of Guildwars are mixed in over a story format that is semi interesting. It gives you something to keep you going, but not exactly interested enough to see what happens next. Btw you will have to complete these stories to open map areas for new characters that you create which can be fun if you like playing the same game over and over again but, if your like me once is enough.Overall Guildwars might as well be a single player console game with online co-op play, but it's a computer based game that pretty much serves the same function. It's not an MMO and it behaves nothing like one. It's not a bad game, not a great game, but it's a decent game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"For once, a game that lives up to it's hype.","reviewText":"I avoided writing a 5 star review of this game 6 months before it came out, and considering the bulk of reviews here, it was a smart move. \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\" is an excellent game, a worthy follow-up to part 3. Though the graphics and control are almost identical to GTA3, the game has a totally different feel to it. Players who played GTA3 to death will notice this right away.Vice City is a totally different setting, with sun, sand, palm trees, with girls in bikinis walking the streets. Size wise, it is about twice the size of all of Liberty City put together, with more back alleys, shops, slums, and most noticeably, more diverse pedestrians. The same freedom of movement in GTA3 is found here, but in order to give players an incentive to do the missions, certain actions are restricted until they are \"unlocked\" by missions. Certain weapons cannot be attained, some properties cannot be purchased, and so on. And similar to GTA3, sections of Vice City are closed off from the beginning, and can only be unlocked by completing X amount of missions.GTAVC is, like the installment before it, a story-driven crime simulator. But the story here is much deeper and more complex. The main character, Tommy, has a personality and a voice, unlike the mute killer from GTA3. The missions themselves are a lot more complex, and require more skill and timing. From the beginning, you know that you are doing more than courier missions.  But between missions, it's your ball game. The game has 32 weapons at your disposal, but the system for carrying them is \"class-based\", which means that you can only hold one weapon of each kind at a time. For example, if you have the chainsaw but also want the Kitana, you must drop the chainsaw in order to pick the kitana up. In total, you can carry up to 10 weapons at a time. This makes things a bit more difficult, and a bit annoying at times when you run out of bullets, but it is a nice twist.The graphics have been tweaked in areas, with better looking cars and more fluid character animation. The music is one of the best parts of GTAVC, with over 9 hours of licensed 80's tunes on 10 different radio stations. Sometimes, I just like to park and listened to music. Another addition I love is the addition of motorcycles, which handle much better than cars, and are much faster. The drawback there is that crashing it means enduring bodily damage. A few lingering problems with GTA3 have also been fixed, including the addition of an in-game map and the locations of the Amu-nation have been added to the on-screen map.Calling GTAVC is retread of it's predecessor is unfair, since the is much more complex and challenging. In GTA3. You made money performing various missions, and moved from island to island, and cause mayhem, that's it. In GTAVC you can shop, rob stores, buy real estate, do the odd jobs (now including pizza delivery) and find the usual hidden packages and rampages. Overall, anyone who liked GTA3 will love GTAVC.

More like an add-on pack for GTA3.But that being said, as I've fully enjoyed GTA3, I've also had a great time playing this game.  The addition of 3 different bikes and 3 different helis (along with a bit more cars) makes cruising through Vice City a fresh experience.  The cops aren't slouches anymore, and you will have a hell of a time trying to outrun a rating above 3 star (without cheating, you h4x0r!).The city itself is alot brighter, with ton of lens flare.  Too much lens flare, to be exact, as I've been blinded many times trying to drive around town, missing turns and running over lanes on a gentle curve quite often.  The fog of limited view, as I call it, makes an annoying return.  I suppose the PS2 isn't powerful enough to squish that little fog.The missions themselves are varied, from protecting one bunch of thugs from another bunch, to driving around creating as much mayhem as possible (yes, that's actually one of your mission).I felt the game was a bit on the short side...for such a game.  Oddly, I didn't find the jumps nor searching for the hidden packages to be any fun, as it was on GTA3.  Perhaps its the 'been there done that' feeling I get.A must own PS2 title, no doubt.  But since the whole game is pretty much a rehash of the ole, I can not give it more then 4 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2002"}

In these parts of the game you can meet and talk (but mostly do favors) for the citizens of NYC or just be a jerk and kill them.- Great voice acting.- Graphics look good (for 2007) and animations are fairly smooth as well.BAD:- Shooting/knocking out lights while unique in the first hour of gameplay or becomes more of a choir and distraction as the game progress.- Some people might find the story of the game disjointed and clich&eacute;.- Some times the Darkness powers don't seem to work the way you want or need in a situation, example The Darkling (your minions) have very simple A.I. and seem almost useless in some situations by not attacking enemies or running head long into bright areas (where they die instantly), and the Darkness Guns which act like traditional guns have no real value next your standard guns, outside of the fact that they have unlimited ammo and no reloading in the dark (also note they have no ammo in the light).- The online gameplay feels tacked on and is glitchly, unless a patch comes out for it I would say stay away from the multiplayer option of this title.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A decent range and Varity of your standard issue First Person Shoot type of guns, with Shotgun, Duel pistols/SMG's and M16 types.- The aiming sight in the game is just a simple red dot, which while it frees up space on your screen a few people might find it difficult to aim with.- The lack of a true or traditional HUD (Heads up Display for health/power meter and such) can make the game confusing and difficult to some.- Being in the light makes your Darkness powers very weak or even not available (in bright light), so you're going to spend lots of time seeking out shadows in order to use your powers and get the most out of this game.- It's not all in the streets of NYC; some parts of the game take place in a dream world that looks like a hell version of World War 1.- This game is for adults or mature gamers as most of the dialog is full of foul words and the content of this game can be pretty gory, for example your dark tentacles eat human hearts (they show them ripping the hearts out of your slain enemies chests and chewing them up, not joking) to gain new power, and also getting close to any enemy with your guns drawn and shooting them up close will make the game go into an animation where you (pretty violently) execute the your enemy (examples are shots fired into an enemies leg followed by a shots to the head).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCIATED TOO:- The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butchers Bay (Xbox & PC)- F.E.A.R. (PC, 360, PS3)- Prey (360)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- A demo of this game is available on Xbox Live Marketplace.- This game is based on the comic book of the same name (the comic and story is similar to Witch Blade comics).- This game was made by Star Breeze Studios, which also made The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butchers Bay.- This game is banned in Singapore and heavily modified in Germany- It is possible to watch the entire film of To Kill a Mocking Bird in this game by watching the in-game television.- Mike Patton of the Rock Band Faith No More did the voice for the Darkness (with little to no help with voice editing).- This game is also on Sony's PS3","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2007"}

It takes you back 100 years ago.BATTLE: No classes for characters, although some are better magic users than others etc...there are harmonixers, who are persona-like users. Boss battles are something that you can't muscle out, you have to think how to beat them, especially last fusion boss for Yuri. I really enjoyed fights.PUZZLES: Great, not too difficult. Made to make you enjoy them.FLAW: Flaw is in game design. Important things are at unimportant locations. Sometimes you have to go out and get back in and then discover something. You have to read FAQ all the times. It is ok (in my opinion) to put bonuses into some god forgotten places, but basing gameplay on this is what made me not give it four stars...This is a continued story from Shadow Hearts one and it would be good to play that first.

While some levels emphasize pure action, others require you to puzzle your way out of the mazes and illusions. If you find the hidden key in Star World, you'll gain access to the extremely challenging Special World, which has its own hidden secrets.Mario and Luigi can jump up and down pipes, climb vines, swim, and toss Koopa shells. Yoshi the dinosaur can spit eggs, munch, and climb with his ever-helpful tongue. Cool touches include spinning platforms, forced-scrolling levels, and great attacks such as the spin jump. Mario and Yoshi fly with the aid of a unique feather, shoot fireballs when equipped with a special flower, and can even raise cute baby Yoshis. Each boss poses a unique challenge. Cross-eyed Lemmy Koopa likes to play hide-and-seek in pipes, while Iggy Koopa prefers to battle on a giant Koopa shell floating on a lava lake.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Polishing a classic","reviewText":"There's pretty much a debate on the best Super Mario game: Super Mario 3, Super Mario World or Yoshi's Island(but you control Yoshi instead). Some might say Mario 64 but the lack of gameplay moves doesn't hold a candle to the many gameplay mechanics each one of the 3 provide. So we delve into one of them: Super Mario World.Story: What little story there is. As usual, Princess Peach gets kidnapped(I swear that b**** needs bodyguards or take up karate or something). So it's up to Mario to save the day as he traverses worlds in caves, the chocolate level, underwater and in the air.Graphics: This is Super Nintendo graphics so granted these aren't stunning anymore. But it does have a nice vibrancy to it and the variety of the levels adds some nice changes to the scenery without being too repetitive.Sound/Music: I often call Nintendo good support music. Besides the Mario theme, nothing is really hummable yet it doesn't feel out of place. They added some voices for Mario and Luigi which as usual get annoying.Gameplay: I remember playing this on the SNES and I was so happy I cleared all 96 stages, got the Star Road finished, the secret areas and everything. Now I have to do it again, ugh. All the levels are here with some minor tweaks.It was this one I believe they introduced one of Mario's famous sidekicks: Yoshi, the green dinosaur who likes to eat anything and s**t it out and makes eggs that he can fling at people(only in Yoshi's Island and maybe some others). He also turned into a different colored Yoshi depending on what he ate. So red turtles gave him abilities to shoot fireballs while one enabled him to fly and another gave a slight earthquake quality when he bounced.Mario 3 wins in turns of transforming Mario. In 3, he had the tanooki suit(that raccoon), the frog suit, that shoe, not to mention the fire flower and the leaf, capable of making him fly. With this one he gets the fire flower and the feather, giving him a yellow Superman cape where he can fly. It's different than the leaf cause that just made him soar straight up while here you can fly across. He can glide down by just holding the button while in 3 you had to repeatedly hit it.The Mario Advance ports are great for us old school gamers who remembers playing Chrono Trigger, Uniracers and Final Fantasy III(officially VI but that's another story). Don't forget about Mario 3 and Yoshi's Island too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2005"}

The warfare promises to deliver the non-stop action, humor, and innuendos Conker is famous for.Also included is the critically acclaimed single-player game,Conker&#146;s Bad Fur Day,completely recreated for the Xbox with stunning graphics and unparalleled attitude.Features:Team-focused, story-driven, Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay is at the heart of this shooter, pitting the noble Squirrels against the evil Tediz. Players can choose from a variety of scenario-based missions featuring two unique campaigns--Old War and Future War--with each mission featuring its own distinctly challenging gameplay mode. Campaign story lines, comprised of multiple missions played progressively, bring an innovative and fresh approach to team-based shooters and Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players.Elite squad action: Players choose from six character classes, including Skyjockey, Long Ranger, Grunt, Demolisher, Thermophile, and Sneaker, each with its own signature weapons and abilities. InConker: Live and Reloaded,team composition has strategic and tactical advantages and implications.Xbox Live gameplay: Team-based gameplay, innovative campaign story lines, and distinctive humor all make for a great experience on Xbox Live.

Special abilities allow players to disguise themselves or feign death and sneak up on unsuspecting foes to unload a demoralizing array of attacks.Twisted and irreverent world of Conker: Over-the-top humor, characters, and gameplay dominate in every way with rude wit, lewd innuendoes, and ridiculous violence. The juxtaposition of the characters, Squirrels and Tediz, and their world is at the heart of the humor. The expressions, exclamations, and special effects bring out the true Conker flavor.Wildly bizarre single-player adventure: The critically acclaimed single-player gameConker&#146;s Bad Fur Dayis now on Xbox, fully recreated with amazing graphics and enhanced profanity. The game is full of hilarious situations, movie pastiches, off-the-wall puzzles, and crazy characters in an offbeat world, including horny bees, voluptuous sun flowers, singing piles of poo, and even Death himself.","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Don't be fooled by it's 'cute' look","reviewText":"Conker first appeared in Diddy Kong Racing for the N64.  He was a weird looking squirrel with a funky voice and a speedy vehicle.  As another character from that cart racer, Banjo, Conker got his own game, but not as much of a E rated game as its cousin.Conker's Bad Fur Day, a really bad game in terms of violence, drugs & alcohol, language, and themes.  It took the humor of  Naked Gun and other spoofs and added the platforming action of many of Rare's games.  The story was simple, you are trying to raise money to buy a round of beers for your friends.  You get lost due to your drunkiness and wake up with hangover.  This is the beginning to one of your worst days ever (hence the name Bad Fur Day).  I really liked its humor towards other movies and the way Conker talks about the developers and stuff.  The bosses are hillarious especially the Great Mighty Poo, a large singing piece of poo.First and Foremost, Parents DO NOT buy this game for your children until you know what you're getting into.  This game is NOT made for children, there are many controversal things here worse than Vice City and San Andreas combined.  Strangely enough, this game hasn't got as much of attention as those two, but who cares.  Anyway, for those parents who want to know the bad things on this game here's a list for you:-Sexual humor-Bad language (so much that some of it is censored)-Blood and guts-Alcohal and drug useSo if you do not like to see these things than I wouldn't recommend it.Live & Reloaded is essentially two games in one.  It's a remake of Conker's Bad Fur Day for N64 with some touches (very little in story) especially with graphics.  It still features the Panther King trying to fix his table for his milk.  The other game is the Live & Reloaded mode which is the multiplayer part.  This is where you can go onto Xbox Live or simply play a mission.  Basically it takes place during and after the Bad Fur Day game in a war against the squirrels and Tediz.  You can play as either with different classes and weapons.  It is truly a fun experience, multiplayer or by yourself.  It doesn't have all the multiplayer modes as the original, but it still is fun to play.  You should pick this game up if you liked BFD or if you want to play the multiplayer mode, but remember, this game is not for everyone.Pros- Very Humorous gameplay- Funny boss battles- Both games are fun to play- The multiplayer is a great experience- Many funny characters to meet- Voice acting has been redone and it was already good- Fun Platforming actionCons- Includes stuff that is not appropriate for everyone- People have mistakingly picked this game up thinking it will be exactly like Banjo Kazooie","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2005"}

Open world, RPG elements, side quests, etc. However, it wouldn't be fair to slap a lazy \"Fallout 3 with zombies\" label on this game, and call it a day. Dead Island has attempted to break new ground in an otherwise rigid genre. Name another open world, rpg zombie game?? My point exactly. While it doesn't do everything right (what game does?). It certainly does enough to warrant praise from the gaming community. I also like how there is a greater emphasis on CQC, and less on guns. This also adds another unique wrinkle.

The story is dumb, but the funny parts are highlighted while the tedious parts are left to small batches of text that you don't need to read to know what to do next.While the game is essentially about shooting various freaky, mutants and collecting objects, there's not a high demand on skill. it's more about the amount of enemies and leveling your character up to get access to more weapons.And oh the weapons. It's not nearly as magical as you might think with the \"millions of weapon combinations\" made possible by the games celebrated algorithm. But you get some satisfying choices and never feel like your stuck with a crappy gun.If you're the kind of person who can appreciate a game with a quirky sense of humor, don't mind running around to do delivery-type missions, and can spend hours doing side-quests, you'll enjoy yourself.The best suggestion: get 3 friends to play co-op and the game difficulty scales as does the loot. it's fantastic, fun, and never leaves you feeling like you're a loser if you can't beat it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}

PS2 usually will win, but I have to disagree. I find the GC controller to be the easiest to use. This controller is identical to the one you would receive when you purchase a Jet Black Game Cube. Please note that the Game Cube only comes with one controller, so if you're planning on playing two player games you'll need to get another one. Yes there are cheaper ones on the market, most notably ones from Intec, Mad Catz, Pelican etc, HOWEVER if you read the fine print in your warranty, using any 3rd party product such as those, will automatically void your warranty with the system. For the few extra dollars you spend it will be well worth your purchase. This controller is also very rugged I've had my Game Cube since 2001, and my controller has been stepped on, spilled on, etc, and it's in perfect working order.

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date. Packed with features like dramatic camera angles, epic set pieces, cinematic cut scenes, stirring audio and seamless fast action gameplay, formerly only available on console platformsChains of Olympusbinds players to the game?s epic adventure, regardless where they are when they join in the action.Combat Moves, Both Old and NewNearly as defining as the name of Kratos itself, the trademark sweeping attack moves of the ?Ghost of Sparta? using his weapon of choice the ?Blades of Chaos,? epitomizes allGod of Wargames andChains of Olympusis no exception.Although overall the PSP has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2 controller, developer Ready at Dawn Studios has managed to incorporate nearly all of the attack moves and combination moves from previous games in the series into this new project. This continuity in gameplay not only provides a seamless intro into the game for veteran players, but a gentle learning curve for players new to the series. Add to this new brutal combat moves and an additional upgradable weapon and you have a combat system that will engage players at all levels.Exploration and Puzzle SolvingFrom the bright gates of Attica to the darkest dungeons of Tartarus, Kratos? journey and your own will take you through the dark and brutal world of Greek mythology. Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"3.5; Taking down a God with bare hands","reviewText":"When I played the first God of War, part of me thought that it was indeed impressive with the production values, the passion and care the developers took and it certainly had a very cinematic and epic feel but there were times where gameplay-wise it annoyed the hell out of me. Ditto with its sequel which wasn't more awful or greater than the original but it was just....there. After recently purchasing a PSP, I figured why not tackle one of the handheld's heavy hitters. Well the same problems that plagued the others are still here and while many will outright love the game, I've noticed a lot to nitpick.Story: Taking place before the original, Kratos is helping Attica against the siege of the Persian army when a strange light is seen in the sky, covering the land in nighttime. Seems the god Helios is missing and the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, has taken over and put the gods to sleep. So Kratos must once again save all of Greece.Graphics: The bigger brothers on the PS2 had some pretty fantastic visuals and that gets replicated on Sony's tiny handheld. While they're not up to the visual clarity as those, the sheer size and scale fits perfectly with the series and indeed, many of this looks like it's PS2-ready graphics. During in-game you get occasional pauses for disc loading but other than that, there's nary any fault with this.Sound/Music: Despite only playing 3 games so far (Tactics, Liberty City Stories and this), God of War was the first time that I tried headphones and the experience became more richer. The soundtrack, filled with big choir and orchestras, came to life and very much brought the game to the more cinematic feel it's doing and the voice acting was spot-on.Gameplay: A lot of what God of War did in its gameplay was combine platforming, action and puzzle solving fairly smoothly but what it did with it was my issue. For starters, the controls are intuitive and it's easy to grasp the various combos and such but rolling (L+R and the direction) feels sluggish and with combos to the L and special moves to the R, it can get annoying when you hit the wrong button. Then there's the timed-button presses like when you take down a baddie with either pressing the face buttons or rotating the analog a certain way. The analog ones were aggravating since the time alloted is kind of fast and using the nub felt strange and never felt comfortable enough to bring them down and occasionally got nailed.One big aspect of the game is puzzle solving and while I do like games like Ico or Legend of Zelda where you'd go \"oohhhhh ok, yeah now I get it\", when you find the solution here, sometimes its more accidental or you consult an FAQ and think \"oh yeah, obviously I would've thought to do THAT\". While it's nothing bad, sometimes solutions just feel too vague and aside from the occasional puzzle, I never solved a puzzle by figuring out but by just stumbling across the answer. Combat though is of course fun and while your favorite combos tend to get repeated a lot, it's still fun to stab and slash at all the baddies though the bigger ones took longer to bring down. As for its length, yes it its short but considering it's a prequel, the PSP's more \"on-the-go\" style and the amount of graphics and stuff, I'm surprised they even crammed this much.Some might disagree with me and plenty of reviews have said this is absolutely one of the best games on the PSP but while I certainly don't think it's the worst, some of my more personal nitpicks and criticisms bring it down a tad but if you want a solid adventure, you could rent this of course. Just being the black sheep and saying this isn't the second coming for the PSP.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B006ZPAYD2","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"The Dark Knight Strikes Again","reviewText":"I am admittedly a huge batman fan and ever since finishing up Batman Arkham City I've been wanting to find something to scratch the itch to play through as the dark knight. Lego Batman 2 definitely fits the bill. It's got actual voice-over work with its own fun story that is enjoyable for adults and kids alike. I was pleasantly surprised by just how big Gotham City is and how much there is to explore. The hours will fly by just driving/flying/running around just messing around with side activities or hunting for collectibles before even touching on the main storyline. The bonus is you get access to a huge roster of other characters other than Batman that each have their own unique powers true to their characters. For example Flash has super-speed and Superman is of course invulnerable and can fly, has heat vision, use x-ray vision, has superstrength and has ice breath. The icing on the cake for the fans is the old-school Superman theme music that plays whenever you take flight. There's a lot of fan service to DC Comics fans both old and young that really adds that extra layer of charm that you don't always see. There are some things that are a bit annoying like camera angles that aren't always the most convenient etc., but they are by no means going to ruin your experience of the game.Point is, if you too are a Batman and/or DC Comics fan looking for a fun game to play regardless of how old you are then Lego Batman 2 is a great purchase that I strongly recommend you pick up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}

Ps2 to ps3? Not so much. I mean, it's always been a solid fighter, and with each iteration came new fighters, a few new modes here and there, and graphical improvements, but nothing groundbreaking. After downloading Dark Resurrection on PS3, the remake of the same PSP title, I was eagerly anticipating Tekken 6, but when I popped the disc in, I felt slight disappointment. While the whole package was serviceable, it wasn't what I expected. Graphically, it seemed light they got away with using the lowest poly-count they could, while throwing on tons of bloom lighting and fancy textures as cover-up. Load times are horrble between fights and there's no excuse for that in a fighting game! The characters still animate stifly in real-time cut scenes and the voice acting is only passable. Convoluted as the story of Tekken has become, I wish they gave more service to the individual characters. As a replacement for a real story mode they include a Campaign mode a la streets of rage, which grew on me after a few stages but its nothing more thana means to earn money for items. All in all, the best feature is the giant roster. Each character is different enough from the next to warrant a go and the selection puts other fighters to shame. The new characters are also awesome to play as. I'd recommend Tekken 6 to any fighting game enthusiast, but if you didn't like Tekken before this one won't be changing your mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}

New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"Not perfect, but it's addictive and the ultimate fanservice for Nintendo fanatics","reviewText":"So going into my purchase of Brawl, I have to say my expectations were massively high-I was addicted to Super Smash Bros. Melee for a good 7 years (pretty much up to the point at which I heard Brawl was coming out), and just had this mindset that it was, hands down, one of the greatest games ever created. It was about as close as Nintendo could come to digital crack. So needless to say, if there was going to be a sequel, it better have been a rip-roarin' hell of a sequel if it wanted to top, or even equal, its predecessor. Well I'll say first off that Brawl definitely delivers and is an amazing game-if you loved Melee, you will very likely also play this game to death. On the other hand, however, like many Wii games, had it gone just a little further, had the developers made that smidgen of extra effort, it would have been an untouchable classic.So to start, if you're playing Brawl for the first time coming out of your Melee haze, expect a few wonky differences that may actually initially turn you off. The controls take getting used to, some of the characters handle differently, and in general, almost everything is a tad slower. The control schemes seem weird at first-this game is simply not meant to be played like an NES title, so needless to say just holding the Wii Remote sideways really doesn't feel right. The Wii Remote+Nunchuk scheme is alright, but quickly reveals that the Smash Bros. series was constructed to be compatible with a basic controller layout. Veterans and newbies alike will very likely feel most comfortable just reverting back to the Gamecube Controllers, which is both a relief in that you don`t have to shoehorn your controller comfort zone into something that just doesn`t fit, but also somewhat disappointing in that they couldn't think of anything more innovative in terms of new control schemes.Meanwhile, some trademark powerhouses and competitive favorites have been toned down power-wise and made generally weaker (Peach, Sheik, Link, Jigglypuff), while some not-so-popular others have been curiously and somewhat pointlessly powered *up* (Mr. Game & Watch, Zelda, Ness). The tradeoff would've been more logical if the toning down of unreasonably powerful moves from the previous game weren't followed up with other random characters who weren't particularly overpowered in Melee being so dramatically powered up for Brawl. Also, the slew of items is now devastating-get ready to defend against things like Final Smashes and the Dragoon, both of which can provide the user with potential multiple instant KO's. Some minor tweaks have been made that actually make things a little more convenient, and provide more strategy options-you can now grab items while running or in midair, and you can now move around while using attack items that required you to fire from a standstill in Melee. It's also slightly easier for most characters to grab the edges of platforms.As far as graphics and general aesthetics go, surprisingly, as where the Wii came somewhat short in some other games, Melee is actually quite visually impressive. The colors are far more vivid, and almost everything is slightly more elaborate and detailed-each character now has unique animations that occur as they're charging Smash Attacks, and every fighter in general is given more character and personality. One of the new items, the Superspicy Curry, causes the user to spout flames from their mouth, and each fighter does this in a manner individually befitting of their character. Also, each character now has three different taunts instead of just one. As far as the new character designs go, some of them are amazing while others take getting used to. Peach is gorgeous, looking the best she's ever looked in pretty much any previous title, Link and Zelda are modeled after their Twilight Princess designs so they both look great (and Zelda's color scheme is now brunette-purple instead of blonde-pink, which mimicked Peach a little too closely), Yoshi is a little less lanky-looking than he was in Melee, Donkey Kong now actually has fur, and the Ice Climbers are less blocky looking (their parkas now have texture to them). Ganondorf's new look (and new handling) takes some getting used to (although it's based off of his Twilight Princess design, like the other Zelda characters), and I initially found Fox a little too cartoony-looking for my taste. Both of these new looks ended up growing on me, however, and ultimately all of the characters are pretty satisfactory aesthetically.The 'clone' problem is also pretty much gone (Dr. Mario, Young Link and Pichu are no longer present, although Fox, Falco and Wolf are all a little too close for comfort at times); and for the first time in a Smash title, Luigi is now completely his own character (gasp). Now for the gameplay itself: everything's pretty much just as exciting as Melee, although some of the new quirks offer new possibilities for strategy, and the devastating items and introduction of Final Smashes can make things far more intense. The addition of the Smash Ball and Final Smash, which is basically a character's 'ultimate' attack, adds a very fresh and fun new flavor to the gameplay. Mad dashes for the Smash Ball always offer some awesomely intense gameplay or at least some laughs-and I have to say, it's incredibly satisfying finishing off your opponent with a well-timed Final Smash.The 1-player game modes simultaneously impress and disappoint-Classic Mode is pretty much the same, but it seems somewhat tired by this point, and feels in general more exhaustive and tedious than in previous titles. Adventure Mode comes in the form of the Subspace Emissary, a 1 or 2-player cinematic adventure mode that requires you to complete several tasks, fight boss battles and basically make your way through 'levels,' like an old-fashioned platformer. It is also ultimately a mixed bag. The cut scenes provided in between each level are really the motivation to play-fanboys and girls alike will probably giggle giddily watching their favorite Nintendo characters interact in sometimes funny, sometimes cool, sometimes just plain weird short movies. The story that ties these cut scenes together would be great if it were a little more focused-nothing's ever explained in full and things end far too abruptly, once you've finally, FINALLY gotten to the final boss battle. Other than the lure of the guilty-pleasure cut scenes and the ability to play through an old-fashioned platformer with the Nintendo character of your choice, Subspace Emissary gets repetitive and tedious far too quickly. By the end of the first several levels you'll probably be bored, and it's far too time-consuming and exhausting to battle each and every boss not once but twice (which you will do if you want to reach the final boss). Admittedly, however, the cut scenes are a great little treat and will keep the average game-lover coming back for more (even if the story tying them together doesn't quite impress).All-Star Mode, which you won't unlock until relatively late in your Smash career, is equally exhaustive, since you need to battle all 35 characters (37, if you include the fact that you need to individually battle all 3 of the Pokemon Trainer's Pokemon) with only 3 recovery items. This makes trophy collecting a lot more tiring, but in this case it's somewhat worth it-the Final Smash trophies, which you receive for completing All-Star Mode with any character, look amazing-they include each character doing a unique, usually awesome pose surrounded by an example of their Final Smash. I'm glad Brawl brought back the addition of trophies to the list of game goodies, because it's really the only motivation to go through the 1-player modes. Also, you can now go through All-Star Mode with two players, which is great because you can collect two trophies at once.There are also, of course, several new features to the game. The Stage Builder allows you to build your own stages to battle on, which is great but not perfect. Don't expect to build anything too elaborate, at least not at first (you can unlock more stage features as you play), but it's pretty damn cool fighting on a stage you created. And surprisingly, the process is a lot less time-consuming and complicated than one might expect.One of the game's greatest new features is its compatibility with Nintendo's Wifi Connection. If you have Wireless in your home or wherever you're using your Wii, you can connect to Nintendo's Wifi and battle with friends or random players anywhere, anytime. Sounds amazing, right? It is for the most part, but there are some major setbacks bogging this feature down-the lag can be horrible, especially if you yourself or the person you're battling has a weak wifi connection; at its worst, it feels like you're playing in slow motion. Also, if you're looking to play with random players, you may or may not be able to-the game can't always find competitors (it probably doesn't help that I think the Wifi only goes national, unlike Mario Kart Wii's worldwide capabilities), and sometimes you'll just be left standing in the practice stage for several minutes waiting for opponents who'll never show up or be reached through the connection. The time of day you log on also heavily contributes towards whether or not you'll be able to reach fellow competitors.And, finally, we can't go without discussing the slew of new characters. Meta Knight is my personal favorite among the new additions-he's speedy, fun to play, and can easily string together combos. He's in general a unique and cool new addition to the game. King Dedede and Snake (who's probably generated the most buzz, new character-wise) are both awesome but difficult to control-you probably won't be using them in competitive matches, unless you really practice with them. Zero Suit Samus, who frankly comes off as Nintendo's version of Lara Croft, is also a cool new character who has a bit of a learning curve but is an exciting, sleek new character once you learn how to use her. Wario's goofy and fun, as expected, and Sonic is great (and has an incredibly cheap Final Smash, so beware), but his normal attacks are somewhat weak, so until you learn to string together specific techniques of his, you'll be picking away at your foes (until you nab a Smash Ball, in which case you'll send everyone running for their lives). Toon Link is very similar to Link, but he has more personality and individuality than Melee's Young Link did. The addition of Pit from Kid Icarus is very cool; as far as pulling old characters from retro games go, he was a great choice (frankly, a better choice than the very random addition of the Ice Climbers in Melee). Lucas is a cute new character from Earthbound, and he frankly handles better and is more powerful than Ness, when used properly. Wolf is a great character, but he's a little too similar to Fox and Falco, and feels somewhat unnecessary. Of all the new characters, however, Pokemon Trainer and Olimar from the Pikmin series are the most unique. Playing as the Pokemon Trainer actually allows you to choose from playing as three different characters: Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard, while Olimar doesn't do much fighting himself but instead wields Pikmin like items to perform attacks. Both take a bit of getting used to, but they're very fun and original characters once you know your way around their moves.Ultimately, as you may be able to tell from my lengthy review, the game has a massive amount of content, so you probably won't be getting bored with it anytime soon. Not all of this content really completely clicks, and some of it just plain falls flat, but at the end of the day Super Smash Bros. Brawl is a thoroughly satisfying game. It really is, as the primary review states, a great celebration of Nintendo culture. If you own a Wii, you really should own this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2008"}

That's not to say that I ever finished the first game I started.

Purposely he spat all over the TV and hurled the PS2 controller on the floor. The following crash sounded as if it were actual bone snapping. Done with his barrage of wet missiles on the helpless TV, the youngster brushed the saliva off his lips and frantically paced around.\"Am I dreaming?\" he asked, prancing like a demented loon, arms swinging about.Accidentally slapping his face, he simultaneously answered, \"no, I'm afraid not!\"Returning on his chair, the TV screen displayed his progression through the \"epic RPG.\" Twelve hours. It had taken him twelve hours from the latest RPG from Square for him to cease convincing himself that this RPG was even a worthy stab. Nope not this one, not by a long-shot! The inspiring Final Fantasy legacy is now fully disfigured and distorted. Formerly forgiving Square for the travesty what is Final Fantasy VIII, the kid's faith in the series momentarily went frozen and shattered. Final Fantasy X is a devastation, but to others a masterpiece, and to him utter wreckage.\"And the next one a multiplayer one? \" he was disgusted.Feeling lassitude creep on him, his distress silences him. When he says Final Fantasy X is a disappointment of lifetime, it is as authentic as the air you breathe in and puff out. Enveloped by rage, he asked himself why was he in such revulsion? Indeed, his heart was racing, his temples burning, but all because of some electronic hobby? Yes, he felt as if he Square pulled a trigger, ejecting a swarm of upset upon him. His hard-earned cash replaced by a game he surmised to accomplish title of \"Greatest RPG Ever Crafted.\" His fifty-four bucks were a definite waste, he might as well have thrown the money down from his roof and cheer for his gluttonous neighbors. Either way its fate was the same.Was the Final Fantasy series gradually reducing itself into the equilibrium of RPG damnation? Truly in a state of disgrace, the franchise has lost its traditional substance in exchange for graphical grandeur. Even though he treasured 1997's FFVII, he now speculates if it is still consummate. He decided it will remain as a fond memory, but ultimately be known as the indisputable harbinger of Square's greater goal, TO BECOME A PART OF HOLLYWOOD!Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within flopped like a bad dream. What then, Square, he thought. Recycle your cinematic visions into your latest installment of Final Fantasy? Final Fantasy X, a hybrid of little RPG significance with movie-format majority, ruins the experience to stimulate imagination of the player -- THE READER -- by deleting scripts of written dialogue and basing an epic with snappish and terse voices. He wished for broad, intriguing reads, and by the Gods, he wasn't a slothful boy. What driven him on the edge of vehemence were the maddening voice-overs. A gamer who valued his imagination, he utilized his creative mind to mentally produce the voices of past Final Fantasy casts. Final Fantasy X puts the enjoyment to total extinction. Despite the impressive apparatus of the well functioning Grid Sphere and the edge-cutting battle system of letting all characters partake in the forceful battles, the assets dig their own grave by the objectionable shortcomings.99% of his worship for RPGs derived from plot and characters. Oh, how he waited to be immersed into Square's next chapter, he struggled, but the more he threw himself into the venture, the more he apprehended that the characters were second-hand versions of previous installments. His observation of Auron summoned Vincent (FFVII) and Shadow (FFVI) in mind; Luna, an almost exact replica of Rinoa (FFVIII); Tidus was an older version of Zidane (FFIX); Kimahri and Rikku were the easiest to fathom, Kimahri is an identical version of Mareg from Grandia II and Rikku is Yuffie (FFVII). The thought of the beloved characters being disguised by a barrage of graphical distinction only proliferated his antipathy. Worse, the arch-villain Seymour, he thought, was a joke, and there is nothing funny about it. He saw Seymour as an inept villain, who solely upheld the attributes of being immoral because he is undead and lost the balance of reality. Every bit of the unoriginality, killed off any reason to gobble the quest or even bring it to an end it.Unlike the spit he easily wiped off his mouth, the kid couldn't free the fact that the story's direction suffocates an excellent battle system. What could have been worthwhile proportions is trodden by the hum-drum purposes of the characters, a lethally boring arch-villain, and the idea that the [bad]characters are reincarnations of past Final Fantasies. All of it led him to the decision that indicated how low, uncreative, and money-ravenous the former console RPG messiahs sunk.Square's motive to him was grounded on the construction of \"videogames\" being incorporated with theatrical premises. In turn, it costs the fundamentals of the RPG genre. Is the company now a capitalist pig intent on deceiving players by saturating commercials and zines with a multitude of striking full motion videos? When a Final Fantasy disc comes out, it isn't the gameplay that clocks in the hours, its the superfluous videos and dreadfully voiced scenes. Anything with the name of Final Fantasy (in videogames, mind you) will have Square put their Speedos on, and dive in an ocean of cash. Where will all this cash go? Maybe to -- again -- futilely make a come back in the movie industry? To reinstate their name of the laughingstock that they are in Hollywood? You can call it paranoia, you can call it absurd, but Sixto Limiac calls it theory.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2002"}

The closest I came was Zelda on the Super Nintendo.  When I think of role-playing games, I think of games designed for losers living in their mother's basement watching Star Trek reruns and playing Dungeons and Dragons.  At some points of this game, I felt I was way off, and some points I thought I was right. Everyone said this is one of the greatest games ever created, so I had to at least play it before dismissing it to the realms of geeks and nerds.This game is gorgeous, long, annoying, yet ultimately rewarding.  At some points of the game, I wanted to throw this game away, while at other points I wanted to play it non-stop.  Throughout this game I wondered why I bothered buying it, and other times I wondered why I hated earlier.The first thing people notice is that in the beginning and throughout many places, this game represents more of an interactive movie than a game.  The first two hours consist of like 10 minutes of game play.  I initially hated this game.  The scenes seemed garish, puzzling, and long, and worst of all, could not be skipped.  You have to watch all the movies, no X-button skip here.  Then about five hours into it, when the game play showed itself, and my eyes grew accustomed to the garish Japanese anime type movies, I started to slowing get engrossed in it.  After a while, I got annoyed when the movies started to become less frequent.  The puzzling story and environment slowly becomes unraveled, along with the histories of the characters.  What ensues is an engrossing, lavish, spectacular story full of good twists and animations.  One of the main pluses is that it takes places on a group of lush tropical islands, instead of the depressing typical dungeons and/or medieval town that I associate with RPGs.  The only thing that annoyed me was the somewhat ambiguous ending.  I played this game for a long time - I wanted a concrete ending that was worth my time.What makes this game enjoyable is the lush tropical surroundings and imaginative characters.  The scenery itself is worth the price of the game.  The backgrounds are spectacular and really shows what a game could do.  One major gripe I had was the Japanese anime stuff, especially the females.  It seems like they were designed by frustrated perverts who flunked out of art school.  It's embarrassing having someone walking in while I'm playing this game.  They could have dressed the girls in a more conservative costume, and made some of them not speak like junior high school dropouts.The fighting sequences are the meat of the game.  Though monotonous at some points, it's still pretty good for what it is.  It's turn-based, which seems almost sacrilegious to me, but after I while I really started to appreciate the use of strategy involved.  The fact that the fights are really won by good reasoning as opposed to a quick thumb is pretty cool.  Though some of the bosses are pretty hard, with help from the internet, I never had to fight a boss more than three times.What was really enjoyable was that it took into account one thing that hardly any other game does - fair progression.  If you work hard and fight all the monsters in the beginning, it pays off in the end.  Though some bosses seemed impossible, the fact that you progressed steadily, along with the continuos learning of the gameplay nuances, really comes out.  Many games start out easy, with the only way to win at the end is to go through some cheap trick, cheat, or pass some impossible jump.  This doesn't rely on that annoying formula at.  Also, when bosses seem impossible, going to the internet can offer many hints on the bosses weaknesses and strengths, and can aid you, but not win it for you.Unfortunately, this game has many flaws.  The most noticeable is you can't save it any point in the game.  Since you don't know when you?ll be able to save it, you don't know if you can go to sleep within a few minutes, or within an hour.  I really hate that.  My schedule is sometimes tight.  I don't want to block out a two hours of my time and only play for ten minutes.Another thing is that it's just way too long for a normal game.  I've got a job.  This is not the type of exciting game that can be played for ten hours straight.  If you play for an hour every night, it would take two months to pass this game.  I have a job and a life.  If I didn't have an injury that kept me indoors, I would have never finished this game.One thing that annoyed me was that you'd have to talk to someone or walk into a room for the game to continue, and many times the game won't say what to do.  It's a minor annoyance, but really got on my nerves since I spent time unrelated to the gameplay or movie.The last gripe I have is that the game also tries to incorporate other things into it.  Most notably puzzles and blitzball.  The puzzles are dull and boring and don't fit into the game.  Unfortunately, you have to go through them to continue.  Blitzball is terrible.  It's some futuristic turn-based made up game that is just plain stupid.  A turn-based sport is pretty lame by itself.  A made up game is even worse.Did I enjoy this game?  Yes, very much so.  Would I play it again?  Not on your life.  Would I get the next game in the series?  No way.  This game is not a mainstream game, and it shows.  Too long and too weird for most people's taste.  Unless Final Fantasy 11 is more in tune with the average gamer, Squaresoft will still be bleeding money.Pros:Gorgeous - bright and imaginativeLong story is gripping, actually worth it.Progression is fair - no cheap tricks or cheats requiredExtremely polished, professionalCons:Puzzles are worthlessIt's really too long of a gameNewbies struggle for a little whileBlitzball is the lamest thing on earthThe females should be better representedCan't save at any pointAmbiguous endingNot designed for normal gamersHours to pass: 60-70 hoursDifficulty: Medium to HardAnnoyance Level: High","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2002"}

The graphics are amazing, and the variety of creatures, bosses, and locales are nothing short of impressive. The detail is really...and I hate to use this word...breathtaking. The interactive cut scenes are intense and new in terms of interacting with the game. You can't take a breather in this game during these either, which is refreshing.  Everyone I have loaned this too or given them as a gift has been floored. It is required playing for anyone who appreciates a deep, detailed, involving game that shows you things you have never seen before. So what if Leon looks like an '80's David Bowie...If you haven't played this, and horror is your thing, you are missing out. One of the greatest horror games ever...or just game period.I have played this on the Gamecube many, many times, and still use the old school GC controller w/this version; the movement is even better than before, def. less 'bobbing' in Leon's step. Have not tried the Wii waving controls w/this.Simply amazing game that has so much replay value....addictive & fun; but get ready to sweat!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R3","description":"Paper Mariohas a 2-D look in a 3-D game world--an aesthetic designed to make players feel as if they've entered an animated pop-up book. A stationary camera helps reinforce this storybook illusion. The game's title is taken from the paper-thin characters inhabiting the Mushroom Kingdom. For example, when Mario is sleeping, he flips and flutters through the air like a leaf falling from a tree.Paper Mariois the sequel to the classic Super NES role-playing gameSuper Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Like the original, it contains a mix of turn-based battles and intricate puzzles, as well as timed attacks. Players time their attacks by moving the D-pad and pressing the A button at exactly the right moment to inflict maximum damage. This seasonsPaper Mariowith a little action/adventure flavor. Classic characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and Toad, are joined by the likes of Goombario and Kammy Koopa.","reviewerName":"Jon Mcfly","summary":"There are so many hours in a day","reviewText":"Paper mario is the one of the best RGP to date.(Or on your N64)  Anyway it has a huge plot, with hidden secrets.  You many ask how the game can be so huge?  The game is 325mb, when games like kirby64 are only 90mb.  There is a lot of reading and the opening moive is abit long.  You play as mario, peach, and 7 friends help you on your quest.  I must warn you i've lost alot of sleep over this game.(I just beat it, with 30 hours playing time)  So if you are looking for a good RGP game for your n64, this is my favorite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2001"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA76","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"It's Fun","reviewText":"I purchased this so cheap I wasnt expecting anything good. the graphics are sometimes cheesy, it's difficult to aim the guns, it takes 10 shots to kill the enemies, that's how its similar to the game Black. But the bottom line is, it's fun and I know my kids will like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0056WJA76","description":"","reviewerName":"Pangloss \"soldierblue\"","summary":"Blast away!","reviewText":"I just got this game yesterday and played for several hours last night and was totally hooked. But it is no more nor less than a shoot-em up game with emhasis on blasting or blowing up everything that moves. Plenty of guns and plenty of action. For my tired old eyes and ears the graphics and sound are great. As other reviewers have said it is reminiscent of early days arcade shooters which is exactly how the game was marketed. To me it is very much like the \"Serious Sam\" shooters that were very lively blast fests. I cannot comment the multiplayer mode since I don't get involved in multiplayer. And yes, this is a fairly difficult game but lots of fun. Any fan of FPS games will enjoy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}
