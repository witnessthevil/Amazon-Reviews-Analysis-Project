I know they haven't been up to par lately, and I realize my mistake in taking on a project that I just don't have the time or energy to live up to, so I just wanted to do the RIGHT thing and make sure it was ok with all of you before I downgrade the gaming quality and packaging of the product I put out to you.

I'm going through some hard times, and despite that my titles are going to be more than under par with what I've already been giving you lately, I just wanted to ask all of you if you will still buy my titles for me. I really need the money, and you know I wouldn't ask you this unless I was really tight for money. Would this be alright with all of you? It's just a couple million, and you know I'll pay you back.

The hardest challenge has to be getting all the Chaos Emeralds and becoming Super Sonic/Super Knuckles but that's just how Sonic games are. It's also really fun if you own Sonic the Hedgehog/Sonic the Hedgehog 2/Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for the Genesis. You can put the cartridges together to have some more fun. Of course, you probably already knew that.Sonic the Hedgehog-a new Special Stage game where you have to get all of the blue spheres, similar to the Sonic 3 and Sonic and Knuckle special stages, just there are so many stages and, when they all finish, they repeat and, this time around, their faster.Sonic the Hedgehog 2-Knuckles is now playable as a third character in Sonic 2, and Knuckles can now go places Sonic and Tails could never go before.Sonic the Hedgehog 3-Probably the best game to go with Sonic and Knuckles, this makes the game even longer, putting together the stages of Sonic 3 AND Sonic and Knuckles. Sonic 3 and Knuckles is one of the best games ever. Some paths are even exclusive to Knuckles.The game itself without the extensions of the previous titles is very impressive, and it's really disappointing how Sega/Sonic Team doesn't make games as good as this anymore.

InManhunt's Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Manhunt. . .","reviewText":"\"Manhunt\" is a stealth intensive action/horror game that casts you as James Earl Cash, a death row inmate given a secret, so-called \"stay of execution\" so that he can star in a snuff film that pits him against bloodthirsty gangs and slavering lunatics in the fictional cesspool of Carcer City. Cash is a very reluctant participant in this game of death, and is understandably unhappy about it all. Even so, he's an anti-hero who has no qualms about killing mercilessly to stay alive. Yes, you guessed it, \"Manhunt\" is an M-rated game that was never intended for the faint of heart.The controversial background story for \"Manhunt\" is certainly original, and at times quite disturbing. It's ultimately a very interesting excuse to plunge into the game's world of horrific violence and twisted, offbeat humor - not because of the game's irreverence, but instead because the game is FUN, pure and simple... provided you're not overly squeamish or easily offended, it goes without saying.\"Manhunt\" is initially a 3rd person `sneaker,' but later evolves into an over-the-shoulder action game. In both cases, stealth is essential to Cash's survival. Part of the game's sadistic appeal lies in its `stealth kills,' which can be performed by successfully creeping up on an enemy and hitting the attack button. There are three grades of stealth kill (normal, violent, and gruesome), and all are satisfyingly over-the-top. Stealth weapons include razor wire, plastic bags for suffocation, and shards of glass, if that gives you any indication just how unflinching \"Manhunt\" can be. Performing successful stealth kills is crucial, as Cash is far from superhuman. If he is forced to fight openly, it's usually a bad thing.Later on, ranged weapons become invaluable as fierce firefights become inevitable. The game's targeting system works very well in this mode, and the action is frenetic enough to compete with the thrilling stealth missions from earlier in the game. Unfortunately, the problem of difficulty does arise here. It can be mercilessly difficult, especially with its limited save system.\"Manhunt\" is perhaps one of the most atmospheric console games ever developed. Environments are suitably dark, gritty, and devoid of hope. The game's enemies fit into this gloom-and-doom atmosphere perfectly, and some of them are quite unnerving. Still, I can't help but feel that \"Manhunt\" occasionally goes out of its way to be controversial. Sometimes the game's sick gags seem forced, and less effective than when they flow naturally into the scheme of things.When it's all said and done, \"Manhunt\" is a twisted gem. It's unfortunate that its high frustration factor sometimes gets in the way of things and prevents the game from achieving a classic status. Even so, I recommend it to the darker side of gamers everywhere.Final Score: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000KLNLUK","reviewerName":"J. Mendoza","summary":"Good game for a great bargain price","reviewText":"I actually bought this game shortly after it was released. In fact it was one of the first games I bought for the PS3, but stopped playing once Metal Gear 4 came out and never actually finished it until a few minutes ago. I liked the game overall, but it does have some problems.The only reason I bought this game is because of the Glaive, because who hasn't wished they had a giant ninja star you can control. I mean, that's the only thing Krull had going for it (really showing my age with that reference). Yeah, the Glaive is a one trick pony, what with the slicing, but you can add fire, lighting, and ice elements on certain stages of the game. You can also control it with motion control or the right stick. Besides the Glaive, you'll unlock a few additional powers like a shield, armor, etc. Really liked the look of the armor on the Nemesis, one of the last bosses.Unfortunately the controls are a bit sluggish. Moving from cover to cover is not as smooth as it could have been. Even though you can find different weapons, or purchase them, you'll most likely stick to the gun you have from the beginning. I sure did, after some minor upgrades to it.The game is entertaining, but forgettable. I mean, I can't really remember the story and I just finished it. Something about an infection creating monsters. But really, for less than $10 you can't go wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Ian","summary":"A roller coaster ride, in all the wrong ways","reviewText":"Quick, name two of the coolest things you can think of off the top of your head.  If you said Dinosaurs and giant, overpowered guns then congratulations, you still have the heart of a child.  And what's even better?  If you said, \"Going after dinosaurs with high powered guns,\" then you will forever be a child at heart.  And it sounds like an impossible-to-fail premise for a video game.  Yet, unlike our cherished inner child, \"Turok\" is a game that loves to dish out both childhood wonder and unimaginable agony in equal doses.\"Turok\" is a first person shooter that places you in the space boots of Jospeh Turok, a futuristic Space Marine (TM) who is heading off to a remote jungle planet to capture his old evil boss Roland Kane.  En route to said planet, your spaceship is blown out of the sky, you crash, and suddenly a simple mission becomes a desperate fight for survival, for not only do you have to take on Kane's army of gas mask wearing Space Marines (TM), you also have to fight off bloodthirsty dinosaurs, as the planet is chock full of them.  And so, grabbing your guns, your wits, as well as your trusty knife and bow, off you go, gallivanting into the jungle in a fight for survival.At first glance, \"Turok\" has all the elements to be the most awesome video game in the history of the universe, for the simple reason of being a game where you run around shooting dinosaurs with really big guns, slicing the throats of dinosaurs with a knife, shooting dinosaurs with a bow and arrow, and running away in terror from dinosaurs the size of a naval destroyer.  You do so in jungles, military bases, and even volcanic environments as you engage in a primal fight for survival.  It sounds like there's no way it could possibly fail, but like looking back at cherished childhood films, you find that it is a lot less enjoyable then you might have imagined.  Part of this lies in the game's difficulty level, which ranges from perfectly acceptable to hair tearingly frustrating, and that applies to the enjoyment factor.  For every moment of pitch perfect fun (taking out over a dozen velociraptors in an underground cave with only your knife), it's followed by a moment of sheer agony (fighting your way through a three storied room full of pipes and outnumbered six to one by evil space marines (TM) ).  Like a roller coaster ride, whenever you have an awesome moment, it's guaranteed that you'll plunge into the depths of gaming despair, only to come out again, and repeat until the final cut scene.  There are some moments so frustrating and so hard that you'll be tempted to just give up.  When I first tried to get through the pipe room mentioned above, I died so many times that I was tempted to just return the game to Blockbuster and demand my money back (Ditto for assaulting a fortress that at times is next to impossible to complete).  And then there's a fight against a giant monster where you have to dodge back and forth to avoid it's attacks.  Every time I get close to killing it, it would pop a random attack out of its ass and kill me instantly, either by ramming me (which it had never done before), to tossing rocks that seemed to be guided by lasers, and thus were impossible to avoid.  Trust me when I say that you'll want to take the developers of this fight and chuck them into a meat grinder.Aside from the game's difficulty, one giant problem is that, for a game that features fighting dinosaurs as its main draw, you spend half the time fighting evil Space Marines (TM), and this is where the game truly stumbles, because let's face it, we've all fought millions of human and alien goons in video games, but it's not everyday that you get to fight dinosaurs.  Every time you're fighting a squad of Kane's goons, you're wishing you were fighting dinosaurs.  Kane's goons aren't any fun to fight either, as they're more then happy to pepper you with lead and kill you in about three seconds, and every (and I mean every) time I was killed by a human, I felt as if the game was cheating.  Turok can take on a dozen raptors at once, and endure wounds that would leave a normal human lying on the ground in so many bacon sized pieces, but send him up against two guys with submachine guns and Turok might as well take off all his clothes and paint a bullseye on his chest.  It's ironic that all the animals and dinosaurs in this game play fair, but the humans are just cheap in every way you can imagine. This is a game where you don't run in like Rambo, but have to take it slow like Solid Snake.Still, even with the difficulty and frustration, Turok does offer a good amount of fun, if you can endure the bad parts.  The joy of fighting dinosaurs never grows old, as there are many different ways you can do so.  Being the Space Marine (TM) you are, you get access to all manner of military weaponry, such as mini-guns, submachine guns, pulse rifles, and even sticky bomb guns that will blast any raptor sized enemy into twitching chunks of bloody meat.  If you're feeling more raw and visceral, why not pop out some arrows and pepper your foes to death?  Or even better, take out your knife.  In a highly surprising turn of events, Turok becomes the first video game in history where the knife is the most enjoyable weapon in the entire game.  With a simple tap of a button (Provided you can get into the right position), the camera will swing out, and you'll watch Turok kill his opponents instantly with the knife, whether from slicing their throats, embedding the blade into their skulls, or many other vicious ways.  It's a visceral thrill, and endlessly fun to do, especially against some of the larger dinosaurs in the game.In addition, Turok boasts some very pretty graphics.  The visuals are top notch all across the board, especially on the dinosaurs, which, when coupled with the animation and sound effects, makes them the stars of the show.  You'll be quite terrified indeed when you're running as fast as you can while a giant tyrannosaur gives chase, snapping at your heels.  The sound effects and music are quite good and properly set the mood.  Regretably however, the story isn't all that great, as while it gets off to a strong start, it teeters out and fades quickly, giving very little background or characterization to any of your friends and foes, to the point where you really could care less if they end up as dino poop or not.  The only exceptions come for Rodriguez, the snappy hispanic soldier, Slade (voiced very well by Ron Perlman) and Kane.  The voice acting is good all around, so while you may not care for your fellow troops, at least you won't have to endure grating voices.Overall, Turok is an acceptable game.  It's frustrating difficulty and annoying human opponents make it sheer torture to play at some points, but thankfully, there are enough good moments to balance things out, leaving it an acceptable, but not extraordinary game.  But let's face it, fighting dinosaurs is always a treasured joy, no matter how badly the world wants to smash that beautiful idea out of our childhood dreams.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2010"}

Game is great.","reviewText":"First off let me say that i think the PS3 is a great system for EXCLUSIVES only, and a do it all multimedia device. 360 is a better all around gaming unit, anyways this isnt about a comparison, its about modern warfare 2. I played all the way through the campaign even after seeing how bland and horrible the landscapes looked on this version, and i have a full HD 37' 1080p LCD. I figured well let me check my setting, well after doing so it was clear that it had downgraded the game to the usual 720p you get from PS3. Well it barely looked good even for that, the campaign itself is great, controls were very smooth, and aiming and shooting were spot on, and a big improvement for the first game. The addition of some new interactive climbing, in the snow, on mountains and building was a great addition as well. I thoroughly enjoyed riding throw the snow killing people on my snow mobile, great moments that i would play over again and again. I went ahead and excepted to see the disturbing content which wasnt all that bad, and really is no different than we are doing in irag, hey we kill innocent by standers every day, we ever hear about it on the news nope. So this wasnt an issue and i thought added a new interesting dark twist to the story. Another thing i liked is them using movie star Lance Hendringson(he was the dude for the PS3 commercial, also Bishop in Aliens, the Pumpkinhead guy and a few TV series), great voice. Also Keith David was great as the commander in various parts of the game(The Something About Mary dad, oh i'm just #$%$$% with ya)HA.Now to the real part, the multiplayer, well since they fixed it on the PS3 is pretty decent, but after playing for about 2 hours i realized how much i missed this game on the Xbox, and missed my achievements on Xbox live. So i actually went out and bought another xbox(for other reasons as well) since the PC version i could have bout was so horrid and if you look on here has 1 1/2 stars out of 376 people(isnt that some sort of record?). After splurging and taking back the copy for 35 bucks in credit at gamestop, it was like night and day. Some say the Xbox is full 1080p and the only console to REALLY support, some don,t. Well i can tell you the difference was like night and DAY. The graphics were sharper, the online, more stable and killer, and just an overall feel that the game was ported much better to it than the PS3, but hey isnt that how it always turns out. So Modern Warfare itself is a great game, and i feel the upgrades from the first while subtle, were a vast improvement overall. The graphics are a step above yes, but i'll be @$%#ed if Modern Warfare 1 still doesnt look incredible.Also some great additions, are the new laptop, radar, bombimg, or sending out plains, or using one to help your buddy. I like the split screen campaign mode, if someone will play it with you. Also with the xbox version you get SO many more people playing on it, and connects very quickly. And overall it just feels like a more stable and better version than PC, or PS3. So why am i writing about this on the PS3 version, well because that was my first experience, and for those who think they've played the game in all its glory on PS3, wrong, sorry. Stick to the exclusives sony has to offer, i for one was shocked at how bad the game looked, but pleased with how much fun i had. So thats why 2 stars for the PS3 version, graphics, and online, just awful. But i bared with it and played it all the way through, and that's why for fun i gave it five. So anyone who leaves a comment, don't be confused now, i told u. Get the game, enjoy it, i just don't recommend this version. Btw if you are squemish or patriotic skip the offensive secens. The blood is intense, and looks very real. IF not go for it, you'll love the game in its entirety.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek Vazquez \"DaFynestRican\"","summary":"Worthy addition to the DOA series","reviewText":"Although not a sequel, DOA Dimensions is a great \"compilation\" of Dead or Alive's lore and a good starting point for anyone looking to get into the series. It's the first Dead or alive on a portable (aside from the psp game which wasnt a fighting game) AND the first title on a Nintendo system. As a big fan of the series, whose main draw is racks 'n' reversals, I think this portable version is the best one yet.Graphically it's one of the most detailed games on the 3DS system, with great animation and detailed modes. It's probably visually comparable to PS2's DOA Harcore, not quite reaching DOA 4's benchmark for the series, but there are some nice flourishes here and there (I like the visual flashes when connecting with strikes and new dynamic camera shots during throws).The music hasn't changed. If you didn't like it before you wont like it now, but I like that the game retains all the classic DOA tracks, and the stereo sound comes through loud and clear on the 3DS. You can even change the spoken dialogue track from English to Japanese, and while the English track is passable, at least the option is there since part 4 lacked it.The game tries it's best to take all the story elements from each game and meld them in a cohesive and comprehendable timeline in Chronicle mode, and for the most part succeeds. I did find that to do so they had to add a little bit which is a good thing. Fighting game storylines are crap for the most part so it's great Tecmo made an attempt to clear the confusion longtime fans may have had from one iteration to the next while trying to follow the story.To be honest, the 3D effect is a cool feature on the 3DS but it was the last reason I wanted a 3DS, and although for games like Pilotwings it does enhance the gameplay, fighting games like DOA dont gain anything from it. The 3D is nice, with the visuals getting slightly sharper and the sense of depth increased, but the downside is the gameplay takes a hit, going from 60fps to 30fps. With the 3D off the game is smooth as butter and I found the pacing to be better than the previous games. Like I said, not having the 3D on won't make you miss much. The game is great without it and the feature can be shut off easily.As for the fighting mechanics, the game is smooth like I stated before, and there are noticeable improvements. With each game added to the series they shortened the window of time with which you could activate a reversal. After mastering the system in 3, by the time 4 came around it was even shorter! I found myself relying on counter strike and fast combos because trying a reversal always left me open for hurt. Luckily, and most likely to lure in new players, the reversal system is less punishing and frustrating. I'd say it's about back to where it was in part 2. You still need good timing, but you wont be frustrated because of the need to pull off a counter at the millisecond an attack connects. Thank goodness!Dead or Alive Dimensions is a great game for fans of the series and the best place to start for newbies IMO. I'd have given it 6 stars if Samus was a playable combatant :-( but I recommend it to fighting game fans, DOA fans, and those who own a 3DS and have played Street Fighter to death. It's the perfect tide-over until Dead or Alive 5 is announced!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"One More Time, One More Fight","reviewText":"I've been a fan of Dead or Alive (DOA) since DOA 3 released for the Xbox in 2001. Since then I've played them all and have been longing for DOA to go portable, after the dull DOA Paradise released for the PSP I had lost all hope in DOA ever becoming portable until I seen DOA Dimensions for the 3DS (it's actually why I purchased a 3DS). Dimensions is just as fun and addicting as the console versions, and offers the biggest character roster yet with a total of 25 playable characters. In Dimensions there is a total of 10 play modes the main one is Chronicle mode, this tells the story of all 4 DOA's and brings you up to speed with what has happened in the series so far. All the CG's used in the previous games have been reused here . Unfortunately if you don't have any idea about the DOA universe Chronicle mode's story will make little, if any, sense to you. Chronicle mode does not take very long to beat, about 3-4 hours. After that you have survival mode, arcade mode, and tag team which are all very fun and get harder with each course, after you beat a course you unlock either different costumes, or different portraits for all the characters. You also have to work to unlock the roster list as you only have 5 people available to you at the start of the game.Graphically Dimensions is stunning, I honestly could not believe that this little handheld was so powerful, Dimensions graphics sits at around the Dreamcast level and runs smooth  in 2D and 3D although the 3D does make the game run slower. I had a fun time with 3D as it was something different but liked the 2D better (things move faster.) Music is also pretty good but there was nothing catchy or overly memorable, voice acting was also pretty good, the voices can be set to either English or Japanese with subtitles on or off. The English voice acting is decent enough but all the battle cry's are still in Japanese. Overall this is a great first time portable entry for DOA which I recommend to any 3DS owner who likes fighters or DOA in general.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCML6","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"The sequel I was waiting for.","reviewText":"Animal Crossing on the GameCube is one of my top 10 favorite games. I wouldn't be surprised if I spent over 400 hours playing that game. It was such a simple, basic concept that managed to hold my interest and keep me coming back every day. Whether it was to get a new fish I hadn't caught before, find all the fossils for the museum, get every K.K. Slider song, or trade items with other people using the pretty impressive password system, I absolutely loved that game. Wild World on the DS and City Folk on the Wii, however, didn't win me over at all. They had more content, yet there was somehow less to do. Everything seemed dumbed down, and the new content didn't add much to the overall experience. What happened? Cut to a few years later when the first footage for New Leaf was shown. Things were starting to look good again! The graphics clearly got better while the tone and look of everything remained the same, the music sounded great, you could actually do NEW things like swim, and most importantly, the game looked fun. I couldn't wait to get it and go back into the world of Animal Crossing. Of course, I couldn't wait for my daughter to play it too, as she'd heard enough from me about how great the first game was, and wondered why I always complained about City Folk.New Leaf starts you out in similar fashion to the previous games. This time, you- the first person who creates a profile on the game, are the mayor of the town. With the help of your friendly assistant Isabelle, everything is arranged for you to start a new life here. And just like with the old games, your first home isn't much to look at. Pick a location for where you want your house to be, and soon it'll be time to start paying for it! This is where the 'main' part of Animal Crossing is. As you pay for your house, renovations become available. Add a second floor, a basement, an extra room, make a room bigger...do what you want! You can pick from different roofs, fences, doors, mail boxes and the ground around your home if you visit Tom Nook's business. If you're new to Animal Crossing, paying for your house is easy. You can collect fruit, fish, bugs and sea shells and sell them at the local shop for Bells- the town's currency. Helping other villagers can also net you presents like wallpaper, carpet or furniture for your home, or clothes or new kinds of fruit. Different kinds of fruit fetch different prices at the shop, so make sure you pay attention to what gets the most! Also located around town are markings in the grass that look like cracks. If you dig these up with a shovel, 9 times out of 10 you'll dig up a fossil. Take it to the museum where it can be assessed and either returned to you, or added to the museum's display. You can take fish, bugs and works of art here as well.But that's not all! Also open for business are several stores by the museum. As you progress with paying off your home and doing other chores, new places open up. The shoe shining skunk from City Folk now has his own shoe store called Kicks, and the hair stylin' poodle makes a return as well. In fact, I've seen most of the secondary characters from the old games so far, with the exception of Wendell the walrus. Gulliver, Dr. Shrunk, Gracie, most of the old gang is here! Customize your look by going to the Abel Sisters' shop, where you can buy new shirts and hats, and even design your own outfits. There's a cool new feature that uses the 3DS camera to scan QR codes and upload images to use for patterns. I'm amazed every time I go to the shop and find something new I like, whether it's a new hat or accessory for my character. I have one entire box in my dresser, with all 6 pages, dedicated to hats and accessories.You might be asking, \"so what are you supposed to do in this game?\". That's the thing- you just go about your daily life! You never really 'beat' the game. I guess you could say that completely paying off your house, getting every single fish/bug/fossil/artwork, buying every single item to fill up your store catalog, getting every K.K. Slider song...doing all of that can count as completing the game, though there's no ending. This is the kind of game that's always going to be waiting for you to play it when you need to- the kind of game you can count on, as weird as that may sound. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a charming game like no other, and the perfect pick up and play game. Want to just check the shop for something new and that's it? Go for it. Do you just want to harvest some fruit, get some Bells and pay a little bit of your loan? Fine, do it! There's never anything here that forces you to keep going, or prevents you from saving and putting it down.The graphics in New Leaf are beautiful considering the style of the game. Everything just plain looks better. From the trees to the ocean, to how your human character looks, to animations for gestures and facial expressions, Nintendo really outdid themselves. Characters still talk in that cute Animal Crossing gibberish, and the music, while maybe not as memorable as the first game's that changed every hour and with the weather, is definitely beyond City Folk's forgettable soundtrack. The best part for this installment though, to me, is that saving and loading times are VERY short! It's crazy how quickly you can save and quit the game given the amount of content here. Finally I'll mention the online play. Visiting other towns is a blast! You can really walk around an explore another person's town with barely any limits. Thanks to the quick load times, there's nothing that makes visiting a friend time consuming.I could go on and on about New Leaf. We've had the game since a week after it came out, and my daughter and I are still playing it regularly. It's fun trying to collect all the special items for events like Halloween, and we panic whenever a favorite villager is on the verge is moving out. Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a perfect game. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, or -the- perfect game. I just have zero complaints with it. This is the sequel that I wanted nearly 10 years ago when I first played the GameCube one. The new Pokemon games may be out now, and raking in the sales, but if you ask me, this right here is the must-have game for the 3DS. I'm 28 years old, have distanced myself from Nintendo over the years because of some of their choices, and I should mention that it takes a lot to really impress me when it comes to games. I don't just give out 5 star ratings for games based on the developer or how much praise it gets (oh, just wait until my review of Shadow of the Colossus goes up soon). Animal Crossing: New Leaf deserves 5 stars, and it deserves a spot in your game collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0053BCML6","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"New Leaf, Old Tree","reviewText":"Let it be known that between RPG grind-fests, oddball art games and the latest AAA titles, I enjoy an unhealthy amount of \"Animal Crossing.\" The last portable incarnation, \"Wild World\", easily received hundreds of hours of my attention, and despite its myriad of problems, it remains one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've ever had. But in 2013, many of the clunky interface issues and limited span of things to do simply will not fly in a modern game. That's why I'm greatly overjoyed that Nintendo has definitely improved the AC mechanics in as many ways possible without changing the core experience here. Make no mistake, \"Animal Crossing: New Leaf\" is more of the same, but delivered in the best possible way.There's not much by way of \"story\" here, as expected. Your custom character arrives at your custom town (the layout of which you can select at the beginning of the game) to discover that he/she is now the mayor of the town. After a brief rundown of basic game mechanics with your perky (read: adorable) secretary Isabelle, you're set loose in a town filled with talking, anthropomorphic animals. Over the course of real-world years, you're expected to expand local businesses, improve local agriculture, and turn your home into a sprawling mansion filled with rare items.If you've played an AC game, you know the drill. The conniving Tom Nook screws you over (he does it worse than ever here, but I won't spoil) at the beginning of the game, you pay off your debt to him, your house gets upgraded, rinse, repeat. All the while, you make friends, fish, water plants, hunt bugs and dig up fossils that can sold or donated to the museum. This time around, though, there's a flea market where you can set prices for items, and buy stuff from other townsfolk. The addition of the store adds an interesting element to the game, as you find yourself going back and forth between stores, seeing where you'll get the better deals.  It's a nifty little mechanic that adds a new level of depth to the game.While this does seem like an old hat of a game on paper, it's all about the execution, which is where \"New Leaf\" truly excels. The controls are tighter than they've ever been, thanks to a completely retooled interface. Gone are the days of having to go into menus to dig out equipment; switching between nets, shovels, watering cans, etc, is now allocated to the D-Pad, making it much more convenient to do what you want, when you want to do it. Also welcome are little graphical changes, such as shimmering flowers to indicate you've watered them for the day, and birds that perch atop bulletin boards to indicate a new message. Little things like this help make the game more streamlined.Another great thing about the game are the enhanced internet capabilities. Visiting your friends' towns is back, of course, but the biggest draw here is the ability to mingle with players from around the world on a tropical island. You can see what their towns look like, among other things, which is a first for the franchise. Then there's the \"Dream Suite\", which lets you upload a \"dream\" of your town to the internet for other players to explore, and the Happy Home Showcase, which lets you see the homes of other players you've met via StreetPass. This is the most online entry in the franchise yet, and it's nice to see in Nintendo embracing internet play finally; it definitely bodes well for the upcoming \"Smash Bros\", after \"Brawl\" had such an abysmal online mode.This is also the best-looking AC yet, with beautiful textures that easily trump \"City Folk\". Water glistens and fluidly moves, characters have elaborate and varied animations, and every detail of the landscape is rendered with beautiful clarity. 3D helps to add an extra level of depth to the game, but other than that, it's actually one of the most unremarkable usages of the feature I've seen in a first-party 3DS title. On the audio front, we have an incredibly safe soundtrack. It's pretty and relaxing, and one of the best in the series, but it's definitely very similar to other entries, and it doesn't rock the boat in too many ways. In my opinion, it didn't need to, but a little more variety would have been nice.Nintendo has easily made the best \"Animal Crossing\" game yet here. There's more to do in this than in any previous entry, the controls are pitch-perfect, and the entire experience is absolutely beautiful, especially considering that it's a handheld title. That being said, not much has changed in the core gameplay and sound department, and while that won't bother the fanbase (myself included), it makes me start to wonder how long the venerable developer can keep doing the same thing repeatedly until it starts to get old. Until then, though, \"New Leaf\" is a really fun little game, and one that I expect to hold me over for not months, but years to come.Plot: 8Gameplay: 8.75Graphics: 9.5Sound: 8.75Overall: 8.75Update (6/11/13): Because of the nature of this game, I'll throw up a new update every now and again if something of note pops up. Today, my game introduced the feature of public works projects and ordinances. The former allows you take requests to alter your town, then gather donations in order to complete them, and the latter lets you change the times of local stores to suit your playing time better. Also more fleshed-out is the island, at which you can eventually unlock a wetsuit that allows you to swim around (a series first.) I stand by my original score, but this is a most impressive development, and without a doubt makes it the best and most varied \"Animal Crossing\" yet.Update (7/7/13): It's been about a month, and things have gotten pretty interesting! A dance club opened up in town, payments for getting a house have steeply increased, and there are still new tools to unlock and creatures to catch. The added variety of deep-sea diving definitely helps. Furthermore, the adorable Isabelle gets a much more defined personality, as does Sable, who works at the clothing store. If you build your relationship with the latter, you'll unlock the ability to get new patterns via QR codes scanned in via 3DS Camera. Not only that, but you'll get cool backstory about the Able Sisters, which ties into past games. Still a solid 8.75 in my book!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2013"}

It has been brought back with the soul ability for online play and enjoyment. With a maximum player number of 32, Warhawk gives us a genuine chaotic war feel that makes this game fast paced and just a hell of a lot of fun.There are a number of different games that you can play against online opponents including Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Zones and a few others. Two new gameplay modes called Collection and Hero have been added with the new 1.4 expansion pack. A new map was also added with the pack, which give a further extension of the game, thus enhancing the enjoyment. Vehicles include Jets, Tanks and 4x4 Cars with a gun turret. There is also a hover type flying craft which allows up to 5 people in at once and have the ability to control individual weapons.I did buy this online via the Playstation Store which meant I got it for half price, but I think selling this game outside of the Playstation Store, but giving a free Bluetooth headset option is a good move. There is a further 1.5 expansion which is going to implement the newly created Trophies feature, and is also rumoured to be giving us a new map. Being online gives this game limitless possibilities, from the number of people in one game to the number of updates we can be given. Due to the constant expansions, there is no need for a sequel. I do, however, in a further expansion hope to see the maximum number of people increased to 60 or more.

The best part of BC1 was the open environment: you could attack positions from any direction, the wacky characters, a lighthearted plot and tooling around the roads and fields in numerous vehicles. BC2 just doesn't deliver on the same scale. Just a few vehicles, very limited exploration possibilities ( if you step outside the lines you get a warning about being targeted by enemy artillery ), and a lot of cursing instead of humor. Basically, I feel that EA Games is trading on the success of the original and turning out an inferior product just to capitalize quickly. BC2 is more like a CoD wannabe and falling short in that also. So, in short, BC2 offers nothing new (so you can collapse a building - big deal) and a lot less of the things that made the original so unique. If EA Games follows up on this franchise, I hope they can regain their vision of the Bad Company.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Walton \"loghyr\"","summary":"Almost Great","reviewText":"Two highly-irritating foibles make this game a borderline \"4\" for me:The first is one of \"sensitivity\", which results in having to replay some sequences WAY too many times. The fairly-cool \"jump-float\" maneuver that Alice has is so sensitive that unless you execute it flawlessly, 50% of the time (for me) it doesn't work. I would have advised a maintenance release for this flaw.The second is one which all too many video games contain nowadays: when you replay the game you are unable to bypass enormous cut scenes. And when you are replaying a sequence, even the first time through, not only must you replay these scenes, but when they are part of a lengthy sequence which has no save-points (a frequent occurrence), then you must replay each and every mind-numbing cut scene in the sequence (possibly due to the hubris of the graphics artists and/or the game producer on their behalf).So almost a great game, but not worth full-price. Now that it is under $20, if you enjoyed the first \"Alice\", check this one out. But be prepared to be hopelessly frustrated at times...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003DNH95K","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Surprisingly Decent Game","reviewText":"I went into this game expecting the worst after all of the reviews I read, but I actually really enjoyed the game. I mean it definitely has problems, especially a lack of polish, but it was a really fun game, especially for fans of the Lord of the Rings. The game relies on a hack and slash or third person shooter gameplay, and both forms can work well. However, certain limitations could be really annoying, specifically limited ammo for the dwarf and ranger, and how much mana was used for each distance attack for the sorceress. Also, I found the health and mana potions to be annoying in how limited they are, along with how ineffective they are where they don't replenish too much of your status bar, and it's a regeneration instead of an immediate effect. Death could also be annoying where you have to rely on you AI companions to revive you, and when you try to revive your companions it takes too long and many times the reviving character is killed. Overall, I was a bit surprised at the difficulty in the game, especially with some of the bigger enemies, some of the battles were extremely frustrating, and this could have been slightly helped with more and/or better placed checkpoints. The leveling system was also a little odd, there was a relatively huge upgrade tree, and even at the end of the game I felt a little underpowered and wished that I could have access to more of the skills. Related to this, it was odd how all of your upgrades don't work for when you switch characters, where the AI controlled characters are different from your characters. I think this is caused by the game's multiplayer, but I would have liked if the other characters were the versions that I upgraded. I also would have loved it if I could have switched the characters on the fly, instead of switching them at the end of levels, and sometimes being stuck with a character that might not be appropriate for that level's battles.Still, because I had low expectations, despite the problems I really enjoyed the game. With some more polish, I think this could have been great. If you're a fan of Lord of the Rings and RPG's, with the game at its current price I would definitely recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"I Dare Say That World at War is the Best COD","reviewText":"I have played Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: World at War and I would say that the World at War is the best. Why do I say that? Because WoW has more meat in it. The other two has better graphics but WoW has more of the good stuff. I found the other two to be too short and too linear. Wow, although by its very nature is also linear, allows you more freedom to move around and tackle each situation as you see fit. Let's say you want to tackle a group of enemies at the front but you have enemies closer to you. You can evade the closer ones and move towards the ones in front.Another thing that I really liked about WoW is that it is more dynamic. You can tackle each situation with different weapons or strategy. And within each offensive you can decide how to attack be it shooting and then going for cover and then shoot again. Or you can go Rambo style guns-ablazing but it doesn't always work as you can be flanked by enemies. That leads to the A.I. The A.I. here is a mixed bag but I found them to be at times to be sweet. They will look for you and shoot you down. But there are times where, you'll catch yourself laughing, the enemies will not see you by their side as they are shooting at your comrades.The one thing that draws this game maybe a little is the grenades. They can spawn at almost anywhere, even where there are no enemies in sight. Of course, they may be hidden. It can get so hectic with grenades spawning at the least momentous situation where you feel like you've made headway. You end up going back to where you started but this wasn't often enough that you will pull your hair out. But it does occur more than you'd like it to. If a Treyarch or Infinity Ward employee sees this, I hope they see this point in regards to grenade or frag fests.The ending credits were supported with some of the best soundtrack that I have ever heard in a video game. I will definitely look for the music soundtrack for this game. The guitar riffs and drumming has got to be the most appropriate and awesome in gaming history. In fact, the game throughout has some of the sweetest soundtracks and sound effects. I don't get the reviews that state that the sound effects for the guns were not very good. I have played all three next-gen COD's and this one has just as good sound effects for the weapons and explosions. The machine guns sounded realistic and so did the handguns. Maybe these people had terrible speaker systems. I played the game for the most part on my tv's speakers and they did sound good. Of course they sound better when played with a stereo or surround system. One of the other COD's did have a better ending credit where you watch a video of the museum of the game. But the soundtrack to WoW is better. They should have shown a montage of the high points of the game to go with the ending soundtracks.I give props to the previous COD's for building one of the best, if not, THE best engine out there. I would say that it is better than HALO or Gears of War and I have played all of those series. But give Treyarch credit for taking the ball and running with it. They made a immersive game that is also immense. It is simply a joy to play this game. If there ever was a video game that is a keeper for me, this is it.Speaking of sound effects, this game has Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman doing voice-overs. I noticed that the marketing department did not mention this on the box. They should have. I am sure that they spent quite a lot of money to hire Mr. Sutherland to do voice work for them. As a fan of his I would have been drawn to it more because of the fact that he did the voice for one of the characters. The voice work in this game is tremendous. Funny how the same happened with Fallout 3 where Liam Neeson did the voice for one of the characters. And he did a great job in that one.Finally, the bonus content after you complete the game is THE sweetest bonus in all of gaming history. I can not get enough of it. The bonus game involves you fending off zombies as you are trapped in a building. You earn points by killing zombies which you use to upgrade your weapon and repair the boards on windows to keep zombies out. The fact that a friend can join you for the frag fest is an added bonus. The co-op bonus game is also great. The only drawback is that you cannot have a true co-op game throughout as you have to select a stage and you and your friend must complete it together. There are no saves either. But I am not complaining as the main game is so well made. I will replay this game eventually after I have played some other games and feel like going back to some sweet shooting fun. And the zombie shooting game is also another one that I will most definitely go back to. This game alone makes for a great party game. This has to be the best shooter, bar none. An employee for some other video gaming company reading this should also make note that we consumers want more for our hard-earned dollars. After all, the price of a video game costs more than a lot of things such as a nice wristwatch or jacket.If you have to make a decision between the three COD's, you should select this version. It is simply the most fleshed out of the three. Also, you get the zombie shooting game which in itself is a complete game. The story in all three are fragmented but this is video gaming after all, a shooter mind you. They could probably merge the story line more but what they did was enough in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2010"}

Allen","summary":"Wait it out....","reviewText":"Too Human is a hit or a miss for most people.On paper, Too Human sounds great, but when you're actually playing the game, it becomes quite a different thing.In my opinion, the game breaks down into two pieces: story and game play.The story of Too Human is based on the Norse Mythology gone techno. I'm not familiar with the Norse religion, but those of you who have played Valkyrie Profile would have a basic idea of the religion. The \"big picture\" of Norse religion is that it is based heavily on warfare. Now that sounds like fun, but Too Human puts an added mixture to it: robots and cybernetic humans.I believe the biggest fault of the story of Too Human is the fact that nearly everything is related to technology. I feel that stories that rely heavily on technology tend to detach the main characters from the player. What I mean is, when you're fighting robots and so fort, you sort of feel detached because there isn't any sort of emotional relationship with the characters since robots aren't \"alive.\" While playing Too Human, I didn't feel attach to any of the characters. I felt that the friends and foes you meet are just generic and not only that, it felt as if the creators just forced the characters on you. I mean there isn't any sort of hatred or love for any of the characters. You know certain characters have a past together, but the game just doesn't develop it well enough for you to get emotionally attached to.The next piece of the game is the game play. Most of the time, you will be fighting and this game has a unique combat system. Instead of button mashing to combo opponents, you must use the right thumbstick to fight. The thumbstick fighting is relative to your enemy's position from the character. For example, if your enemy is to the left of the screen, simply move the right thumbstick to the left, and you will attack. This sounds all fine, I believe, but it's not intuitive in my opinion. What I'm getting at is that combat is not smooth at all and it feels rather automated. Simply move the thumbsticks and you will fight. You don't even get that many moves and even more so the enemies don't seem to challenge you all that often and when they do strike, it's usually because you're overwhelmed by enemies.Speaking of combat, it's inevitable that you will die in this game. However, this game is quite unique in it's death system. Unlike most game, you continue where you left off and the only real penalty is that you lose your combo count - a meter that fills as you fight and as it grows it gives stat bonuses as well as the ability to use moves. This is really a hit or miss and in boss fights, you don't even really need to fight... simply do small damages, die, return to life, and then recycle.Aside from combat, from time to time, you will be walking in town. The fact is the towns might as well be empty because you have zero chance to interact with people. On occasion you may hear people talk about you, but you have no chance to interact with anyone. I mean normally in games, I sort of ignore the townfolks, but in this game, I'm begging to just talk to someone. Simply put, when you're in town, you just go to some location, and then you're done.Too Human has RPG elements to it in the sense that you level up and gain new equipments. If anything, this game has a full array of unique weapons, armor, and skills for you to try out. I must say I was quite happy to see how much stuff you get.However, there are some serious flaws with Too Human's RPG system. First off, as you level up, so does your enemies. You don't really fight all that much, but simply a harder version of the previous enemies you fought.The second flaw of the system follows the above. Remember how I said you can gain many new equipments and weapons? Well, you sort of have to change them over and over as your enemies changes. Basically, if you found some really cool set of weapons, you'll eventually have to change them either because they broke (yes weapons and equipment degrades as you die I believe - another penalty for death I believe), or because you leveled up and now the weapon is useless.Overall, I am half happy with the game. In my opinion, if you're unsure to buy this game after reading the many reviews on it, wait it out. What I mean is wait until it becomes cheaper or at least trade in games. I have a younger friend who plays a lot of games, and he doesn't have a job so he gets money through chores and his parents. I felt really bad that he wasted 60 of his hard earned dollars for this game and only to be disappointed by it. If you have friends or family members you plan to buy this as a gift for his/her birthday, I say have the receipt handy in case.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The long awaited sequel is ruined by poor gameplay design choices","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visuals, story, neat gameplay ideas, very creepyThe Bad: Bad physics, stiff sluggish controls, bad combat, driving shouldn't be annoying, some puzzles are badly set upI was so excited for Alone in the Dark for such a long time that I never thought it would be an (almost) bad game. I don't want to rag on this game since the developers did try really hard, so as a courtesy I'm going to start with the positives. The first thing you'll notice are the visuals; they are amazing. The graphics have high res textures, amazing lighting effects, creepy fog, and it's all very dark and surreal. You'll be playing as John Carnby who is trying to find out the secrets of Central Park while trying to stop Lucifer from taking over the world through \"The Path of Light\".In the beginning of the game everything is very cinematic and pretty fun. The game walks you through the \"mixing system\" where you look in your jacket and mix tons of things together at your will. If you want a molatov cocktail stick a handkerchief in a glass or plastic bottle, light it with a lighter and BOOM! Hey you want it to stick to solve a puzzle? Add some sticky tape and your good to go. Need to light your way through a dark tunnel but need it landed in one precise area without it bouncing? Add some tape to that, or you just take an explosive bottle and shoot it in mid-air...don't worry the John keeps track of the bottle in slow motion it's just your job to time the shot.There are also environmental weapons such as setting 4x4s on fire and lighting enemies up with them, use them to light your path, take fire extinguishers to put out fire, or you can use them as battering rams to take down doors. While the combination system is really fun it does have it's limits, but we'll get to the down sides later. The next thing you'll come across will be the combat and there are more downs than ups too this. The one good part is you can use anything at your disposal. While you can only kill the demons (they are pretty damn creepy) with fire there are multiple ways to do this. Have a health spray, or any type or aerosol? Use your lighter for a mini flamethrower.Another great aspect of the game is everything is seen visually. There are no meters or bars anywhere, so your health is indicated by wounds on John's body. Bleed too much and you get a timer to find some bandages fast. There are also car scenes, and Central Park is kind of a much Grand Theft Auto type map where you can get in and out of random cars to kill \"evil roots\" which are a huge pain in the you know what to find, but more on that later. What's really cool is that if there are no keys you can hotwire the car to start it by matching colored wires, so this gives the game a more of a \"I gotta hurry and get the hell out of here\" type feeling. While these are the main elements of the game there are just way too many down sides.The physics in the game are busted so everything is either really floaty, really heavy, or just plain wonky looking. Nothing really moves around right in the game and this really sucks since a lot of the game is built around physics. When it comes to combat the game just wants to hate you. While there are very little supplies in the game to begin with it's so hard to kill 8 demons when you only have one spray can. While you can only kill with fire is really dumb since you have a gun, but it won't kill them unless you poor gasoline on the bullets. I found this really stupid and when you try to kill the evil roots near the end of the game you will go mad trying to use the little supplies you have for the root, yet trying to fend off the demons.The controls are just really wonky and don't really work. In third person you can only move with the left stick and you swing things around with the right, but the movement is just really limited. This really sucks when an enemy is behind you and you have to fiddle with the left stick to get John to turn around. The driving is also another pain since the physics really suck. You'll stuck on the slightest slope or little rock and your car will go flying. Demons can come rip you or of your car...or rip the car off you and it's really hard to shake them off. Thanks to the crappy physics you just slightly bump something they go flying off yet they can jump 400 feet. The controls just feel stiff and sluggish and they aren't very responsive sometimes, so this makes everything overall harder than it should be. At least the last positive is the voice acting is good, the story is great, and the DVD type skip feature really helps. I can't recommend this game unless you feel like struggling through this annoying game. It's worth playing for the visuals, story, and great gameplay ideas, but you'll struggle more than smile.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Performance wise, it feels like a 360 controller and definitely meets the mark.  I play games like Call of Duty and this controller keeps coming back for more.  My only complaint is that the Analogue sticks don't quite work as well as the 360 controller but they are still very good.  I haven't noticed a bad dead zone like other reviewers so maybe they have improved on that issue with the newer version of the controllers.  Last thing to mention is that this is also wireless and rechargeable via a USB charging cable just like your regular Playstation 3 controller.Final Verdict - even with the Analogue sticks not quite reaching the mark, I am still giving this controller 5/5.

For PS3 there's the official, Sony-made,PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controllerand then there are the third party offers, which is fine because competition is good.This one is not bad per se, especially for someone who spends most of the time with an Xbox 360 but I couldn't think of good reasons to actually pay more for a controller that does less than Sony's.Let's start with the positives, and there are a few:- Xbox-like shape and buttons layout which, like I said, may be a positive for someone used to Xbox controllers.- Nice black-and-grey on top and red on the button color style, it really looks good, or dramatic.- Non-shiny finish - you'll never see fingerprints on this one.And then there are the negatives or missing features, and some of them are quite major:- No Bluetooth support requires a dongle to be inserted into one of the PS3's USB ports and the current models only come with two.- No Six-Axis support. You can tilt and shake this controller all you want and nothing is going to happen whether the game you play supports the feature or not.- The 'Home' button which is instead the PS3 won't give you the controller's charge level when pressed.- The little red lights that show you which 'number' your controller was assigned faces toward the player, always visible, which is annoying.- The L2/R2 triggers look and feel thin and cheap. I'll go as far as stating that all buttons feel 'cheap'.- The Select and Start buttons are small and crammed together with a useless Turbo button which makes them more difficult to reach.- There appears to be a slight response delay. This is subjective and we are probably talking about fractions of a tenth of a second but it was noticed independently by both myself and my kids.- It's significantly heavier.- It's significantly bulkier, much larger than the PS3 original.Yes, you CAN use this controller but unless you just can't stand PS3's own and must have something that's Xbox-like, I couldn't justify actually paying more for what most PS3 gamers would consider to be less.______________________________________________REALITY CHECK:There are 4 PS3 users in our household and we all tried the SC-1. As far as I know, none of us has picked it up again once the testing session was over.

In single player players primarily utilize Ezio's weapons of choice, the hidden blade and crossbow, while in multiplayer modes players gain access to a wide variety of weapon, depending on the character they choose to play as. Examples of this include: the Axe, wielded by the Executioner; the Fan, used by the Courtesan; the Syringe, the tool by the Doctor; the Dagger, used by the Priest; the Switchblade, carried by the Prowler; and the Claw, used by the Nobleman.Key Game FeaturesAs Ezio, a legendary Master Assassin, experience over 15 hours of single player gameplay set in the living, breathing, unpredictable city of Rome.Recruit and train promising young Assassins.

You are Desmond trying to escape the modern day Templars. You find a new location to setup the Animous and continue going through Ezio's memories. Ezio starts off where he ended in ACII trying to escape the guards. You take on the Templars and their allies the Borgia. The story continues in Rome.Gameplay: Similar to ACII, you take on missions that advance the plot, and various side missions, such as viewpoints, setting up guilds, finding flags and treasures, rescuing citizens, taking down Borgia towers, etc. The difference in this game is that after you destroy 15 Borgia towers, you can then recruit and train new assassins. You can level them up by sending them on time-based missions throughout Europe. You don't actually see the missions, but you find out the results. The success rate is determined by a percentage you are given based on the number of assassins you send, and the difficulty of the mission. You can reach 100% success if you send enough assassins. Some missions require max level assassins to complete. You can use them in real time by calling on them to assassinate and aid in combat. Like in ACII in the city of Monteriggioni, you can invest in Rome, buying and renovating buildings, shops, adding paintings, etc. and collect the extra amount of income earned from the upgrades at any of the banks around the city. Leonardo is back to help you again with inventions and upgrades. Some of the new weapons include poison darts, a crossbow, and the ability to pick up and use heavy weapons after an upgrade is purchased. You can now ride horses in the city and initiate horse-based assassinations. Stealth still has a role in this game, though not to the extend of AC or ACII. You can still use groups, benches, haystacks, etc. to hide in but unless your wanted level is high, the need to blend in is minimal. The ability to move throughout the city has never been easier with quick access to roof tops using merchandise lifts or using a tunnel system to get from one point of the city to another instantly.Multiplayer: AC:Brotherhood is the first game in the series to feature a multiplayer mode. The players are Templars in training at the Abstergo facility. They use the animi seen at the beginning of ACII to access memories of old Templars and to acquire their skills using the \"bleeding effect\". Eight game modes total; Wanted, Alliance, Manhunt, Chest Capture, Advanced Wanted, Advanced Alliance, Escort and Assassinate. The different maps include the areas from ACII and brotherhood like Florence, Rome, Castel Gandolfo, Siena and Mont Saint-Michel. Stealth is a major part of multiplayer. You must hunt down targets while being hunted yourself. You earn points by performing assassinations, defending yourself, getting bonuses or completing certain objectives. You can level up in multiplayer which allows you to unlock rewards by earning experience points during the matches and gaining new levels. You can unlock abilities, perks and streaks. Abilities can be used again only after a cool down time, perks can be equipped before the match and they are active all the time, while streaks are bonuses awarded for reaching certain number of successful or failed contracts.Conclusion: Controls are fluid and easier than ever to use. Both the story of Ezio and the story of Desmond advance in this game. I look forward to the conclusion of Ezio's story in next installment, called Revelations. Multiplayer is shockingly good and well thought out. The AC series is one of my favorite and I would recommend this to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2011"}

I decided to buy this game over a month ago and I must say there is a lot to like here. The real problem with the game lies with the &#34;glitches&#34; and &#34;crashes&#34; unfortunately. It's ABSOLUTELY mandatory that you save very frequently or you run the risk of losing progress due to games freezes, crashes and glitches marring that mar your experience.I HAVE enjoyed the game so far ... there are many side quests and multiple endings to the game (if you are into that sort of thing). Being able to modify weapons and the ability to bring along companions is great. The companion side quests are very interesting and it adds a new dynamic I did not see in Fallout 3. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Fallout series, you won't be disappointed. Just be aware that there will be some frustration with the game play. Most of the major gaming websites touched n this in their reviews .......... it has glitches and the game has a tendency to freeze.  Supposedly over 200 patches have been made to this game (from what I've read). There is also a forum available for players to share &#34;bugs&#34; and &#34;work arounds&#34; to parts of the game (yes even 3 years later !). Why the 4 star rating ? .... when the game plays smooth and you can look past the &#34;bugs&#34; its a fantastic story and a great role playing game. I would have given the game 5 stars but there are far too many issues (as I've noted) to give it a higher rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2013"}

You have various attractions spaced around a hub, and you can go in and out of them as you wish. As you earn points you unlock decorations for your park.The games are quite fun! Sure, they aren't long, epic tales. Still, they're great for parties. For example, I adore the Luigi's Ghost Mansion game. One player gets the mini-screen unit so they are the ghost and they can see exactly where they are and where the other players are. The rest of the players only see the TV. So they can see each other but they CANNOT see the ghost unless certain special things happen. It's brilliant.Or, for example, Mario Chase, one person has the smaller screen and they are the hider. They know where they are. The other people are the \"finders\". They get to look at the TV and have to figure out where the hider is.Other games are just one player, or everyone looks at the screen. So there's a mix of games to appeal to all interests. I love Takamaru's Ninja Castle, taking down enemies left and right. Metroid Blast was fun as well.Again, these aren't meant to be long games to suck you in for hours and hours. They're meant to be quick games to help you learn how the system works and to test out a variety of game styles. The game is perfect for that.Is there a down side? If you're expecting it to be a Final Fantasy style epic with character building, relationship creation, and long, arcing storylines, that just isn't what this is about. You'll want to get other games to fill that need. However, for quick, fun, easy-to-learn action, this is definitely a great game to have in the house. When someone comes over and asks, \"What is a Wii U all about?\" you pop this in and show them.I've had this game for three months so this isn't a day-I-bought-it review. This is after three months of solid gameplay.I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.Rating: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

The game is along the lines of Heavy Rain and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, it plays more like playing an interactive movie more so than your typical video game.There are a lot of cinematic cut scenes, which you can skip if you choose to, but I'm not sure why you would want to because then you would miss a good percentage of the story. The visuals are stunning, probably one of the better looking games I've seen in a while.The game is a Japanese port, so all the spoken dialog is in Japanese with English subtitles. Just like with the cut scenes you can skip through the text (which there is an abundance of) if you wanted to, but again I'm not sure why you would, if you were even the slightest bit interested in the story.I'm only a couple hours in and I'm just barely scratching the surface, there's a ton to do in this game, needless to say if this is your cup of tea you won't be bored. There's bowling, darts, pool and even butt kicking, a little something for everyone.So in a nutshell, if you're a FPS faithful or not really a fan of the aforementioned titles, then you may want to pass this game by.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Rises above the formula....","reviewText":"I was one of the few people who didn't openly embrace 'Uncharted 2' when it came out two years ago. It had the strengths of the original game (amazing graphics, fun writing and solid shooting) but added almost nothing to the 'Uncharted' formula. 'Uncharted 3' is a different creature entirely. Not only are the graphics given a major polish, Naughty Dog's globe-trotting adventure sets a new standard for gameplay-design with a pacing that never lets up once.'Uncharted 3' picks up some time after the events of 'Uncharted 2' with treasue hunting protagonist Nathan Drake in search of the lost 'City of a Thousand Pillars'. Joined by his friend Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan and series regulars Chloe Frazer and Elena Fisher (and a few new characters) Nate travels around the world following the footsteps of his supposed ancestor Sir Francis Drake and T.E. Lawerance while being chased by the mysterious (and resourceful) Katherine Marlowe. As with the first two games the overall narrative of 'Uncharted 3' takes a backseat to the charming characterizations and action-packed spectacle. That Marlowe and her side-kick, the unpredictable Talbot are such great villains (being not only threatening but also great parallels to Nate and Sully) is just icing on the cake!The graphics in 'Uncharted 3', as with it's predecessors are absolutely stunning! Everything from busy city streets to underground caverns to vast, unending deserts shows an amazing attention to detail. Very few video games give you that \"you are really there\" feeling and 'Uncharted 3' never disappoints. Even the character models were given a major overhaul with fluid animations that seem to come alive even as you're controlling them. This is the best looking video game I've ever played!As I said before, my biggest complaint with 'Uncharted 2' was that it didn't add enough new gameplay to separate it from 'Uncharted 1'. 'Uncharted 3' is MUCH more dynamic. The controls are a bit looser this time and aiming isn't as reliable but I think NOT being able to head-shot every enemy in sight adds to the frantic tension of each encounter. There's an even bigger emphasis on cover, stealth, and hand-to-hand combat and the game lets you approach each encounter in different ways (I really liked how you could use water as cover and swim into enemy areas without being noticed right away). Even better than combat, though 'Uncharted 3' makes sure you're always in control of Nate during the game: whether on horse-back or on the hood of a jeep, you control the action with Nate yelling \"go left\" or \"speed-up\" as you move the analog stick. 'Uncharted 3' is still a very linear game but the new emphasis on player-input makes the experience feel more personal and much less scripted than the previous titles.'Uncharted 3' isn't perfect; the puzzles are still embarrassingly easy and the overall story, despite spring-boarding off historical influences can come off as a bit shallow when compared to other next-gen games. But as non-stop, interactive enjoyment from beginning to end I can't think of too many games that can top 'Uncharted 3'. One of the best games of 2011 and a must-play if you own a PS3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

In fact I was so thrilled witht he reviews of it I ran out and bought a Gamecube just so I could play it while I was laid up after my knee surgery.  I love it.  In the spirit of the Sims it is so much fun and open ended just set in a more fatasy type world.  The real time date system is new and innovative in that everyday things change and there are holidays and other special things going on just like real life.  I haven't seen a festival yet but the visiting people are unique.  The only problem I have with the game is that it also moves in real time.  Meaning if you pop the game on after 10 pm the general store is closed and will not open until 9 am.  THis means you have to basically go to sleep and play in the morning if you were planning on selling (the only way to really make money) or buy anything.  I found it frustrating when I first paid off my loan to TOm Nook and he promised me a new house yet I had to wait a whole day just to see it or when you send mail away you have to wait days for responses.  This is almost too realistic for a video game.  What it transpires to is a game you pick up and play for maybe 1/2 to and hour each day then you can turn it off as things to do for that day run dry.  I think Nintendo should look at that issue and perhaps make things happen faster with actions rather than time.  I think the Sims should learn from this as well as the time frame for a day in the Sims was terribly fast! (It used to take me 30 minutes just to go to the bathroom.  I mean were talking number 1 here and that was ridiculous!)  So maybe a game such as either of these with a time scale in the middle would be great.  Anyway back to the game.  If you want a game that is fresh fun and entertaining well get this.  You won't beat it or exhaust it in a day or so trust me.  I also hear it is even more fun when connected to the GBA.  Now I don't own one and am not really planning on it I am curtious.  I don't like how it is very geared to those who own the system as a lot of the games features can only be accessed through the GBA.

This game is unforgiving and requires patients, cunning, twitch reflexes, a bit of memorization and the willingness to die dozens if not hundreds of times on the first play through. The controls are old school, which means that button mashing will seldom earn you victory.

It is all up to you, just make sure you take the time to read up on what you are doing or the uber ring may turn to dust. Everything in the game is about strategy.

Final fantasy series are supposed to be these stories full of epic characters with this amazing stories. I narrowed down some of the good and the bad.The Bad:The story don't make sense, you can't return to previous dungeons or other explorable areas. Also, there's no explorable towns, no people to talk to, no home city, no back story on the characters, no explaining what happened at the ending. I also was looking forward to the superbosses and they were uninteresting. Finding money is almost impossible.The GoodGraphics are amazing, and gorgeous colours. They really nailed the emotions of the characters, they feel very real.

I kept reading that Gods & Kings brought back a lot of the things that were missing, and indeed it does. It's a great expansion.

After VIII I was almost ready to give up, but X and X-2 where vast returns to form, now with XII, they've made leaps and bounds.Unlike X-2 that took away the explorative feeling by having you return to the airship and then simply choose your next location (I didn't like this at all, it feels too much like a level based game than an RPG) FFXII feels more like the original Nintendo versions, you walk, you explore and you choose your own path.The graphics are also excellent. The characters are large on the screen and for the first time you can move the camera (I've missed this on PS2 games, since nearly all the GC games allow this) so you don't feel like every time you walk to close to a way your stuck and can't see around you.The screen expands to 16:9 for widescreen owners (hint, invest in a composite adapter to increase resolution and provide progressive scan capability.) This is the first PS2 game I've owned that offers widescreen.The battle system is simular to Diablo, no more being sucked into battles by invisible foes, they are all there all the time. However, the battle system is much, much better. Also,  you control your party leader as in any FF game, not with some lame mouse pointer! The battles are fast and intense here, no the slow, plotting style of the old FF games. You have added issues to, as more enimies can wonder in and join the battles in progress adding a new dimension to the game. Using gamebits you can give pre-planned general instructions to your party, litterally, they will fight on thier own if you let them!This is the fastest paced, possibly bigest and best looking of the FF series. It has more crossover apeal to the Zelda action/rpg crowd as well and I can't state how addicting it is!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Jerry P.

Sadly, I feel for these previews and reviews as well. I even went against my better judgement and bought the game with it's horrible DRM and limited activation policies. DRM is not the only flaw found in this game.The game is set up with several different gameplay modes, and while fun for a temporay time, is nothing more than what you get from a casual game. The first stage is a very easy Pac-man type game without the maze. You collect body parts to add to your creature, developing it's form as a carnivor or veggie lover. The obstacles? Other creatures are trying to collect parts too. However, anyone that's played a game before will not have any trouble not dying. Afterwards, you get to run around on land and develop your creature while trying to friend or enemy other creatures on the island. This is pretty simple stuff too. Really, after this section, the game just turns into more 'creating' for your own type of creature. That's probably the best thing about the game is buildings, vehicles, and creatures are fully developed by you (as much as you can with their decent variety of add-ons). The problem with this? The AI is horrible and very easy.Really, the game turns into a basic casual game right after you mess around with creature creator. Actually, that's about the time the fun ends. The only fun thing to do is develope your character. Otherwise, the RTS elements in this game likes any strength. This was a serious problem for me, and I've hardly touched the game since day one.Another thing that was highly disappointing is the lack of any multi player. You can only fight against other horrible AI units that are incredible dumb and predictable. This game had to have been made for children or simple people.On top of that, yes, the game is infected with DRM and the most dreadful PC gaming experience on the planet: Limited Activations. If low PC game sales are the effect of software piracy, then these horrible measures taken ONLY on the ones purchasing the game are the effect of piracy. I'd like to point out that the pirates cracked the game before the game came out. Now who is the loser in this situation? The person who bought the game and is limited to so many installs?

Didn't realize how fun it was but one thing bugged me.Story: I played the game a second time so I understood it more so it here it is. The Covenant are attacking Earth under orders from one of the Prophets. Didn't catch the reason why. A group of creatures called Brutes led by Tarturus want to activate Halo without the knowledge Halo kills all life within a 15-000 light year radius.Sound/Music: This I can speak of. The music is downright catchy. They'll be moments of utter nothingness besides game sounds than some catchy techno-esque thing comes on. The voices are good too, but again, see above comment about aliens. The marines are good with some celebrity voices, but since one of them is David Cross, who played Zero in San Andreas who has the most annoying mission ever, I kind of hate the guy automatically.Gameplay: This game is quite fun. Now given the option to Duel wield, you can have a Magnum in one hand and a SMG in the other. You can't throw grenades during this though which sucks cause I love throwing them and the enemy catches it. You can ride some vehicles with my favorite being the Ghost, this kind of futuristic motor bike almost.The AI for the marines is also great too, no longer just shoot haphazardly, although I found myself without marines several times. The enemy AI is nice too, with enemies dodging attacks or crouching to avoid gunfire. One enemy I hate is these Brutes, this rhino-like things who either like to charge or fire grenades, hard to dodge those things.Also cool is you play as the Arbiter, one of the Covenant who's maybe not as bad as his buddies. While Master Chief's black button move is flashlight, Arbiter goes invisible Predator-style, which is just downright fun to get the drop on them. My favorite weapon has to be the Energy Sword, you can do a mad dash and kill them in one hit(except Brutes and these other massive things). And in a have-to-kill-them-but-so-cute way are the Grunts, these little midget things that like to yell at you or if they're on your team, thank you for saving them.Since we don't have 2 controllers, I can't comment on multiplayer but it does give plenty of options and with the addition of Xbox Live, you probably won't leave the house much but with single player, since it's so short, you probably will but you'll kick ass while doing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2005"}

Thats a bad downside.-Will master chief ever show his face!?(It be funny if he was a covenent, but that libally ain't the case)Well Halo 2 definitly outshines the first Halo, but why the 4 star rating, because of it's short story, no bots, and The fact that it wasn't all that groundbreaking like it's predicessor.  But the real reason is that they could have realesed this game a year back, and they delay it all this time, and I just feel somewhat gyped.  I mean come on, without the duel weilding, new weapons, extra multiplayer maps, and Xbox live, this would just be Halo.  I was really hoping for it to go beyond the hype, like San Andreas did, but it didn't.  Those who say Halo 2 isn't better than Halo is definitly lying.  They knew dang well if this came out before Halo, odds are Halo would be sitting on shelves, while this game would be a household product.  Anyone who wants the Xbox live experience, this is the best so far.  Those looking for a Bigtime sequal, might be, a little, or very dissapointed.  To me this game is a nice improvment over Halo, I really brounght this game looking for Live.Peace","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2004"}

Listen, I grew up with Sonic and always preferred the Sonic games over Mario games, but Lost World proves that Mario has aged better. With that said, I do, however, think that both Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations were exceptional games and on par with recent Mario games. Sadly, though, Lost World isn't half the game that Colors and Generations were.My main issues with Lost World:- Controls feel off and imprecise- Much of the level design doesn't cater to Sonic's strengths as a character- Villains are pretty lousy- Difficulty spikesLost World started out looking like it had the potential to be an incredible Sonic game but, sadly, given all of the issues, it's just an okay one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00002STFD","reviewerName":"Nathan T.","summary":"Childhood Game-Nostalgia","reviewText":"I recently went crazy and bought an N64 system, an expansion pak, a memory card, and 13 games. Thing was, it all happened in less than 2 days and it happened cause the sweet memories I had when I was a child. I bought the N64 mainly for the game Zelda: Ocarina of Time (by the way if you've never played it, by all cost and means, do so). However, this game was also part of that sweet memory which I'm trying to relive again.This game, from my experience a long time ago, was fun. The only minor problem is sometimes the lack of directions, camera angle can be changed but sometimes even with the change you don't exactly get just what you want still, and controlling is a little hard sometimes so jumping from one spot to another usually ends up in falling to your doom, but again not if you get use to it. Same for walking on ledges.You start out with a small spaceship (don't know the names that well not much of a star wars fan) and you use your laser guns to kill the small two legged robots (at-st?) and these ropes to entangle and destroy the big ones. Than for the next two levels or so are first person shooters.The thing about this game is that soon it gets boring so what you do is be creative in killing your enemies. For example: Level 2 or something, where you meet these hairy beasts haha, wow, anyways what I do is, they are locked in this room with some guys. So what I do is run in, save up my guns, and run around and open the cages and let them handle those guys. Afterwards you let the two beasts fight each other to save ammo. Trick is to not let them see you and don't disturb them while they are fighting each other. And in the first level I love killing the smaller robots with my own ship. Suicidal style.This game is nice still. I think its quite replayable. It was hard for me to play it then cause I didn't have a memory card and each time I turned the game off I got to start in the beginning of that level again. I never beated the train level.You really can't go wrong with this game. Just don't buy it for more than $15. I bought one that worked great for $7.50. Shop around. Nice day to everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"True to the original (review from an owner of the game)","reviewText":"I am a latecomer to the Tenchu series. I played the original PS1 version only about a month ago and was immediately hooked. This says a lot about a game when it can stand up against the slick PS2 titles that are now available. Anyway I have a review for that on Amazon, so go read that if you want to know more about the original.Suffice it to say, the original is still fresh in my mind when I compare it to Tenchu 3:Pros:- Follows the successful formula of the original very closely.- Much better graphics - some wonderful backdrops.- Easier to handle controls (using the analog stick) and hence easier to pull off cool moves, like the forward jump sommersault. I used this in the first mission and killed the boss that way- very slick.- Does not sacrifice easier control scheme for fewer abilities.- Large environments give you multiple paths to your objective. Also encourages you to explore the space. The first mission I played took a long time to explore the whole space.- AI is better than the original. AIs follow you better than the original- however there are points where they are still pretty blind.- There is now a pre-boss before the main boss.- Wide range of items to use- that can be picked up from slain opponents.- Stealth kills sum up to give you new combo moves.- Multiplayer mode.- Video tutorial system.Cons:- Intro cutscene was not as dramatic as the original but it is still top notch compared to other PS2 games.- You can see farther in this game than the original. By NOT being able to see far in the original, created a greater sense of tension.- Voice acting could still use some work.- Camera can be hard to control in tight spaces.If you are Tenchu fan and want to upgrade your version of the game, this is well worth it.If you have never played the original Tenchu, Tenchu 3 is a satisfying, heart-pounding stealth game.If you like games like Quake where you win mainly by full frontal attacks and massive firepower, then this game is definitely not for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2003"}
{"product_name":"B008SBZD9G","description":"","reviewerName":"crank","summary":"Completely engrossing even if it does nothing new.","reviewText":"Note: PS3 users do NOT have to pay for the PS4 version, beyond the subscription model, when it comes out again for that system.The server issues are fixed at this date and time. Games as large as this one always run into issues. I don't have problems with people docking stars as long as they come back to their reviews, which, in all honesty, they will probably not. And that would be mainstream criticism from the internet. It's mostly pointless. Don't believe these people. Most of them are game addicts who can't deal with issues in life and Amazon is their outlet for their rage. You see a lot of people review this game saying it is one star and their only reasoning is you cannot log in. Well, you can now and everything is mostly fixed. So, their reviews are pretty much... pointless. Why?Because FF14 is the first Final Fantasy since 12 to be any good. Before that you would have to go back to 9 IMHO, though, I never played 11. Even 12 is heavily debated though the International version was easily much better than what we got in America. Anyway, the three main realms that comprise Hydaelyn, a place that is the greatest world they have ever constructed for an RPG bar none, are vast in scale and appropriate to the universe of FF. If anything, I implore the RPG fan to at least put enough time to level up to 25, when you can start to ride your own mount, before deciding if this game is not for them.Even before that soloing the 3 areas of the world is a lot of fun to me, though, I haven't burnt myself out on other MMOs in the past. Sure, you have the same kinds of fetch quests as in any other MMO but here they are at least decent, make sense, and are even written well at times. That isn't the main part of the game imo. The main part of this game is simply seeing all there is to do in this world. Just walking to your next destination and town is enthralling, especially on PC, where the graphics can be as nice and lovely as you want them to be with some minor caveats at launch.Gridania is the typical forested realm but with a lot of nice woodwork and personality, and it also has a snow world attached, done better than just about any in recent memory. Ul'dah is the desert realm with many rivers and mines and such and has a nice starry expanse in various areas. Lastly, Limsa Lominsa is a pirate sea world that is none other than stunning as you make your way through the various nooks and crannies in the countryside, among castles and lagoons and ocean views. In fact, they all look stunning. This team's art direction is the best Square Enix has put out in a LONG time. Period.I honestly cannot get enough of the place. In time this game WILL be supported because you can tell, despite the negativity from the neckbeards on launch, the fanbase seems extremely dedicated on launch, and setting up your own free company to roam with friends or joining another company is very easy and fast. Over 400K concurrent users atm. I think that the only major question is content. But realize that a gamer such as myself has no need or want to play this game for 5 years straight, 10 hours a day, with my fellow hardcore nutters.The job system is typical more or less but very complex and engaging. From your major class such as Thaumaturge or Gladiator you can pick any number of subclasses so to say that have to do with gathering, crafting, etc. You can switch your main class on the fly unless you are in battle or dungeons. You can also accordingly pick a job that is combined with two classes and this will be something like Black Mage or Bard or the like. The class system seems fairly in-depth and it is easy to level your secondary class as it adds a bit depending on how high your main class is.We have only seen a small glimpse of what this whole thing could entail for the future. If the game survives it most certainly will build into a full economy with people doing goldsmith and botany work and also such things as mining and fishing and selling their wares on the vast market for absurd prices. Really, whatever you want to do here you can within the constraints of the system. The system in place is clearly well thought out, though still early in MMO terms, and is only going to get better as it is maintained.As I said this is a big game. You have hunting logs, crafting, gathering, FATEs battles, and many dungeons to bide your time before major raids are released. That doesn't mean you will not get bored it just means there is in actuality quite a lot to do.The story is mostly unvoiced with major scenes receiving audio. This will be a disappointment to some, but with all the terrible voice acting and the major money sink it would have been I can't say I care. Armor and weapons are nicely designed as are the monsters and towns.After the travesty of the last couple of Final Fantasy's let me tell it is a joy to behold walking into a major town with tons of people roaming about. Chatting is easy. The UI is fully customizable and a joy to work with. The controls can take some getting used to in battle but after awhile it becomes second nature. I actually LOVE using the PS3/4 pad on the game along with my mouse for whatever I need it for. Dual control here is the way to go on PC IMO.The game is totally cross play meaning all versions are connected. The PS3 version is terribly gimped in the graphics department, which very well could put some people off. This was expected for a largely very dated machine. I run an i5 2500k at 4.4GHz and a 770 4GB at 1200 MHz Core and this game can still stutter with hundreds of people on screen but ultimately runs great. I do use Sparse Grid Super Sampling at 2-4x though, so most people could be satisfied with lesser settings. You can tune the game pretty much however you want I just don't like the in-game anti-aliasing, which is FXAA and terribly blurry and useless on sub-pixel elements, and the vast amounts of transparent foliage in this game really lend themselves to supersampling if you have the rig. DX11 features and better graphics will come in the future.Try the demo. Make up your own opinion on what you want to do after that just know many of us simply love it because it has brought FF back in a big way. DX11, a PS4 version, and many other features are to come and I only see a bright future for this game if the content is suitable and long lasting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2013"}

Like many, I thought the original had a great concept, looked stunning and seemed to at least break the mold of action games only it got bogged down by repetition and an open world that wasn't quite as open as one would like and let's not forget those ****ing flags. Taking the complaints and suggestions from fans and critics into account, Ubisoft seemed to go all out in presenting a game that felt more bigger and better than the first game but then the crux of the matter is did Ubisoft just deliver what the first one should've been or actually went beyond? Well this game shows that there is legs in this series and whereas the sequel to the first one was inevitable just in terms of sales, this looks like it has the makings to be an actually worthwhile franchise as a whole and it starts here...with nitpicks I hope they fix.Story: You once again \"control\" Desmond, a bartender turned captive by Abstergo Corporation who's using him to locate the Pieces of Eden, mythical artifacts tied to mythology and history. When him and technician Lucy Stillman break out, they bring him back into the past via a new Animus into the life of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian living in 1476. After his father and brothers are betrayed and executed, Ezio becomes an Assassin and takes to the streets of Florence, Venice and many other places to track down the conspirators behind his family's death and how it ties into Desmond's struggle in the future.One thing I will say about the story is that 2 things: one, they definately changed the structure of the game and it's no longer repetitive and some missions do take a different take and give you a lot more options to proceed. Not to mention the story is a lot more engaging and while I was at times concerning the many, many names that pop up and figuring out who was the last dude I had to kill versus who's actually a friend, it's a more compelling story and when it combines mythology, paintings and historical photographs, it's a really cool storyline they got set up.Graphics: Can't fault Ubisoft in the graphics department and like this, Far Cry 2 or Prince of Persia, they have a really great idea for amazing looking visuals and it goes right down to the architecture and I wouldn't be surprised if they recreated Florence or Venice perfectly. Character detail is good, animations during parkour are fluid and certain graphical details such as the \"glitches\" you'll occasionally spot look awesome. As far as actual glitches or bugs, I barely ran into any and if there was, I didn't catch them. My one complaint is that the \"countryside\" areas where it's more forest and meadows look a bit too barren and not really full so to speak.Sound/Music: An absolutely stellar soundtrack with some really haunting and peaceful themes playing throughout and the more dramatic or action-y moments are nicely done. Voice acting as well is spot-on with many voice actors actually sounding like they're from the era and place as opposed to Altair's odd American-sounding accent and it's not the fumble that was Far Cry 2's voice acting. As far as sounds are concerned, everything works and the annoying comments when you climb buildings (\"what's he doing, he gone mad?\") have been toned down so that they're no longer heard EVERY time you climb something. Oh and I'd recommend playing with subtitles because characters have this habit of switching between English and Italian very frequently.Gameplay: While the basics are the same, there's been so many improvements it might be hard to replay the previous game since you don't get access to the new parts. For one combat has been improved and counter kills have now given way to disarming opponents and using their own weapon against them, double assassinations, smoke bombs for easy getaways or poisoning them so they go crazy on nearby NPC's. Don't want to fight anyone and slip by unnoticed? Hire courtesans to distract them, thieves to lure them away or mercs to fight for you. Not to mention there's a lot more added missions with the familiar races but also there's assassination contracts, courier missions, beat-em-up parts where you pummel cheaters and many others. As far as collecting is concerned, there is some of that found in the feathers but there's only 100 as opposed to 100 in each city but then we have glyphs. Uncover a building and find an icon and you'll see somewhere on the building is a glyph, strange markings easily found by using Eagle Vision and scanning them prompts a really intriguing story about Subject 16 where you decode messages, find clues embedded in photographs are doing some riddle solving. While some are really taxing, they're kind of fascinating. Oh and found in Italy are assassin's tombs, basically a mixture of Prince of Persia-esque platforming sections and some combat where you'll uncover treasure; find all 6 and you'll get a cool gift as opposed to just an achievement/trophy and that's it.Another added element is the idea of money. Remember those \"please sir I'm poor and sick and hungry, just a few coins!\" women from the first game? Well remember how you never actually had money to give her and you just had to push her away or if you were feeling devilish, stab her? Well now there is money (though no beggar women, though there's these lute players that get on my nerves) and they can be spent on upgrades such as better armor, better weapons, replenish your poison blades, smoke bombs, buy paintings or tint your cape. Buying paintings or upgrading your villa, a sort of central hub of sorts, will give you more money and like most sim games, depending on how awesome your villa is and the more visitors you attract, the more money you make. One element that isn't as successful is the idea of notoreity. Do more killing and bad stuff than the city can tolerate (which isn't much) and the guards will be more suspicious of you so while before they're a bit more suspect of you, at full notoreity they'll practically want to kill you on sight. How do you bring it down? Find posters that no guard would see, kill officials that don't exactly run that fast or bribe heralds and naysayers instead of...I don't know, roughing them up mafia-style and threatening to break their knees?My one complaint about the game and it's a somewhat big one is the controls. I don't know if Ezio is too sensitive or he needs too precise commands but at times you'll find yourself swearing at him for doing something you never intended to do. He'll drop and hang from a ledge when you intend to jump, he'll run up walls when you intended to go into a door should your aim be off and most unfortunate, he can fall and sometimes to his death because he decided to jump off a building instead of up it. It's of course fun to do the parkour elements but to drop completely to the bottom of the streets cause of a missed jump or not judging the distance right can be frustrating. Oh and while it's a welcome change from Altair's snail pace, the parkour elements up a building are a tad unbelievable and athletic ability aside, you'd wonder how the hell Ezio can even climb half of this stuff at the speed he does. Oh but on that note? Ezio can finally swim and while he can't go underwater and dive like Mario, he can actually go in the water and even use boats as transports though rooftop travelling tends to be faster.For those of you curious, I bought the Master Assassin's Edition so I'll detail what was in it. Found first inside of course is the game but it comes with a bonud DVD where you can listen to tracks from the soundtrack, watch trailers and developer diaries but the soundtrack looks slightly skimpy for a game this size and the \"Part One\" with no inclusion of any others bugs me. Oh and the developer diaries were far more numerous online than what we have here. Underneath that is the really cool artbook showcasing weapon detail, character designs and concept art for the cities. Still doesn't beat the Fallout 3 book for me but it's a notable one nonetheless. And of course under that is the Ezio figurine with some cool details and in a pose like seen on the cover. He's not posable but meh, it'll do. Included also in the game is 2 \"bonus\" areas: basically at a certain part in the game, an icon will appear on your map marked a \"templar lair\" and these are basically obstacle course type levels which'll yield a nice big cash sum at the end. Nothing completely awesome like new weapon or different armor but they're cool nonetheless. Also, in a welcome move on Ubisoft's part, apparently these areas will be made available for download sometime later as opposed to \"either pre-order it or you'll never get it\" offers given by other developers.Is it my Game of the Year? Hard to say given the sheer amount of great games that came out this year but I'll say I definately enjoyed playing the game issues aside and would love to say a part III very soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2009"}

TESV is ambitious to say the least, and Bethesda have created a visually stunning (especially if you install the high-res texture packs and graphics mods available) and hugely immersive experience. SKYRIM is a large, varied, open world that can be fully explored. There&#8217;s much to see and many jaw-dropping sights. There are also a huge number of quests to complete and skills to acquire, and this is where the flaws lie. There are simply too many quests (often repetitive) and skill trees, and the storyline suffers as a result. The main story is underwhelming and because the player tends to get so sidetracked by the numerous side quests (I have read, but cannot confirm, that there are as many as 300 pre-set quests plus more that are randomly-generated) it fails to engage as much as it should. The game would benefit from greater emphasis on quality of story and more imaginative and diverse, though less numerous, quests.

{"product_name":"B00149ILDO","reviewerName":"Campy","summary":"I wanted to like this more...","reviewText":"I recently bought The Saboteur, as it had piqued my interest upon release but I never got around to getting it (I had read a review stating it was like Mercenaries 2, I didn't like that game, so it kind of put me off all this time)I'm glad I waited, and I'm glad I got it, because I had to see Pandemic's swan song myself, but still...it's very bitter sweet. This game has potential, yet lacks so much polish.The premise is somewhat simple, an Irish stock car racer exacts vengeance upon the Third Reich throughout occupied Paris.The look of the game is a sort of stylized realism that, when it comes to the character models, looks now dated, though a couple of years back it should have been a bit better, but they serve the general aesthetic. The real show-stealer is Paris. Pandemic took care, real care, to reproduce Paris. I have not seen much of it, you start off in the areas surrounding Montmartre, but everything looks genuine. I don't remember the exact layout of that arrondisment, but I stood in front of Sacre Coeur for at least 3 minutes before uttering a deep \"Wow.\" Pandemic also made a beautiful play with their color palette, simple yet elegant: as you walk from liberated to still-occupied sectors of Paris, the world will shift from a warm and colorful arrangement to a noir black and white format, often accompanied by stormy skies. The best aspect of this game is quite possibly just wandering around Paris.The voice acting is a mixed bag: it depends on how much \"stereotype\" you can handle. It careens the feel of the game into the cartoonish realm, which on the one hand saddened me. The game is so beautiful, I thought it might have benefited from a more serious tone. On the other hand, taken with a grain of salt, the tongue in cheek is strong with this one and makes the occupation of Paris a bit less opressing of a topic (not that that's a good thing)The music is DELIGHTFUL, especially the incidental music: it might be trite, it might be a cliche, but soft accordeons and Paris do go together quite well. Some of the music played through the Radio is great at creating the full experience, but I have found some anachronisms already (Nina Simone's 'Feelin' Good' ...Nina Simone was like 7 in 1940...come on. I love the track, but still)All of this nitpicking would be peanuts if it weren't for the gameplay. The gameplay isn't bad, but it lacked SO MUCH POLISH. And I've researched some of the games that had set standards of gameplay that had already been released by the time this game came out, so...the game pales in comparison.I would divide the gameplay in three aspects: gunplay, driving and platform/exploration.The gunplay is sloppy by comparison to some games that had come out already. WWII guns aren't top notch tech anymore, but the way you move around, the reticle everything...it had already been done BETTER in Uncharted, in Gears of War, in GTA IV...it just didn't feel that tight. Not bad, but not great. Points for realism, you can only carry around 2 guns, on top of grenades and some element of sabotage (I had only seen dynamite so far, but I know there were remote detonators too)The driving is horrible. It reminded me of playing Mafia on PS2. Yes, old timey cars aren't great when compared to modern cars. Doesn't mean they have to handle like floating platforms. Driving away in a car never really feels like an option, to be honest. Paris streets have tight turns, and Nazis are, apparently, impecable drivers.The exploration portion was...shoddy. You get around climbing up through ledges, and jumping through rooftops. Sure, ok. So, some light parkour? How many times did I jump to an adjacent roof to slide down the opposite wall, having magically missed 2-3 obvious ledges to hang from? Dunno, many. How many times did I hit a magic sweet spot and didn't die after falling 50 feet? A couple, and they were head scratchers.Seriously, I didn't expect the character to handle like Altair in Assassin's Creed, but...jeez, the platform elements felt like a step back from Uncharted (I know it's hard to compare the two as Uncharted never had open world exploration, but still, it just felt like it lacked polish)The style of the game doesn't save what I had seen thus far in the way of paperthin storytelling, and the gameplay isn't enough to keep me playing much more of it. It saddens me because, seeing as how this was a swan song, all these issues, which dould have been addressed in the way of patches or maybe one day a sequel, will probably go unanswered.I'll keep waiting for a WWII sandbox, I guess.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","summary":"Fun, But Not Much Here is New...","reviewText":"Introduction-Mario Kart started as a great little game on the Super Nintendo. Super Mario Kart on the Super Nintendo assumed you as one of eight mascots of the mario world, and let you race against the computer, or with a friend. The twist, setting it apart from all the other racers in the genre, was it's Item and power-up system, letting you attack your opponents with shells, and get a boost from mushrooms, plus many more. Looking back on the game now, you will see very aged graphics on a very aged system. But sit down with it for a few minutes, and you will find the addictive gameplay that made it such a classic.Mario Kart then moved to the Nintendo 64 in 1997, and replaced the flat courses of the origional with huge, lush courses to show off the hardware of nintendo's new system. Unfortunately, this upset many people because the bigger courses made winning the race more about who could best use power ups, rather than actual racing skill. Multiplayer in this game was fantastic, letting you race with three other people rather than just one.Mario Kart 64 also built up on the battle mode, making it much more than just a diversion from the main game. But this game was plagued with many bugs and glitches that made the game unfair, and sometimes even unenjoyable. Mario Kart 64 was fun to play with friends, but was a little unbalanced, and had too many problems for its own good.Now comes the third outing of the Mario Kart franchise to hit nintendo consoles. Mario Kart: Double Dash!! combines the best aspects of both the games before it, but unfortunately doesn't really do much else to improve the game.Graphics-The graphics in MKDD are crisp, smooth, and very colorful. The style of the game is very cartoonish, so those looking for a more gritty dark game will be very dissapointed. Nothing in the graphics catagory is done wrong. It has that classic mario style, but some might be somewhat concerned about how nintendo has places eyes on many of the game's inanimate objects, making it somewhat distracting to drive without feeling that you are being watched the trees... (Graphics 4/5)Sound-Mario and the Gang are very chatty, commenting on most of thier actions. Voice acting isn't terrible, but it might get annoying to hear those italian plumbers shout out their nintendo nonsense over and over. Some catchy themes on some of the race tracks, but nothing to get too excited about. (Sound 4/5)Gameplay-The gameplay in this game remains mostly unchanged from previous editions of mario kart. Race 3 times around a track, collecting power-ups from Item boxes scattered throuout each course, and beating your opponents. Controlling your Kart in this game has been tuned to perfection. The biggest addition to this edition of mario kart is the two-player-per kart aspect of racing. There is one driver in the front of the kart, and one in the back who handles the weapons and power-ups. This means you can hold two items at a time, and you can switch your character's places whenever at the push of a button.This adds a strategic element while chosing your character, because you can combine any two characters in one kart. There are 20 characters in total, each with their own specialized kart. Another thing to worry about is that each \"team\" of characters has a SPECIAL item that they get randomly from any item box on the map. Each special item is different, and adds a lot to a team. The addition of a two-player-per-kart system works well and adds a lot to the game, but Mario Kart Veterans of any kind will find that playing with as two characters at once doesn't really change the gameplay that much.The tracks you will race on are some of the best and creative courses to date, but unfortunately there are only 16, and some of them are mediocre and dull compaired to others. (Gameplay 4/5)Multiplayer-Multiplayer is the main draw of this title, and should be where you spend most of your time. WARNING: If you have no friends, do not buy this game! The two-player-per-kart lets you play co-op with a friend, but honestly, controlling your own kart is way more fun. Battle mode has unfortunately taken a step down from Mario Kart 64, because the courses to play on are boring and uninspired. Two new battle modes to play with are fun and welcomed, but just not fun on such bad battle arenas.Nintendo also offers LAN play, offering up to 16 players to race, but it looks like this was thrown in at the last second, and only recommended if you actually have the resources to do it. (Multiplayer 4/5)Overall-This game is a great addition to the Mario Kart franchise, and recommended to anyone who owns a gamecube, and is looking for a great multiplayer experience. It perfects the mario Kart formula, but it has too little tracks, and a bad battle mode, and in the end, doesn't really offer anything new.Overall, it is a great game. 4 out of 5__________","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003VWGBC0","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Truly Ultimate","reviewText":"This is the second \"Ultimate Edition\" that I've bought this month, and now, just as before, I am very happy with my purchase. I missed out on most of what the BATTLEFIELD franchise has evolved into; I think the last game I played was BATTLEFIELD 1942. This package was a great way for me to \"catch up\" and see what all the fuss about this game was truly about.I'm glad my expectations were set so moderately so that they could be broken in such an insane manner.BAD COMPANY 2 (4/5 Stars):This game is great, I can't stress that enough. If I had to pick between BC2 and CoD: BLACK OPS to take with me to a deserted island, I'd be taking BC2. But it loses a star because when I buy a FPS, I do expect a good campaign to go along with the multiplayer that will be inevitably touted. In this case, while the multiplayer is indeed stellar, the campaign still has some catching up to do.I never got a chance to play the first BAD COMPANY (something I hope to fix soon), but it wasn't too hard to figure out what was going on. The backdrop seems to have been carried over from the last game, but the story itself is fairly self-contained.The characters are fun, well-written and very competently voiced. I won't say they're particularly deep, because the story doesn't really allow them many chances to shine. Remember those awesome trailers from BC1? I kind of expected a lot of that, but just didn't find it. Since the story itself is almost cliche, sending you across South America to track down a secret weapon (that's it), I expected more out of the writing, but didn't get much more.On the whole, the campaign doesn't maintain the excitement or immersion that the first level provides. As amazing as it was, most of the following missions boil down to destroying entire villages, which, after a few hours in, just stopped making sense. Everyone in South America wants a piece of you, and their aim is frighteningly good, so you'll need to rely on your three (count them: three) squadmates to pick up the slack. Kinda sucks, because they ultimately drop the ball in that regard.The AI in this game is absolutely horrible. Sometimes they'd follow me, sometimes they wouldn't. Sometimes I'd get halfway into a firefight and they'd just up and disappear. I'd walk through a tunnel just before one of them recommends, \"Let's check out that tunnel.\" On several occasions, I'd just watch as they unload every round on their person, trying in vain to kill one guy who's been standing out in the open. And the AI of the enemy is just as bad, since they ultimately disregard my squadmates and attack me every single time, regardless of whether or not I'm actually returning fire.So...the campaign. Not quite a bust, but I can't really see myself playing through it again anytime soon unless I'm feeling achievement happy. There are some amazing set pieces throughout, but they're sandwiched in between long stretches of just-your-average-shoot-everything-around-you gameplay.But the multiplayer, that's another monster entirely. This is where the game really shines. The game modes are pretty much what you'd see in other games, but it's the Frostbite Engine itself that makes them great strategic fun. The maps are HUGE, and pretty much everything built on top of them is destructible and behaves realistically. Meaning: you can shoot and hack through a wooden fence, but you won't have the same luck with a concrete wall. If a sniper is hiding in a house, you can get a tank and bring the building around him, wall by wall, and to a point where it'll eventually collapse.You'll have to slow down and use strategy in maneuvering around these maps, which is a breath of fresh air in comparison to the breakneck pace of CoD. Factor in a whole bunch of unique vehicles, great level design, and a rewarding leveling system, and you've got a great online multiplayer experience that (for the most part) will be unlike other FPSs that you've played.BATTLEFIELD 1943 (5/5 Stars):I was so happy to see this was a part of the package. This is essentially a remake of BATTLEFIELD 1942, one of my favorite games from back in the day. Three maps are included (with Wake Island being one of them!) for the \"capture the flag\" mode, but there is also another mode, \"Air Superiority,\" where you basically fly around and kill the opposing team. Basic package, but it's just as fun as it was eight years ago and was a real trip down memory lane for me.This \"Ultimate Edition\" also includes codes for VIP access to free BC2 maps and Onslaught Mode, which I have yet to play. Great package at a great price. This is a fantastic game with an addicting multiplayer element, in addition to some astounding technology powering it all. In so many words: beautiful, addicting, and fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000GA8UAQ","description":"Set in the peaceful kingdom of Slimenia, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime is suddenly invaded by a mysterious cartel called the Plob, who then proceed to kidnap all the slimes in the capital city of Boingburg. The only slime left behind, Rocket, must embark on a journey to save his friends and uncover the Plob's nefarious plot.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Rocket Slime is the best adventure on the DS yet","reviewText":"Last November's Dragon Quest VIII initiated the series' return to western shores and flew off of store shelves, offering dozens upon dozens of hours of traditional RPG gameplay and a Final Fantasy XII demo disc to boot. With that game's popularity, it's no surprise to me that SquareEnix has stuck around in 2006 to offer American gamers two spin-offs of their Dragon Quest/Dragon Warrior series. The first of these two spin-offs, with the latter Dragon Quest Swords coming to the Wii in November, is Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime. This is a DS game that captures familiar Zelda-like gameplay with its own cutesy charm and intuitive control style, and it does all of this very well, rounding off one of the best DS carts to come out in 2006.As its name implies, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime puts you in the...er...goo of a slime, one of the Dragon Quest series' most iconic monsters. Rather than serve as experience fodder as they have in previous Dragon Quest games, the slimes in this game are friendly and peaceful as they go about their slimy lives in Slimenia. One day, the Plob, an evil gang of monsters, wreaks havoc on Slimenia and captures all of the slimes. Rocket, the slime you'll take control of, remains untouched. It's up to you and your bouncy virtual avatar to save the slimes and stop the Plob. The story, while not totally original or inventive in itself, gives way to cute dialogue, funny cut-scenes, and more slime puns than you could ever imagine. In short, the story isn't the greatest but the comedy that stands above it does more than a fair amount of entertaining, and it would be a sin for me to ruin any of the humor for you.Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime plays a lot like the classic 2D Legend of Zelda games. I'll just get that out of the way as quickly as possible. Don't expect a 2D epiphany while playing through this one-anyone who's touched one of those older games will be familiar with how Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime works. It would be a travesty to write it off as a copycat game, though, and it's not-Rocket Slime introduces a lot of intuitive and innovative things to the mix. While you don't use the stylus or touch screen at all, Rocket Slime has a handling perk-you only use the directional pad to move Rocket, and you'll interact with and attack things in the environment with the A button. Holding down the A button in combination with pressing a direction on the d-pad will elastically stretch out your slime, and letting go of the button will send him \"Elasto Blasting\" forward, knocking anything in his path into the air. By Elasto Blasting, you can \"catch\" objects or enemies and throw them around with the B button. This simple mechanic is what 60% of Rocket Slime consists of.It's this simple control that will ease gamers into the gameplay, but the design of the game goes much further. Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime, like the Legend of Zelda games before it, has simple control mechanics but a level design that will sometimes have you scratching your head and trying hard to figure out just what to do next. You'll interact with objects in the environment, and you'll do things like go underground through water wells and fire cannons to proceed through the environment. Anything that is found (objects, items, enemies) can also be thrown onto rail cars that are located throughout each level. This is useful for tank battles, and before I lose track and go on a tangent, I must discuss this second gameplay feature. Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime takes a bite out of Advance Wars' book and combines dual-screen battles with its adventure portions. These battles, initiated at certain times and locations throughout the game, are a lot of fun and are the more involving parts of Rocket Slime's gameplay. The items found throughout the world are used as ammunition, and you'll defend your Schlieman tank from other creatively-designed (and hilariously named) enemy tanks. These portions of the game can be very intense, as you'll fire off ammo in real-time by doing what Rocket does best-Elasto Blasting into objects, carrying them to your cannons, and throwing them into the cannons. Once the enemy tank is weakened, Rocket can travel over to the enemy tank and sabotage its engines to end the battle. These tank battles are almost always exciting, they're always fun, and they're my favorite part of the game. They've even got their own fully-featured multiplayer mode, as Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime supports the Nintendo DS multiple game card multiplayer functions.The tank battles get much deeper about halfway through the game when you start finding bigger, more powerful items that serve as ammo; not to mention you can upgrade your tank's health meter to make it sturdier in those long-winded conflicts. Besides the ammo and health upgrades, you can actually recruit friendly slimes that have specific in-battle strengths and weaknesses. For example, Hooly, one of your slime friends, will fire himself at incoming projectiles, knocking them out of the air. Other characters will run around throughout the Schlieman tank, collecting ammo and firing away at enemies. Some characters even play a defensive role and protect the tank from intruding Plob monsters. All of these abilities are controlled by AI, but it's a great feature nonetheless, and adds a lot of depth and strategy to the already-exciting tank battles.Visually, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime is, again, very similar to Legend of Zelda games. It has its own charm, though-it's very bright and colorful, and everything, even the Plob, looks bouncy and happy. In fact, I'd say this is one of the most ridiculously cutesy and happy games I've ever found myself being gripped by. The sprites are big, bright, and perfectly animated. Visually, you couldn't ask for more from a top-down 2D adventure game. The sound is appropriate, with cutesy music that never gets annoying. The tank battle music is fitting to the gameplay, and in hand is more reminiscent of Advance Wars.Overall, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime doesn't go unscathed. Though there is a lot of depth to be found in the tank battle system, and the game has an undeniable pick-up-and-play feel to it, Rocket Slime ends shortly around the dozen-hour mark. The lack of WiFi multiplayer and downloadable play hurts, but Rocket Slime does have a multiplayer mode that is loaded with features like playable tanks, characters, and settings. All-in-all, for anything bad I could say about Rocket Slime, I could say about ten good things about it. As if Rocket Slime needed another piece of proof, that's a sign of a good, fun game; one of the better handheld titles this year. If your DS has been dormant since New Super Mario Bros. and Tetris DS stole the show earlier this year, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime will definitely satiate your appetite for handheld gaming until Final Fantasy III attacks this November and Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass sets sail next spring.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"There are no righteous in this war","reviewText":"Spec ops the line is a difficult game to review. At first glance, it looks like your standard military shooter, but scratch the surface, and you'll see just how layered it truly is. For one, calling this game \"fun\" is a little misleading. COD and BF are \"fun\". Appropriate phrases to describe Spec ops the line are: haunting, thought provoking, cinematic, stark, jarring, traumatic, eye opening, genre defying, or even artistic achievement. Now, while many of those don't sound like fun, make no mistake, this game is still very enjoyable.You start the game as Captain Martin Walker, accompanied by the rest of your delta squad, Lieutenant Adams and Sergeant Lugo. The game starts with a bang, and establishes exactly what makes this game great. The visuals are breathtaking, showing the faded beauty of Dubai as it is slowly swallowed by ever worsening sand storms. The combat is fast and effective, and the characters are rich and engaging. The main gist of the story consists of Walker and his men going into storm savaged Dubai to investigate a distress call from a colonel Konrad. What starts as a reconnaissance mission, quickly becomes something darker, and far more engaging.Spec ops is based off of the story \"Hearts in Darkness\", the book that inspired \"Apocalypse Now (Apocalypse Now / Apocalypse Now Redux / Hearts of Darkness) (Three-Disc Full Disclosure Edition)  [Blu-ray]\". The biggest surprise about Spec ops is the fact that it's biggest strength is its dark and engaging story, that I won't ruin for you. Needless to say, things are most definitely not as they appear.A quick aside to any parents, Spec ops is not Call of Duty. It is not Battlefield. It is not the game equivalent of a glossy Hollywood blockbuster, though it does have some truly impressive set pieces. Spec ops bucks the trend set by these games by NOT glorifying armed combat. There is blood, cursing, violence, but more than that, the horrors of war are on full display, and I leave it up to you to decide whether or not these scenes are appropriate for your kids. There are no \"good guys\" in the same way there are no \"villains\". The decisions you make are never black and white, but are motivated by the need to survive. Walker and his team are deep in enemy territory with no intel, and nothing is as it seems. This desperate fight for survival and lack of perspective is perfectly encapsulated by a certain segment in the game that has caused some controversy. I won't ruin it, except to say \"willy pete\" is not just a funny name.The combat is straight forward and easy to pick up, and while I had no problem going through this game on the second hardest mode from jump, I have heard from many other people that, even on the lower difficulties, this is not an easy game. Thankfully you have your team to back you up, and I'm happy to say that, for the most part, Adams and Lugo are two of the best friendly AI partners I've ever played with. You can give them targets on the field; Lugo can snipe for long range, and Adams has grenades for entrenched enemies. If the opposition doesn't know you are there, equip a silencer and take them out, or better yet, get your team to do it. They will very ably sneak up and stealthily dispatch your foes for you, without raising the alarm. When things get a hectic, and you find yourself pinned down, have them throw a flash grenade to buy yourself some breathing room, or have them attack the person pinning you down, so that they draw their fire, freeing you up to take care of them yourself. There is an environmental component to the game, where you destroy barriers, dropping sand on them to end the fight, and while it is certainly fun, it is rarely used.The one gripe I do have with the combat is that the cover system isn't as flexible as the situation usually calls for. On the higher difficulties, your opposition is not shy about using grenades, and if you are in cover, healing one of your team, or in the process of throwing your own grenade, it is much harder to get to safety than it should be. Even if you are able to avoid the grenade's kill radius, be prepared to be shredded by enemy fire before you can get back into cover. To be fair, this problem can usually be avoided by playing smart, and using your team effectively, but in a certain part late in the game, your team isn't accessible, and you are vastly outnumbered. Having cruised through the game up to that point, it is jarring to hit a wall of difficulty like that, and does take away from the overall experience.Beside that small issue, Spec ops: The Line is an excellent game that redefines what military shooters can achieve. The action is fast, fun, and for the most part effective, the story is intelligently written and suitably dark, the characters are organic and engaging, and the overall experience is very fulfilling. It is definitely not the feel good game of the year, but it offers a uniquely gratifying experience that, in my book, makes it a solid contender for game of the year. Highly recommended and a definite buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2012"}

This is why I found the story to be completely ridiculous and nonsensical (even with the background provided in the game).  So this character, an obvious rip off of Snake Plissken from the 'Escape from' movies, starts his own country, full of mercenaries, advanced weaponry, and nuclear weapons, and the rest of the world is supposed to be ok with it?  Laughable.  And then there's the iDroid rip off, but enough of that.Regardless of the horrendous (lack of a) story, there is the game play.  There are many sneak games out there nowadays, and many do it much better than this.  Adding a shiny sheen to everything doesn't mean that the graphics are a lot better.  Having your own convoluted button scheme doesn't make this game better either.  Then there is the game length.  This has been covered by plenty of other reviews.  I also found this game amazingly difficult, and not in a fun way either.  The game basically requires you to do something a certain way, and never 1) teaches you how to do ANYTHING, 2) never gives you hints that this is the specific way to do it.To sum it up, skip it.

So he and I settled on a borrowing agreement he took one of my games to borrow and I took one of his games to borrow. Which in that case meant we would return the games we borrowed from each other (Its like renting a game from a video store only I was borrowing it from a friend and there was no late fee plus I am agreeing on a handshake to return his property in the same condition he gave it to me and if theres any damage I pay for it.) So I took the game home, tried it out and I immediately was immersed and in total love with the game. This game is by far one of the best Legend of Zelda games I have ever played.  My playing experience and ratings for the game which include graphics, storyline, side quests are as follows:Graphics 5/5 starsStoryline 5/5 starsSide Quests:4/5 StarsNot every single side-quest was terribly hard. The Poe Soul Side quest however is the hardest side quest because there is over 60 Poe Souls.  Because what I find difficult about the Poe Souls is a.) there locations b.) Knowing when you got them and not going back to the same location twice when I was already there.So yeah that's why I took one star off for that particular side quest because the locations for all the Poe souls can be confusing and I kind of wish that Nintendo would have lessened the amount of Poe souls and dropped it down to like 30 or 40. 60 is way too many for me to handle. But otherwise I love the darker atmosphere the bosses, the storyline and the graphics and my favorite part of the game is the Master Sword.

I'm talking of the lagginess felt when moving the mouse ingame, and  the 'resyncing' DX2 does when you go to a new area or load up a game.  Loading and going to new area (each area is painfully small, so this is QUITE frequent) takes around 15 seconds.  Doesn't sound like much on paper, but it is unforgivably long in game.  Even after the patch, there are still game crashing bugs (it also freezes my CD drive, having to restart the PC to fix).Even if the patch actually fixed what it was supposed to, the game itself isn't engaging enough for a repeat.  Universal ammo takes any fun out of trying out different guns.  Sounds odd, but when it takes around only 2 sniper shots to deplete a clip compared to 15 shots of the pistol...and combine that with the fact that 2 shots to the head from the pistol is all it takes to take down most opponents...what's the use?  Seriously, the only weapon I used was the pistol until the Antartic stage.  Even then, I only had the pistol, SMG, and the sniper rifle (for those pesky I. Assasins...boom! to da head).The lack of skill-based gameplay limits this as an RPG.  There's only so many bio-mod combinations to choose from.  And I find it silly that there's no other way to use the security console without the console hack bio-mod.  Seems like the dev. were forcing the issue on us by having so many security terminals around with no other way to hack it.I can't help but feel the game is all too console friendly, from the limited control binds, to the smaller maps, to the generic ammo and toolkits...ho-hum.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2003"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"D. Blizzard","summary":"The Best Computer RPG in Years","reviewText":"For those of you who loved Baldur's Gate, you will certainly enjoy Dragon Age: Origins (DAO).  This is a rather formulaic, but very well done, fantasy role playing game.  People who enjoy this type of game generally have no problems putting in 50 hours or more into a game and exploring every area in it.  It is meant for the a gamer who prefers slower paced games.  This genre of game is what got me into gaming many years ago, and Dragon Age is one of the best by far, taking its place along side the Baldur's Gate franchise and Planescape.  To make this review more concise, I will break it down into sections.Controls:  This is a multiplatform game, it is also available on the XBOX 360 and the PlayStation 3,  However, it seems as though it was made originally for the PC then ported over to the consoles.  The PC version has an entirely different control scheme than the console versions.  If you have played Neverwinter Nights 2 or any other RPG on the PC, then the controls will be very familiar to you.  You simply point at an object and click on it.  In a battle, you do the same, but you can select various skills and spells from a toolbar at the bottom of the screen or press the corresponding key to activate them.Graphics:  Once again, this is a multiplatform game.  With the PC, higher resolutions, anti-aliasing, and better textures are available.  This game looks fine, it would have been very nice a few years ago, but the graphics just look old.  I believe this might have something to do with the amount of time game has spent in development.  Once the developers got so far along in the development cycle, it may have been too costly or difficult to redo the graphics in their entirety.  As an example, the character models are well done, not Mass Effect well done, but still pleasant to look at, but when the characters are placed against a wall or other gameplay object, the character looks sharp but the background appears muddy and dull.  The character animations are functional, but largely wooden.  Also, the game is quite bloody, so it is not meant for children.  The gore is much like that in Kill Bill, very over done.  Large enemies spurt blood like a fountain and you get covered in it all the time.  I had to rid a pantry of mice and when I was done, I looked like Carrie.Audio:  The audio is by and large, top-notch.  The musical score is well thought out and sets the mood when it is needed.  The music is unintrusive and the voice acting is of a high calibur.  For you science fiction fans, you may recognize one of the voices...Gameplay:  Dragon Age shines best in how it presents the story.  Sure it is mostly standard fantasy with elves, dwarves, and magic, but the developers polished it and made it a truly deep and engrossing tale.  I found myself playing for hours and hours, oblivious to the time, and when I wasn't playing, I thought about the game.  Few titles capture me like that.  One of the hallmarks of the game is how the characters are realized.  Every character in the game has a story that you can explore.  Even while you are in town adventuring they will banter amongst themselves and when you speak to a townsperson they will offer their opinion based on their background.  I was always eager to talk with my companions just to see what they had to say, it adds a depth to the game that few titles have.  When you start the game you get to choose your race and origin story.  Both will alter how certain characters respond to you and what you can do.  For instance, a human noble (Noble is a origin story) is treated positively by most of the townspeople and the noble origin makes vengence against one character more satisfying.  It also allows for the player to become royalty very late in the game, if conditions are perfect.  As the game progresses, your choices have real effects on the game's universe.  Unlike some RPG's where you play as a good or evil character and get various bonuses as a result, in Dragon Age, there is no morality meter and the only way to guage the effects of your choices within the party is to see the various members' feelings towards you.  If it dips too low, the character will run off or attack the player.  When I finished the game, I found myself caring about what happens to the characters and various people we met along our travels.Other Considerations:  Dragon Age will play on many PC's, it is suggested that you play with the recommended system specs.  I have an Intel Core 2 Quad 9450, 8GB of RAM, two NVidia 9800GTX's in SLI, and Windows 7 64-bit and didn't have any slowdowns while running at max settings with the anti-aliasing turned off.  Anti-aliasing is very hardware intensive and at a high resolution, 1920 x 1200, I didn't see the need to turn it on.  Over time the game did slow down while loading some areas, but when it did, I had played the game for over three hours in one sitting before it started to take longer than 30 seconds to load an area.  Most of the time, areas load very quickly.  Usually less than ten seconds for most areas, 30 seconds for large maps.  The game is also quite stable, I only ever had a single crash and that was at the end.  This game also has very weak digital rights management (DRM).  The DRM is just a simple disc checker with a product key, there is no online activation.  However, the product key will be paired to your online account, which is needed if you want to use their Bioware social site and downloadable content.  The Bioware social site is a bit buggy but PC players can post achievements, similar to XBOX Live and PSN, screenshots, and character profiles.  The forums at their social site is extensive and very helpful.  If you're planning on showing off your achivements or screenshots to other non-Dragon Age players, you may be out of luck since viewing profiles is restricted to members only, for now.  Also, this game is not a Games for Windows or a Games for Windows - Live title, so there is no achievement integration with the Microsoft system and the downloadable content comes from EA's servers directly.  Once again, this is a multiplatform game and there are differences between various versions.  From what I can tell, it seems as though the PC version was made first and then ported over to the consoles.  On the PC, there is better graphics, much faster load times, the ability to zoom all the way out and view the party from a top-down perspective (similar to Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale) which is very helpful during battles, a keyboard and mouse control scheme, and a less expensive price.  If your PC can run it, go for it over the console editions.  If you are limited to the console version, the story is exactly the same and some features aren't available, but the controls are very similar to those in Mass Effect.  If you have a choice between the XBOX 360 and the PlayStation 3 version, the PS3 version seems to have a slight edge over the 360.  Remember, this seems like a computer RPG that has been ported over to the consoles, so some actions might be more difficult to perform on a console.  Also, there is absolutely no multiplayer at all in the game.  Personally, I like having no multiplayer, it means the story and your interactions with it can be deeper.  If you're a player who must, without question, have a multiplayer component, look elsewhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"The best Star Wars space flying game ever","reviewText":"This is easily the best Star Wars space flying game ever.

I actually waited a couple years before getting a newer one and am glad I did because I started hearing about the RROD.

For the rest of us, at first glance between an XBox 360 game and a regular XBox game, there isn't much difference.  It's true, on an HDTV the games are a sight to behold (most of them anyway) but a majority of them just don't have that \"next-gen\" feel.  And that's what comes down to judging a game console: the games.  In it's launch lineup, there's no single game that is able to sell the console.  The only games that come close to this are Perfect Dark Zero and Project Gotham 3, while third party titles such as Dead or Alive 4, GUN, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, King Kong, Madden '06, and Ridge Racer 6, still look and play like current-gen titles.  Now here's the thing; the XBox 360 has the potential to be something truly great, and with games like the next installment in the Elder Scrolls series, and of course Halo 3 on the horizon, the future of this console seems bright.  The system itself looks cool and sleek, and the XBox Live support is still the best online console gaming around today; so for XBox faithfuls, you really can't go wrong.  However, with the hefty price tags for the console, games, and accessories, along with the fact you need an HDTV to get the most out of the system, most gamers will be better off waiting a good while before laying down the cash for this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2006"}

The online portion is great.  By far it is the best online play of any console.  The controller feels good in your hands and works well.  The system has a lot of stuff other than just games you buy from the store.  It has great games you can buy and download.  You can either hook up an either net cable or buy a wireless adapter for 99.99 dollars.  You can use Xbox live gold which will cost about 49.99 for a year, or you can use silver which is free. Of course you need wireless internet for this to work.  You can also buy and download movies and shows.  Now I think (having my apple TV) that it is stupid to download movies and shows on my 360.  But for those of you who do not want to spend all that money for an apple TV.  That is a great feature.  Then your not just paying for a game system, your paying for a media system.  I am not sure how much space the movies and shows take on your hard drive, but you can always buy a new hard drive.  The few games I have downloaded are really fun.  You can use a credit card to download games or you can buy an xbox live card.  The only one I ever saw was for 1600 points and cost like 20 dollars.  A lot of the games on this system can be bought for the PS3 or the Wii.  I have a Wii, but not a ps3.  The graphics are great, though not as good as the TV makes them look.  I have only played one game that came close to looking like TV made them look.  I mean the only way you will get the full expierence is if you own a high def, flat screen TV with surround sound.  I don't have either of these.  I'm not going to pay so much more for a TV in my bed room.  The games still look pretty good without the high def though.Now I know I have said a lot of good things about the system, and I'm sure you thinking \"why the 2 out of 5?\"  Well I'll tell you why.  I got my first xbox 360 from a whole sale place in 05.  It had red rings and stopped working.  I sent it to Microsoft and sold it on amazon when it was fixed.  So that's 1.  Then I got a new xbox 360 elite.  In 06 it broke, and I exchanged it at the store I bought it from.  That's 2.  That one broke a little while latter and I exchanged it for a new one.  That's 3.  Just to make things short, I just exchanged the one I had for another one.  That is SEVEN OR EIGHT!  I exchanged one 3 weeks ago and it already broke.  I only play the system for like 6 hours in a 2 week period.  If I had not just bought Lego Indiana jones and my mother brought me Ninja Gaiden 2, I would have sold the new system and everything with it for 800 dollars.  It's not worth having to drive to the store and exchange it.  The store is only 10 minutes away but I can not drive and gas is WAY to much to have to do such a stupid thing.  Microsoft obviously can't and didn't make a good quality system that would last.  I still have my ps and ps2.  They both still work.  Hell I have an NES my uncle gave me and that still works.  I will never buy another xbox 360 game.  Unless, after I rent it it's really supper fun and I really want to play.  I was thinking about buying a ps3 today but I said \"forget it.\"  I will keep my xbox 360.  I have to pay like 30 dollars for a new warranty next month.  That is the only reason I will do so.  If you get the system, I warn you.  Get the warranty, because it WILL break, and you Will have to return it time and time again.  I am going to write to the news and some game magazines about how bad and unreliable it is.  Shame on you Microsoft.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2008"}

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl. (Also compatible with the Classic Controller.)Open-ended Play Structure- Whether you prefer Life Sim gaming, Action RPG action or a mix of both,Rune Factory: Frontierlets you game as you want, when you want.Console Debut-Frontieris the console debut of the popularRune Factoryseries.","reviewerName":"Wendy","summary":"Didn't care for it.","reviewText":"This game was okay.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"JLeack \"Jleack\"","summary":"Backward step for the series, but great story","reviewText":"Pros:- Extraordinary presentation- Intriguing story- Great level of detailCons:- Backstep for the series- Horrible controls- Quirky cover systemGameplay:The Grand Theft Auto series has had amazing success in the past decade, and this latest installment from Rockstar has had a lot to live up to. As in past Grand Theft Auto titles, the game puts you in control of a character living in Liberty City, a very hostile environment. In the case of Grand Theft Auto IV, you play as Niko Bellic, a man who just moved to America from Eastern Europe looking to live the American dream. The game once again takes place in Liberty City, which this time around is a very well-detailed environment full of obstacles, people and cars. The story itself is very intriguing and features a wide range of characters that make the story quite compelling. Also, a lot of interactions in the game take place on Niko's cell phone. You're able to keep in contact with friends and enemies on the cell phone as well as engage in side missions over it as wellCombat is as simple as in previous iterations, but this time around there is a cover system. It's a very simple cover system which allows for you to duck behind most objects, and also allows you to stand up and shoot from behind the cover or pull up your gun and fire while remaining behind cover at the expense of accuracy. There are also a wide-range of cars to drive in the game as well as motorcycles and boats. Unfortunately, the cover system as well as driving mechanics have some serious quirks which don't grow on you even with time. In essence, the game has devalued the gameplay itself in trade of a greater physical presentation.Controls:Since Grand Theft Auto IV features so many things to do, controls can't be broken down into 1 category. The movement itself is great, and Niko controls very realistically when moving. Unfortunately, the cover system has some issues, and most of the time makes you feel like it's more of a magnet system than a cover system. Lots of times the camera angle makes it really hard to fire at the angle you want to which is frustrating. One of the worst things about the game is the driving controls. Rockstar seems to have gone with a more realistic approach which is respectable, but the driving controls aren't realistic whatsoever. When turning, all cars in the game oversteer and lose control around turns, Also, the camera angle likes to try to be cinematic which in many cases forces you to use the right analog stick when turning to see what is ahead of you. The driving controls are quite frankly unacceptable, and make many missions in the game enraging.Graphics:Grand Theft Auto has had a complete makeover which is great to see for veterans of the series. This game quite simply looks great, and both the character models and city are very detailed. Also, during cutscenes, the facial and body animations are top-notch, and really add to the atmosphere of the story. The presentation is also great and the menus are easier to navigate than ever before.Sound:As with the previous 3 games, Grand Theft Auto IV has great audio. The voice acting is quite possibly the best to date, with great voice actors and character defining dialogue. As with previous games, there are also over 10 radio stations to listen to in the car when driving. There is a lot more diversity of music in this game than the previous 2, and everyone should be able to find a station that suits them. Sound effects are also spot on and help mold the game into almost a movie-like experience.Replay Value:The story mode along is roughly 25 hours in length, but there are also a lot of extra things to do around the city. There are hidden pigeons scattered around the city ready to be found, super jumps, side missions and the simple entertainment of a sandbox environment. Trophies were also patched in shortly after release which is great for PSN trophy collectors. There is also a multi-player experience which has several game modes, but it doesn't last long. The only real downfall is that the game does grow repetitive very quickly which makes the replay value irrelevant to those who get bored of the game quickly.Rating:Story: 9.0Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 9.5Controls: 8.0Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 9.0Overall: 9.0Own, Rent, Avoid:Rent: Grand Theft Auto IV packs a lot of things to do, and a long story mode, but the replay value just isn't quite there. The game falls short of addicting and after you beat it you will likely never touch it again.Last Thoughts:The game could have been a lot better if the controls weren't they way they are, but with that said, the game is a remarkable feat in sheer quality and quantity.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2009"}

Some work great and feel right on the Vita, some don't and i found myself trying them over and over till i wanted to scream.  But, if your a Vita owner, then i say buy this game, for one simple reason, there's really nothing else out right now, and if you do what i did and get the PS3 version with the crossplay then it's a steal.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

Your character, the galaxy, the plot and many other characters carry over from the first and if you don't recognize the constant references you will wonder why you should care.Like ME1 and most BioWare offerings, this is a brilliant game with great storyline, amazing characters and fun combat. The degree of care and complexity with which ME fleshes out the lore and history and technology and species and politics of this world matches that of Dragon Age. Unfortunately, like with ME1 but unlike Dragon Age, BioWare has seen fit to bloat and hamper the game with lots of pointless minigames. The repetitive hacking and hotwiring games I can understand, although I wish they came up less, but mining planets for resources is dull and completely out of line with what your character is supposed to be doing. Basically, whenever you want to use an upgrade you've won on the field of battle or purchased with your hard earned credits, you also need minerals, which you get waving your mouse cursor over planets and then right-clicking when the scanner tells you there are resources. It's very tedious, it delays the gratification of new toys (and makes you pay for everything twice, once in acquiring and once with resources to enable) and it's truly bizarre to think that the most important, most talented and most expensive military resource in the galaxy (you) would be taking time away from your mission to strip mine the galaxy and probe Uranus!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2010"}

Fire Emblem doesn't count as it is more turn based strategy game and not a real RPG game like Tales (you don't travel in Fire Emblem, since it is Chapter based).  The Tales series are known for the \"real time\" battle system, where you get to control the battle hands on instead of choosing what you want your character to do (though you will most of your characters to manage on their own).  The game is huge and will take a while for any seasoned RPG gamer or first time RPG player to finish.  The main draw for the game is obviously for the great story.  Any game that tells a good story is usually a very good RPG, of course that's just part of it.  The battle system is another key factor in any RPG and Tales doesn't disappoint as it is easy to execute but at the same time there are interesting perks such as the combo system.  One main draw to the series is how there is no random battles.  You get to see the enemy on the screen and you get to choose if you want to engage in battle or avoid it (though the enemies will tend to pursue you to engage in battle you can normally avoid a lot of battles if you don't wish to fight).  I can go on longer about this game but I will end by saying that this game definitely deserves a purchase seeing how it is budget priced and if you own a GC or a Wii you will be owning one of the best RPGs for both systems (at least for now).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005LOXE","description":"The two classic RPGs in this compilation not only represent hours upon hours of story, character, and action, they also present the background for two recent bestselling, critically hailed games:Final Fantasy IXandChrono Cross.With all the different names for the original 1991 release of the first title in this compilation (Final Fantasy IVin Japan,Final Fantasy IIin the U.S.), role-players new to the game may get confused. Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation. InFinal Fantasy IV, players take on the role of Cecil, a loyal captain who questions the orders of his king, and for it is sent to slay a mysterious beast in a nearby valley.InChrono Trigger, Chrono must follow princess Marle's teleportation through time and locate her before an intergalactic parasite arrives to destroy the world. The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games. The decisions that players make during the game will point them toward one of more than a dozen possible endings.These new versions retain the authentic Japanese SNES stories and characters while updating their graphics and adding new full-motion video sequences and other features.","reviewerName":"Ryan Bancroft","summary":"The fans are answered.","reviewText":"That is why this was released.  The fans demanded it.  Finally, their voice means something!  Final Fantasy IV was among the first games that introduced the epic storyline, though with this came the inception of melodrama.  Within the first few hours of play, there must be around five deaths/diseases/oustings/hatreds etc.  This is so obvious that it is almost funny.  However, in its time this game was one of the best.  The gameplay is solid, offering traditional active time battles and a much-improved translation over the snes version.Chrono Trigger is considered by many to be the reason to own this collection.  This game offered a unique skills system, one brilliantly flowing storyline revolving on the axis of time travel, and enough sidequests to keep a person busy for 10 hours!  Needless to say, this combination makes one of the best games ever.  Only downside to this version has to be the load times.  At least a five second wait for the menu opening makes this a chore to get into.  However, once the story draws you in, the load times become completely insignificant.A must own for first time players who have a taste for old-times.  If you choose to buy these games again, like me, the extras in Chrono Trigger (bestiary, ending checklist, CG gallery) and the revamping of Final Fantasy IV's storyline make this well worth the low asking price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2002"}

The controller hooks into the wii remote where the nun-chunks usually connect to and the response time is great just like the wire-less Xbox 360 controller there's no lagging on the button commands.  You'll not need the controller to much with the old Nintendo games but more with the Super Nintendo, Sega, and N64 games instead. The one thing I also like about this controller is that it's small and easy to hold and while it might feel delicate it is pretty durable so don't worry to much about button mashing during game play.  So if you're like me and are downloading a lot of the old games I say this is the perfect controller to play those games with.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"David C.

Sorry, but Disney's \"crown jewels\" can't compete with Final Fantasy XII (or even X).  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Valley of the Winds?

After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

I've gotten all three of the previous games and couldn't help but get this one.It's very faithfull to the originals. If you've played any of the others, you'll feel right at home with this one.What's good:After the years of not having a Metroid game come out, fans finally have something to sate their addictions, and this game does that quite well.The missions are straight forward. You have a computer named Adam that tells you where to go and what to do. You do it, save the game and get back in touch with Adam. No fuss, no muss. It's all laid out what to do next.Graphics are incredible. Especially given the size of the screen.What's Bad:While it's nice to have missions that are straight forward, it nags at me that the game goes so far as to restrict your movement to the level that pertains to your particular mission. You're not AS free to move around as in other Metroid games.What's Neutral:They've completely revamped Samus' look. Of course she's recognisable as Samus, but she's radically altered.  I kinda miss the old costume.Some of the old items have merged or changed slightly. Example, Hi-Jump is now a combination of Hi-Jump and Spring-Ball. The differant missles, instead of using one or the other, stack the abilities. You don't just have a regular missile, super missile, or ice missile. You have an ice-super-missle. Small differance, but you'd be surprised what some people would fuss over.Over all, great game, if not long overdue.

You cannot remember who or where you are, but your former self is not surprised. The note tells you that you have purposefully forgotten recent events, and that you now have one goal: find and kill a man named Alexander. You don&#8217;t know who Alexander is or why you wanted to kill him, but your note warns that you are being chased by a dark shadow that alters reality and that time will be short.The dark shadow is a persistent threat that is never directly seen but its presence can always be felt. Earthquakes are tearing the castle apart, and odd noises can be heard coming from outside. However, these are the least of your worries as strange creatures walk the halls of the castle. The castle is impressive &#8211; a massive maze of twisting rooms  and corridors. The earthquakes are causing parts of the roof to collapse, blocking off passages and creating new ones as you play.Light is in limited supply, as candles provide your only means of illuminating the darkness. Tinderboxes are scattered all over the castle, but you never seem to have enough. You also have a lantern that runs on oil, but even that is in limited supply. Staying in the darkness slowly drains your sanity, which is something that could easily be lost in a place like this. You need to treat light like a limited resource, otherwise you could lose your mind.You have to stay focused and keep your wits about you. Keeping the darkness at bay is only part of the challenge, as every odd event you witness chews on your soul. Looking too long at the foul creatures could cause you to panic and reveal your position, forfeiting your only advantage: stealth.  You will find no weapons to use against the creatures in the castle. Your only choice when faced with one of them is to run or hide. You can close doors and barricade yourself in rooms, but that will only slow them down. Running fast and far away or hiding in closets or other dark corners will be your best bet for survival.As you lose your sanity your vision becomes blurred. You might start seeing and hearing things that are not actually there. Depending on how far gone you are there might even be a delay between mouse inputs and you performing the action. Keeping your mind on the tasks at hand is the only way to preserve what little sanity you have left, as solving a puzzle completely restores your sanity.Solving these puzzles is how you will spend a majority of your time. The castle is in very bad shape with areas that you need to get to currently inaccessible. Many of the puzzles work like classic point and click adventure games. You have to find the items that you need, combine them to create something useful, and then use the item on the environment. This might include mixing chemicals to produce an explosive to clear your path, or to fix a broken steam generator by properly setting levers and replacing gears and other broken parts. The puzzles are well designed and often make good use of the physics engine. They will require you to think things through, but are never so complicated that you will be stuck on any one for too long.The physics engine makes interacting with the world feel pretty real. Using the mouse you actually grab on to items and move them around. Opening doors requires more than just a click, as you have to push or pull your mouse to swing the door open. Similarly, turning valves requires you to move the mouse in the correct circular motion. It creates a unique physical connection between you and the game that really helps to immerse you in its world. It also helps increase the tension a lot, especially when running from enemies where you actually have to stop and swing a door open in order to get away.The presentation of the game is pretty solid, especially for an indie game. The graphics engine won&#8217;t necessarily impress if you have been playing a lot of big budget games, but by no means does the game look bad. The actual art in the game is pretty good. Objects have a good amount of detail, and feel authentic for the time period.  The lighting engine works well, creating believable shadows and the use of ambient occlusion adds depth to the scenes. However, the most impressive part of the presentation has to be the audio design. The audio designers clearly understand that what you cannot see is often scarier then what you can, and they provide you with some truly terrifying sounds to get your imagination working against you. The graphics and audio combine to create a game that is really rich in atmosphere.True horror games are rare these days, but Amnesia The Dark Descent really pulls it off. This might just be the creepiest game ever made.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

While it does have a childish cartoony look to it, the gameplay is classic zelda, and a little bit more.  Now you have the option to pick up items off the ground and use them as weapons.  This is an awesome feature, unlike anything ever seen in a zelda game.  Beating enemies with these items is very satisfying and is a welcome addition to the Zelda series.  The second highly noticable feature is the GBA to GC link up.  If you have a Game Boy Advance, or Game Boy Advance SP, and you have the GBA to NGC link, you can play Wind Waker with 2p CoOp play!  That's right, for the first time in history a Zelda console game allows two people to play the game at once.  Player 1 is obviously link, while player 2 is tingle.  Tingle is represented by a marker on the ground and can drop bombs for a small charge.  The player controlling Tingle can look at the GBA screen because it presents a full map showing where Link is.  The map screen also gives helpful tips on what to do.  Overall, if you own a GameCube, you'd be a ... not to try this game out.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Moni R. \"Moni R.\"","summary":"Underrated System...Great Potential","reviewText":"I cannot believe the hate Nintendo and this system are getting online. I waited until E3 to see what xbone and ps4 had to offer and with paid online on both(Sony you almost had my pre-order), fishy DRM(I know both consoles are saying their leaving it up to \"publishers\" but that can still mean a lot of things and we will wait and see what happens with that), and no real must play exclusives (I'm not that into killzone, infamous, halo, etc.) I decided to go with the Wii U for now and see what happens with the other consoles first before picking them up. With all that said I'm very pleased with the Wii U and its capabilities and performance. After the initial update which all consoles do have, the Wii U menu was fast and I liked the user interface.The gamepad is a real shocker, it's light and actually very comfortable to hold. The button placement is my favorite now on this controller with the analog sticks level on the top, it feels very natural and playing ps3 now feels a bit awkward. The gamepad is also very functional for me at least. I now browse the web on it and watch youtube videos without having to boot up my computer. I also find myself playing games on the gamepad itself with the tv off, it is useful since no one else in my house gets disturbed with me playing since I have my headphones on. The battery could be better but I'm easily getting 4-5 hours with screen brightness at 3 and volume halfway. I don't mind the battery life because I got the charging cradle and I just put it into the cradle after each play session and always have full battery when its time to play. Also I heard they will be selling a new battery pack to extend the battery, I won't buy it since I don't feel the need to. The only negative about the gamepad for now is that it is not sold separately and the system does not support two gamepads yet. Nintendo said that dual pad support will be available and therefore you can purchase the gamepad by itself. Hope that happens soon because I would want to be able to purchase another gamepad just in case...for now I got it armored with the nerf armor.The system itself is small and looks sleek. It has a traditional Nintendo feel to it and looks great in my tv setup. I like the piano black finish on the system and gamepad but yes it shows fingerprints easily...a quick wipe down with a damp cloth every few days will keep it looking great. The apps are all there like netflix, youtube and hulu...but the web browser is really worth mentioning, it has to be the best most usable web browser on any device, I use the web browser on this  more than on my phone,laptop etc. Miiverse is excellent, it is the best gaming community twitter type thing ever...seriously I'm not into social media much but Miiverse is like heaven sent for someone like me, a social community only about games. I love it and find myself posting screenshots and whatnot frequently. Also the people I've met on Miiverse have been the nicest gamers out there. Miiverse is something Nintendo really got right. The eshop is also good I purchased Trine 2 on sale and that went really smooth so no complaints but I think they can expand it more and make it better. I like that you can watch trailers of upcoming games on eshop that was kinda neat.Okay, so now the real bashing the system is getting is about not really being \"next gen\"...first of all next gen just means a companies next game console and it has nothing to do with power, so yes the Wii U is Nintendo's next gen console. With that said I understand it will be weaker than xbone/ps4 but it is much better than ps360. Don't believe me? well go look up the specs online and you'll see that is better than ps360 and is actually next gen. People who think it will fall short when compared to xbone/ps4 don't understand that it doesn't really matter because Nintendo first party exclusives will be on it and you will be surprised by some of the other great looking games like bayonetta 2 and \"x\". As for third party support it is fishy on the Wii U but if enough consoles sell we might see more multi plats than expected.I have so far played Mario U/BLOPS 2/Warriors Orochi 3/Zombi U/Injustice and Need for speed U. All I can say is that all games were very fun to play and dare I say the multi plats looked better on the Wii U. The graphics are great and remember this is the first year of the console it usually takes many years for games to look even better on any console. Remember launch games on ps3/360...yeah they looked liked ps2 graphics, the Wii U is looking great at launch and if games are properly developed for it then they can really use the gamepad and system to its full potential.In conclusion, I am very happy with the system. The graphics are great, the gamepad has a lot of potentail, more first party exclusives are on the way, Bayonetta 2 and \"X\" alone look like they are worth buying the console. I do think Nintendo should have had more games available quicker so people would understand that the system is not as dry as they think but oh well the future looks better. Can't wait for mario 3d/wind waker hd/mario kart/bayonetta 2/wonderful 101/pikmin 3/\"X\"/donkey kong tropical freeze/rayman legends/watch dogs/AC 4 Black Flag/Batman Origins etc. Yeah the system will have plenty of games as you can see. Another plus is no online subcription and used games policy which was pretty important to me not because I can't afford to pay online or buy new, but it's a value and freedom issue(I already pay for the internet and I should be able to do whatever I want with my purchased game).  Last but not least will the Wii U be enough vs xbone/ps4? Well that depends on the individual gamer, for hardcore Nintendo fans it will be enough, for gamers that love xbone/ps4 exclusives maybe not. For somebody like me who is not that crazy about the exclusives on xbone/ps4...it will be enough IF AND ONLY IF it gets some of the major cross platform games like it is for now with watch dogs/batman/AC4. For now I'm happy and feel that the Nintendo exclusives only make this console worth buying so please people don't hate and give it a try you might be surprised. Sorry for the long review but I just had to let the world know. Btw I don't work for Nintendo but I respect Nintendo because I would not be a gamer without them and their NES/SNES consoles.P.S. I forgot to mention that the system is also backwards compatible with the Wii games and accessories, another plus for those who want to keep some of there great Wii games like Zelda/Mario or play some they missed.Also the memory isn't that bad considering it is flash memory. If you are going to use only disk based games then the 25 GB leftover after the update will be more than enough and you can download quite some games from eshop. If you are going to be downloading a lot of games from eshop then you can easily find a HDD for a very good price here on amazon. It is always good to have one of those anyways. Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2013"}

The Presentation, the Story, the World of the game looked amazing. Then it came out...and got reviews that ranged from mediocre to VERY negative (IGN gave it a 59 out of 100). But knowing what I know about game critics and their tastes (El Shaddai's metacritic is 75, Child of Eden's is 81) I figured the critics were just snubbing the game (as usual) for not being a sepia-toned FPS with lots of blood and gore. I figured right. I was actually about to purchase this game outright when SONY offered it for free as part of PlayStation Plus. Needless to say I was overjoyed at an opportunity to try it out for free.Welcome to Neo ParisDon't let the crappy orange box art fool you. This game is absolutely gorgeous in the art, animation, and presentation departments. Literally from the moment the game starts you are enveloped in a gorgeous futuristic world of Minority Report-like technology. The menus, the interface sounds, the help system, are all slick as the designs from Designer Republic in Wipeout 3. As you move through the world of the game, there are digital indicators everywhere like an AR (augmented reality) system that we all know is coming to the real-world soon. Like the glowing, moving advertisements in Mass Effect, or the city details in Arkham City, it feels like a living, breathing city straight out of Blade Runner meets Ghost in the Shell with Minor Report thrown on top. As a lover of cyberpunk I am in love.Catch me if you canI cannot overstate how incredibly the character models, animation, and world are presented. The main character moves like a beautiful woman (not waddling like a duck, like the female Shepard from Mass Effect). The animations are incredibly life-like and SMOOTH. As you walk through the first rooms and the opening credits scroll, you feel like you are in a science fiction film. Awesome.Once things get going, you find yourself running away/toward areas to accomplish objectives, and fighting off enemies. The platforming is straight out of Prince of Persia and the excellent Tomb Raider Legend, but... it's BETTER. Instead of jumping to your death when you meant to jump to a ledge, instead of trial and error and frustration, the indicators show you where to go and our protagonist is remarkably sure-footed. The frustration is ENORMOUSLY less than other games of this type I have played.You gotta fightEverybody and their brother lately is trying to emulate Arkham Asylum/City's combat system with combo-based fighting. This game pulls it off extremely well and in a very fresh new way. Unlike in Batman where you will often find yourself completely surrounded and trying to figure out what combination of buttons fires the one gadget you need for this ONE enemy type, here you can customize combos to suit the situation. The action plays out incredibly smoothly, remarkably like a fight from the kind of movies I enjoy, pulse pounding and never frustrating even when things were difficult. I don't think ANY combat system is perfect, but this one is dang close.Thanks for the memoriesThe stealing and manipulation of memories is key to the story, and it also makes up part of the gameplay. You will follow in other's footsteps using memories they leave behind, overload the minds of thugs, and hack into people's minds to remix their memories. All of this is extremely well done and highlights a great strength of the game.Star Wars:Force Unleashed had quick button press events that were overused to the extreme and distracted from the gameplay. Prince of Persia:Sands of Time had over-long platform-climbing segments that slowed down the pace of the game. And don't get me started on how games have a near-constant combo-fighting gameplay leave you feeling exhausted and wanting to reach for the power button. In contrast this game is extremely well balanced, and will have you exploring, climbing, fighting, and remixing at intervals that keeps everything fresh and exciting.My game of the yearThe things people complain about in this game are quite frankly ridiculous. The world is too restrictive? It's an interactive cyberpunk not a crime-fighting superhero/western. And it's a far cry from the &#34;tube world&#34; of Final Fantasy XIII. Memory remixes aren't done enough? They aren't the point of the game, they are a part of it. This isn't a memory remixing simulator, it's an interactive movie. There's too many bugs? Batman: Arkham Origins had a LOT more. So did KOTOR II: The Sith Lords. So did X-com: Enemy Unknown. And don't get me started on Skyrim. Didn't seem to hurt those games scores (or sales).This game has it all. A beautiful, intelligent, sexy protagonist with an intriguing past, fantastic voice acting, gorgeous visuals, incredibly facial and character animation, a incredibly detailed game world, a fantastic soundtrack, thrilling combat, slick non-frustrating platform climbing-traversing segments (that make Uncharted look like the garbage it is), and a story and presentation that sucks you in makes you want to keep playing till the the end. There world needs more games like this. 10 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

Hooker \"bulmabriefs144\"","summary":"Pffft","reviewText":"In terms of strategy games, it's kinda a lightweight. Mainly, you have three elements, that are sorta like rock/paper/scissors, Sola (sun), Luna (moon), and Stella (star), with sun weak to moon but strong to star, etc. You can boost abilities or use techniques, by equipping skills that you find in battle to slots, or buy them in shops. There's a few problems though.  The slots aren't separate for abilities and skills, so you need to choose between having heal and having defensive abilities. The MP meter fills each turn, but always starts at 0, making battles a pain in terms of special abilities.  But what made this thing ridiculous, to the point that I quit playing was the limited turns system.  You have a certain number of turns the battle is to be finished (sometimes this makes sense, but usually it really doesn't). Ultimately, I stopped around the point where I not only had ten turns but was supposed to protect these two soldiers (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD). Soldier 1 died on the first enemy turn, Soldier 2 died at the beginning of my third turn.I like the anime style graphics, but they're often absurdly cute. The monsters shown in the opening scene, the skeleton in the army looks like a lego style one, and the big bad demon is just a dark shadow, that possesses the \"prince\" (who looks suspiciously more like a girl, and here you thought Jeanne was a crossdresser). The conversation is trite in places, and inconsistent (Jeanne's friend Lianne is the only one in France apparently that has a noticeable accent). It's certainly funny, but not at all fun after the third battle.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2011"}

On your journey to stop the cycle of dying and coming back, you meet a large assortment of very interesting NPC's that will aid you on your quest.

Masterpiece; a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company.  Many things gain this mark, but few live up to their expectation.

The characters seem generic.  However, this is all a product of subsequent games.Final Fantasy 7 defined the 3D graphical engine used in almost all of today's RPGs.  Its characters, still fresh, were very unique, emotionally unstable, and enjoyable to read about.  The storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning, realistic world that presents real-life human troubles.This is far from a typical RPG.  From its conception, it redefined the genre and introduced the RPG to about 3 million new gamers.  Saying that Final Fantasy 7 single-handedly elevated RPGs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statement.Considering all of these things, a person skeptical about playing Final Fantasy 7 should grant reconsideration.

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"Axle F. \"The Brutally Honest Critical Reviewer\"","summary":"Great Mostly Linear Shooter... Bad Crysis","reviewText":"This is a single player only review... I couldn't care less about multi-player.I am going to try to rate this as a stand-alone game because comparing it to the others is like comparing \"The Godfather\" to \"The Godfather 3\" There is no comparison. The first ones were better in every way, save for maybe the musical score.I am a fan of the first two games in the series, Crysis and Crysis:Warhead, the amount of vehicles and a totally open world and all manner of community support and mod development, not forgetting to mention that the first game was, in my opinion, EPIC. It took me a full week worth of time to beat them and I loved them... Still do. It was quite fun with the amount of things you could do. Nothing beat getting to jump out of the water in stealth mode and then go into maximum power mode and punch bad guys, literally LAUNCHING them off cliffs or 80 feet into the air or against a fully destructible seaside shack building... Or shooting out the front tire of a hummer full of bad guys bearing down on you and causing it to flip and roll throwing everyone out of it... Head shots were so very satisfying... If I shot a guy in the leg, he would limp. The A.I. was amazing. The graphics are amazing, still, and the first two games are STILL used as benchmarks for high-end PCs. It was what a PC game should be, hardcore mouse and keyboard WITH optional, and flawless support for a PC Xbox-360 controller for the more laid back gamers... Made for the PC and THEN ported to the lesser console systems.Before I rant here... I'll say this is a surprisingly good shooter among the offers up around the same time of its release. I cannot say much anything bad if rating it as a stand-alone game with no previous entries.... So it is all kinds of awesome....Buuuuuuuuuuuut...That is not the case here... Whenever a company makes a series of games, they should ALWAYS out-do the game that came before... Bigger and better... That is what sells and brings back customers in a game series... This is not the case here. In fact.... I have to say WTF??? Did EA fire the original development crew and designers again or something? Is Crytek still on cruise control off the first two games and think that nobody would notice a bunch of things missing?First off... Compared to the previous games open world environments, this game is more of a corridor shooter, though there is the illusion of lots of space, this game is what I would call Bi-Level Linear, as in, it pretty much gives you only two major options to approaching most situations... Go in the front door, or sneak around back. You cannot backtrack like the previous games as this one loads level by level and you really are just nudged forward and rarely ever revisit any place.The A.I. characters are now dumb as bricks, instead of going on high alert when one of their own drops dead in front of them, they just keep walking around like nothing happened. Whereas in the original games the A.I. would even notice the visual distortion your cloaking made if you got too close, or would go on high alert if they found a body. Though on higher difficulties they become a bit less forgiving. Also... I have a problem with the more arcade-like feel of the bad guys in this game, you literally have to empty a full clip into each one to drop them and they don't seem to act as \"wounded\" like in the first games... On harder difficulty settings, each enemy acts like they are wearing the same super suit as you.Vehicles... VERY disappointing... Because of this games linear, corridor type set up, you probably won't even use them if you see them sitting around... All TWO of them, an unarmed Hummer thing and a standard FPS APC thing. Where as the first games, you got to control the vehicles from the cockpit, seeing the steering wheel and gauges and everything, sort of like far cry 2, so it didn't break the immersion of the game when in vehicles. In Crysis 2 it just goes to a standard 3rd person, outside the vehicle view and just feels too arcade like. And when you DO need to drive a vehicle, it is in only a straight line because there often isn't even enough room to turn around and everything behind you \"conveniently\" collapses and such.Weapons... Surprisingly similar to the first two games... In fact, I was quite happy with the selection and the ability to hot-swap mods on the weapons like laser sights and scopes and silencers. One of the things they kept from the first games. Though the fact I had to unload tons of ammo into every bad guy, made the guns feel more like I was trying to take down a mugger with a BB gun.Keyboard and mouse Vs. Controller... This game is not like the first two where they were made for PC first and THEN ported to console. Nope... This one is pretty much only good with an Xbox-360 controller, though I cannot be too critical about that since I actually like having controller support on PC and prefer the analog controls and more laid back playing with a controller over being stooped over the keyboard and getting carpal tunnel. So I give it a great rating with the controller integration.Graphics... Well... Um... Ouch... It actually DOWNGRADES to Direct X9! The first two games were some of the first to fully utilize DX10. Now with DX11 out, I would have expected a game with this kind of PC following would try to push the envelope again... But nope... It is pretty much a direct port from the consoles, where most the consoles can only run DX9, and it shows. Though the graphics are pretty damn good for a twice outdated engine, I guess it is the best that can be done with DX9 and there are \"rumors\" of a patch coming to add DX10 and DX11 support for the PC eventually...Story... While the story isn't as epic as the first two games, it is quite good compared to the other FPS offerings around the time of this games release. It gave me quite a few, \"WOW!\" and \"DUDE LOOK AT THAT!\" Moments, and it felt quite satisfying by the end. Though I do wish the single player campaign was a few hours longer... I'm getting rather tired of games constantly getting shorter and shorter.Music... ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING!!! But that is mainly because they tapped Hans Zimmer for the main theme and score that is heard throughout the game... The opening movie and the theme are quite memorable after you see it.But damn... I just cannot get over the fact that I can no longer punch the bad guys across the room anymore, or jump down from a height and pretty much squish a baddy. Or drive a massive army truck up to an enemy camp, run into 3 guys, getting them stuck on the front with the awesome physics of the first two games, jump out of the truck while it is still rolling and then watch it and the baddies plummet off a cliff to a nice fiery crash at the bottom of the cliff. That is what made the first two games so much fun, because if you had the imagination for it, you could do all kinds of fun things.Replay value.... Next to none... It just feels too scripted.The bottom line... And I wouldn't admit this about most EA games lately... I did not feel like I got too ripped off... Though it might just be the Hans Zimmer soundtrack that got me hooked... It creates such a great environment in the game that I'm willing to not be overly nit-picky about all the things this game lacks compared to the original two.It IS linear... But not to the point where you can't explore a little. I think game companies need to understand this... That people like getting rewarded for exploring off the beaten path instead of being herded like cattle down a one way street.Now for the honesty from a fan of the original Crysis games... STOP MAKING GAMES THAT ARE CALL OF DUTY or HALO CLONES!!!!!!! One is enough... Just because Call Of Duty made more money than James Cameron's Avatar movie does not mean ALL gamers want to only ever play games like that one in the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2011"}

This game is a classic and is a must own for any ps2 owner.You play the role of a Criminal who got an early bust out and now is on the road to revenge and mayhem.  You start out with easy to do missions but then start to get harder like asassinating the worlds biggest mafia all the way to destroying planes.  The game acctually has a really good \"mafia\" type storline.  The main character doesn't talk but I'm glad cause that lets us imagine.  The game has its pros and cons and that's why I didn't give it a big 5 out of 5.  The game has some really memorable parts and really great missions.The missions in the game are superb but if you're in the mood on doing some mayhem and exploring you can acctually leave the missions aside and do em' when ever you want just as long as you're not doing anymayhem after you've just triggered a mission.  The game takes place in Liberty City...Then South Central but with more of an attitude and much more Semi-safer with loads of Crooked cops, yakuza gangs and Columbian Cartells, not to mention the Triads!  And yes the main character has to go through all of these punks in order to survive and get revenge to the woman who put him through all of this mess.The best part about Grand Theft Auto 3 is the memorable characters that you'll adore but the only con I had with the characters is that most of them don't \"end\" with and ending like you won't take em' to some house and get a good bye, once you've finished there missions it's over and you'll never see em' again though there is one person you work for that acctually has an ending for him.  The game overall has really great memorable characters.  I really enjoyed this game back when It first came out, I was a few to get the game when it first came out and I hear stupid rumors that if you get the very first version of the game that was released some were in 01' you'll see spider man and Batman?!?!  I don't believe that though....The game consists of many missions to do and but loads of Arsenals of weapons like the shotgun, machine gun, and the bat.  The game has great controll.  Very easy to use and will get use to it withen 10 minutes.  The games music is fantastic and has a great selection of them and I loved the radio station with Laz-lo that was really great.  Rockstar tried to make this as real as possible even though it is abit cartoony then again it doesn't try to be too realistic.  Overall the Music and Controlls is a plus one.  The game really had one major flaw and that is that the game becomes very tedious later and that the visuals arn't as great as many has said to be.  The visuals could have bin better like say...Max Payne 2 better ohwell..The violence in this game is not Graphic, nor disturbing but cartoony-bloody violent and this games profanity isn't as hardcore as Manhunt or Max Payne 2 which are worse..  The game does deserve its Mature rating because well lets face it the game is really violent.  The game is from my opinion not recommended for kids under the age of at least 17+.  Now lets get to it..Good-Many missions to do and lots of places to explore-Many cool aray of weapons including the flamethrower-Lots of memorible characters also most of these characters are seen in San Andreas like Catalina and the GTA3 character also!-Lots of cool fast paced action to keep you on the edge of your seat-Great level desighn on Liberty city-When bored you'll have a blast just doing mayhem to the people on Liberty City-Great selection of MusicBad-It was a bit short...If you do the missions that trigger storyline missions only you could beatthis game inless then 10 hours..-Gets abit repetitive and frustraiting later on-The visuals wern't that great...Could have bin betterthe ugly-Killing Salvetore Leon..eheheheOverall this is a fast paced action adventure of Crime and vengence with buttloads of missions to do and great voice acting by some really great actors like Micheal Madeson(Kill Bill, Resivour Dogs, Species I and II)and has some really memorable Missions and great weapons of choice...Overall this Ps2 classic gets a4.9 out of 5 stars...Lates..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2004"}

Many people were anxiously awaiting this game and why shouldn't they have? These 2 companies were famous for their own hits at the time. Square with Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and the Final Fantasies. Nintendo with Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, and of course Mario. When it was released it seemed it was a game that people either loved or hated. I was one that loved the game.  Super Mario RPG had everything that a great RPG needed, with a nostalgic and original feeling to it that made it so special.At the time I thought these graphics were the greatest thing ever. The transition of Mario from the NES to SNES was exceptional. Basically, I think the graphics fit the game perfectly. Just like most RPG's you move screen to screen with different surroundings at every turn. From mountains and caves, to oceans and jungles, its all here. The character models in this game are excellent and the pseudo 3D graphic feel is really cool. Lastly, the battle animations and lighting effects are awesome.  Just look at Geno's Ultimate attack or Mario's fireball, and tell me that is not cool.  There are those that feel that the graphics are too ''kiddy.'' I for one have never understood that term. I suppose a true example of ''kiddy'' graphics would be Yoshi's Island for the SNES. Do I think that the graphics are bad because of that? Absolutely not... The overall graphic environment provides a great setting and plenty of emotion.Next we come to the sound. There are some very interesting and catchy tunes in this game. From the traditional Mario theme to some very great Square compositions. Each area has its own unique tune and at time I found myself humming to it. As for the sound effects, they all work. The attack and power sounds, as well as the grunts are all well done, and fit this game perfectly.  There is no voice acting to speak of, but what do you expect from a classic SNES game.I found the gameplay to be above and beyond my expectations for this game. First let me talk about the primary world. There are over 8 worlds and within each world are a variety of stages that you must pass to move on. Within each world are stages where you must pass through dangerous caves, jungles, or mountains. There are also towns as well where you can interact with characters, buy items and weapons, or just take a rest. Every level of gameplay is unique and different. There are puzzles to solve, interesting characters to meet, and fun battles. This brings me to the next point, the battle system.Unlike most traditional RPG's the enemies are not Randomly Generated. For example, in Final Fantasy you move around a area and all of a sudden you are pulled into battle. This is not the case here. While you are traveling through areas in this game you can see the enemy and engage in combat with them by walking into them. From this you can either surprise them and attack first, or if they run into you they get the first strike. All in all, a very interesting concept. There are so many other things I could go into, but I won't give it away.Overall, this classic is wonderful, and one of the best RPG's I have ever played.  About the challenge of the game, it is actually quite easy.  There are some difficult levels and bosses, but the overall premise of the game is simple, but I don't mean that in a bad way.  A easy learning curve is just what a game needs, so you can start having more fun earlier in the game.  With the amount of secrets in the game, and the surprising depth of the characters and story, the game can offer over 20 hours of gameplay.  Also, it is a great enough of a game that you will want to replay it over again as soon as you finish it.  I myself have beaten this game over 50 times in the years I have had it.  So, to put it simply...if you haven't gotten this game yet...get it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"A western shooter which has flaws, but is still fun","reviewText":"Fans of classic westerns and gunslinger flicks will appreciate how faithful this game is to its source material, but as far as gameplay and story goes, Red Dead Revolver barely rises above being an average third-person shooter and provides just enough bloody mayhem that will appeal to even other gamers who are simply casual fans of gunslinging (like me). The game opens with a young Red Harlow at home with his father and Indian mother when they get ambushed by a group of outlaws; Red's parents are killed and Red himself manages to escape. The game then jumps to about 12 years later where a grown up Red now makes a living shooting outlaws dead as a bounty hunter. After a quick tutorial, Red begins undertaking several missions involving a whole lot of shooting in small towns, a moving train, saloons, desert mountains, underground mines, and so on. A handful of other missions even take place on horseback and on the back of a moving wagon. Red gains access to a number of sidearms (revolvers), ranged weapons (rifles and shotguns), and thrown weapons (knives, dynamite, flaming whiskey, and snake poison), all with their own advantages and disadvantages in accuracy, damage, range, and speed. Each mission begins with Red choosing one weapon in each class, but other weapons and ammo can be picked up by fallen enemies and added to his collection.Five of the missions in this game put you in control of five other characters who play their own parts in the main story: the English dual revolver wielding gunslinger Jack Swift, the rifle wielding Annie Stoakes, Red's Indian cousin Shadow Wolf with his bow and arrow, the Buffalo Soldier with a one-hit kill rifle, and the villainous General Diego with his own suped-up rifle. Playing as these characters helps keep the game from getting too repetitive and adds a little more depth to the story, which is good because it really needs it. As it is, the story is very straightforward and simple, but still manages to be a little interesting. Plus, Red himself is a rather dry character who has less spoken lines than almost any other character in the game. It's not until almost halfway through the game that we start seeing who the main bad guys are and Red begins doing all he can to hunt them down and take his revenge on them for killing his family, but even this is done with almost no emotional reaction from Red. The game's graphics are somewhat... special. During cutscenes they're purposely made very fuzzy and grainy, along with intentional screen lines and screen tears that give the game the look of a dated celluloid western film, and the accompanying music is very fitting to the genre. The fuzzy screen effects clear up during actual gameplay, but not by much; I found myself squinting a lot when shooting distant enemies and objects since the fuzziness gets worse the farther away something is.The character models look okay, if a bit cartoony and slightly blocky. The main characters and a lot of the regular NPCs look more traditional, but some of the more outlandish enemies and bosses have noticeably exaggerated features, such as a pig nosed fat guy with TNT strapped around his body and a freaky looking pale man with a noose around his neck. Other guys will have really long faces or string thin gangly arms and legs, making this game sometimes look like half Clint Eastwood western and half Looney Tunes western. Even Red with his square shaped face and whisker-like scars on his cheeks has kind of a \"Naruto-ish\" look to him. The environments, as previoulsy mentioned, are all varied and look pretty nice, but again suffer a bit from the fuzziness of the graphics. Aside from this graphic fuzziness, none of the other things I addressed about the game are necessarily bad; in fact, they make the game more unique from others. The best part about the game is its challenging combat and missions... for the most part. About 80% of the game is moderately challenging, while the other 20% can be frustrating. Lots of missions have you facing a large group of enemies and you'll have to either shoot from cover or strafe around them while shooting.Most of the enemies are easy to deal with, which is why the game throws a large number of them at you in order to make the game challenging. Plus, the enemies can be stupid at times and will leave their cover to run straight at you and then away from you. Sometimes, you can shoot right at an enemy from behind or the side, but if they're next to a wall or other form of cover, the game's somewhat lousy hit detection thinks you're hitting whatever they're hiding behind instead of them, no matter how good your aim is. Another thing that can make the game a bit frustrating is when you have to not only keep yourself from getting killed, but also keep some AI partners from dying as well, which can be a pain in a couple of missions where you fight an army of enemies and letting even one of your allies die leads to a game over. Fortunately, the rest of the game's combat is fun, and aside from the occasional hiccups in the game's hit detection, the gun combat is well done. There's nothing more rewarding than shooting at some guys with a rifle and then switching to your sidearm and scoring two or three headshots in a row.There's melee combat as well, but it's poorly implemented and awkwardly stiff, which makes a certain bar fight mission all the more unnecessary. Killing enemies nets you points in gold, which can be used to purchase new weapons, increase health, unlock new characters and levels for multiplayer, unlock journal entries, and increase the amount of time certain special skills can be used (some of these things can be unlocked after completing a mission, depending on how well or poor you did). The upgrade shop is rather strange in its accessibility: it only appears after certain missions or before boss fights, and what was in the shop the last time you visited it will most likely not reappear again until much later. Now for special skills: Red's special skill known as \"dead eye\" slows the game down (like bullet-time) and lets you target your enemy by pointing the aiming reticule at certain spots (head, leg, arm) and then fire your gun in rapid succession at all marked targets. The other main characters have their own special skills, like flaming arrows or a flare shot that signals nearby cannons to fire on the target the flare hits.A few times Red will face one or up to three characters in duels, where the game has you grab your gun, draw it, and then you go into a similar mode as \"dead eye\" where the targeting reticule will appear somewhere on the screen (sometimes way to the bottom) and you have to mark your enemies when the reticule turns red in order to score a hit because marking your target when the reticule is yellow has you miss. Missing too many times or reacting too slowly will get you shot and most likely killed when facing the tougher duelists (like the very cheap Mr. Kelly). These dueling sessions would have been better if the targeting reticule didn't drift around on its own and you had better control over it, but as it is these duels can be satisfyingly fun when you pull them off right. Overall, despite its brief story and infrequent control issues, this game is pretty good and offers a mostly fair and addicting challenge. Still, this game won't appeal to everyone and even at its current price (about $15.00 in Gamestop) it should only be purchased by lovers of western themed shooters, otherwise it would be best to borrow it from someone for a weekend playthrough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2011"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience. Merging blistering 2D action with meticulously rendered 3D environments, players race through intriguing locations across the globe as Sonic to save a chaotic world.The other side of SonicSonic and his alter ego Werehog.View larger.Collect rings for Ring Energy.View larger.Swing into action with Werehog.View larger.A NewSonica New StoryOn a quest for world domination Sonic nemesis Dr. Eggman has managed to steal the chaos emeralds once again and this time drained them of their power. As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new proprietary &ldquo;Hedgehog Engine,&rdquo;Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other next-gen technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Everything that isn't the Sonic Day-Stages ruin this game...","reviewText":"I wanted to like this game. I really did. But everything about the game that isn't the Sonic day levels ruin it. Of course, you've probably heard by now how bad the Werehog levels are. Yes, they are THAT bad. In fact, they are so bad, they pretty much warrant most of this entire score. What's so bad about them though, isn't how lame, corny and repetitive the melee combat is. It's how HORRIBLE Werehog Sonic moves. He's not just slow compared to Sonic, he's just slow, period. He can't even really jump. And the levels are based around fighting hundreds of monsters, and the worst part, doing miss-it-or-die acrobatic stunts with Werehog Sonic. They are SO frustrating! Near controller breaking frustrating! Like, he's supposed to cling onto a ledge or pole, but half the time, it doesn't work! Not having any kind of depth perception whatsoever in the game doesn't help, either. Oh, and he can die from a six foot or more drop, as I learned. The clock tower climb in the Spagonia night level was pure torture. But then again, all of the Werehog levels are. Oh, and the night levels are roughly 15 to 20 minutes long! More than twice as long as the Sonic day levels! Seriously, who thought it'd be fun to make you play as this slow-moving Werehog having to do numerous death stunts when most of the time, he either never clings on to what he's supposed to, or you'll only get a split second to do so. The overworld stuff isn't really fun, either. Just busy work, honestly. The plot is so-so for a Sonic game and I like the idea of an Earth-like world to explore, with similar to real life countries. But overall, outside of the Sonic levels, the game is just tedious, frustating, and a chore to play. Even some of the Sonic levels (like godawful Holoska) are a pain in the you-know-what. All in all, this game is frustating, feels like a chore to play every time, and is almost never fun when you're not speeding through a Sonic day level. Ironically, the Sonic levels were created as an after-thought considering the name of the game. So, avoid this game, unless you can endure the torture of the Werehog and errand-running crap to get to the good stuff of the Sonic day-level speedy goodness.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2011"}

That's right folks, they're here to save the world again, as the Ghostbusters video game has finally been unleashed, and be glad that it has.  Playing as a young protege on the first day of the job, you accompany our favorite wise-cracking ghost wranglers as New York City is thrown under siege by a bevy of ghosts and other creepy baddies.  Technically speaking, the game looks great despite some minor graphical glitches, and even though the somewhat cumbersome controls take time to get used to, wrangling ghosts ends up proving to be a fun and rewarding experience.  Adding to the fun that Ghostbusters ends up conjuring is a funny script with plenty of witty dialogue written by original film scribes Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd, and to make matters even better, Ramis, Aykroyd, Bill Murray, and Ernie Hudson all lend their voices to the characters they played way back when, along with other stars of the film Annie Potts and William Atherton, as well as Alyssa Milano as a pivotal character whom Venkman takes a fancy to.  Multiplayer modes provide even more fun as well, with the only real drawbacks of the game being that it is a little too short, and the combat itself can be a little too repetitive.  Still though, if you are a Ghostbusters fan in the very least, you can easily overlook these flaws and still get plenty of enjoyment out of what they find here.  All in all, Ghostbusters is a pure enjoyable blast, and if you grew up with the films, cartoon, toys, or whatever; this game is a must-have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2009"}

Games are fast approaching Hollywood blockbuster movies in their sophistication, depth, and storyline, and Mass Effect 2 is a perfect example of this.Mass Effect 2 is basically a science fiction movie that you get to play inside of.  I won't go into the plot, but as a huge sci-fi fan, I can tell you that it is worthy of a movie, and I believe it is being developed now to be turned into a movie.I liked (but did not love) the first Mass Effect.  It was choppy and uneven, especially in combat.  Mass Effect 2 refines and perfects the FPS combat, and while because of that it is not a \"true\" RPG, it retains the great story telling of RPG's while also being satisfying as a straight shooter.You don't have to play the first Mass Effect to enjoy this game, but you will want to get familiar with the plot of the first.  IGN had an excellent 10 minute video of Mass Effect 1 that narrated and showed footage of the first that I reviewed to get me on track for the 2nd Mass Effect.  You can Google it and locate it.  I am sure there are other summaries out there as well. (there is at least one on You Tube, although it is a bit annoying)Since they are already making Mass Effect 3, which will be the final in the trilogy, now is a great time to jump in and join the Mass Effect universe. It is around 40 hours of great gaming that sucks you into a great story, all for $20.  Compare that to the cost of even a single movie that lasts only 90 minutes, and the value is apparent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I wasn't thrilled with how the story began in ME1, but most importantly I was extremely thrown off by the shooter elements being greatly enhanced in ME2. Even though I hate shooters, I found myself sucked into the story and the galaxy as a whole in ME2. This to me is where ME2 shines. The story is phenomenal. I found myself thinking so many things just didn't add/make sense playing ME1, well plenty of answers are found here and in ways I never expected. It also seems that Bioware worked hard to put more emotion into the dialogue and scenes, and did so in a believable and noncheesy way. I found myself with goosebumps many times throughout the game.I am an RPG-lover at heart and at first I thought ME2 was going to fail miserably in delivering a true RPG experience instrad favoring a fast paced high action shooter. But, while many RPG aspects do seem dumbed-down, this games shines in dialogue and story. This definitely left the RPG lover in me craving more.

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"Awesome Sonic game","reviewText":"I've always loved the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and this game is no different.  The great part about this game is that you can either play the Hero side or the Dark side, whichever you choose, it DOES end up the same way.Gameplay - awesome controls, plays a lot like the older games but obviously a little better considering it's a lot newer and on a better system.Graphics - great graphics, good detail on the characters and the levels are awesome.Stages - each character has their own special stages, Sonic/Shadow are on their feet doing adventure modes, Tails/Eggman are in machines while Knuckles/Rouge have to find three emerald pieces.  This game even has 2 racing stages.  The best part is, after you beat a level, you can replay it as much as you want and you keep playing until you receive the letter A.  Once you beat the level, a new &quot;challenge&quot; appears such as collect 100 coins, find the lost chao, time mode and hard mode.  The stages also get gradually harder which is expected.Characters - old and new characters appear here, of course Sonic, Tails and Knuckles are back to fight off the evil Dr. Eggman but this time he's brought along Rouge the bat and Shadow, a Sonic look-a-like which is supposedly the &quot;secret weapon&quot;.Options - not only does this game have the different challenges for each level, it also contains a 2 player mode where you can play with a friend on some of the stages.  Other two player games include the racing, chao race and a shooting battle.Chao Garden - the Chao Garden is an amazing feature, it's awesome raising chao and in this game you get 3 gardens though 2 have to be earned.  The Hero Garden is a garden for the good chao (chaos that should only be raised by Sonic, Tails and Knuckles).  It's a beautiful sunny garden with a nice heavenly waterfall/pool.  The Dark Garden is for evil chaos (for Shadow, Eggman and Rouge).  It is complete with a red pool and dying, Halloween looking trees.  The chaos can die but if you treated them well, they will leave an egg and after 2 or 3 times they will become an immortal Angel or Devil chao and will actually look quite different (IF you follow the directions).  There is chao races in the normal garden (for good, evil or neutral chao) and chao karate.  Once you beat all the races and karate, you will receive gifts.Other - the game is great, it features similar levels to the old Sonic, he still has the loops and everything.  I like the idea that you can be good or evil and the storyline is excellent.  It's the kind of game you will want to play over and over again, especially since it's actually REALLY hard to get a level A in some of the levels.  A fun overall game and definitely worth the price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2004"}

The game was a beaut to look at but it was hard as hell and there was a lot of backtracking. Now the sequel comes and while it's not a failure on all fronts, the developers still haven't addressed some issues from the first one.Story: What little story there is anyway. On the planet Aether, a race called the Luminoth is thriving, much like the Chozo on Tallon IV. They discover a massive meteorite is about to hit and when it does, the resulting energy causes a dimensional rip that provides 2 Aethers: Light and Dark. Afterwards, a Federation ship crash lands on Aether and a distress signal is sent to Samus. She must now stop the Ing, the race that occupies the Dark world.Graphics: Improvements over the first one, which was beautiful anyway. Particle systems are better and levels seem more expansive. Bosses take up a huge chunk of the screen which makes it a bit annoying when you're trying to dodge.Sound/Music: No voice overs except for Luminoth's weird voice(kinda like Zelda, no words just gibberish). The music is still the same: ambient textures with an otherworldly feel.Gameplay: Basically the same as the first. 2 new visors: Dark Visor, allowing you to see objects and enemies that are in the dark world when you're in the light world. And the namesake Echo Visor, which looks like Ben Affleck's power from Daredevil. They took out some beams and added the Light and Dark beams, with get this: ammo. Instead of going nuts, you have to preserve your ammo, which got really irritating.As for the difficulty, if you've never played the first one, I suggest you beat it first. At least then you'll know what to expect with this. For players who long for a harder difficulty, you'll enjoy this. For the rest of you, you will have your *** handed to you on more than one occasion. Even with standard enemies.

The ability to surprise people by hiding in the rafters and then gliding down to kick their booty's is an example of some ways in which Bat's can be more effective in combat. The ability to customize is really cool also. Perhaps you really want to get \"Bat-ass\",:), at using your Batarang.

{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Kristin","summary":"Great gameplay.  End is a little dissapointing but not a game killer","reviewText":"There are some things about this game that are amazing and others that I thought were a little annoying, so like many who have come before me, I will try to list out my observations:1. Cutscenes are way too long and far too many, especially in the beginning.  Its like watching a movie with a little bit of gameplay sprinkled in.  I had this same complaint about another Bioware title, Dragonage II.  It does seem to get slightly better as you progress and get into the action, but it feels like theres a lot of cutscene where there should be gameplay instead.  The last hour or so of the game is just basically watching a movie with very little interaction.2. Gameplay and graphics are almost exactly like ME2, so this is more of a continuation of that game without significant levels of upgrade.  There's lots of gameplay though.  I played ME2 for 56 hours, ME3 went for roughly the same number of hours.  Of course I tend to be a little more thorough and thoughtful in terms of how I approach a game so your experience may be different.3. Story is a good one.  Engaging and interesting with well developed characters.  Relationships from previous ME games are brought forward to this finale in the trilogy.4. Has what I can only describe as serious wierdness and not in a good way.  Like dream sequences in which things are slow and irritating.  I get what they were trying to do with that and it could have been done well, like some of the spookier gameplay portions of Dragonage Origins, but I think they fell pretty short on this.5. I still had my ME2 stuff on my computer, so it gave me the option of just importing that into ME3, very convenient and made for some nice consistent carryover from one game to the next.6. As with ME2, there is a huge amount of information available in the form of journal entries, codex info, when entering orbit on planets and so forth.  While very little of it is necessary to be successful in and enjoy the game, it does add to the RP immersive element of understanding the game universe better.7. I liked the fact that I didn't have to scan every planet in every system for resources as in ME2.  That got tedious and boring and the way resources are discovered in ME3 is a little better.8. They do a great job of giving you a sense of urgency which contributes to the excitement.9. Good emotional connections, especially if you've played previous ME games and got to know the characters and their back stories through those previous installments.  Some of the scenes and music reminded me of Dragonage Origins and how well the characters were formed and how well many of the scenes and situations played out on an emotional level.  Many of the characters that had major roles in previous games come back in fairly limited cameo appearances.  It's nice to see them again but there's not significant amount of interaction with them as they're not the focus on this one.  Because of the depth of development of the characters, the ending can definitely have a strong emotional impact.10. The music is very nicely done.  Some of it seems pretty standard but there are a few pieces that go with some scenes in which the music really stands out, helps create a much stronger scene and is really enjoyable.11. I'm fairly certain that the dialogue choices don't really impact what happens beyond perhaps minor response variations at best. That is, there doesn't seem to be any kind of outcome or consequence from choosing one response over another except that you either get renegade or paragon points depending on how you answer which I suppose has some impact that I'm not sure of.  I guess it's good for the whole RP element too in terms of how you view your character and the situation.12. There's no mini games in this like ME2, like door bypasses, etc.  Also, there's no ammo differential in terms of picking up heavy, normal, etc like in ME2.  It seems like any ammo you find fits whatever guns you have.14. I kind of liked how in ME2 I could wander into the men's room and EDI would gently remind me where the women's room was.  ME3 the men's room is just inaccessible.  Its just not as much fun that way.15. Although I didn't get the \"perfect\" ending, I did get one that I felt pretty good about in the bigger picture.  The only thing the military strength really does is give you more choices at the end.  The higher yourpoints, the more choices you will have and the better the outcomes will be.16. I can see how a lot of people would have been dissapointed with the ending.  It seemed like for all the choices you make throughout the game, they have zero impact on how the game actually comes out.  So what you do in terms of relationships and RP choices, etc doesn't matter one bit it seems.  So you get a few choices at the end, you pick the one that makes the most sense to you and thats pretty much it.  There is a nice epilogue that may or may not have been tacked on later, I'm not sure.  That kind of helped me to understand that I made the right choice and to feel good about things.  Still, to make all kinds of choices and decisions for almost 60 hours and then have it all come down to a handful of options that having nothing to do with most of those choices and decisions, I can see a disconnect there for sure that would dissapoint people.Overall I think its a great game.  I think many people have said that until the ending, its very satisfying and a lot of fun.  For me the ending wasn't optimal, but it didn't destroy the game either and it didn't take away from all the enjoyment I had prior to that.  I think if you've played ME before (or similar 3rd person shooter closed path games) then you'll really enjoy this.  If you haven't played ME before, I would strongly recommend that you go play ME or ME2 first, that way when you get into ME3, you'll have a stronger sense of things.  Since theres not much gameplay difference between ME2 and ME3, why not?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"John L. Maillard \"Digital Enthusiast\"","summary":"Fun...but a Little Boring","reviewText":"Okay. I was never a big fan of the first Diablo game. One dungeon. Many levels. Many monsters. Many weapons. Many left clicks. That was really it. The story was decent, but as far as &quot;engrossing&quot; RPGs go, it could've been a lot better.Along comes Diablo II, and I hoped it resolved the problems of the first game. First off, the graphics weren't really updated. In Act 1, the monsters looked bitmapped, and the animations weren't too hot. As the game progressed, the graphics got a little better, but still, I don't play games for the graphics foremost; it's the gameplay that counts. And again, this is where the Diablo franchise stalls. I like the 5 different classes; it makes for terrific replay value. But then again, when Icewind Dale, Planscape: Torment, and Baldur's Gate I and II are out there, do you really have time to go ahead and play the same game again as a different character? The skills were pretty cool and the plot was masterfully written and detailed in breathtakinig cutscenes. But something is missing in this game. I found some of the quests tedious and boring, without any real fulfillment when I completed them. It was like, &quot;go here, kill this thing, and come back when you're done.&quot; Still, I did find myself battling hordes of demons well into the night, so it did keep my interest, simply based on the fact that I wanted to kill the big dude at the end. I worked hard to build up my barbarian, and I wanted it to be all worth it. The different locations were nice, although slightly formulaic (desert, jungle, ruins, etc.), and the ability to customize your character was a breath of fresh air. NPCs were okay, as your interaction with them was limited to mostly gossip and a few quest checkpoints. But don't get me wrong: Diablo II is a nice game, and probably worth the money. But if you're looking for a real story with a &quot;true&quot; RPG feel (a la different characters in a party format), do yourself a favor and pick up Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But if you're into tried-and-true, mindless hack-and-slash, Diablo II is your game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2000"}

But since then I have finished it about 4 times over a yr period.  The first time took me over 100hrs and then next few times I sped through exiting the cut scenes and stuff and it took about 40hrs.What I want to say is that I recomend this game because of the fun, the graphics, the tight controls, and the scale of the living world.First of all the game is fun.  You can drive and hijack any vehicle.  Tanks, cars, motorcycles, helicopters, trucks.  And the driving mechanics in the cars is so fun.  You can drive fast cars and use the hand brake to fish around corners and each vehicle drives and feels real.  Especially your tech girl Fiona's pink camaro!  Also you can blow up anything.  Oil tankers, buildings, towers, cars, bad guys, a castle, bunkers... anything!  You can use guns, c4, have a helicopter drop an airstrike, or later in the game have a jet drop an airstrike type bomb and even a nuke.  You can man stationed machine guns, different artillery morters, you can shoot down helicopters with a anti air missle.  drive a tank and shoot morter rounds at building bad guys vehicles.  And all of it has a gratifying big explosion.  Also this isn't like grand theft where you are encouraged to do bad things.  If you kill civilians your money is deducted and there are no missions that involve killing civilian.  So this game will let you sleep at night.  That is if anybody's got a morality standard anymore.The graphics are awesome.  Best of any game I have played.  Cars, character models are lifelike and big not small like some games, the country of velenzuela all look visually stiking with no slow down and I havent noticed any pop up or any graphical issues at all.  This is quite an accomplishmet considering the size of the world.  There are about 5 factions and about 10-20 missions per faction which include taking over outposts which means you usually blow it all to hell except for the building that the soldiers from the faction you are working for need to enter.  There are also missions where you take out high valued targets or stun them and have them extracted and there are also buildings to be destroyed in different locations.  There are other missions too like blowing up a castle or oil tanker.  There are a few vehicle missions to like time trials of driving different vehicles through an obsticle course, like a ferrarri type car or a boat or jetski.  The world is so big that it takes several minutes to drive from one end of the map to the other.  But not so long it gets boring and if you find it a pain you can call in you helicopter pilot to take you to different landing posts near your missions.  Also the AI is really good the helicopters are bothering you.  Tanks are bothering you, guys with rocket launchers are bothering you.  Guys on foot in jeeps are bothering you.I have read a few reviews about bugs.  I have been stuck in place a few times.  It sometimes happens in 3rd person games of this scale.  It has probably only happened a few times and all but once I was able to get unstuck.  It usually happens when you try to force your character into a tight spot that is not supposed to be gone through.  Like some trees near a wall that are not meant as a route to be walking through.  I have not noticed any slowdown frame rate issues.  And I cant remember but it may have froze once but I am not sure.  But it autosaves after every mission so you just have to redo a small amt of work.  Anyway, Most games I have had at least froze up once.  Anyway it is the funnest game I have ever played or owned and I recommend it to all third person adventure/war/shooter/open world lovers.  A really great game and should have been more appreciated so a third one would be made.  Too bad for the reviews professional and not who only love the gay 1st person shooters where the makers are so lazy they cannot even go to the trouble of showing you a person instead of an arm and a gun.  I hope somone still makes 3rd person games because I can't play the 1st person ones unless they are for a light gun.  Sorry for the rant.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"phoongdan","summary":"Fun concept game, nice graphics, but short gameplay...","reviewText":"I am a big fan of the MK series, in fact it is my favorite gaming series, dating back to when I played the original MK. The concept of having the MK characters fighting DC Universe was a great idea! The graphics look great too. Where the game loses me a little is in the story mode. The story mode in this game is little more than just fighting. If you have played the MK Deception or Armageddon you know how fun the story mode was in those games and was much more than just fighting other MK characters. In those story modes you also fought other forces and moved a long a path in order to collect items that unlocked various costumes, songs, etc. in the game play. The story mode in those games was even more fun than the arcade fighting.However, in this game, the story mode is little more than constant fights of the opposing side (if you choose the MK side, then you fight the DC side). I did like that as the story progresses you play as most of the MK characters. In other words you don't have to choose simply one character and stick with that throughout the story. That was one thing that I didn't like and I thought was a bit boring about the story mode in MK Armageddon was that you were stuck playing with Taven the whole story. Here you get to play with most of the MK characters and fight most of the other DC characters (or vice-versa if you choose to play story mode on the DC side). However, I still find the story mode in Armageddon much more dynamic and interactive whereas this game's story mode is little more than the arcade mode with a slightly developed story to it.You get 10 MK characters and 10 DC characters. Of course everyone is going to feel this character should have been replaced with that character, so there's no way to make everyone happy unless you do something like they did in Armageddon and have ALL the characters available to play with. Which in this game would be bordering on impossible considering you are representing both the MK characters and the DC characters. That said however, for my 2 cents I would have liked to seen either Sektor or Smoke as one of the MK characters - I'm a big fan of those cyborgs, particularly Sektor. But I understand those are minor characters for most people. However, certainly they didn't need to put Baraka in there! On the DC side, well I've never really been a fan of those comic book characters, but I suppose I would have liked to have Aquaman in there - would have been kind of fun to have one of the fighting arenas be in the ocean! Though I'm not sure how you would make that work exactly.The graphics are nice and the game is very clean and polished looking. The fight arenas are really good too. This was a fun game to play, but I guess my biggest criticism of the game is that it only took me a few hours to play through all of the content. The story mode seemed so short - an hour or two of game play I think, and the arcade mode of course only takes about an hour. So unique gaming time was only a few hours. I'm still playing the game and having fun trying out the different characters, but as these are the main characters from the MK games of the past, I know Sub Zero, Scorpion, Katana, etc. pretty well already. I do like the Deathstroke character on the DC side - pretty cool using that pistol shot to the face of your opponent!In comparing this game to the most recent MK game, Armageddon, though this game is much more polished and the set designs and graphics look nice, Armageddon offered a lot more in terms of gameplay and particularly a much better developed story mode. But both games are nice and I'm glad that I have them both in my gaming library for future play.Final Grade: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2010"}

Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"Who Needs Goldeneye 64???","reviewText":"Opening Statement...At first I was a skeptic like everyone else who knows and loved the James Bond video game franchise. After Goldeneye 64 any game that game out with the James Bond name one well let's face it they didn't live up to the hype and they flat out sucked (That is with the acception of Everything or Nothing, Goldeneye 64, From Russian With Love, and Nightfire of course.). And after looking up information about this game I felt the same way. Well here comes another game that is going to suck pretty bad. Boy I was so way off I was out of the ballpark...Presentation....This game does an amazing job at capturing the true James Bond feel to it. Some times it is stealthy and sometimes it is just go out and kill. The game does a good job and skipping through Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace scenes. It also captures the look and feel of Bond as well. I give this catagory a 5/5Graphics...This game does a great job at capturing Daniel Craig as james bond. The look the feel everything. It looks exactly like him. Along with other key characters in the game they all look pund for pund exactly the same as they do in real life. The missions are fantastic graphic wise there are dozens of diffrent textures and shands of anyting you can think of. The houses and everything look great. I give this catagory a 5/5Story...This game is great with the storyline. They had little to no information from the movie directores about the movie so therefore they coulden't make it just like the movie, however the information they got they worked with and made it fun and exciting every step of the way. They make it a thrill ride from the moment you load the game until the last single second until the credits start rolling. I give this catagory a 5/5Gameplay...This game is fantastic with a nice mix of 1st and 3rd person shooters. When you are first playing it is just like the old GOldeneye first person action that everyone knows and loved. But when you take cover it goes right into an outstanding 3rd person shooter which is awesome because it lets you see Daniel Craig at his best graphic wise. The ability to change guns and weapns so easily is a huge plus. The ability to uyse melee attacks so easily is also a plus. Also it kinda takes on a Call of Duty feel to is as well so it is easy to pick up. I give thsi catagory a 5/5Final Thought...This game is a must have for any James Bond fan. I know a lot of people have not played a James Bond game since Goldeneye 64 and I know my title is a little deciving. Believe me I love Goldeneye and I always will. But you need to open up and try this game. It kicks so much butt that you might even forget about Goldeneye for the moment becuase it has its own feel and greatness to it. If you don't but this game and play it you are NOT a true James Bond fan. It is an amazing game with a low price it is fantastic. This game is by far one of the best games i have ever played and it uses every little aspect of James Bond to the max....Goldeneye may be a thing of the past with this blockbuster hit. My overall rating for thsi game is a 6/5...I know impossible but what this game does was thougth impossible Thats how good it is....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

I enjoy this new version for DS, however I am very disappointed that they do not include the original version with which many people are familiar.  The DS version does include an `original' mode but unlike Bejeweled, where you exchange adjacent gems to make rows of 3, 4, 5, etc., the DS Classic mode, which looks like the PC version, makes you rotate a group of four adjacent jewels to make sets or 3 or more.  Classic mode on DS also includes time bombs which you must match before time expires.  Another nice twist (no pun intended).  There also are locked jewels which cannot be rotated in other positions.It is not that this is worse, or better, just different.  I enjoy playing the Classic mode on DS, and the other modes, Zen and Challenge are fun also.  I would have just liked if they included the \"vanilla flavor\" of Bejeweled.Zen is fun.  It is slower paced - no exploding time bombs or locked gems.  In that respect it is the closest to the original.  I would recommend Zen mode for beginners so they can learn at their own pace.Challenge mode must be unlocked.  This is simple to do by playing Classic or Zen a little to build up points.  Challenge mode is sort of the \"mini games\" of Bejeweled.  It gives the player different challenges they must overcome.  Detonating gems in a time frame, clearing a specific number of gems in limited number of moves, and so on.Overall, this is a fun game which can occupy lots of time - it's addictive and you can find yourself playing for hours.  But I think they missed big by not including the original variation.  I am giving it 5 stars because it is an excellent game in its own right, and if I didn't know of the original I would love it just the same.  But be forewarned that if you get it because you want the version you are familiar with on a phone or PC, this one is somewhat different.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

For a 15-16 hour game, I think it was worth it for 40 dollars. The platforming was good and even though the graphics were absolutely horrible, the art style made up for it. In London, you could tell that the graphics looked almost like a PS2 game, but when in Wonderland, the art style covered up the bad graphics and made the game look great. Combat was pretty good but not why I bought the game. Combat/platforming could get a bit repetitive at times but it was never boring. I didn't particularly like the minigames, either. Some were too challenging, but you are given the option to skip some of them. The story wasn't the best, and it was only explained a little bit in each chapter. Each chapter seemed to be a lot of pointless platforming to get to the next location, then the story was explained in some cutscenes for maybe 2 minutes in each 3 hour chapter!

The hype consumed me and now I find myself regretting the purchase a bit. In appearance, it is what you would expect out of a GTA game, activities and the ability to steal cars and so on. But what they've done is make the map bigger and give you three point of views to play from, Trevor, Micheal and Franklin. The interface itself simply bewilders me, and unlike Volition... Rockstar went the direction of an over complicated user interface. The online portion of the game is what I consider to be it's weak suit. I've always said that pvp detracts away from cooperative and solo gameplay. Games become weaker as a result of such a game mechanic being added and with GTA Online it is no different. You have an open pvp system, where passive mode doesn't work like it should have in the first place. If you like a crime sandbox game, buy Saints Row IV instead. If all you can think about is PKing other people, then this game is for you by all means.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2013"}

First, the level design has gotten simpler in an effort to streamline the original.  However, in an effort to do so, the layouts of the buildings have gotten quite absurd. For example, they now have stationed an office (with the 2 programmers in Kalinatek) behind a wall, aside a narrow corridor. In the last part, with the Palace, they have stationed cameras on bushes!  The XBox version had a more realistic design.  Next, the addition of the new suit and mission is nice, but overall, the additional mission wasn't too exceptional.  Additionally, the loading times for the PS2 version were too long, and the checkpoints were not save points at all on the PS2 version, like the XBox version.  Lastly, the boss fights (especially Grinko's) were stupid and quite annoying.  They streamlined the boss fight too much, and it lacked the realism (and extreme difficulty) of the original.Now to the props...The addition of binoculars were great.  They were definitely helpful, especially given the fact that I used the SC-20K's scope as binoculars in the XBox version.  Next, the cinematic movies made more sense and added much more to the story, although the XBox version of the opening cinematic was much better, with the inclusion of the Chemical Brothers' technobeats.  The PS2 version made Sam seem much older with the orchestral music, a disappointment on my behalf.  Lastly, some of the modifications they made in enemy and their placements was greatly appreciated, and it did intensify the situation a wee bit more.Overall, a very good game and very good PS2 game, but the game is not up to par with the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2003"}

Cloak mode makes early part of game a bit too easy in that you can just walk by enemies without being noticed.However, once you get going game really picks up. I would recommend this game it is really different.

I do really like that sometimes stealth other times fighting is way to go. this is a really good game, i wished first few missions didn't drag so much however.

{"product_name":"B00897Z27C","description":"London is falling! A great plague has enveloped the city in a fog of death.  Humanity has been ravaged by infection, the diseased prowl through the streets, waiting to prey on your living flesh at every turn!  ZombiU is built from the ground up to take full advantage of the WiiU and its revolutionary New Controller and will test your will to survive in a fear-fueled zombie Survival Horror First Person Shooter. Make every second count; you only get one chance.  Stay Human.","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Worth buying the Wii U for this game alone","reviewText":"ZombiU left me somewhat skeptical but very hopeful after watching video previews some months ago.  Ubisoft fumbled their launch of Red Steel for the Wii, and I was concerned that they might do the same with ZombiU.  Fortunately, my fears were satisfactorily squelched.  This is the ultimate survival horror game, period.  If you like being scared, like zombies in general, or just like high-quality games, this will be right up your alley.The campaign mode is simply unnerving.  I've played Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, and it was an excellent game that kept you on the edge of your seat.  ZombiU trounces RE4 in the fear department.  You are so vulnerable, because unlike other zombie games you have almost no ammo which leaves you to defending yourself with a cricket bat.  If there are several zombies approaching you in a tight corner, you either run or die.  Zombies claw at you as they approach, but once they get really close they bite you and you are DEAD no matter how much health you had left.  Then you start back at the Safe House as another random survivor.  Any progress you made is carried over, unless you play Survival mode in which case you have ONE shot to make it through the game.  If you die you start from scratch!The Gamepad offers some awesome mechanics that really enhance the game.  Looting corpses and cabinets leaves you vulnerable as you check the Gamepad screen for any items to place in your backpack.  You have a Flashlight and other quick key items set for easy access at the tap of a finger.  You can also use the controller as a scanner to examine the area around you or to accomplish specific missions.  Most importantly it displays a map of the area at all times along with a radar button that you can tap to detect the location of moving organisms in the vicinity of your character (this can pick up zombies, crows, and rats, so you're not always sure what you're in store for!).In addition to the campaign mode, their is a local multi-player option for two people that's really fun.  One player is the King of Zombies and uses the Gamepad to place various zombies on the map to kill the Surivor.  Obviously the second player is the Survivor who uses a Wii Remote and Nunchuk in typical first-person shooter fashion to kill the zombies.  There is a Capture the Flag mode and a Survival mode with various maps for both.  My wife isn't good at shooters, but she loves being the Zombie King.  I never thought I could play a shooter game with my wife and both of us be happy!Overall, I would definitely say this is a must-have game for the Wii U if you are into the genre at all.  There are some negative reviews out there, but don't trust them.  They don't know what a survival horror game is all about.UPDATE: 12/6/12  After beating this game I believe 100% that this game is worth the asking price.  This game delivered tons of fun along with plenty of fear.  My wife enjoyed watching me play this game, being the fan of horror that she is.  Now, I'm playing through it again to get the best ending, even though I'm not sure that it will have any different cinematic sequence if I succeed.  The game feels very different playing through the second time, and in ways its even more fun.  It's still scary, but now I know when to use my best items and weapons.  This is a liberating feeling, because I almost never used good items unless I was totally desperate in my first playthrough.  Now I get the pleasure of pulling out mines more liberally and watching my enemies go up in flames of failure!UPDATE: 12/11/12  I finally beat the game with the good ending, which does offer a little bit more to the ending sequence.  Nothing spectacular, but I'm definitely glad I achieved my goal.  I suppose Survivor mode is next, and I'm really tempted to start it right now before moving on to any other games.  ZombiU is definitely one of the best games I've ever played, and I hope that everybody else enjoys it as much as me!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Christopher Manna","summary":"Great Party Game!","reviewText":"This was a great recovery from the terrible Mario Party 3!

Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options.

Reviews by the big sites and magazines are hardly ever a good indication because they get under the table perks and prizes for good reviews. For a bad review, they may not even get the advanced copy, or a reviewer could get fired (See 2007, Kane & Lynch, Gamespot) Fortunately, I rented this game and instead of wasting $60, I wasted about $10.Let me start by saying that this feels like an Assassin Creed spin-off instead of a continuation. It takes over 4 HOURS for the actual story to begin as the next Assassin. Why? You start off as British rich guy Haytham in the 1700's amid the war between the British and Americans. My first impression on the first scene where you are in England is that the graphics were beautiful. It's a lot less pretty in America where you play the rest of the game. Anyone playing this game should have the first concern that the Assassin order has fallen very far and lost their morals. My exact thought was \"Why are the Assassins now a group of rich Aristocratic men being driven around by fancy servants and sitting around in their secret meeting rooms, looking for treasure?\"That question is answered is a \"HUH...Oh!\" moment in the last scene you have with Haytham. SOMEHOW, the next descendent in the order became a Templar/Mason instead of an Assassin. Cut to a Native American kid living in the woods (who I wasn't sure was a boy or a girl at first).You spend the next sequence as this kid (Haytham's son from knocking up the Native American woman he saves) and you run around LITERALLY playing hide and seek with other kids. Then they force you to hunt animals (rabbits,deer) with a bow and arrow. This is where it temporarily masquerades as The Most Boring Game on the Planet.Next sequence is \"training\" to be an Assassin- which involves being an errand boy and running around the city trying to keep from being spotted after the Templars try to say you are a terrorist. They have America conned into thinking they are helping them, when they are really plotting against everyone but themselves. That's when instead of giving you a change of clothes, they have you running around in your own weird clothes, covered in dirt, trying NOT to look suspicious. It's not until the next sequence that the game actually starts- over 4 hours into the damn game!Characters: 2/5I cannot tell you how annoying it is to have to play over 4 hours to actually get to be an Assassin. And to have to be a Templar (Mason) and then a child. Haytham is a rich, ruthless, greedy Templar- but he's not a villain until the story starts. Which is weird because he goes from a smooth charismatic man who frees some slaves and fights some bad guys to being the leader of a mustache twirling (Charles Lee) band of greedy killers. The new Assassin, his son Connor, has the personality of a rug. When they speak in Native American language, the subtitles are tiny white words you can't see against the screen. Extreme disappointment.Controls: 2/5  Part 1:The battle controls are HORRIBLE! Gone is actual controlled free fighting with your sword. Instead the game switches to a side view in which you have to press buttons to counter and swing and time goes into slow motion about a third of the time. The tutorial on the boat is not even subpar. Then the guns. To shoot is triangle and re-loading takes so long that using the gun becomes more of a pain than anything else.What happened to the classic method of using R1 and L1 to shoot and either R2/L2 or circle to switch weapons?? For a game with an open free world, the battles are completely restrictive and a giant pain in the ass.Part 2: When running and climbing you press R1. In chases especially, this results in randomly jumping or climbing up a building wall or some other object. If the object is not climbable, you run up in the air and pause. Poof. Your target is gone.Running in the woods, some trees are climbable, most are not, but it becomes a grand puzzle to find the start point. They eventually stop and you crash to the ground.By cliffs, most have no handholds and thus, you cannot climb them. You climb and climb, then get to a point where you just run up and...nothing. Go around and walk for 5 minutes to find an area to continue climbing, only to find yourself too far. Give up and \"fast travel\".Other times you are climbing and your character randomly just throws himself off the building and plummets to the ground. This is not a new control issue for AC, but it should have been corrected years ago.Graphics: 3.5/5First scene England is beautiful. America is decidedly less so, but they are mid-war so willing to give them a break. Cutscenes are always impressive as far as graphics.Here is where I have to factor in the crazy amount of glitches. For me they started when I landed in America and chased the apple thief. He drops the apples and one of them floats in mid-air. A servant in the inn freezes and glitches in and out with 2 brooms...I could go on...Without these glitches, 5 stars.Gameplay: 3/5Not taking into account the horrible controls...I was frustrated again and again by how many enemies would attack you at once. While countering to get the weapon away, 2 more hit you. Thanks to the controls, maneuvering becomes impossible. Run too far and you desynchronize due to being too far away.In one of the naval missions, the entire game froze and I had to restart the system. Not once, not twice, but 3 times!!Gone are actual assassinations- it's battle, sneak around, battle, chase someone. Yes, you can sneak up behind someone and kill them, but there is nothing epic about it...It takes over 4 hours to play as the new Assassin. This includes a training where you are required to hunt and kill animals with a bow. The animals don't attack you, they run. If I wanted to play a hunting game, I would have gotten one of those. How most people would feel about killing children and babies in a game...I feel about animals. So this made me very unhappy. Some people say, \"well the animals attack and it's kill or be killed!\" No, bears and wolves attack in one or two instances and you can avoid them or run. The rest of the animals are woodland creatures minding their own business. Fine, Connor is NA, his people hunted. Make it optional, not required.There are alterations from stealth and killing missions, in the form of chases (3), naval battles, manning cannons...There is even a mission where you ride with Paul Revere to warn of the British coming. That was actually really cool. Another one was the Boston Tea Party where you can optionally throw tea overboard.You also defend George Washington, but he turns out to be a pretty weak man in this re-telling, and it is thus disappointing.You also get to be Desmond, which would be better if they gave you a map and directional arrow. One particular sequence gives Desmond no health bar and some otherwise bad odds. It was nice to be able to enjoy the story.Story: 3.5/5Re-living events you read about in History class is very surreal and very fun, but there is also Connor's story woven in. He is hard to like, as he has little to no personality. He also does not fit the picture of an all powerful and stealthy Assassin as the only people who really know he exists are his enemies who mock him, then eventually fear him at the end and his (kind of) allies who think he's crazy then eventually grow to respect his resolve by the end. At one point he is captured and framed for plotting to kill George Washington (though it was the Templars who are powerful and respected figures). He goes to jail where he is beaten and recaptured and then they sentence him to hang. His trainer saves him last minutes, but this isn't the type of thing that an Assassin typically allows to happen! The ending with Desmond was far from being either good, clever, or satisfying, but felt like a cheap sci-fi gimmick.Summary:I was not pleased to have to play for over 4 hours to actually get to be an Assassin and have the actual story start, then have an Assassin with the personality of a cardboard box. The glitches were a slight annoyance, but the game freezing 3 times was a problem.The restrictive battle controls made for some very excruciating gameplay, as did the one button running and climbing that constantly screwed things up while I was trying to do one and got the other.Required hunting made me unhappy, as did the required hide and seek child sequence that didn't seem to serve a point.  While it was very epic to play famous events in history, the epic assassination were gone or restricted to cutscenes at the very least. I continued to play only because I wanted to see if Connor could kill evil Lee. The ending was unsatisfying. Just glad I didn't waste money buying this mess. I am sure they will patch some of the technical problems, but if it wasn't ready, they shouldn't have released it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Luigi's Mansion was the best Ghostbusters game ever made, which is mighty praise since it's not even a Ghostbusters licensed game, but it's exactly what you'd expect an excellent Ghostbusters game to be. So it was a shame that the Luigi's Mansion IP dropped off of the radar after the first game. Then the 3DS came out and fans would finally have their dreams fulfilled in the form of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. Seeing as the first Luigi's Mansion released over a decade ago, can a sequel to that game be relevant in 2013 and still offer enough fresh things? The answer to that is a resounding yes.Luigi's Mansion's gameplay is very similar to the original, but it still offers enough new in terms of some additions to the gameplay mechanics and such. Since we're talking about a portable game, Next Level Games made Dark Moon a much more portable friendly game, offering a lot of exploration while segmenting each mission into nice bite-sized chunks. The main mechanic of finding ghosts and sucking them up into the Poltergust is a lot of fun, but it doesn't get old since you'll come in contact with various ghosts that require a little bit of thinking and strategy. In addition to the lengthy and very replayable single player campaign, there's multiplayer options that lengthen the game's replay value, which are very addictive and well-built.The graphics in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon are some of the best on 3DS, right up there with titles like Super Mario 3D Land, Resident Evil: Revelations, Kid Icarus: Uprising, etc. Each mansion is beautifully detailed and littered with so many little touches that truly bring the environments to life. All of the environments have a ton of interactivity. This game's gorgeous graphics look even better in 3D.Next Level Games nailed it with Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. I couldn't recommend this game more. This game not only lives up to the original but surpasses it in many ways. Next Level games has made excellent games (Punch-Out Wii, Captain America: Super Soldier 360/PS3), but this is their best work to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

I am going to give this game 3-Stars for a reason. The last Persona game I've played was Persona 3 Fes on PS2. That game immediately had me interested from the opening cinematics. The game has just the right balance of combat and story/narrative. I went on to complete that game but never actually played the Fes parts. I know that 99% of the people who purchase this game know exactly what their buying and this is the perfect game for those people (this review is for the other 1%). For me I love Jrpgs but this game has replaced the balance of combat and dialogue with mostly dialogue. Now I'm sure it's quite possible that it eventually equals but at the 4 hour mark I haven't seen it. Playing the game for 4 hours doesn't give me enough experience to give a full review to this game but it at least warrants a first look review. My fair comparison will be with the game Zero Escape, now this game is obviously story driven with very small amounts of any actually choices/gameplay. That's something I knew getting into that game because that's the genre and style. This game is a turn based JRPG and should behave as such. I understand the game needs a warm up but 4 hours is far to long. I will continue to play this game because I know there is a great game hidden in all the text. Even if I go onto to love this game my review will always stand for me because the opening of the game is it's first chance to truly pull me in and this game has failed along with many others. Another small gripe is that the touchscreen is not used not even for simple things like selecting saves or starting the game. Overall with the Vita's underwhelming library of games this is one you should consider purchasing.

There is also alot of nice bonuses like the movie cinematics,and of course unlocking goodies for beating the game.Now for the bad:Well,in my opinion ff2 leaves alot to be desired.I was kinda disapointed;in fact I can now understand why it was only released in Japan.If you are expecting ff2 to be like ff1 only with a diffrent story and characters,then you will be sorely mistaken.The gameplay is VERY diffrent with it's rpg format! To start with,no one has any numerical levels nor will they ever. Also,anyone can use any type of magic;but there are limitations.Depending on what actions you take,certain stats will always go up or down.In other words,if you fight alot,then you will be a lousy spell caster and vice versa. Basically you just have to decide who's going to be doing what; don't think that you'll be able to create a character who can do a little bit of everything. Also another very bizarre feature is that you gain more hp soley depending on how often you get attacked.(Hint:Just keep attacking yourself to gain more hp!)Yeah I know,weird....This is all kind of a let down after getting two great classic games in final fantasy anthology and final fantasy chronicles.In the end though,if you were a fan of ff1 and are curious to see the new makeover,then that's more than enough reason to buy this title.Also,I was suprised to learn that this game is alot cheaper to buy new then I thought it would be(maybe cause both games are on 1 disc?)So just think of it as you are paying for a great remake of ff1,and ff2 is more of an added gimick.A page of the ff history to own,rather than play.Well,what are you waiting for?Go play ff1!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2003"}

And I look forward to every game they bring out. This is by far the best looking game in the series. You can zoom in on the veicles and buildings and the detail come in view without being fuzzy. I run this game with everything set on high and runs very good (I have Pentium III 1000, with 256 ram and a 64 meg video card). I was a little dissappointed when I first started playing the first set of missions China) as it seemed too easy and they were almost all short missions (except the lsat couple), but as you moved on to the the other 2 factions, it kept getting harder and harder and I started liking this game more and more. A couple of things I don't like is playing skirmish mode. When playing a skirmish, it seems the balance is off in favor of China. You can build bunkers (that will hold 5 guys, I like putting rocket launchers in them) and machine gun turrets) if I get those built quickly, the defense is too strong to get through, but the GLA and USA don't have those type of defenses and it's not easy (depending on the difficulty level you choose). And the difficulty level is touchy. If you play normal, it seems pretty easy ( I was winning with China playing against 5 computer opponents and only losing less than 10 units every game). But if you move up to Hard, and play against more than computer opponent, you get mowed over (unless you are playing as China). A little bit of balance issue I think, but this is still a very fun game. I you want more of a challenge, you can also go on-line, though you have to wait for a while sometimes for games to end so you can join. It is still a worthy effort, but I miss old but scenes they used to have. Any fan of this series will definteley enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2003"}

Yuji Horii has steered this ship since its beginning in 1986 and continues to innovate while keeping the classic DQ play that fans worldwide expect.  In short, turn-based battles, the foundation of Dragon Quest make a return, as do the requisite monsters such as Slimes.  What has changed though, besides being on a handheld, is the social aspects of the game; local multiplayer, passive mode, and online wi-fi DLC all enter the picture to make this one of the most well-rounded RPGs to come from Japan in ages.  They've even thrown in some casual aspects such as customizing your party and outfits to try to appeal to a larger female audience.  I would say the game suffers slightly by not having well-rounded NPCs to accompany your character, but the focus this time is really on you, and your real life friends, so it's left much more open-ended to create your own adventure.  Even after the campaign is finished, there is tons to do in DQ IX, and hopefully with Square's promise of a year's worth of new dungeons, we will be playing this game for a long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2010"}

The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original.

{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"LACKING IN STORY DEPTH BUT FUN","reviewText":"Red Steel 2 is UBI's sequel to Red Steel, a first person sword/shooter action game that makes use of Nintendo's new MotionPlus add on device for the Wii controller.  The small device (running about $20) plugs into the bottom of the Wii controller and promises to offer more fluid and greater range of movements.  If you didn't play the first Red Steel, don't worry.  The sequel has little to do with the original outside of the name.The setting of Red Steel combine elements of Feudal Japan, the American Old West, and a dash of Road Warrior mixed in making for a strange dynamic.  In true Clint Eastwood tradition, you play a no-name hero, a Kusagari (think Samurai with a gun) who has returned home from a long absence to find his town under siege by a marauding motorcycle gang known as the Jackals.  After an opening cinematic sequence in which you are dragged through town by one of the gang members, you enter the town and locate Jian, The Swordmaster.  Jian will provide you with your training throughout the game.  As you advance and learn new moves and combo-attacks, Jian will give you the opportunity to practice the moves on training dummies.  Credit the game designers in this area...when you are training, a video of an attractive young lady will display on screen showing you the proper movements to make with your Wii controller.  With the MotionPlus controller, the exact movements such as the arc of your swing are very important.  Fortunately, Jian will make you practice until you get it right.In a lot of games, combo-attacks tend to be unnecessary and often times your basic attacks will suffice.  Not so in Red Steel 2.  Learn the attacks, and use them as they are the key to your survival.  One of the simplest attacks is the \"rush\".  This two-button combo allows you to knock your opponent to the ground allowing you to finish him off while he is still down.  This is also an important combo to give you some much-needed space when surrounded by multiple attackers.  There is also the \"Storm\" attack, which gives you a spinning attack with your sword, another useful attack when surrounded by multiple enemies.  You will find that learning these moves will help you dispatch the grunt enemies that much faster.  Holding the Wii vertically or horizontally and pressing the A button will allow you to block attacks which can then be quickly parried.In addition to learning these new attacks there are various safe houses located in the game where you can go to purchase additional Kusagari powers, weapons and weapon upgrades such as making your gun do more damage, have better accuracy, or greater ammo capacity.  You'll purchase these with coins found when defeating enemies and destroying just about everything you see in the game like boxes, vending machines, barrels, postal boxes, safes, etc...One of the safe houses has a bulletin board where several different messages are posted listing different messages you can undertake.  The choice of missions is about the only thing keeping Red Steel 2 from being straight line linear in its approach and even then you're just doing things in a different order that need to be done eventually.  The missions feature a variety of activities from blowing up Jackal trucks to taking out communication towers and rescuing VIPs.  As such, the gameplay is nothing special.  There's very little character or plot development in the game.  The entire game consists of combat, breaking objects for cash, and learning new techniques and buying upgrades and it gets to be a little repetitive.Graphically Red Steel 2 looks gorgeous, eschewing realistic graphics for a cel-shaded environment that gives the game a comic-book-come-to-life look.  And as the game feels much like a comic book the graphics are perfectly suited to the task.  The Wii remote with the MotionPlus add-on performs very well.  Just try it out and watch how your sword mimics your own movements.  Occasionally there might be a \"miss\" but overall the MotionPlus does perform as advertised.  Your sore shoulders and arms will let you know just how well it's working!  The enemies also move fluidly with a solid frame rate that doesn't lag even when you're up against an entire group of baddies.While the gameplay is repetitive, and the story lacking in depth, the solid fighting controls and smooth visuals make Red Steel 2 a vast improvement over the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2010"}

Also, the AI's rounds must be armor-piercing because they kill you quickly (even on easy), but your rounds don't seem to do anywhere near as much damage (probably only rubber bullets).  The storyline, although somewhat interesting, is borrowed from the flashback method of telling a story that we've seen in BLACK (pretty sure that was an EA title) and Call of Duty: Black Ops.

The colorful environments, stimulating music, and inventive character design kept me interested even into recent years. After Megaman X4 however, Capcom has been getting sloppy with the series. The translation and overall production of X5 and X6 took a nose-dive, the music wasn't as inspired, and the level setup/enemy design was poor. Sadly, Megaman X7 is even worse than those two games. The updated 3D graphics give the game a fresh facelift, but the hit detection, boss design, and story is just a garbled mess. The camera in the full 3D areas often obstructs the player's view, some of the minor enemies take way too many hits to defeat, and there isn't even a sound effect when you pick up items. In short, the whole production simply feels glitchy and incomplete. The new character Axl is no redeeming factor either...he's a whiny brat who is meant to appeal to today's overconfident youth. If a good Megaman game is what you want, get Megaman X4 for PS1 or one of the Megaman Zero games for Gameboy Advance instead.First the Street Fighter/VS. series drops in quality, then the sequel to Devil May Cry turns out to be a dud, and now Megaman X7...what's going on, Capcom?","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

It's Valve and Valve is notorious for taking their sweet time releasing quality games, was one reason.  And then there was the more important question.  Was this a cash grab?  Is it merely an expansion pack masquerading as a fully priced game?  And now it's released and the answer to the above questions is evident:  Left 4 Dead 2 had me at \"improved pipe bomb.\"But you're not here to listen to me go on about how cool the pipe bomb is and how awesome the changed effects of zombie bodies literally exploding through the air is.  At least I hope not.  The fact is, after playing through Left 4 Dead 2, the original game feels more like a blueprint.  Everything that was in L4D is in the sequel, but the sequel is a completely different beast.  I was surprised, when we played through the opening campaign \"Dead Centre\" just how varied and improved the game was.  You begin at the top of a hotel, bringing to mind the small apartment complex that began the first game.  Except that this time, there's a whole lot more.  You see, the building is on fire, you can create backdrafts through doors, and the entire event feels more context driven than...well, than the entire first game.Fire will cause impromptu passages, forcing you to discover different ways through the crumbling building.  This means sometimes climbing out a window and balancing precariously on a ledge, moving from window to window in your escape.  The intensity is further exasperated by the introduction of the special infected.  Imagine playing this in Versus as a Jockey, hopping onto one of the survivors and moving them off the edges or being a Spitter and spitting the goo at just the right moment.  Moving through the hotel, the fire increases and eventually, smoke will cloud your vision, creating an extremely claustrophic even where zombies charge out of the dense, dark smoke or other zombies, wearing hazmat suits, will simply rush, unharmed, through the flames at you.  This diversity continues as you race through the chapters.  In the first campaign alone, you will race through a burning hotel, tear through a grocery store in search for cola to bring back to a crazed, holed up hermit so he'll destroy a barricade and eventually reach the climax where you have to locate gas cans (like in the new mode) to gas up a car to escape.The thing is, that's only the tip of the iceberg.  Later campaigns like \"Dark Carnival\" add a bit of whimsy as you can play some of the carnival games (kudos to Valve for bringing back the Half Life 2 gnome for an achievement), race up and down a roller coaster as zombies chase endless after you, and eventually reach the end which culminates in an inspired ending scenario that's completely different (and a tad whimsical) than anything else in the game.  This diversity only continues through the later campaigns as well, with \"Hard Rain\" being my absolute favorite.  In \"Hard Rain,\" as you move through the maps, it starts raining harder and harder.  It's by far the most atmospheric and most interesting, since you eventually have to backtrack through the zones, but this time they are flooded and the weather adds a completely different challenge to the map.  Additionally, unlike the first game where the campaigns all felt a bit too similar, resulting in my group relying on a couple campaigns we liked the most, each campaign offers so many differences, that I find myself wanting to replay them over and over.  With five fully-developed campaigns, there's a lot more content than in the original game.  Also, if you're feeling especially masochistic, try turning on the Realism mode which gets rid of the glowy outlines around survivors and ammo, makes infected harder to kill (headshots, please) and gets rid of the spawning closets...And that doesn't take into account the other features.  Of course, there's Versus and Survival Modes like in the original game, but L4D2 also throws in Scavenge.  Scavenge essentially is L4D2's version of a capture the flag mode, with the myriad of gas cans being flags.  The survivors race around the map, fighting both the infected and the clock, trying to get as many gas cans to start a generator as possible.  Meanwhile, the infected obviously try to stop them.  What I love about Scavenge is that it's not the time commitment that Versus is. It's a quick best of three or five game that ratchets up the tension and can create some truly inspired situations. My only complaint about this mode is that there's only one per campaign right now. Ditto the Survival mode which doesn't seem to have as many maps as in the original Left 4 Dead. Hopefully Valve rectifies this with DLC.After you get past the myriad of modes and campaigns, there's still more tiny additions that made me smile.  Guns are now strewn across the level and you won't find conveniently placed groups of weapons that contain everything.  The guns also have a lot more variety, with a few different options for each type of weapon (I really enjoy the combat shotgun).  The newly introduced melee weapons are interesting.  In lower difficulties, they are seemingly overpowered; however, as you start to play on expert, I've found their limitations to be too great.  Still, a nice additional and some of them are fantastic: taking down a witch with a chainsaw is perfection.  The two grenade types return as does vials of Boomer bile.  This operates under the same concept as the pipe bomb, except that the undead will race to the impact point and try to destroy whatever's there...like a Tank.  Not that they will destroy a Tank, but they do provide some assistance.  Then there's the other miscellaneous items, like defibrillators that will bring back dead party members.And I haven't even talked about the characters and story.  I do miss the original gang of archetypical characters; I miss Frank's acerbic comments (\"I hate vans...\") and the camaraderie they had.  But the new gang is also better developed and their banter is fresh and entertaining as they move through the campaigns, which, by the way, feel a lot more connected and there's more story here.  So here's the thing.  Those who didn't care for Left 4 Dead will probably not be swayed by L4D2 because it offers more of what the first one did.  It's not a radically different game, it just feels...more complete.  When I blasted through the first game, I wanted more...I felt like I played through a blueprint of a fantastic game.  L4D2 delivers on that promise.  It's not an expansion, it's a great, new, longer and better game.Very much recommended for fans of the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"'Party' Pooper","reviewText":"The \"Mario Party\" franchise has finally branched out to the Nintendo DS, cutting the fun--literally and figuratively--down to size.  In the game you guide a miniaturized Mario and company through colorful board games that decide who gets to save the day.  To do that, 4 players face off in a series of minigames to earn coins to trade for stars, and the player with the most stars gets to fight a boss character and advance.  Now that's all well and good, but I've come across some problems, one being the mixed bag of minigames.  While mostly intended for the pre-teen crowd and mastered with little practice, the concepts of some games, like driving a racecar by spinning a wheel with the stylus, are just a little out there.Also, if you earn enough special points, you win a bunch of prizes.  Now I like virtual figures and trophies and props as much as the next guy, but nothing replaces new characters, games, and play modes (which mostly consist of the minigames you've already played a hundred times).  By then, the bag of treats you get from \"Mario Party DS\" gets pretty stale pretty fast.This game is rated E for Everyone: Comic Mischief.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

With a new open world to drive around, Most Wanted lacks a story and a lot of innovation that other games in the series have, making it an alright game.Most's Wanted's premise is you enter the city with a list of the top 10 most wanted people in the city of Fairhaven with otherwise no background to what you are supposed to do. What's unique about the game is that there is no &#34;unlocking&#34; cars by ranking up (with the exception of the Most Wanted cars which you unlock by passing people up on the list and racing them), and that all the cars are scattered around and hidden in back alleys and under bridges, waiting for you to level them up and earn them upgrades (turbos, upgraded chassis, tires, etc). The city is detailed and the cars look great, and it is very fun to evade the cops that are scattered around your world without having to grind for the top cars. Speaking of cars, the list feels a little lacking. Ferraris, Pagani, and many other staples to the franchise are missing, only to have them added as paid DLC...The game is also horribly repetitive. Driving around and finding races is only fun for so long. You'll eventually grow bored of leveling up your cars and doing the same races over and over again, earning the same upgrades for different cars. While there's nothing broken or noticeably bad, Need for Speed is &#34;just another&#34; racing game with little to keep you coming back to it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}

It did take me awhile to get interested in the game. Something about the story I don't think I found all that compelling, and I did play Resident Evil 5 right before starting on this game, so there was likely some \"hangover\" effect as I'm a big fan of the RE series (isn't everyone?!).As I said, the story didn't really engage me much until the end. I chose to help the Little Sisters rather than harming them, and this \"savior\" role seemed to get me more interested in the story. I really enjoyed the last few stages of the game much more than the beginning or even mid points of the game. For awhile there during the middle of the game, after I had already gotten several plasmids to use, I started to tire of the game a bit because it was pretty easy to just use a plasmid, followed by the pistol or machine gun to take down nearly any enemy you meet (I favored the inferno, but the freezing blast worked well on the \"ghosts\" - but keep in mind that the freeze will not allow you to collect loot after you kill them). The Big Daddy's were really easy to defeat once I got the hang of it - just use the inferno followed by the electric shotgun buck or exploding buck. In fact I only died one time in the game, and that was very early on when I wasn't use to the game play. So I didn't make much use of the Vita Chambers, though I thought that was probably the coolest design in the game! I want a Vita Chamber in my apartment now! LOLThe game play was pretty fun, though like I said I did grow tired a bit of it about midway through the game. There are quite a number of plasmids and weapons you can use, and they all can be upgraded. In fact I think towards the beginning of the game I thought it was a bit of overkill until I started using many of them and found that I really only liked or used a few of them most of the time. The Inferno was my default, I would use the Frozen Blast if I was fighting ghosts, but that was only in one stage of the game that I recall, and I would use the Hypnotize Big Daddy from time to time to use him to kill other enemies before I killed him, and then use the Bee Swarm for fun sometimes (!) though it wasn't really that effective.The graphics were good, but \"comic-bookish\" I thought. In other words I didn't perceive the environment to be realistic, more like a comic book design. But there certainly was a lot of detail. It had a real artistic flare to it. I also liked the tape recorders that you pick up, which fills in the story for you. Though mixing in some paper reports with the tape recorders probably would have been better. And a tip for you, use the subtitles option - for some reason the volume on the recordings is really low and sometimes the accents are difficult to understand. The game was much more enjoyable when I could read the subtitles and understand what was being said! The tape recorders were a nice idea, though the execution of it was not so good, since they were difficult to hear!You've probably figured this out by now, but there are alternate endings to the game. I got the \"good ending\" as I rescued all the Little Sisters and earned the \"savior trophy\" but a friend of mine killed them and he got what he called \"the bad ending\" - I'm not sure what it was, but I think it is safe to say that you should not kill the Little Sisters, your enjoyment of the game will surely be enhanced.Final Grade: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

Drew \"Anaal Nathra/Uthe vas Bethod...","summary":"Truly amazing - draw-dropping vistas and game play - 2nd playthrough comments as well...","reviewText":"This probably is the perfect game. If you played Bioshock, this is essentially the same style game, only in the clouds, not under the waves. Vending machines, weapons and Vigors (Bioshock=Plasmids.) Looking inside almost everything for food, drinks, etc., same interaction, etc. The city, it's back-story, history and major players are somehow familiar. It's the robber barons of the 1900's without any control. It's intensionally racist, echoing the attitudes of the era. For example, in one area bathrooms are segregated - \"Blacks and Irish\" use one (and man is it disgusting) and the upper crust whites the other.  There's the battle for equality, and our alternate dimension hopping heroine trying to fix things.  This alternate dimension aspect is totally cool. Eventually you can see the \"tears\" in reality and can have Elizabeth open alternating tears to aid you in battle. You'll have access to weapons, barricades, medical supplies, skyhooks and more. Plus she's a great companion - miss something, like a lock pick or locked door? She'll point it out. She'll also toss you ammo and supplies during battle.There are tons of weapons, and all can be upgraded with vending machines. You'll also be able to upgrade shields, health and salts - you'll find these shifting potions - each can be used to increase your shields, health and salts one level at a time.  You pick which one the increase goes towards. I put 75% towards health and the rest towards the others, until health was maxed. Shields recharge and salts are plentiful - you almost never run out of salts (the power behind your powers.)There are a few side quests - do them! The rewards are great.My favorite weapon is the hand cannon - basically a 44 magnum revolver. The 2nd weapon alternates with the battle. Sniper rifle, carbine, heat gun, crank gun (Gatling gun), pistol, machine gun, sawed off shotgun, shotgun and more.If you die in battle, you're penalized dollars and revived with partial health - same as in Bioshock. If you walk off a ledge or bull a stupid move (like hop off a balcony) you're not penalized.  There are many places I just had to try this. Occasionally I wound up on a balcony and once found a side quest.  The navigation system is cool. Get lost? Where's my goal? Tap the appropriate control and and arrow points the way.Training is also unique. You play games at a carnival to learn the weapon and power basics, and can win money.2nd play through: Mastered the skylines and freight hooks, kept hopping on for all my kills (when possible) - the strikes and kills from skylines are deadly, especially with the right clothes. See the bottom for more - with spoilers for 1st time through - 2nd playthrough comments. Lets just say the plot really - REALLY - has a lot of \"no effing way!\" moments! But it's not a \"Game plus\" - your character has no bonuses and everything except accomplishments and partial accomplishments are lost.  For example, if you were half way to an accomplishment at the end of the previous game, that's still there. But your weapons, vigors - etc. - all back to the beginning.My only gripe is that there is a first day DLC - it costs $20 for the DLC. You get more weapons, power upgrades and locations. Yes, it's worth it. But this really should have been included in the game. But they have to pay for a $100 million development cost somehow....I did experience a FEW glitches. Missing bodies in one scene, but I still had the \"search corpse\" option. Frame rate crawl in some action scenes - I installed the game, it's not running from disc.They really went with the whole multiverse thing to the extreme. The ending? Wow. Mind blowing - several huge reveals. 1-2-3 punches to the hind-brain.  Plus a really funny comment by Booker about one reality Elizabeth takes him to. Will there be a part two? We can hope....Spoiler alert:.......On my 2nd play through I paid special attention to the recordings and the conversations between the brother and sister. There were so many hints dropped! Plus we'll figure out that our poor Pinkreton is nowhere close to his home dimension. We see a shift when he's looking at a statue - the 1st time through I thought it was a poorly done ribbon blowing - nope.  Then when he's watching Comstock lecture him from the floating blimp TV screen - and all the soldiers are kneeling down - he shifts dimensions - the nose bleed and sudden change in the way the screen appears. So Comstock can control tears - that's what the siphon was for. He shifted dimensions at will. There's more - play again.

If you disliked Dark Souls you most likely won't enjoy Dark Souls II since they are so similar, but if you did enjoy Dark Souls then you know what you're in for - and all is well. DSII is familiar in a way DS vets will understand (controls, mechanics, UI mostly the same), with enough new material and variation to keep things fresh.A few great changes: you can warp from any bonfire to any other bonfire you've already discovered, basic fast-travel is fine and unlocked at the beginning of the game, afetr all the world is huge so you'll need the help getting around; secondly, DSII holds a solid 30fps at all times even when there are a dozen things happening on screen at once (remember how awful Blighttown was in Dark Souls?); thirdly, DSII has an updated game engine and visually it's an obvious step above DS, the lighting is especially enhanced and really makes for some fun exploring - especially when monsters come sneaking out of the shadows! You're also able to light torches at bonfires now which helps you explore extra dark areas, it's a very cool feature.Souls `vets will find just as much difficulty as DS offered and new players may find the game a bit strenuous. Players who explore, persist, and learn from their deaths will find great reward in the new challenges DSII offers - especially those players who explore each nook and cranny in the world. The stakes have never been higher in DS, with each death your total life will be reduced, and while a rare human effigy will restore this, it makes each venture into the unknown a tad overwhelming (which is kinda the point, amirite?).Multiplayer is monstrously improved this time, connections are smoother, and joining another player is much easier - the best part, if you summon another player you get an immediate response whether or not it was a success, thank goodness! It wasn't as hard for me to buddy up with a phantom in the first few hours and we had a jolly good time breaking faces. There are new covenants this time around, each offers a different take on multiplayer, but I won't spoil those here.New-Game+ is here as always but now you can choose when to begin, very nice if you're holding off for late game PvP. Over all it's a really dang fun and a worthy successor to Dark Souls, definitely a must buy for me.One thing is for certain though, DSII is not watered down. You're going to have your butt handed to you on a silver platter, a lot.Prepare to die, over and over and over again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Hilarious and a true South Park game","reviewText":"Licensed properties are almost uniformly bad.  They are usually rushed, buggy and just plain terrible.  Take a look at the South Park game on the N64 for a good example of a terrible game version of a hit TV show.  This stigma has been kind of changing recently, with the Lego series doing a decent job and, more importantly, the Arkham games and the amazing games Telltale has been creating off of other intellectual properties.  Into this fray, we have the new South Park game, The Stick of Truth.  And while it comes from a well-known developer, Obsidian also doesn't exactly have the best track record in terms of new IP.  They're usually known for making &#34;That other Fallout game&#34; or &#34;The other KOTOR.&#34;  So I was trying to calm my excitement for the new South Park game because of the history of this type of game.Turns out my fears were unfounded.  South Park: The Stick of Truth is an absolute blast and is as hilarious and irreverent as the TV show.You start the game as the mute &#34;New Kid.&#34;  Your family moved to South Park to escape something in your past. You're immediately sent out to go play and meet the kids of town and you run into Butters.  Pretty soon, you're brought to meet the Grand Wizard, Cartman, and are quickly embroiled in an all-out war between the humans (led by Cartman) and the Elves (led by Kyle) for the titular Stick of Truth.  This being a South Park story, there's another, more sinister plot happening behind the kid's fun and eventually the two stories intertwine in hilarious and sometime unexpected ways.  Along the way, practically every character imaginable shows up and there are often sight gags or items that show up from the show.  Some characters show up in unexpected ways.  Towards the end of the game, I was wondering, &#34;Where's Big Gay Al?!&#34; And then, boom.  The humor is just as biting as the TV show and, like the movie, tears into the medium of video games.  It makes fun of the mute hero and other game clich&eacute;s.  It's hilarious.  Some of the levels are absolutely brilliant, too.At the beginning of the game, you choose a class from Fighter, Thief, Mage or Jew and each class comes with its own specific abilities.  But any class can use any weapon or armor.  You can customize your character by spending points in their class-specific skills and you can also put points into perks.  This allows you, with the combination of weapons and armors, to create a character that plays how you like.  It's a very simplistic system, but it's fun.  And I'm glad that weapons aren't class-based because it gives you the flexibility to play as you like.  The combat system plays like the Mario RPG series on Nintendo's handheld systems.  You choose your attacks and they have timed presses or some kind of active button press to get the best damage.  Additionally, whenever you're attacked, you can time your block just right to ignore some damage.  More complications come into play with different stances that make certain types of attacks ineffective and also shields that block damage.  Overall, it's not a complicated RPG and most veteran players won't have any problems with the combat once they get the hang of the timing of skills.  But, like a good licensed game should be, it's very inviting to players who normally don't play these types of games.It took me about 12 hours to finish The Stick of Truth and I enjoyed absolutely every minute of it.  In fact, this is the first game I've finished this year because I couldn't stop playing.  In the end, if you love South Park, you will almost assuredly love The Stick of Truth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2014"}

I purchased one a couple years ago and haven't went back since. I've had several different sets from a variety of makers (Astra, Turtle Beach, Tritton, Afterglow, etc) not because I needed a new set but because I like options.In terms of comfort these are a a great feel. I game for hours at a time and these never feel uncomfortable or irritate my ears at all.Sound quality is top notch as well. The features on this headset though are what really set it apart from others around this price point. Bluetooth, customizable presets to use depending on what game you are playing or even if you're watching a movie there is a mode for that as well. Just crazy how much they have packed into it.Now, here's the thing about this one. It's pretty much the exact same headset as the XP 510 but with Call of Duty Ghost branding.Bang for your buck this is a very, very good headset. If you're looking for a top grade headset that will work on every system out there (Xbox 360, PS3, PS$, and the Xbox One - with a caveat). Now the Xbox One caveat as of the writing of this review - December 30th the chat is not available. However, there is an adapter that should be on the market in early February that will enable this headset to work with the new Xbox One technology.With all that said, if you're looking for a great headset at a reasonable price, packed with features this is one you should consider.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"They say you can never really go back home","reviewText":"Silent Hill 2 is on my short list of favorite games, as it is, I'm sure, on most Silent Hill fans' lists.  It, and the first game, are shining examples of why this series is spectacular.  Unfortunately, they are the only two games that I feel are great in the series.  The third one felt more like a coda to the first (and was way too short), while the foruth one had more than a few design flaws that made me lose interest.So, now the torch has been passed to Double Helix, an American developer, and the result is Silent Hill: Homecoming.  Even with its flaws (and boy does it have some), Homecoming has become my second/third favorite game of the series and bodes very well for Silent Hill's future.The story begins with you, as Alex Shepherd, tied to a gurney and being pushed down dilapidated halls of some hellish hospital.  Looking to your right and left, you see even more disturbing sights as doctors drill into a patient or drop a body down a large and presumably deep hole.  Eventually, you're led into an observation room and left alone.  The doctor that left you is murdered, you break free of your bonds and have to make sense of where you're at.Right away, the game had its hooks in me.  This first level terrifically set up the rest of the game, but also presented some genuine frights and more than a few disturbing sections.  From here, you'll go back home and try to figure out why Shepherd's Glen is cloaked in fog, where your brother left, why your mother seems catatonic and what exactly lurks in your flooded basement...From a story perspective, Homecoming feels like a mix of Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 (with a splash of Saw thrown in the mix), which is definitely a good combination.  Unfortunately, the story is also the most straight forward of the series (it's a Western game now) and while they try to mimic the essence of Silent Hill, they lose the ambiguous feel that tasks you with putting everything together.  By the end of the game, you pretty much know all there is to know.  Some might like that, but it was a sore spot for me.The combat system, which was supposed to push Silent Hill into this new realm, isn't very good.  In fact, I found myself trying to avoid enemies more in Homecoming than in any of the previous titles.  On paper, it sounds good: light attack, strong attack and dodge.  But the problem is that you absolutely have to dodge attacks or even the lowly dogs will eat your face.  The problem is further amplified by the small, claustrophic areas you are in.  A lot of battles take place in very tight corners, making dodging very difficult.  And even when you successfully dodge in the small rooms, eventually you'll run into a corner, the camera will go wacky and you won't be able to see what you're fighting or, more importantly, see when to dodge.Then, when you're in the big rooms, Double Helix is kind enough to throw two or three (or five) enemies at you at once.  Dodging one is a pain in the butt as it is, but trying to juggle three enemies is...well, it's hell.  Add to this some enemies with their gaseous breath that I could never seem to dodge and halfway through the game I never wanted to see another monster again.  And don't get me started on the boss fights...So, why the four star review?  Because of what happens halfway through the game.  At the halfway point, the game ratchets up the tension, brings the story into new light and really made me want to play more.  In fact, I played the last half of the game in one sitting because I had to see how it was going to end.  The last half really makes up for any of the deficiencies in the game.Graphically, Homecoming is obviously the best in the series.  The new sheen of gloss mostly works, though some of the monsters with the more colorful highlights (the gaseous monsters, for instance, with their red chests) look fake and break the color scheme.  Taking a page from the movie, the transitions to the other world are real time, with the paint flaking off and floating into nothingness.  It's cool but it's not as terrifying as waking up or just finding yourself in the other world.And, of course, the music is phenominal.  Akira Yamaoka, series music/sound effects creator and producer, returns to craft a haunting score that mixes industrial with noises, rock and some heart-pumping effects.  Very awesome, some of the best of his music in my opinion.In the end, Silent Hill: Homecoming is a great addition to the series.  It feels like the most cohesive Silent Hill story since the second game and tries to branch into new territories.  Having a new developer really helped the series avoid becoming stagnant.  And even with some faulting moments, it really is an involving and engrossing trip into hell.  Definitely recommend giving it a chance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

All I did was hit people with a stick, or perhaps take their picture, and maybe solve a few puzzles.  It was still the best game I played all year.  I also bought it for $20.00.  This is a classic example of a game that has fallen victim to a lack of violence, and because it is more tasteful, it has lacked sales, which in the business world has deemed this wonderful game a &quot;failure.&quot;  In this game you are Jade, an action reporter who is hired by an outside group to expose some of the horrible things your government is doing to your people, the Hillyans.  You will have several goofy partners along the way that lighten the mood, but there are also some intense moments.  In general, despite its shortness it is worth is for 20 dollars.  So instead of picking up a game like True Crime or Manhunt, which are quick cash ins on a fad, pick up a worthwhile game in the bargain bin.  Not only is is truly artful and worth playing, it may also soon be extinct if gamers only want to shoot things up.

In desperation, the Soviets created a time-travel device that they've used to assassinate Albert Einstein before he is able to develop the weapon technology the Allies later use to defeat the Soviets. Upon returning, they notice a new world, and there is a world war taking place between three groups for control of the world.Play As Three Different Factions for Varied game playIn Red Alert 3, you have the choice to play as the Allies, the Soviets, or the Empire of the Rising Sun. Each faction has its own story-line and distinct units with advantages and disadvantages that you have to master in order to win. The new faction to the series is the Empire of the Rising Sun, derived from Imperial Japan, with an all-new cast of units and characters.The three factions have many differences, exemplified by their wildly different types of units. The Soviets, for example, have armored attack bears, Allies have the Dolphin ship which can high jump and use a sonic attack, and the Empire of the Rising Sun features such quirky units as a giant transforming mecha and ninjas. As they've done with the series, EA injects humor into the game when possible, keeping a smile on your face as you wage war.Fight on Land, in the Air, and on SeaRed Alert 3 has land units, air units, and naval units, all integral parts of the game. Unlike most strategy games that don't bother with naval warfare, Red Alert 3 makes controlling the seas an essential part of the game. Controlling resources in the seas and mounting attacks from all directions are strategies that must be employed to achieve victory.Cooperative Mode Lets You Team Up with Your FriendsRed Alert 3 has a fully co-operative campaign mode where you and a friend can play together to achieve victory. This means that you have to develop a strategy together, as well as execute it in synch in order to win. If your friends aren't online, you can also choose one of several AI commanders as your teammate.Play Against Your Friends in MultiplayerWith the different units and play mechanics of each faction, you and your friends will have a great time playing against each other, perfecting different strategies to best suit the units you have and the maps you play on. And thanks to the balanced game play, no one will have an unfair advantage.For previous fans of Command and Conquer, Red Alert 3 will provide the same light-hearted game play, but with more units, more strategies, and more fun.

THIS GAME WILL SELF-DESTRUCT IN 3...2...1","reviewText":"It really pains me to rate with 1 star a successor of the classic RED ALERT series. But EA made sure to ruin this franchise as well. Buy this today and in a few months encounter this:YOUR GAME HAS EXPIRED. THANK YOU. NOW PAY AGAIN.Similar to all major EA releases since June (MASS EFFECT,SPORE,DEAD SPACE&CRYSIS-WARHEAD) RED ALERT 3 harbors the most malignant version of SecuROM (7.xx) that is also crippled by Limited Installations (3 or 5 it makes no difference, it is still a RENTAL!). And to no avail mind you: all these games received ZERO protection from their draconian DRM scheme when it came to preventing their piracy!Exactly like Spore, for which the customer backlash was heard around the world, EA is trying to force this DRM scheme down its customers' throats instead of doing the reasonable thing: listening to them.Since piracy will always be a factor to consider and everyone has the right to protect his investment, a form of DRM will also always exist. But, at the same time, this gives no one a free hand in entrapping and exploiting their own customers. Or using piracy as a thin pretext to slip snoopware into our computers!- Revoking our rights as the Administrators of our own computer by creating irremovable folders or registry entries or subroutines that run masked is unacceptable!- Bundling a snooping, auto-updating and in-secret-contact-with-the-mothership utility that retains backdoor access to our computers is unacceptable!!- Trying to force legitimate gamers to pay again and again for the same game by Limiting its Installations is UNACCEPTABLE!!I am sure that, in the end, the best and more effective DRM method will prove to be very simple: reasonable pricing. Who would place his computer in danger of Trojans, Worms or slow Viruses of a pirated copy when the original costs $20? And since even more people would buy the game, everyone should be happy. But fighting piracy was never what EA is aiming for (after all, piracy has been used to cover a multitude of executive blanders over the years).Let's be honest: datavoring SecuROM subroutines and Limited Installations have NOTHING TO DO WITH FIGHTING PIRACY. They aim at making us pay for the same game AGAIN & AGAIN and preventing us from ever reselling our copies.EA, you had me as a customer for years. I even gave your products more than fair reviews. Unless someone cleans house over there and you start listening to your customers, you cannot count on any more of my money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Awesome (If you don't take the dialog seriously)","reviewText":"This review contains no spoilers.So you play DOD special operative Sam Gideon, a guy with a voice that would make Tom Waits or Bob Dylan cringe. The only thing he does more than blow things up is smoke cigarettes.The game is good, and challenging, if a bit linear. When I saw the trailers I thought it would incorporate much more vertical combat than just straight shooting. Nonetheless, even though the action is repetitive, the game is short enough and the enemies diverse enough to where you won't be thinking \"Oh God when will this end?!\"Anyways, the story is actually fairly original, even if the twists are expected. With the exception of the training level, the entire thing takes place on a huge solar array space station thing.The voice work is awful. Well, not precisely awful. The voice work itself is decent, but the dialog is atrocious, and the characters are shallow and one-dimensional. No biggie, since the game is mostly just a shoot 'em up affair.The game gets a one-star reduction from me because even though I probably got a good 7-8 hours of gameplay (and it will be a lot more than that if you try the harder difficulties), the game ends abruptly, right as it is getting really good. Setting it up for either downloadable content or a sequel. With a fairly original premise I expected the game to follow the story through to the end. Games are already overpriced for what we're paying for (in most cases), so when the developers fail to even finish the main story arc, it really irritates me (think the end of Halo 2: \"Sir...finishing this fight.\" 'Ohhhhh hell yeah I'm gonna kick some Covenant teeth in now!' [Credits] '...............WAT.......WAT!')Overall though, this shouldn't keep you from enjoying the game. And once you get past the cheesiness of the dialog and start laughing at the action movie banter, it actually makes the game that much more enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

Martin","summary":"Console version not up to standards","reviewText":"The console version of Call of Duty 2 entitled Call of Duty: The Big Red One is simply just not up to the standards of its PC cousin.The best parts of the game occur in the new North Africa campaign. This is largely unexplored territory for video games and Call of Duty The Big Red One does a good job of giving you a view of what the North African campaign might have been like for the Big Red One. The campaign through Italy is also unexplored territory and these missions are quite fun, particularly the beach landing mission. The game also gives you the opportunity to control several different vehicles in the game, from a tank to a machine gun on a jeep to an anti-aircraft gun. This is a fun respite from just being a GI and gunning down Nazis.However, the drawbacks outweigh the positives in this game and make it just mediocre. The game overall is too scripted. Unlike the PC version, this game has objectives you must complete in order because they're only given to you one at a time. The levels are also not very wide open, there are several paths you could take to complete a mission that are cut off to you by invisable walls. This is quite irritating, especially since there are tons of PS2 games out there now that don't force you into one path or one objective at a time.Even the enemy AI is scripted too much. There were occasions I ran into rooms only to have the enemy inside not react. Other occasions I had to run to a door in order for the next section of a mission to start and the Nazis to open the door and pour out. This smacks of gameplay of a couple years ago.One of my biggest gripes is that this game just is too short. They didn't bother continuing the game with the Big Red One's assault into Germany or its role in repelling the Nazi offensive in the Ardennes, one of the Big Red One's biggest successes in the war. This gives the game just a feeling of incompleteness. If they aimed to tell the story of the Big Red One during the war they should have told the complete story, not just half.Overall, this game isn't a step forward for WW2 console games. It's got the same tired problems those of us that have grown tired of the Medal of Honor series have experienced for years. Unfortunately the advances made in its PC cousin do not appear here at all and make this just an ok game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2005"}

I'm a dad with a 10 year old son. The best game we've played is Wii Sports which comes with the console. That's pretty sad.

Tiger Woods golf is pretty much unplayable due to bad controls. Many other games are really poorly done, like all of the Carnival Games, Mini-Golf, etc. Wii Sports is fun for get togethers, and creating Wii characters is pretty fun.

This network not only connects friends for epic head-to head pursuits and races, but also enables players to compare performances and stats, thereby setting the stage for the ultimate in friendly competition.","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"NFS is finally back.","reviewText":"The last time I purchased a Need for Speed title new was Most Wanted. If felt like Hot Pursuit, but was missing something. That something is what Hot Pursuit brings to the table. Much like the original Hot Pursuit, this one is all about speed and running from the cops.If youfre new to the series, herefs a heads up. Need for Speed is not a racing simulator. Itfs not trying to be. If anything, itfs a Fast & The Furious simulator. Itfs an action-movie style racing game. If youfre familiar with the series, take a step back and pretend Underground, ProStreet, Shift, and the likes never happened. This is directly after the Most Wanted/Hot Pursuit style of Need for Speed we all like. The series is back to illegal street racing on a higher scale.Career mode is setup into two different categories: pursuit career and racing career. Both are tied into each other. I started my career as a police officer, since Ifm normally a bad guy in video games. Youfre given a map with symbols on it. Each symbol represents your career path. As a police officer, youfre duties are to stop illegal races, and as a racer, youfre just suppose to dodge police and win the races. Therefs no story. Just pure racing. And stopping it.Each race you complete, it feels like youfre constantly unlocking cars which can be used online or in single player. You also unlock weapon upgrades. gWeapons?h, you ask? Yes, weapons. Youfll end up dropping spiked strips on the road to pop tires, call for police backup for road blocks, helicopters to drop spikes further away from you, and shoot someone with an EMP. If anything, the EMP is the only weapon I wish was eliminated, just because it feels a bit like Mario Kart during a race when someone hits you with one.On top of unlocking things, one of the more exciting features of this game is the Autolog. Much like the name suggest, the Autolog auto logs your stats to a sort of EA Facebook application thatfs in the game. Itfs basically a leaderboard with your friends. When a friend beats your score, the game updates you with what happened and you can fight for your rank back. It might sound like just a friend leaderboard, and essentially thatfs what it is, but it adds a lot to the gameplay. Ifve gone back a few times and redid races to retake my glorious 3rd place ranking from a few friends.The visuals are nice. They might not be 1080p with 60 frames per second, but it keeps itfs own. Therefs a few jagged edges here and there, but itfs nothing to completely cry over. The cars are nicely modeled and the sceneries are wonderful. If any visual complaint really exist, itfs the lack of a dash cam. Otherwise, it works. The sounds are fine too. The soundtrack is a bit forgettable, or maybe I just havenft really listened to it since Ifm constantly thinking about which route to take to ram my car into a racer so I can give him a ticket. Oh, and therefs damaged car models. Cars tent up real nice.The gameplay feels like a mix of Need for Speed and Burnout 3s road rage mode. I always thought road rage was Burnoutfs best feature, so being able to play that with real world cars is a blast. Nothing more exciting than seeing you bump a Porsche into oncoming traffic and watching it flip a few times on the road. Given that Criterion Games made the game, itfs no wonder it feels like Burnout. Therefs also an option for a free roam mode, for those that want that sort of thing.One thing to point out that is really annoying is the traffic. Therefs not enough of it, and randomly, youfll end up ramming into a car that popped out of nowhere. This happened to me over a dozen times already. Ifve lost a match because of a car popping out of thin air on the road right in front of me before. And sometimes, cars will just disappear. Itfs pretty sloppy, and my biggest complaint so far.If youfre a fan of realism or customization, leave your bags at the door. This isnft your game. This game relies on light Ridge Racer drifting, streamlining, and action. Outside of paint jobs, therefs no customization for your cars. This is strictly a pure arcade racing title. Being able to mod the look of your car is greatly missed. Part of the fun of Most Wanted was customizing that look for online play. Maybe next time.Online so far has been a blast. Therefs nothing worth noting other than the basic gameplay modes. Pursuit has made it into the online play. Itfs a whole lot of fun. Still, the game lacks a split-screen mode so better hope your friends just buy this game to play with you.+ Autolog for tracking friends and your progress+ Pursuit mode is addictive- Traffic pop-ins/outs- No customizationsRecommendation: Buy this now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2010"}

It's very light on RPG elements, shooting tactics, vehicles, story...  But it is fun to play solo or with 2-4 Players.  The world is open ended with load screens separating the different areas.  As you shoot things, you gain XP and loot.  When you gain enough XP, you instantly Level Up.  You get more Hit Points and deal a bit more damage with your weapons, which allows you to shoot tougher enemies.  It's a fast paced shoot stuff to loot stuff to shoot stuff cycle.Story: 7/10In Borderlands, you must discover what is in an ancient alien vault.  (LOOT)  That's pretty much it.  The story really doesn't get in the way of the action.  You talk to NPC's to get quests (Kill X, Meet X, or Return X.)  When talking to NPC's the dialogue is pretty entertaining, but the story definitely takes a back seat to the main focus of the game.  Shooting and Looting.Weapons: 8/10Borderlands uses an algorithmic weapon generator, which allows the game to create a nearly infinite number of weapons.  Here's how it works.There are base guns and they all do what you expect them to do:Revolver - Holds a few bullets, deals a ton of damage.Machine Pistol - Holds a clip full of bullets, fires fast, and deals a little damage per shot.Submachine Gun - Holds more bullets, fires really fast, and deals a little damage per shot.Shotgun - Great at close range, holds a few shells, and deals a lot of damage at nearby enemies.Machine Gun - Holds lots of bullets, fires at a medium speed, does a lot of damage.Sniper Rifle - Holds a few bullets, fires slowly, does a ton of damage, has a scope so you can shoot enemies at a distance.Rocket Launcher - Holds a few rockets, fires slowly, does a ton of damage in a wide area.Each of these weapons has stats and attachments.Clip Size, Damage per shot, accuracy, shooting speed...Elemental Damage, Scopes for long distance aiming, Recoil Suppressor...The elemental damage is useful for certain types of enemies.  There are Acid, Fire, and Shock.Acid works well against armor and does damage over time.  Fire does damage over time.  Shock greatly lowers enemy shields and does damage over time.  Explosive randomly does a burst of damage..So, a gun that does 30 damage with acid, is better than a gun that does 40 damage vs. armored enemies.  But that same gun would be weaker against enemies with an energy shield.You can carry 4 guns at once and switch between them with the D-pad.You also get grenades with a modifier (Explosive, Health Regen, Acid, MIRV...)And you get a class based skill.Example:  So if you play a hunter, you get a hawk that attacks enemies.  The hawk can be modified as well with a class specific item and your skill Tree.You also get an inventory where you can carry your loot.  Additional spaces are unlocked as you do specific Claptrap side quests.In your inventory, you carry Healing Potions, Loot, Class, and Grenade Modifiers.Although there are a TON of weapons and some skills in the game, it is much more limited than your typical RPG.  The guns just shoot bullets and your special skill only has one function.  Borderlands could really use more variety in their weaponry and skills.  Seeking bullets (100% accuracy), force fields, buff and debuff auras, chain lightning, stun, mines, etc...  It feels really light on the RPG and tactical elements.  But in this game, it is important to remember that the focus is on shooting and looting.Levels:  7/10Like Diablo, Titan Quest, Everquest, Sacred 2...  There are areas full of monsters that you can kill and loot.  If you point your gun at an enemy, it will tell you your chances of survival if you were to attack it, so you can make an educated decision if you want to shoot at it.  If an enemy is much more powerful, it will destroy you.  If an enemy is close to your level, it will be a fun challenge.  If an enemy is much weaker than you, you can walk right through it, but you only get 1XP.  The loot is also level specific to that area.  (The first area in the game always has weak monsters and weak loot.)Graphics: 8/10The graphics are highly stylized and look like a graphic novel.  For this game, it works!Sound: 9/10The background music is pretty low key and the sound effects punctuate the action quite nicely.Replay Value: 10/10The campaign is about 20-30 hours long, depending on how many side quests you do.  You can also play co-op with your friends online or split screen at home with a guest.  When you finish the game, you can keep playing at your current level and get more loot while fighting tougher enemies.Maturity: OK for TeensThere's cartoony violence involving guns, aliens, and armored soldiers.  There is some bathroom humor, but it's all in good fun.Overall: 8/10Borderlands isn't the most sophisticated game ever made and it doesn't break any new ground.  It borrows the loot system from Diablo/Titan Quest, it borrows a simplified combat model from Halo (shields and vehicles), and it borrows the quest system and level up system from Fallout 3, WoW, Oblivion...  All of these are blended nicely in a game that allows you to run around and shoot things to loot things.  This game is simple, fun, and rewarding.  If that is what you're looking for, then you'll have a great time.  If you're looking for an RPG with depth or a shooter with tactics, look elsewhere.If you liked the Loot System of Borderlands and want more, check out Diablo, Titan Quest, Torchlight, or Sacred 2.If you liked the FPS combat and want more depth, check out the Halo series.If you liked adventuring around a world and doing quests, check out Red Dead Redemption, Fallout 3, and Oblivion.Rent it if you have about 20-30 hours to blow through the campaign.Avoid this game if you are looking for FPS tactics, complex leveling, or immersion in a fantasy world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2011"}

The indents on the joysticks are designed to fit both big and small thumbs, the spring-loaded triggers are perfect for twitch shooters and racers alike, the bumpers and buttons are responsive and easy to use, and the Xbox Home button isn't in the way of anything. My only complaint with it is that the directional pad is one big awful piece of plastic rather than four individual &#34;arrows&#34; like the Playstation's controller. The wireless controller uses batteries, and while some might not be bothered by this, having your controller die on you mid-session is a huge pain and has resulted in a lot of frustration in online games that can't be paused.The 360's controller is excellent overall and I would recommend buying another for friends and family.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2014"}

THIS is how to make a racer","reviewText":"After playing Gran Turismo 5 (which was a disappointment to me), I decided to try the Forza series of racers next. What did I get?The best racing experience I have ever played.Forza does everything right that GT5 doesn't, and then some. The main thing that annoyed me in GT was it's AWFUL menu system. Forza's menus allow you to just cut to the chase and get right on the racetrack. After a brief &#34;tutorial&#34; in a Ferrari, the game sets you off with a starting car of your choice, and you are tasked (by the great Jimmy Clarkson of Top Gear) to progress through the ranks and drive. The inclusion of Mr. Clarkson really adds a lot of personality into a game that really has no backstory or anything to it.The real star of the masterpiece is (obviously) the driving, which caters to almost all driving audiences, from arcade-y Need for Speed players to the hardest of hardcore driving simulators, thanks to its highly customizable difficulty settings. The game encourages you to turn off as many driving assists (which range from braking and traction assists to transmission), as you are rewarded more credits for using less of them. I really like this, as it encourages you to remove your training wheels and become better at the game. The rewind feature (which allows you to literally rewind the race and retry hard parts of the race) returns, and it is amazing how helpful it can be to people experimenting with higher difficulty settings.Also worth mentioning is the amazing roster of cars, which all feel unique and incredibly detailed (something Gran Turismo lacked). The roster ranges from antiques to today's super cars. I applaud Turn 10 for taking the time to actually pour in as much effort into making the low end cars look as good as some of the higher end ones.I've played this game almost every day for at least an hour after work for the past two weeks and I'm still not done with the world tour (campaign). With an amazing roster, incredible driving and detail, and being insanely addictive, Forza 4 takes the crown for best racer on the 360, if not one of the best ones out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

One of things that's always been a pleasant surprise to me is how much I love playing these games even though they are essentially the exact same thing... over and over and over again.1.) If you are a huge fan of the series and have loved the previous entries, and have gotten them as soon as they come out - then same deal here.2.) If you've never played one of these before, but are interested in changing that - this is not the one to start with. You will have no idea what's going on, and there are better ones to play. Start with AC23.) If you generally like the AC series and have played some of them but aren't sure about this one, and maybe want to get a better idea of if this is worth your hard earned shekels - then the following is for you:The thing with this one - that makes it the weakest entry in the series (in my opinion) is that for the first time, I really felt the repetition. Even though the gameplay and the general progression of the games has remained untouched throughout the previous 3 games - this is the first time I kind of felt like I was just going through the motions.As always the graphics are beautiful, the story is good (although the constant \"unraveling\" is starting to get a bit old), and exploring the new environment is always a blast. The combat mechanic is the same (which is great - although it feels sluggish at times). That being said there are some things in this new sequel that I could have totally lived without, and I think really take away from the game as a whole.- Bomb crafting:This is now a huge part of the game - and one that I do not care for at all. It was great to find treasure in the previous games but the bomb materials now make up like 90% of the treasure boxes. So you end up with tons of crap you don't need and can't carry any more of. Also - the bombs are pretty much useless, and add nothing to gameplay...so there's that. If you think spending a large amount of your time making bombs that you don't need is awesome...then prepare to be amazed.- Goodbye Horses?Uh. They've got horses out the whazoo in Venice (a water locked city famous for having rivers that serve as streets) but none in Istanbul? Yeah....not having horses on tap is a bit of a let down and makes getting around annoying at times.- Button Switches:The controls have been modified slightly and I personally don't like the new layouts. Eagle vision is now moved to the left-stick-press and only seems to work when you are standing dead still and really press that sucker. And now you need to use it more than ever so I am not sure I get that one. Also the weapons wheel has been broken up with some inventory on the left stick and some on the right...which I find kinda annoying and more than a little confusing sometimes.- Zip Lines:I actually like this as a method of getting around - you can use zip lines and this new hookblade you get to quickly traverse the city from the rooftops...but I have no idea why they are placed the way they are, and they're never placed anywhere useful. Even if you do find one that's \"going your way\" it only takes you like a block and half so it's not really helping all that much any old way.All that being said I still enjoy playing this game. I mean at the end of the day it's still a quality product and for a game in it's 4th iteration - that's pretty good :) I will say that if I hadn't gotten this and never played it - I wouldn't be missing a whole lot either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Average racing game with some flaws","reviewText":"I have long been a fan of video games and usually enjoy racing games.

It's great, I love it. I also like that the developers made it rather simple to switch tracks if you so desire.The graphics are sharp, crisp, ad look fairly real. The city is laid out well, as much as a video game city can be anyway, there will always be those weird twists and turns but that's okay with me.Some things I didn't like.The camera angles are annoying at times, and terrible at other times. It seems that no matter how nice a game can look, developers keep screwing up the camera angles making it hard to see things. It gets frustrating very quickly.The layout of the screen. There are so many things going on, that you have to look at the little map at the bottom of the screen, the compass at the top of the screen, that you are not really allowed to lose yourself in the game. The only time I was really able to 'watch' the graphics and appreciate the game, was when a friend was playing it.The controls are average in terms of layout, but I would have liked the option of customizing them to how I like it.Overall, this is a decent racing game, although, if I had to pick my current favorite is stillNeed for Speed CarbonIt offers the same free roam style of play, but has a much better story mode and crisper handling.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Patricia Laverty","summary":"Pure Classic.","reviewText":"Every instalment in the long-running Zelda series is as sharp as Link's sword but Twilight Princess is an absolute masterpiece.This latest epic quest features a compelling, darker plot and many memorable characters. Players control a grown-up Link, exploring Hyrule on foot, on horseback or as a powerful wolf.Link is transformed into the beast when entering the mysterious Twilight realm, complete with heightened senses and brute strength. The wolf sections are cleverly integrated into the game, and in latter stages players can transform at will, allowing clever puzzles.Link's enigmatic, fascinating companion Midna is another brilliant addition, providing helpful assistance and playing a key role in the story, in which Hyrule is consumed by a world of shadows and inhabitants turned to ghosts.Some gamers were concerned that lengthy sessions with the motion-sensing remote would be too tiring but the controls quickly become second nature and do not require much exertion. Sword swinging works well even though it doesn't require finesse and pointing at targets when unleashing arrows or hurling boomerangs is a terrific addition. Battling enemies from horseback is particularly thrilling.As usual, most time is spent in carefully constructed dungeons such as forest, water, sky and fire temples. Each features many ingenious puzzles and secrets and concludes with a battle against a memorably massive, fearsome boss.At more than 40 spellbinding hours, this is the largest Zelda yet and features an almost overwhelming amount of content. Diversions such as fishing, mini-games, collection duties and side quests are extremely engaging time-wasters. The game could be criticised for not radically altering the Zelda template but when the formula is based on some of the best games made (Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past) it seems churlish to complain. Link's legions of fans would not have it any other way.ENDGAME: Imaginative and masterfully designed, Twilight Princess is every bit as good as the best Zelda adventures. It is hugely rewarding and absolutely essential for new Wii owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2009"}

Players follow Rogue as he planet-hops around space, visiting a number of planets, each with their own unique ecosystem populated by various unusual creatures.   Play successfully to earn hunter coins that upgrade a player's hunter license and open up additional challenges   Over 8 hours of high-quality cut-scenes and cinematics","reviewerName":"Gamblor","summary":"My Favorite PS2 RPG","reviewText":"Rogue Galaxy succeeds due to many factors, the main one being its story (which breathlessly escapes most of the JRPG cliches). I appreciated hte fact that you played as a prty, but there was minimal babysitting - an efficient list of set commands is available to issue your teammates. the combat is fast and fluid, and brekas up some of the humdrum mechanics of many turn-based affairs. the weapon/item synthesis is deep (practically a game in itself), and it will take well over 100 hours to experience everything just once. Any fan of dungeon crawlers, level grinders, or fast-paced action/RPGs should check this out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2008"}

There are too many zombies too fast. I guess I will have to keep practicing. In the mean time, RESERVE UMBRELLA CHRONICLES instead. That game actually allows you to use the controller like a gun instead of worrying about facing the right direction.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000FRVCAA","description":"Forza Motorsport 2, the sequel to Microsoft Game Studios' award-winning, fully customizable driving simulator Forza Motorsport, speeds its way onto Xbox 360 this holiday. With authentic simulation physics, bone-jarring damage, photo-realistic graphics, and licensed tuning and customization options, the franchise improves on the unprecedented features gamers enjoyed in its debut installment. Loaded with more than 300 of the world's hottest cars for you to collect, personalize and tune, Forza Motorsport 2 gives you a complete racing experience.","reviewerName":"Semschy \"Gamer\"","summary":"You don't need an engineering degree to play this game...","reviewText":"...But it helps.  First off this is the best racing game on the market to date.  If you're like me and you thoroughly enjoyed Gran Turismo 3 and were thoroughly disappointed by GT 4, this is the game GT 4 should have been.  As soon as I popped this into my disc tray I couldn't stop playing it until I had finished Career mode.  Upon completion of Career mode I thought I was done and put this game on the shelf.  When I popped it back in a few months later I discovered online racing and the online auction house.Online racing: this is the game's forte.  You can always outsmart the in game AI, but racing other people online is a true challenge.  If you REALLY want to be put to shame, then sign up for an online tournament.  If you thought you were a good driver, this will show you that there is always someone better.  Also check out the online leader boards for each class and each track.  If you want to work your way to the top this has replay-ability written all over it.Modifications and tuning: this is where an engineering degree can be useful.  This game is all about balance.  If your car has more horsepower than it can handle you'll just smoke your tires and not be able to brake and corner.  If you focus solely on suspension and brakes you'll get passed in the straights.  Then comes the tuning: this is where the engineering degree comes in handy.  You can spend HOURS tuning your car.  Forza 2 really rewards those who spend a lot of time tuning.  Make one small adjustment, and then run several laps to see how it affects your time.Damage:  this is what sets it apart from the crowd.  This really forces you to drive just like in real life.  You can gently nudge other cars occasionally, but other than that contact with walls and other cars can drastically affect your car's ability to drive.  Of course if you'd rather the game not be so challenging, you can always change damage from \"simulation\" to \"limited\" or even \"cosmetic\".  Forza 2 allows you to make the racing as difficult or as easy as you prefer.Customization:  You can modify the outside of your car just as much as the inside.  Not only can you add spoilers and body kits, you can also add an array of shapes to make any design you can think of.  Then you can sell it in the online auction house.  Finally I can get my ebay fix without spending real money.If you want a game that's a constant quest to improve your car and improve your driving skills, this is the game for you.  I can't think of a single flaw with this game.  My only complaint is that Forza 2 makes me want to get a racing wheel, because that would be a lot smoother than driving with analog sticks.  This is the serious racer that Xbox 360 needed.Edit: After months of playing online I finally found a flaw: other people.  Just like driving on the highway, there are always idiots who drive way too slow and those who drive way too fast, both of which seem to change lanes without little to no room to do so.  In one weekend of online tournaments I met both extremes.  My first encounter was with a guy who would do anything to disable my car in order to beat me.  As I passed him the first time on a straight he performed a PIT maneuver on me (youtube: PIT maneuver).  Being the better driver I caught up to him and passed him again this time he slammed into the back of me at full speed as I slowed down for the last turn of the lap.  I passed him again and he rear ended me again.Later that weekend I met the other extreme: someone who raced clean and was intolerant of any touching whatsoever.  I didn't realize he felt that way until the third race when I blocked him from passing and he hit me anyway.  He immediately left the race and sent me a message demanding I drive clean from now on.  Forza 2 is still a great game, but some people take it way too seriously.If you want a racing game that doesn't take itself way too seriously, then check out Juiced 2: HIN.  It is the total opposite of Forza 2.  Where Forza is all about handling and never losing traction, Juiced rewards you for power sliding through turns.  Where the car physics in Forza are painfully realistic, Juiced is comically unrealistic.  Where Forza has an online auction house, Juiced has pink slip races and drift contests.  Unfortunately where Forza has a strong online community, Juiced has very few players online at a given time.The bottom line:  Forza 2 is a great game, but just like in real life other people can ruin your fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2008"}

Maybe some like it when you actually get into battle ( it is pretty good when you finally get into it) but no one can deny that the game is largely spent runnning and running and after that more runnning  to the battle !!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2010"}
