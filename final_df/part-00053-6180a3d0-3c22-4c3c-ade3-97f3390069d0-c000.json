It's always difficult for publishers to come up with a new idea and make it into a game that works, but with Mirror's Edge, EA / Dice seem to have managed it.The basic premise is simple - you're Faith - a runner. In a city run like a police nation, runners take sensitive packages and deliver them via alternative means. In this case a highly athletic form of street running, or parkour. Each mission is an A to B affair but you have at your disposal the entire urban landscape from the bottoms of the sewers to the tops of the skyscrapers. Run, duck, slide, swing, wall-run, hop, skip and jump your way around obstacles that would, in any other game, be unpassable.The majority of the game takes place well above street level, hopping from building top to building top, balancing on crane arms, and working your way around air conditioning units, pipes, construction materials and the other detritus you'd find on the top of any modern building today.Gameplay.Mirror's Edge is not only unique in it's idea, it's unique in it's presentation because it's a first-person game. You see through Faith's eyes, which means you see hands and feet, and unless you're in front of a mirror, nothing else. This is one of the game's strengths. Trying to use a third-person view just wouldn't work (as it doesn't work in Metal Gear). From a first-person view, you get a proper sense of speed and depth. As you run to slide under a pipe, you'll find yourself ducking in your chair. And if you've got a touch of vertigo, it wouldn't pay you to stand on the edge of a building and look down in Mirror's Edge - the effect is very convincing. The controls are pretty simple - run with the left stick, look with the right stick, and jump and duck. In addition there are basic combat controls to kick and interact with other objects, as well as a slow-motion effect for those hairy moments. You build up the ability to use slow motion by the amount of 'flow' you have. Flow isn't something with an on-screen meter, it's just a natural sense of making progress. If you stop before climbing every wall, and go everywhere at walking pace, you're not really making progress. But wall-run and then jump on to a roof, hop over to an A/C unit then drop off and slide under some pipes - that's a nice, flowing style of getting from A to B. Although when you first pick up the game, you'll be tripping over everything in sight and smacking your head on low-hanging objects all the time.The game does mix it up a little with occasional encounters with 'Blues' - the police. You have some basic slide, jump and kick skills that can be used to attack them or disarm them but it becomes obvious that more time was spent in the control of Faith as a runner than as a fighter, as the sparse fight scenes are awkward to contend with and you'll often find yourself doing them over and over again just to try and get past the police. In some cases, you don't need to engage them though, so hop up on a container, jump over their heads and get away.As well as all the rooftop acrobatics, there are many levels set indoors from the cavernous underground water tank in the first couple of levels (think the underground ice store in the film Total Recall) to the frantic subway chase which has you both dodging oncoming subway trains and riding their roofs whilst dodging rail tunnel infrastructure and jumping from train to train.The game is short - 9 sprawling levels in all plus a training level - but it's exciting and fun to play and you'll find yourself going back and trying to better yourself on the levels you've already done. Having said that, the levels do get incrementally harder as you go through the game, and whilst the run/jump/slide gameplay might seem repetitve, there is always more than one way to get through a level. Crawl through the ductwork, or run through the office itself? Up to you.You can choose to use 'Runner Vision' in the easier game modes which will highlight objects in red as you approach them to hint at the direction you should go and what objects can be used to achieve your goals. For example pipes light up red to indicate you should probably climb them, but as I said above, there are other ways of completing every task.There's also trophies to be earned in Mirror's Edge, which is an added incentive to go back and do better. The tropies are nicely balanced between bronze, silver and gold. For example the easiest trophy is the bronze for just finishing the training level, whilst some of the harder silver ones require strings of moves to be assembled, such as wall-run to jump-tuck to slide.Graphics.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are excellent. The developers have created a unique art style which is mostly white with very pure colours here and there. It sounds dull, but it looks absolutely amazing when you play it. Your point of focus changes depending on whether you're looking at things up close or far away, and when you get up a lick of speed, there are motion blur effects that are added to the scene in a subtle enough fashion to not destroy the look and feel of the game. The usual sun flare and whiteout effects are present if you look the right way, and if you look down the cavernous canyons between the buildings, you can see people going about their daily lives as well as the occasional police cars parked up looking for you. The lighting and texture work is top notch with bump maps and reflections everywhere you'd expect them to be. Shadows are relatively well drawn too. The modelling of the levels is very very good and so far I have not noticed any popup in the game. That is to say, objects change detail or appear so subtly that your eye is never drawn to them. It's also worth pointing out the 'falling to your death' effect. Rather than simply understanding that if you walk off a tall building, you're dead, Mirror's Edge prefers to show you the ride all the way down to the pavement. As you speed up, the screen becomes more and more distorted until it suddenly goes black with a sickening accompanying sound effect. Whilst on your way to becoming a ketchup pancake, you still have full control, so if you really want to, you can pivot in the air and look at the rapidly approaching ground. But I wouldn't recommend it.A final note on the graphics - read the signs on the fences before you jump over them, or at least get used to what they look like. Your first encounter with a high voltage fence will teach you that lesson quickly.Sound.There's a lot of breathing and panting in Mirror's Edge, as you'd expect from a game which is mostly concerned with running like hell. Other than that the environmental sounds are excellent. As you cross the rooftops, the background noise of a normal city is all around, from aircraft and helicopters overhead to the streets below and everything in between. Chain-link fences rattle when you jump over them. Steam vents hiss as you pass them. Bullets zing past and ricochet off walls if you're being shot at. Everything is properly in its place. The subway levels are made all the more nerve wracking by the sound of the train cars, and especially the train horn if you get too close. More than once, the horn took me so much by surprise that I fumbled a move and ended up as a hood ornament.The music is very ambient for the most part. A lilting background accompaniment to your superhuman feats of dexterity. But it does change at the appropriate times. As you're getting close to an encounter with the police, for example, it starts to become a little more menacing, to ramp up the tension. And when you get in to a full-on foot chase over the rooftops and through office buildings, the music changes completely to an excellent run-for-your-life soundtrack, very similar to the style in the cult film Run Lola Run. The music in this mode alone is enough to stop you turning around to see how close behind you the police are.Overall.I wanted to take a star off my rating for this because of the somewhat clumsy fight mechanics. But the more I play the game, the more I can forgive that element of it because everything else works so well. From jumping over wire fences, to sliding down zip lines, to hopping over subway turnstiles and sliding under closing doors. If you're not sure, download the demo from the Playstation Store first - it's free and you'll get a feel for the game dynamics. I like it. 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2008"}

It had decent music, decent graphics for its time, and the characters you chose looked beautiful.  This is so so in my opinion, as it is not enough better from what I've seen to warrant an overhaul of your machine (you need a Pentium 3 or more, a dvd-rom, and everything else to work well; Daggerfall ran on WIndows 95/98).  I managed to get it to run even without the dvd-rom, but I wasn't really impressed.  That all considered, the controls are harder to maneuver (since I didn't have a manual, I had a tough time figuring out how to talk to people), and they scrapped the default design from Daggerfall, so you have to move forward using alphanumerics instead of cursor keys.  If you have a manual, and you have the specifications, it might be worth your while.  Given the choice, though, I'd rather purchase Daggerfall again. I just found out that even though XP generally forbids Daggerfall, if you are unlucky enough to have XP and not have capacity to run Morrowind, go type in Daggerfall XP patch into the search engine to reconfigure the system. I think the deal is that it's illegal to have both on your computer, so if you have Morrowind capacity (I hate you), you shouldn't install this patch.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2004"}

Personally, I didn't really like G/S that much. They were decent games, but I never really liked the variety of Pokemon the original games had, and so I was a bit cautious about purchasing the new games.All my worries were put to rest instantly. I had previously played and enjoyed the FireRed/LeafGreen (FR/LG) games, and these new games are similar in structure (FR/LG being remakes of Red and Green- although Green was Blue in America). First off, the original game is completely updated and remixed. You'll see new features from the start thanks to the dual screen and touch input. You can do most everything with the buttons and d-pad, so touch control is mostly optional. Since you'll be logging easily 50 hours in this game, that's important. Pokemon variety seems to have been updated for the better in many spots, and the graphics are the same bright and simple graphics that make Pokemon games great (with the addition of some neat 3d twists in spots).And the content is amazing. In each Pokemon game, you compete around the region for 8 gym badges and then fight the Final Four (and their Champion) for the title of greatest trainer in the land. But in FR/LG and now HG/SS, you repeat the process in a new area- Kanto (from the original Red/Blue games). That means 16 gym badges, two sets of Final Four showdowns, and oodles of extra content throughout.The controls are as simple as always. There's a toggle for your Running Shoes now, which means you can run fast or walk slow for better control at the touch of a button / stylus, plus the bike is in too. The bottom screen basically has the in-game menu up at all times, and with touch input, this means you're basically one touch from any option at any time. If you don't have your stylus out, it's one button to switch between screens. It's simple, and brilliant.Overall, this is the best Pokemon game to date. It has the most features, the best graphics, the most gameplay- everything. If you're a Pokemon fan, this is absolutely the one to get (especially SS over HG- I prefer Lugia). And don't forget the Pokewalker! As if these games didn't have enough stuff already, they includes a little pedometer that raises the levels and happiness of your Pokemon while you play little minigames to catch additional Pokemon and items. That's a lot of content.Notes for the hardcore fans- the mascot legendary is Lugia, although you can also get Ho-Oh (from HG) later in the story, without trading. You also get to choose from three sets of starters at different points in the story, including the Kanto starters- and yes, that means you can get 3 different starter pokemon in one game. You also get to catch the Kanto Pokemon, so you can get virtually all of the National Dex in one game. Catching the full National Dex requires HG/SS and Platinum, plus some event-only Pokemon. HG/SS are fully compatible with Pokemon Platinum for trading, and you can also import your Pokemon from FR/LG through the Pal Park, although you need to play all the way through the first half of the game to open it up (and FR/LG are not required to complete the NAtional Dex). Apricorn and berry collecting are in, poffins and underground mining are out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"\"MAN THESE BANANAS ARE GOOD!\"","reviewText":"Bonus points for any who caught theBrian Reganreference in the title...In the past five or so years, two previously dormant video game icons have made major comebacks, starring in some of the best 2-D platformers in decades. Of course, I'm referring toDonkey KongandRayman. Both characters offer games that are about as awesome as 2-D platformers get these days, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is yet another modern DK masterpiece to add to the list (Rayman Legendswas also stellar). This game is simply stupendous, in so many ways. Not only is it filled with nostalgia for the DK of my childhood, but it also adds a ton of new ideas that are not only cool for DK, but for 2-D platformers in general. This game is a real treat. Once again, Retro Studios has nailed it, and this game actually soothes some of the sting I felt at learning they were not developing a newMetroid game(Not gonna lie, it still hurts a little). If you don't like somewhat longer, detailed reviews, then give this one a pass. You've been warned.The story in DKCTF is very unique for the series. Once again, Retro has created an all-new villainous force for DK and co. to face called the \"Snowmads,\" a ragtag army of arctic animals with a major Norse/viking theme. They rudely crash DK's birthday party with an invasion, driving all our favorite Kongs away from their home island while also redecorating it to suit their snowy tastes. Needless to say, they brought a polar vortex of their own, transforming DK's island paradise to a frigid arctic playground. Thus, DK and three of his closest companions begin a trek across several unique and totally different islands to take back his home. The premise is cool and all (Like that pun? No...? I'll see myself out...), but like all platformers, the story is there to introduce the platforming action and then take a step back to let the gameplay shine, and it does so well here.The graphics in DKCTF are, putting it bluntly, drop-dead gorgeous. There's so much vibrant color and imagination in this game, it's fantastic! Because you'll be traveling across several different islands, you'll be treated to a huge variety in locales, all of which look awesome. From DK's frozen island, to an island filled with flaming boars, massive mountain crags, and Viking Owl villages, all in a beautiful autumn, to an island strewn with the wreckage of countless boats, planes, and ships (includingSamus' starship cleverly hidden in the canopy in one level, which is awesome!), to a jungle during harvest time filled with jelly, rivers of juice, and other food items (Yummy), there's no shortage of interesting level themes. Remember the beautiful silhouette levels from DKCR? They return in full-force here, making some levels look like they'd belong in a sweet art house indie game. Lots of creativity in this game visually, you'll never be bored. Seriously people, this game is gorgeous, and it runs at a smooth 60 fps which is awesome. The new enemies are also really neat and full of character. While it's easy to miss the Kremlings, Retro has made up some equally charismatic and iconic villains to replace them, if you ask me. I love the Snowmads. Really, the charm in this game is everywhere. I love how Donkey will sit down and start playing a 3DSXL if left idle. I love the different personalities of the main characters. This game is full of charisma.The sound design in the game is also fantastic. Lots of nostalgic sound effects return. I also really enjoy the voice actor's work on DK and the rest of the characters, even if it's all relegated to shouts, grunts, howls, etc. Best of all, this game sees the return of David Wise, the brilliant composer behind the original Donkey Kong Country trilogy's incredible music. Remember the unspeakably awesome atmosphere of songs like \"Aquatic Ambiance\" and \"Stickerbrush Symphony?\" This game has songs of that caliber (Both of those in addition to other fan favorites actually show up gloriously remixed, and the latter is evoked in the incredible \"Alpine Incline\").  Remember the bop-your-head-to-the-beat awesomeness of the original \"DK Island Swing\" or the dramatic epicness of \"Flight of the Zinger?\" Yep, that kind of greatness is here too. I would start listing off awesome tracks from the game, but pretty much *every* single song is stellar. No joke. I love David Wise's music so much. He hit it out of the park with this one. Recruiting him was very smart on Retro's part. Thank goodness he agreed to come back to the series. As a matter of fact, I'd go as far as to say the soundtrack is a major, major selling point for this game. If they ever release this game's soundtrack, I WILL buy it immediately. I don't care if I have to import it from Japan, I *need* this game's soundtrack.The gameplay in Tropical Freeze is, at its core, the same great formula introduced almost two decades ago, with even more of the refinement and freshness that DKCR introduced to the mix. You'll be enjoying a 2-D platformer with a tangible rhythmic quality to it that is very satisfying, with controls so tight you can bounce a quarter off the game and make change. Alongside Rayman's recent outings, you will not find a platformer with such great controls and unique, challenging level designs. You'll be collecting red balloons, banana coins, and literally hundreds upon hundreds of bananas. KONG levels and puzzle pieces are hidden cleverly in the levels. Mine carts return to turn you into a sweat-drenched, adrenaline-drained husk. Make no mistake, this game is ridiculously challenging, perhaps infuriatingly so for some gamers, which is something to keep in mind. DKCTF is a game that hearkens back to a time when dying in the same spot a couple dozen times in a row was due to a lack of player skill, not the game being \"cheap\" (so many games these days coddle gamers, it's nice to see old-school challenge in my opinion). Boss fights are a highlight as well. Most of them have multiple parts, each of which requires you to take a new and different approach. This makes boss fights super hard, but also very engaging and challenging, which I appreciate.DKCTF also introduces quite a few new ideas to the DKC mix. For the first time since DKC3, DK and friends can swim. In my opinion, the controls in these segments are much better than they were in the old DKC games. Underwater levels in this game are actually awesome thanks to more than just the music this time. There's a lot more emphasis on 2.5-D in this game. During many barrel segments, the camera will change to a full-on 3-D view, which makes for some mind-bending challenge and exciting set-pieces. Even mine cart segments have some 3-Dish moments, which is awesome. The biggest change to the game is the introduction of two new characters. DK and Diddy return and play exactly as they did in DKCR. New to the game are *drumroll* DIXIE KONG, who plays similarly to Diddy but has a double jump of sorts that gives you some extra distance and height. Totally new to the series is CRANKY KONG (He hasn't been the star of a gamecanonicallyin a loooong while), who essentially uses his cane in trueDuckTalespogo fashion. Cranky's style is particularly unique, and so fun to use. While player-one can only ever play as DK, each of the three supporting characters add really fun and unique benefits to your move-set. All the characters are fun to play, whether DK for player one or the other three for player two, and the increased variety is really nice for people who love co-op gaming like my wife and I do. Overall, there's a lot of new ideas in this game, too many to count here. Suffice it to say, this is a major step forward for the DKC series, and most definitely not a rehash.Let's face facts, this game rules for the most part, but there are some subjective aspects that some may not like. These should be pointed out for the sake of objectivity. Like I said earlier, this game is ridiculously hard, especially after you get past the first couple islands (and even those can be challenging!). This game will not coddle you. No, this game will kick your @$$ six ways to Sunday, and that will undoubtedly turn some gamers off. As much as I love co-op, you have to be so in tune with your partner to succeed, and the slightest mistake will ruin everything. My wife loves playing DKC with me. For us as a couple, DKCR and now this game have been majorly bonding at the best of times, and end-of-the-world fight inducing at the worst of times (I'm only partially kidding, lol). All I'm saying is the punishing difficulty and co-op don't always mix too well. Also, when playing co-op, they did not make a way for player-2 to quickly switch characters or drop in/out. You have to pause the menu, select the drop out option, then reconnect to pick a new character. That's a major pain. Perhaps worst of all, or least worst of all depending on your opinion, they did nothing to utilize the Wii-U's features in any meaningful way.  Don't expect any interesting implementation of the touch screen, gyroscope, etc. The gamepad's screen isn't even on if you select to play off of the T.V, in fact. Rather than a Wii-U showpiece, this is just an awesome traditional hardcore DK experience that happens to be exclusive to the Wii-U, which I'm perfectly happy with. Focusing on the core experience in development is always better, I sayI don't know how Retro does it, but every game they make is just pure gold. They must employ Midas or something. I've played for many hours by now, solo and with my wife, have reached several islands, conquered several bosses, and I'm really thinking that this is the best Donkey Kong game I've ever played. I'm not just blowing smoke or using hyperbole. This game is just pure, refined 2-D platforming gold, and I absolutely love it. DKCTF makes DKCR look like an extended demo in comparison, and I LOVE DKCR, so that really is a testament to the greatness of Retro's work on Tropical Freeze. I love this game, and if you are a fan of old-school gaming challenge, platformers, Donkey Kong, Nintendo, or just awesome games in general regardless of genre, then get this game immediately. Buy it, prepare an epic trek across several islands, and save your precious home and banana hoard from the Snowmads!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2014"}

This is just flat out frustrating, especially as more of my friends give up the game and I have to team up randomly.Seriously, just last night, I had one round of all noob tubers, one round of all snipers, and one round of campers.  This was all within a one hour session.So, not sure whose bright ideas these were at Activision or Infinity Ward to add all this junk, but I say it actually detracts from what would have been a great game.  And not having dedicated servers makes a bad situation even worse - hosts rage quitting or lost communications/glitches cause constant host migration or drop matches altogether.And don't waste your money and time with the map packs.  I had hoped they would have MP modes to strip all the junk, but they're just new maps that further encourage noob tubing, sniping, and camping.  Again, more is less.  You aren't missing much at all by not buying these add-ons.  I'd say only one map in each pack is any good for actual FPS.  I wish they'd sell new MP modes rather than more useless maps - BRING IN THE ZOMBIES!  BC2 just did this, so IW must have the programming know-how to do this too.Activision/IW really isn't listening to the community and doesn't seem to care at all, just so long as the money keeps rolling in.  It took ridiculously long times to get patches for all the glitches, cracks, and exploitations (infinite care packages, the Javelin glitch, elevators, dual 1887's with seemingly infinite range, OMA and infinite noob tube grenades).  I suppose their marketing team is forcing the programmers to put in junk to attract as many buyers as possible - game design by white collar bean-counters and not players.  I have serious doubts if I'll bother with Black Ops or MW3 based on this game alone if the same overlords at Activision are forcing what goes into the product.So, if you have friends and can form a team worth a spit, then buy it.  Otherwise, avoid it - you'll be happier and healthier by never touching it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Alice returns for more blood","reviewText":"American McGee's Alice is a rare gem on the PC. It's not really the best example of platform gaming or shooting, but it was fun and took a familiar fairy tale into a dark and twisted Wonderland that was unforgettable. When a sequel was announced, it caught me off guard. I really didn't see a big fan base for the series, outside of the cult following. Either way, I was excited and couldn't wait to travel down the rabbit hole again. As the title suggest, the madness does return.Alice: Madness Returns is an action adventure title based on the classic Alice in Wonderland story. To catch you up on the story, Alice's family has been burned in their house, and Alice has to battle if she killed her family. This is the premise behind the original as well. The beautiful thing about this game is that if you never played the original, it's included with a new purchase of the game as downloadable content. The original is still fun but you might not get as much fun out of it unless you played it originally due to the heavy reliance of nostalgia. But this isn't a review on the excellent original so let's move on.If you are hoping for a true sequel to the original, you've got it. Madness Returns is a great take on the series and hopefully EA Games will continue with the series. Maybe not every year, but every console generation would be nice. They've fixed up the combat to be more like a modern action game (think Darksiders or God of War). Don't think this is just a clone. While the combat may be similar to the game, almost every enemy has a different weapon you'll need to attack it with. I was constantly switching between weapons throughout the game, which I enjoyed since most games I manage to finish with maybe two favorite weapons I liked. The enemies are impressive looking, and fit well with the twisted theme of the game. They're also spaced out enough between the exploring and platforming that you hardly feel stress from being overwhelmed. It's almost a perfect blend of fighting and platforming.The gameplay is really solid and features around six weapons. Some of my favorite weapons are missing from the game (devil dice and the playing cards) but the weapons in the game are all fun to play with. You'll cycle between the classic blade, a bomb (also used for puzzles), horse-sledge hammer, a pepper sprayer, and boiling hot tea. Each weapon is used to attack each enemy and they're all needed throughout. Sometimes, using several different weapons for one enemy. The combat is repetitive, but again, you're not constantly fighting and they do manage to introduce new enemies to keep the feeling new. But during all of this, one thing that really disappointed me was the lack of bosses. There is a final boss, but you're never ending chapters by fighting an insane boss. And as for the one boss you do fight, it's really weak and unimpressive. There's an achievement/trophy to not take any damage by \"it\". This is very easily obtainable, even in nightmare mode. Overall, the game is never so difficult that you'll feel too challenged. For that, I have to give a disappointed grunt. I did die a lot, but most of it was just from stupid mistakes.Another thing you'll have access to is an ability that allows you to shrink on the fly. Shrinking allows you to spot hidden platforms or messages, but also allows you to travel through cracks in the wall to access areas for collectables or teeth.The few issues I did have with the gameplay comes from a couple areas. The camera during some of the platforming doesn't follow that well, and I often fell of the map or jumped right into a trap. Luckily, the game doesn't punish you for falling of the map with a load screen. You'll see a flash of butterflies and then you're back at the nearest solid area to try it again with no damage taken. However, when you do take damage and then finally die, you're punished sometimes with a respawn all the way back to a spot at the beginning of the chapter. This isn't something that happens all the time, but it was quite annoying due to me also trying to collect everything in the game. When you die, you also have to go back and track down all of the collectables while going back to where you previously died.As far as story goes, the entire game is dark and twisted (as I mentioned). The deeper you go through the chapters, the more insane the game plays out. Throughout each chapter is also collectables, which is absent from the original game. In all honesty, this game would have benefited with so many repetitive collectables. You'll collect \"memories\", which are vital to the back story, teeth (for upgrades), and bottles (costumes). All of these, maybe outside of the teeth, just feel out of place. However, I think it would have benefited the game to have different things to pick up, but only slightly. One of the reasons for these seem to be to give you a reason to replay the game. Either way, they're not the most fun thing to search for while trying to get into the game. After I beat the game, I planned on going back to collect all of the pig snouts I didn't shoot and finish cleaning up the game by collecting everything. The game is split up into chapters with sub-chapters you can replay. The game shows you how many items you missed throughout, but it would have made it easier to see which sub-chapter I missed a snout into instead of forcing me through the entire chapter again.Voice acting is from the original cast of characters, and spot on. However, some of the voice acting is just not that good or sounds so similar to the other characters, you might be confused on a memory piece if it's Alice talking in the memory or another female. But overall, I was satisfied with the voice acting. I'm not too big on condemning voice acting. (See Duke Nukem Forever review). The music is outstanding and much like the original, very gothic. Sound effects are spot on, but I did notice a few times where the sounds were not playing correctly. It was very rare.Graphically, the game is beautiful. It's full of bright colors sometimes, and rustic Quake themes at others. The character models are cool looking and feel very true to how I'd imagine the next Alice to play out. There's a few random hick-ups throughout, but nothing to write home about. Actually, the most impressive thing in the game is Alice's hair. Seems minute, yes, but the moment you see how fluid her hair is, you'll know what I'm talking about. The game uses the Unreal engine, so if you're a fan of how most Unreal games look, then you'll be fine with this game. Frame rate fans should rejoice, as the game hardly ever had a dip and none that actually effects the gameplay.Overall, this game is hard to recommend for a purchase unless you plan on keeping the game to play again. Once you beat it, even with the collectables, you're done. There's some downloadable content that might come out eventually, other than what I consider to be cheat weapons and costumes, but only time will tell. However, if you're a fan of the original and plan on replaying through the game for pure fun and story, purchase this. It's a terrific game with nothing wrong with it outside of a few minor complaints.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

Eddie Riggs is the best roadie in the music business, but he longs for the days when heavy metal rules the scene.  A freak accident wisks him into a heavy metal fantasy world where humans are enslaved by demons.  The opening where Eddie rescues Ophelia (the love interest) is incredibly funny and exciting.  The humor falls flat as soon as he meets up with the human resistance.  Eddie shows his fellow humans the power of metal (literally).  Music can be used to heal allies and kill enemies.  The story is truly well written and original.  Cut scenes are a pleasure to watch.  It is too bad the story is not fleshed out more than it is.The main single player campaign is a shallow and often broken RTS.  Seriously, that is all it is.  You play \"stage battles\" where you spawn various heavy metal inspired units.  You resources are fans.  The more you gather, the more units you get.  Your stage is your base.  Eddie commands his units through a limited command menu.  What frustated me is that the commands used to interact with your units are broken.  I often found my myself trying to issue a command which the on-screen help is telling me I can do only to find I cannot do it.  It did not matter how how many times I pushed the button.  Nope.  Sorry. It just did not work.  It is kinda sad that a game with such a good pedigree (and long development cycle) came out so uninspired and broken.  It feels like a close cousin to Overlord.Multiplayer adds some replay value.  But, there are so many much more worthwhile RTS available for every gaming system that Brutal Legend gets lost in the crowd of less inspiring RTS games.Side missions bring a welcome diversion to the main campaign.  Eddie can participate in smaller RTS battles, fixed turrent shooting gallery mini-games, racing and delightful mixed bag of other activities.Brutal Legend's average gameplay gets a little more frustrating when you consider that this game comes from the creative genius, Tim schafer at double Fine Productions.  One has to wonder what happened with this game.The side missions and the open world are where Brual Legend shines.  Various racing and shooting games helps to flesh out the game world.  The voice talent is amazing.  Having Ozzie Osbourne as the voice of the Guardian of Metal is a nice touch.Brutal Legend is worth playing.  Especially, if you love metal.  If you do not stare too hard at the game's flaws, then you will likely love Brutal Legend.I give Brutal Legend a 8 out of 10.Pros:great storyawesome voice talentgreat graphicsmetal fans will love itCons:below average RTS elementsshort single playermultiplayer is limitedbuggy commands","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2009"}

Well back when we had NES/SNES,  they released Final Fantasy 1, Final Fantasy IV, and Final Fantasy VI and renamed them to 1, 2, and 3 respectively.  So once Final Fantasy VII(probably the best RPG ever created and I don't throw that around lightly) came out in 1997, people went \"whoa, 7? what about 4 to 6?\" Enter Anthology, Chronicles and Origins and the recently announced Final Fantasy III remake for the DS. This review deals with Final Fantasy Anthology, containing V and VIFinal Fantasy VStory: Bartz, Reina, Garaf and Faris have to take down X-Death(dumbest FF villain name ever) from controlling 4 crystals. Maybe it's my status as a post VI-player but it must've been irritating saving those damn crystals over and over.Graphics: They're pretty standard really, I mean this is the Super Nintendo so they're not great, even for SNES standards. The FMV's of course are cool.Music: Pretty good but not spectacular like IV or VI.Gameplay: It excels for one reason: The Job System. For the first time, you can customize your characters rather than just being one particular class. Master one job, move to another. The story is eh, music's ok, but play it cause it's a FF.Final Fantasy VIStory: They're existed once powerful beings called Espers many centuries ago. Now they're gone and the world is in an Industrial Revolution-like setting with airships and weaponry. A soldier of the Empire, Terra, was used for battle and after being free of mind control, joins a group of resistance members planning to take down the Empire.Graphics: For the most part the graphics are great for the SNES era. They're still not as sharp/detailed as Chrono Trigger or even colorful like Yoshi's Island but they work in the end.Sound/Music: The music here is usually cited as the best Uematsu soundtrack he's done. While personally I go with VII, VI is by no means a flawed soundtrack. There's tons of great themes: catchy ones, emotional ones and epic ones like Terra's Theme, Forever Rachel, Aria de Mezzo Caraterre and Dancing Mad.A HUGE cast list with 14 playable characters, still the largest cast in a Final Fantasy game. While it's nice to have variety, some don't get as much story as they should've. Ones like Celes, Terra, Locke and Setzer have substanstial backstory while others might just join your party and that's it. The game brings in the Esper System. It's not a wild departure like Junctioning but essentially you can equip an Esper to use in battle and after each battle you get points to learn a spell. Learn it and on to the next one. Finish them all and you can pick someone else.While V is merely playable for the Job system and the fact it's a FF game, VI is required playing for an RPG fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2003"}

Shaw \"Casual Reviewer\"","summary":"WOWOW","reviewText":"Great Great Game! So, here is a different take on reviewing this game. I know everyone else loves the racing of the Burnout series, and surely this is some of the best racing on any platform. However, for me, the absolute best thing about the Burnout series is the crash mode. INCREDIBLE! It is hard to put into words why it is so much fun to drive as fast as you possibly can into a crowded intersection to see just how much monetary destruction you can cause. It's like primordial fun. Your inner beast gets to come out in the form of plowing through semi trucks cars and minivans. Plus, every time you complete a crash intersection, you unlock another. Each crash is different, each intersection is different. Eventually you'll get to harder to crash intersections and the crash mode becomes somewhat of an addicting puzzler, trying to figure out how to get the gold. Each crash intersection takes about 1 minute to complete lending this mode of the game to the perfect portable title.Bottom Line: Is it fun? Yes. If you like completely destroying cars and you don't mind using a little brainpower to do it, or if you just want the best racer anywhere, get this game. Will I keep it? It can be played forever. Is it for kids? Extremely violent car crashes with no people involved. My kids can't get enough of it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2005"}

My first complaints about the game still stand, and yes, Blizzard does have Server Lag issues during peak hours of gameplay as other gamers have pointed out.  However, after several hours of gameplay I still find myself drawn back in.  NPC Monsters progress in toughness as your character levels up, so you can continue to gain experience and loot in low level dungeons even as a high level character - making revisiting favorite locations worthwhile.  The soundtrack is every bit as memorable as that of the first 2 installments of the series (maybe even more so).  Even the forced top-down perspective mode of gameplay, which most people would agree is outdated, does not deter from the addictiveness of the gameplay.D3 is a fast paced hack-n-slash game with all the trappings of its predecessors.

Those familiar with the Diablo series and its gameplay will feel right at home with this title.  I am disappointed with the art direction, however, which makes the game feel more like a top-down perspective expansion of World of Warcraft and less like the gritty Gothic ambiance of the original Diablo titles.  The lack of a skill tree and lack of character customization is also a disappointment, as each character you create will be exactly like other player characters of the same class.  That being said, this is a great game for those of us who are suckers for nostalgia and simply want a visceral Hack-n-Slash with which to kill 15-20 minutes at a time - complete with the \"slurpy\", \"steely\" and \"crunching\" sounds we've come to expect every time a weapon is swung in the Diablo universe. :)Overall, well worth the $20 I paid for it and I do expect to download the Expansions as they become available.P.S. *Blizzard does require you to be constantly connected to the Internet while playing the game (you cannot play the game offline), but you do not need the Game Disc in the drive once you've registered your copy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

Then I hit the Wall. Literally and figuratively. All the waiting for D3, and  this is how it ends. I have more questions than answers. Why does Act 1 seem so much better than Act 4 ?Where is all the level 60 gear ? Are we really being \"forced\" to use the $ AH ? What's the point of fighting a pack of 5 five buff elites, who singularly can kill you ? If I can't stay at range nor fight in close, what's my option ? Do I really need to farm Act 1, 5 stack valor, Butcher runs for 333 hours in order to buy a piece of equipment(legendary boots, AH cost 50,000,000). Who's really making the money in the $ AH ? How much gear, what kind of gear does it take to compete in Act 3 ? Was the difficulty in Act 3 planned; and why ? Act 4: can it really get more difficult. Should I quit now and go play GW2 or SWTOR ?Update ... spent 200 hours farming Act 1. Of course, 99.999% of drops is vendor trash. Finished Act 3. Tried Act 4; no chance. Now items needed cost, on average, $400,000,000. My current take is $1,000,000 per 5 hours of farming. Here's the game breaking rub; you will need to have deep pockets to finish D3. I'm guessing buying gold is legal ... I receive 3 offers each day. The cost for 1mil gold is now down to 43 cents. Gold is so devalued, farming is now a waste of time. My guess is, it will cost us at least $700 to buy Act 4 gear. Swapping to MF/GF gear while farming Act 3 is problematic. So, it looks like a cash grab when it is all said and done. How can a game penalize players willing to spend hundreds of hours grinding the same content. Well, if you devalue the purchasing power of the games asset/gold, only players with deep pockets can afford to play. Think about it, I spent 5 hours to make 1mil gold ... Another player can pull 43 cents out of his/her pocket. No; I refuse to sink more than the cost of the collectors game edition cost into this game. Where will the cost finally end. The cost of endgame gear looks like powerball tickets on steroids ... SHAMEFULUpdate 2 ... while waiting for severs to come back online after patch 1.05, went and purchased Torchlight 2Update 3 ... after patch 1.05, gear prices have risen to the point of 'pay hundreds of dollars' or stop progressing. In fact, you could spend $1,000 easily and still not be outfitted in BIS gear. Before, you received messages for gold amounts of 1 million. As of last week, 10 million. Yesterday, bot'ters raised it to 20 million gold. Now the prices at the AH have topped 2,000,000,000/piece. Average gear now tops 10,000,000/piece. Good gear, if you're lucky can be found for 50,000,000/piece. To outfit yourself in excellent gear, will cost on average, 300,000,000/piece. If you want gear to do the hardest content, better crack open your checkbook. So, if your goal is to finish all 4 difficulties, no problem. Figure 40-50 hours per character. DON'T COUNT on drops to help. I have over 700 hours logged and I've found only '2' level 60 items which I then equipped. As of today, it 'costs' too much. The 'grind' is pointless.It appears Blizzard as well as sellers are 'banking' on pvp to 'cash in'. Then, everyone who has great gear and/or gold to sell will pvp'ers tripping over themselves to 'gear up'. Blizzard has drop rates so low, they are forcing players to buy what they need. Once pvp is introduced, we can finally put the last nail in D3's coffin. Of course, I'm sure an expansion is planned to start the cycle once again. Had enough of this pay-to-win game and bot'ters driving up gear prices.Give 'Path of Exile' a look. Will start open beta in December. It's free-to-play.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2012"}

Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A shockingly bad game, even when played as intended","reviewText":"I remember when I first saw Brink. It looked amazing, even a year and a half before release. Conceptually it looked awesome... when I saw it released to extremely poor reviews, I was disappointed and surprised. Then, I saw that the developer/publisher released DLC for FREE for the first two weeks of August, in order to try and get more people to play, because nobody is. They also did that as an apology for the poor saps who bought the game, and I am serious about that, not exaggerating or making that up whatsoever. Now, a mere THREE months after initial release, it is only 12$! 60$ to 12$ in three months!? If that that is not a sure sign of a bad game I don't know what is, but I was deceived by SOME positive user reviews and an extremely low price tag (as well as my own naivety) and bought it anyway. Boy was that a bad idea. }:(Brink DOES do a couple of things well. Here they are:- A ton of customization that really feels like there are infinite choices to shaping your character's appearance, weaponry, body type, and class.- Pretty cool music, when the audio isn't completely glitching out.- The story concept is very unique, and pretty cool. It's decentWaterworldishpost-apocalyptic sci-fi, and I liked it quite a bit. However, ONLY the concept is good about the story.- The art design matches the story CONCEPT well, meaning it is very unique, and overall it's pretty decent sci fi fare, if not boring and repetitive because there's two different types of environments. Variety is not a strength here.Pretty much everything else sucks, terribly, which is very tragic, because *conceptually*, Brink has a ton going for it. Objection based 16-player matchmaking in such an interesting sci-fi apocalyptic setting sounds amazing, but... well... here's the bad, specifically:- The AI is the worst I have ever encountered this generation. Either it's WAY too easy, OR, more likely, your teammates are completely idiotic morons who love to swan dive directly into headshots more gracefully than an Olympic synchronized swimming team. Opposite this team of fairies is a team of ultra SWAT commandos who also happen to have part-time jobs as Master Chief's stunt doubles. They're invincible, sharpshooting marksmen with brilliant neurosurgeon medics, super effective spy operatives, or rocket science engineers. You on the other hand, have a team that arrives on the short bus who die immediately or wonder around nowhere near anything important the entire drudge of a match. It's so frustrating. Now here's an argument to those jerks who say only unskilled players hate this game: I would like to point out that I play shooters fairly often. Not enough to be a MLG gamer, mind you, and not a TON of multiplayer, but I still consider myself a pretty decent gamer. I play video games a lot, and I find the game unplayable. So there.- What makes my preceding point about atrocious bot AI worse is that, because this game sucks, nobody ever plays it so you'll end up with AI bots way more often than not. In my time playing the game, I was lucky if I had ONE other player with me in a match. Let's do some math: 1(me)+ 1 other person = 2 actual people playing in a supposedly SIXTEEN-player match... Remember, this is supposed to be a 100% MULTI-PLAYER GAME! GAH!!!- Even if a match has as little as two people, the lag is so bad at times it is unplayable. I'm not kidding. With more, just say goodbye to any meaningful gameplay whatsoever, as if that was there to begin with (It's OK, you can pretend there was, if it makes you feel better).- The level and mission design is horrendous. This is how a game of Brink will often play out: You have 12 minutes to blow up a door, so you die, then respawn way on the other side of the map, then you run for thirty seconds to get to the objective, die, respawn, then run for 30 seconds, actually plant a charge on the door, get shot and killed along all seven other members of your team by two enemy bots, the enemy undoes what you just accomplished, respawn, run, die, respawn, run, die.... *vomits*... well, you get the idea. It's this cycle ad nauseum for the duration of the time limit until it's over and you lose. OR you win within two minutes and it's not fun that way either. Talk about incredible frustration. It's a joke. Levels are designed where you're directed into choke-points directly in the line of sight of protected enemies.- The \"SMART\" system which was supposed to take an awesome game,Mirror's Edge, and shove it down Brink's throat. It's an awesome idea. It's terribly implemented. You can't tell what is traversable, and more often than not, it fails and you're left stumbling around, probably getting shot.- The story is awesome, in premise. In execution, it's nonexistent, and the \"small touches\" like all the characters yelling out what they're going to do like a bunch of annoying Rastafarian rebels is really obnoxious. Ugh.- The sound, in my copy anyway, glitched out constantly. I was terrified that my newASTRO A40swere actually broken inside. No, they're fine (and awesome). This piece of trash is what's broken, in yet ANOTHER way.- On one map, I stopped and waited for, wait for this, TEN ENTIRE SECONDS for the graphical textures to pop in... still with me? Ok, well, I paused and another FIVE SECONDS LATER, MORE detail popped into place. Remember I haven't moved this entire time. I waited to see another layer pop in, but it never did. Do you know why I kept waiting? Because they were fully loaded, but still looked to be one or two layers away from today's generation graphics. The art design is decent, if not boring and repetitive, but the graphical implementation of them is shockingly bad!Seriously, I cannot word strongly enough how tragic this game is. It had so much potential, but fails so utterly in every possible way that it is downright irredeemable. I will say this, if this game actually HAD players on it, it MAY be a two-star game. However, you can't even experience that because nobody likes this game and so there are no other players to game with. A real shame. What I'm wondering is how in the H-E-doublehockeysticks did this go through both Splash Damage AND Bethesda without somebody noticing the glaring flaws. This game is truly a travesty to gaming everywhere. I am shocked this released. It needed another year or two, at least, to bring it up to today's standards. Too bad. I also must point out that I NEVER write such negative reviews of anything on here. I always try to put every commonly perceived flaw into context to make it a little more understandable. I literally cannot do that with this garbage. It's beyond redemption. 1-star game, and while it's not THEE worst game ever, it is the worst one I've personally played in a long while.This game deserves nothing more than a funeral in my toilet, along with other materials you typically flush down the John, because that is what this game is... avoid it like the stinking, fly-ridden pile it is, seriously!Edit: A month after writing this review, the game is now $9.99 NEW, and $6 USED! It is literally 1/6th the price it released at new, and 1/10th(!) if you get it used. That is a massive depreciation in value over the pathetic time frame of just five months... I am shocked... but then again, I shouldn't be, considering how bad this game is. Honestly friends, I'm just trying to spare you the agony this game will put you through, as well as save your wallet some funds for when the real games come out this Holiday season. The dramatic price drop should be the final nail in the coffin you need. Frankly, Brink SHOULD be $1 new, and Bethesda should PAY YOU money to get it used.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A God on the PS2","reviewText":"How do you follow up a game like God of War?  The first one was incredible.  A thrill ride filled to the brim with complex puzzles and gameplay unmatched by most platformers of the day.  In the end it turned out to be one of the most successful Playstation 2 games out there.  So how do you follow up such a smash hit?  The answer, very carefully, and that's exactly what God of War II does.  It keeps the elements of the first one that worked, while being sure to tweak with a few minor things.  The end result is exactly what a video game sequel should be.  True to the first one.Once again you assume the role of Kratos, the God of War.  He still commands the Spartan Army, and continues to conquer the land.  However, his actions have led to the Olympian Gods being disappointed in him and thus he is betrayed by them.  Thanks to Gaia of the Titans, however, Kratos is able to live and go on another epic journal to once more change his fate.  The journal is difficult and perilous, but it's no problem for a God of War such as Kratos.As far as the story goes, God of War II is just as absorbing as the first one was.  If it's been a while since your trip through the first game, you may want to play it again just in case because the two games link almost directly, and there will be a few references you may or may not pick up on.The gameplay in God of War II hasn't really changed from the first one.  In fact, it's almost exactly the same.  You'll romp through the game slashing and killing things in a bloodfest.  This game is a bit bloodier than the first one, but that's to be expected.  It's also a little romped up in the difficulty.  Much like the first one, however, there's a lot of button mashing involved in the combat.  Simply put, as long as you keep swinging your blades you can survive.  You've also got magic and other weapons you can use throughout your journey, but the problem with this little mechanic is much like the first one, spells and such become useless after a while.  Once you get passed the point where you actually need a spell, there's no reason to ever use it again.  While you get some pretty nifty weapons, none of them are as comforting to play around with as the default.  In short, there's a lot of variety here, but no real reason to explore it.As with the first game, there are a ton of puzzles throughout God of War II.  In the first game there were plenty of difficult and sometimes frustrating puzzles.  I'd be lying if I said the same wasn't true of the second game.  There are a few frustrating puzzles, but nothing quite so frustrating it can't be done.  A lot of the puzzles are actually very well constructed and crafted.  Even the ones that'll frustrate you, you'll appreciate the complexity to them.As far as the game looks, this may very well be the last fantastic looking Playstation 2 game.  It doesn't look that strikingly different from the first one, but there is a lot more detail to the environments.  There are just times when you want to stop and take a look at everything.  Even better, there's hardly (if any) slowdown in framerate.  Everything runs smoothly.Then there's the audio.  As with the first game, God of War II has a fantastic soundtrack that accurately depicts each situation and the mood of each situation.  Even better, the voice acting is top notch.  Just like watching an actual movie.  As far as the sound and audio go, God of War II should be a game developers use as an example of how to do voice talent right.There's not a whole lot that separates God of War II from the first one, and that's a good thing.  While it feels almost entirely like the first one, the story and dedication to keeping true to what works is what makes God of War II just as good as its predecessor.  This may very well be the last great game on the Playstation 2.  If you liked the first God of War, then you'll absolutely love God of War II.On the Positive Side+Fantastic overall story+Simple and addictive gameplay+Complex puzzles and fantastic level design+Great visual look+Overall fantastic voice acting+One of the greatest soundtracks ever composed in gaming+Stays true to the original God of WarOn the Negative Side-Some frustrating puzzles-Lots of variety, but a lot of spells and weapons become useless rather fast-While the gameplay is fun and addictive it's almost reduced to mere button mashing, although that's not really too bad","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2007"}

The reason I'm playing it so long after it open was because many scenes tie directly into the movie. We don't see the whole story in the movie but had to play the game to get why something happened. I don't like this because that leaves two sources to go through to get the movie. The game was rushed to market and there are many, and I do mean many glitches and bugs in game. Many levels are just your characters walking through a hall way but here's the kicker. The game controls are old school. ONE ANALOG STICK controls your character. That leaves the camera in automatic and yes there are times you can't turn around to fight an enemy behind you. There are some glitches like the Sewer flashlight thing that can be worked around. You can't move forward without the it. Yet, you can't pick it up. (shoot some rounds off of your MP5). The way-point arrow is slow and deceptive. It doesn't point to where you really want to go and when you get there resets to another location entirely. The game's graphic and content is okay and the cutscenes adds to the experience of the movie. I am very frustrated playing this defective game because of the research online to find ways around the bugs. One review in a game magazine said it best. \"The only thing complete about \"Enter the Matrix\" is that it's a complete mess.\" Yes, it is.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}

It has a very high replay value, despite the limited number of environments and levels, probably because of all the rpg elements. Not only are there 6 completely unique characters to level, all of which have varying skills and playstyles, but it never feels like a grind becuase of all the treasure there is to collect. You can set up one set of gear specifically for fighting against dragons, and another if you know you're going to be fighting a bunch of demons. The environments are also beautiful, and display absolutely wonderfully on the Vita screen. Although the game has a lot of fast-paced action in the heat of battle, sometimes it's nice, when you aren't laying waste to a horde of undead, to appreciate the detail that was paid to each of the game's many backdrops.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2013"}

This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"bcas400g \"bcas400g\"","summary":"Excellent game made better with FREE updates from developer","reviewText":"Had some reservations about this game as I am not a huge racing game fan.

{"product_name":"B001CRM3YQ","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"A Classic Shooter Reborn","reviewText":"Wolfenstein 3D was the first shooter I ever played and it holds a deep place in my heart. It not only made me interested in video games outside of platformers, it also inspired me to look at the history of World War II.This new installment in the Wolfenstein series is a lot different from the previous games. For starters, you're not breaking out of a prison cell or out of a castle. Instead, you're in the middle of the war, helping resistance soldiers with their quest. When I first read the previews, the game seemed to be as if it were an open world, sort of like Far Cry 2. However, the reality is that while the game is pretty open, there's a lot of load times in between areas. One part of a map is the west side of town, the other is the east side. This was a bit disappointing since it is very possible to make a town that's very open world with today's gaming hardware. This is one of the let downs of the game, as in even the earliest of Wolfenstein games, the maps are really well thought out. The maps in the new Wolfenstein, while aren't terrible, just aren't as creative as you'd expect coming from the masters at id Software and Raven. One of the more disappointing things is the tribute to the secret areas by pressing your action button against walls. There are secret areas, but they're just not as fun to find since it's not a wall just pulling back to reveal a special area.While the maps aren't as impressive, the story is very well thought out and fits perfect in this occult shooter. The architects have uncovered crystals that possess power from a Sun dimension, and now the Nazis have their hands on them. So this time, as B.J., you are on your way to uncover the secrets of these crystals and try to take down the occult once again. This story line is truly faithful to the Wolfenstein series.One thing I've always been a fan of in these games are the weapons. They're a blend of actual WWII weapons, while mixing in a few 'what if' super weapons. The new gun, the particle gun (which instantly vaporizes enemies into dust) is one weapon that is incredible to use. Now, the weapon does feel a little cheap the first time you use it, but after you discover how limited the ammo is, it feels pretty well balanced for the game. You also sport a veil, a device that holds your power crystals for slowing time or seeing things in another dimension. All of the weapons, including the veil and the grenades, can be upgraded using gold that you find throughout the game. The upgrade system is pretty impressive. It doesn't just allow you to unlock everything you want. You have to find secret tomes and intel throughout the maps to unlock features for your upgrades. While this system is pretty fun to use, the weapons are a bit limited compared to other shooters. However, I don't think Wolfenstein was designed to be more than a typcial Doom-style shooter with an actual story to back it.The graphics are a bit dated, but they're not bad at all. It's the Doom 3 engine. The engine still looks really good, has great lighting, and still impresses. It's not going to blow anyone away like Crysis or Killzone 2, but it does it's job at providing a smooth and sweet looking Nazi shooter. The framerates stay smooth throughout all of the action, even during switches between one dimension to another. I was pretty impressed with the sound quality. The running waterfalls when falling near your character on a surround sound system really sounds life-like. The gun sounds are most impressive, as they each hold a booming sound instead of the typcial light sound most shooters give.Now, the multi player is where the game is a little messed up. The game is less inpiring in this area, and it really doesn't feel like they put much though into it. The maps aren't horrible but the whole system just feels a little cheap. When you come from games like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory: Wolfenstein, you expect that excellent experience to carry over. The game is a typcial deathmatch style game with a few objective maps, however, they just don't feel as strong as the aged 'Return to'. It's still fun in some ways but don't expect this to take the place of many better multi player shooters out there. There's at least a ranking system, which is always better than nothing.If you're just looking for a relaxing shooter with classic gameplay (and then some), this is the game for you. If you're not into single player adventures, I'd wait until a price drop or at least until they patch up the multi player. But for those who don't care and just want a classic Wolfenstein Nazi hunting game to go through, this game will keep you busy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2009"}

More so than ever before, your choices lead to fa rmore profound outcomes that impact your every being. Whether it's deciding the outcome of minor squabbles or changing the direction of the entire kingdom, these key decisions will change the world forever.","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Liked 2 better...","reviewText":"I really played the heck out of Fable 2.  Can't even count the millions I have, gameplay was great, entertaining and not really frustrating.This new version I had really hoped would extend that, take it to another level, graphically and gameplay-wise...Unfortunately, it was not to be.Graphics are great.  Other than some pathing issues where things walk through each other as if they're ghosts, the visual quality is stunning at times.The dog is still pretty stupid when it comes to getting your treasure though.  Same problems with it not going where the treasure is.  You'll see the sign for Dig Spot and go by the dog, and it just sits there half the time, not leading you anywhere, and you have to start wandering around in various directions to force it to follow you, to see if it then will \"click\" and start going somewhere.  And like the original, I really wish there was an option to \"skip digging animation\" since that gets really old really quickly.Also no more health bars, XP bars, the whole \"leveling\" process is changed.  Some people like the new one, saying it's more \"realistic\", but if I wanted realism in my video game, I'd buy the sims and recreate my neighborhood, including the annoying neighbors to the west of my house...  I hate not knowing exactly where my health stands, how many potions I need to take, etc.  On the other hand, getting away from people hitting you lets your regenerative powers heal you also, so there's less need to carry food or such.  The entire game, I had no food, only some potions.  Never ate any food at all.The combat is still good though, and I actually like the spell casting better because  you can mix things.  My favorite was the fireball/shock combination since that actually stops enemies and stuns them.  Many times in the game when i was surrounded, I could just stand there and keep hitting that spell without directing it, letting it go in the circle around me, and would stun people as they got near.  So I couldn't get hit, and they'd eventually die.  But there is no option for a time slow spell anymore, just the potion, and that was a HUGE loss since I loved being able to select different levels of the time slow spell in a fight.  No more, just a potion with a set duration.For those who loved the sarcastic gargoyles in Fable 2, there are replacements for fable 3, gnomes.  But they're not quite as witty or funny as the gargoyles were.One improvement I DID like very much was the map room, a three D representation of Albion, and that was how you could look to see who needed help, where to travel to, etc.  That was done VERY well.But it's in a location that keeps all your items, so no more changing guns in the middle of a fight, now you have to jump back to this special room, go into the armory, and then change weapons.  Also, no more augments.  That was a devastating change, since I loved being able to change things when I wanted to.  Now the weapons \"morph\" abilities based on how many things you kill, how or when you kill them, etc...Storyline is pretty lame this time around too.  Won't go into it since there's enough spoilers out there already, but too many times you're forced into these extended slow walking parts that you can't just skip through.The interaction with the NCP's is also very, very irritating.  Was so easy and smooth in FAble 2, but in 3, the options are more limited.  the \"A\" button is always a \"good\" action, others vary.  No more just cycling with a stick to which action YOU want to do...And those interactions take longer.  \"Dance\" seems to be the most common and every time you have to watch this same action.  EVERY TIME.  And there's a delay before and after while it resets the graphics from the video of the dancing to the interaction view again.And you have to interact with them to get the \"seals\" which are how you get new powers.  I don't see why dancing with everyone in albion suddenly allows me to become a master spellcaster...Disappointing in most respects, but very well done in a couple.  Hopefully with Fable 4 we'll get back on track to something less annoying.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Benjamin M. Cady \"Ben\"","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"Let me first start by saying I got into Uncharted right before the second entry of the series was released.  I purchased the first one, played through it and saw a great amount of promise for the sequel.  After playing Uncharted 2 I was convinced the game could not be topped, I was partially correct.  I love Uncharted 3, but there is one minor quibble I have with the game that keeps it from being perfection, the aiming system felt a bit slow (something which I recently read would be improved, if anyone else read this it would be appreciated if you could back me up on this) and everything being grandiose on such a consistent basis made it feel a bit on the tired side (not quite a quibble so much as a bit of a gripe :p).Enough about what I didn't like, what I did enjoy was the story and (more specifically) the dialogue; which is witty and very sardonic at points.  The game on the whole provides an interesting means of taking the player through various scripted shooting and platforming sequences that blend seamlessly together, not a moment of it feels like filler or forced.  Then there are the graphics, which are great, just like one who is a fan of the series or any other passerby may have noticed in previous entries.  The multiplayer is robust and varied, with interesting takes on capture the flag and smear the queer (sorry for saying \"queer\" as it can be offensive, but the idea is there) and the co op missions are great fun.  This game should be in the PS3 of any fan or anyone looking for a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, even if it isn't perfect, it's still a great game.Buy this one, now! 9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWSQQ","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"NFS:  Most Wanted, Reborn as Burnout Paradise 2","reviewText":"The premise behind NFS: Most Wanted is this:  In Fairhaven City, there are 10 drivers who are the \"Most Wanted\".  Take them down, you get their car.  The goal:  Become the most wanted driver in Fairhaven City.Ok, so the story's lame, but you didn't have one at all in Burnout Paradise either.  That's not really important to racing fans, as one look at NFS: The Run's reviews will tell you.  What DOES matter are the cars, how do they control, modes available, upgrading possibilities, and multiplayer.  Again, this is a review in process, so I can address all of these outside of multiplayer at this time.- It's really hard to pin down the driving controls in this game at this early stage.  We're not talking Gran Turismo level of difficulty, but it's also not as easy as the original Burnout Paradise, or even Blur.  Think the controls in Ridge Racer Unbounded, but MUCH less touchy, and you're getting in the right ballpark.  My best guess:  If you're familiar and have played the NFS series, you'll be at home here.- As for the cars, no more going through ranks 1-20 to unlock.  Every car in the game is available at the start.  Now the danger of this, of course, is that you'll find one you fall in love with and really have no need/desire to find all the rest (Why would you bother with the Delta Lancia when you can drive/upgrade a Porsche, for example)?  All you have to do is look for the cars with an badge above them, choose the car and it's yours to drive.  It's definitely a step in the right direction away from what a \"typical\" racing game would force you to do (aKa Gran Turismo, forcing you to grind for money to buy them).- As far as single player is concerned, I am a little worried that the modes are a little on the bare side.  The various events in Burnout Paradise were diversified and had cars to match them.  In NFS: Most Wanted, it's pretty much limited to races, evading the cops and maintaining a certain speed through the course.  In short, it's got the potential to get old in a hurry.  However, you'll probably be too busy seeing if you're beating your friends, smashing billboards and the like to be worrying about that.- Each car gives you the ability to upgrade various functions, such as tires, transmission, boost, etc.  This is done by earning Speed Points, which you pretty much earn doing anything in the game.  Now of course, for the completionists (like me), it will be fun going through and upgrading every car fully, giving an vast array of options for attacking different races (example:  lightweight chassis give you more speed and are better for fast races, but suck when trying to go against the cops.  Off road tires help you on those races, but you lose grip on pavement, etc).  It'll be fun seeing online who gets the perfect combinations to set the best times.And for now, that's it.  As I get experience in Multiplayer, I will update my review, but it definitely seems to be at least as good as Burnout Paradise's, which is a testimony as to why there is still a good online community existing in that game 3 years after release.Bottom line:  NFS:MW takes it place alongside the other racers on the PS3 (GT5, Burnout Paradise and NFS:HP) as the best you can buy.  There is an incredible amount of depth and layers in this game to unwrap and discover.  Criterion, you did it again!**UPDATE #1 31 October 2012**Multiplayer is definitely as diverse as in Burnout Paradise if not moreso, given that many of the cars (including the ones you receive from pre-ordering) are only able to be used in Multiplayer.  Players who invest the time in the various races/race layouts with the proper cars/mods will have a definitive, FAIR advantage over those who do not, but given the chaos that is traffic in this game, there's a chance a person ending up in last can still make up ground for a good finish.  Outside of the racing events, there are also ones that involve getting away from the cops (wreck your friend=them getting busted and disowning you) as well as who can drift the most, get the most air, break the most billboards, etc. in a certain time frame.  While the single player, for those who dump a ton of time into it and find their favorite cars, probably has a short life span, when you start talking about multiplayer, and get a few friends who have this game, and the replay value goes through the roof as you try to \"top\" your friends to be the \"Most Wanted\".If anything, multiplayer has reinforced my opinion that this quite simply is one of the best racers on the PS3, the best one released in 2012, and deserves your purchase.***Update #2 10/31/2012I'm seeing some questions about how this compares to NFS:Hot Pursuit.  Keep in mind, Criterion's goal was to make this game a \"spiritial\" successor to Burnout Paradise (released in 2009).  In terms of gameplay, NFS:HP and NFS:MW are different in terms of modes as well as scope (open world, explore at your leisure vs. rigid routes), but similiar in that you can wreck the cops when you are being pursued.  The cops will use spike strips and roadblocks, no EMP or helicopters that I've seen.  Your cars do have \"mods\" which can offset the roadblocks and spike strips (much like you had in HP for the racer).  Online is much deeper IMHO vs. Hot Pursuit, even when you consider the DLC that EA/Criterion have released over the life of NFS:HP.My verdict is NFS:MW will ultimately be much deeper and have more replay value then NFS:HP.  But both are OUTSTANDING games in their own aspects.Also, in another simularity to NFS:HP, NFS:MW will allow you to utilize your own soundtrack that you have on your PS3.  I think you'll definitely want this as there's nothing memorable about the soundtrack I've heard so far from the game, and some of them are downright annoying.  Why ALL racing games don't have this as an option I have no idea.  It definitely enhances the enjoyment of the title!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

I avoided this game for a long time due to the bad reviews and expected practically nothing when I started it up. I'm not a hardcore gamer and I've only tried playing FF7, FF8, and FFX back in the day but never really had the patience for them. I also prefer sandbox games or non-linear games, but the linear storyline in FF13 didn't bother me at all. The graphics are gorgeous, the music is nice, English voice acting wasn't as bad as I thought it might be (I hate dubs), and the gameplay was fun. I really couldn't stop playing. The story is confusing and lacking a bit, but don't try to make too much sense of it and just enjoy the ride. Probably the one thing that really kept me playing is leveling up the characters and seeing their skills, along with the battles. Some of the battles were challenging and you have to figure out the right tactics to win. I'm definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy XIII-2 whenever it comes out.

Over the course of the game, Ratchet also uncovers Dr. Nefarious's newest plot, and Clank learns of his destiny and how he relates to an enormous structure called the Great Clock.Now that that's out of the way, I must tell you that this is a really good game.  It's a lot of fun.  Very funny.  The graphics are beautiful, and the voice acting is top notch.  This game is a bit different from previous ones because throughout much of it, you switch between Ratchet's story and Clank's.  Ratchet's is the usual gameplay you're used to, with you exploring a variety of planets and getting to shoot enemies with a bunch of different weapons.  (At first, I didn't like the guns you could get, but you finally get some better ones later.)  Like usual, there are a few fun gadgets Ratchet can use, too.  The best is the Hoverboots, which allow him to get around quickly, stay in the air longer, and use these ramps to get places he couldn't without them.  I also think it's neat that Ratchet can do more with his wrench now.  It can be thrown while on the move now (I know on the PS2, you had to stop to throw it), and it can also be used to do things like move objects.  I think it's a nice change that his wrench is more useful than it was in the past.In Clank's part of the game, there is new gameplay involved as he goes around the various sectors of the Great Clock.  Most notably, there are these great time puzzles that really get you thinking.  Basically, it involves a puzzle that would normally involve several people, and you can record yourself doing things, and then you can do other things while your recorded selves play.  For example, you record yourself stepping on a switch to open a door.  Then, you go through the door as your recorded self steps on the switch.  But, they get much more complicated than that.  You can get hints if you need them, and you can skip many of the puzzles, but you don't get any reward for skipping them.One difference in this game (at least, from the original PS2 trilogy, the only ones I've played before this one) is that you can fly around in space, which is kind of a nice change.  In the earlier games, you just chose a place, and Ratchet would fly there himself.  Now space is divided into several sections, and you can fly from place to place.  There's a lot out here, too, which I get to later.  There are also a few radio stations to check out while you're flying, too, which can be fun.My main problem with this game is it is too easy and too short.  When you start the game for the first time, you can choose one of three difficulty levels.  I went with normal, and it was too easy.  Certainly easier than the original trilogy.  If you're used to the series, you may want to start on the hardest difficulty.  The game (the main story part, I mean) seemed to be pretty short, too.  You can beat it in about eight hours, which doesn't seem as long as earlier games.To make up for it being so short, there are a lot of extras, fortunately.  There are Skill Points you get for doing certain things like in the previous games (for unlocking concept art and cheats).  There are 40 Gold Bolts for unlocking skins.  There are also 40 Zoni to collect for upgrading your ship.  And once you get all of them, something special happens....  There are also all these other weapon-related things to collect.  I never used much of them, but I think many are for customizing weapons.  And some will get you the Ryno V, the strongest weapon in the game.  There's also an arena where you can battle enemies for bolts and other rewards.  There are many small moons to explore, too, and there are people out in space you can help out.  There's also challenge mode once you beat the game, which is nice, considering how easy the game is normally.All in all, it's a great game.  It's really a lot of fun and one of the funniest games of the series I've played so far, too.  (And I love those puzzles with Clank.)  Like I said, my main problems were that I found the game too easy and the main part of the game too short.  But, you can play it on a harder difficulty level or do challenge mode (I don't know what the difference is), and there are so many extras, it does make up somewhat for the game's length.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"I love StarTrek, but this game is really dull and a wasted oppertunity","reviewText":"Since StarTrek Online is now free to play, there is no real reason to buy it other than to save yourself a 4 GB download. This is a massive multiplayer online game that is part role playing game, part over the shoulder shooter and part starship navigation and combat. I love StarTrek as we probably all do to even be here reading this. I've always wanted a game that gives you the total feeling of captaining a starship, commanding an away team and interacting in a universe. StarTrek online feels shallow and hollow in some areas, yet needlessly cumbersome in others.The game is shallow with interactions and choices. The game delegates talking with characters down to a portrait and written text. No voice acting, but maybe I have been spoiled. I take that back, there is some horrible voice acting from Leonard Nemoy to start the game and the holographic doctor that acts as a tutorial is one of the flattest and worst voice acting I've ever heard. Especially when the EMH doctor on StarTrek Voyager uses the same lines with a pop and snap. The dialog is so bland that I just skip through it because everything you need to do is marked with an exclamation point. It would have also felt better to be able to interact with more random objects like scan flowers that are not marked and have a 1% chance every hour to find something. There are still interactions like anomolous readings that open up a wave pattern mini game that is very easy to say the least.Right off the bat it is a disappointment as you are thrown into a conflict with the Borg who in the StarTrek universe should not be for beginners. Nor should they fall easily, but you might as well have a fly swatter for all the Borg you'll encounter.Luckily if you have a problem with the missions, there is an actual mission editor. You can submit your missions and have them put into the game which is a nice touch.Like any MMO, you get to pick a race, pick a class from three (red, blue and yellow). Everyone seems to pick red. Each race has special traits and you can customize your look with excessive detail. It all feels very superficial.When you're not walking around and talking, you're either flying a ship or shooting things. The shooting is good and pretty easy even if its one dimensional. Point your phaser at the target you want to die or blow up and keep firing til its dead. Shooting civilians doesn't matter... and it should. You get an away party that you make up of crewmembers that you find or recruit throughout your play. Its a fun micromanagement thing and your allies are pretty competition and takes away from a MMO when your party is made of computer characters. The ability to just jump into someone else's party to replace the computer would have been nice.You have some basic controls to fly around, but it seems a little cumbersome, throttling up to go forward and then going to impulse... Flying around objects and toward objects to blow them up or beam off survivors. The visuals are beautiful here, but the fact you're over dead space makes things seem pretty lifeless unless there's a space battle going on.Space battles are where the game excels. You have 4 \"power\" settings... attack, defense, speed and balanced. They all do what you'd think to make it easier for you to survive. In a space battle, your starship has 4 shields, front, rear, left and right. Taking too much damage to one shield will leave your ship vulnerable and easy to kill. So you need to manuver around the ship you're facing firing off phasers to drain their sheilds and torpedos to finish them. Oh and aft weapons as well. The weapons have cooldown times just like any MMO. Some space combat missions feel like a slog when you're on your own... kill 4 enemies here, fly there, kill 4 more enemies, fly there, kill 4 more and go back and they respawn... 1 ship vs 4 quite frequently. There are no quick battles until you level up. Then there are massive battles MMO style where its 10 players vs 1 super ship or 10 players vs 10 ships then 10 more then 10 more then 10 more. There is a noticably slowdown on my laptop for those.You can visit your bridge and ship interior from your vessel, but there is little life there. There are plenty of NPCs and big hollow areas, but no one speaks and its more of just a little head nod that... yes we have your ship interior. Perhaps in further stages of the game the bridge opens up, perhaps when your ship is boarded by alien hostiles... but that is just a prayer that's what happens. Perhaps drama of your ship filling up with deadly gasses and you and a party need to save everyone. Oh and another glaring detail is the fact that when you start the game you pick how your uniform looks... why is it no one else from my crew is wearing the uniform I have chosen? Am I the rogue ensign captain that does as he wishes?The missions greatly vary but after a while they feel very copy and paste. Some missions are well thought out with plot twists. Other missions seem one dimensional, like space battles where you need to destroy 4 satellites protected by a squad each... then fly to pick up dilethium that is guarded, then drop off dilethium but you can't, because your transporters are being blocked by a jamming station that is guarded, so when you return after destroying the jamming station the dilithium drop point is guarded. Constant space battles are not a good thing. Neither are the missions where you are exploring random planets where 2 of which have been baron and devoid of life or action. You are sent down to scan 4 objects on one with no enemies and barely anything to look at. Another planet had me in a cave with no enemies downloading audio logs that I couldn't listen to... what? Those are the bad missions and the missions seem to each take 40 minutes with sections that take 10 minutes.5 or 6 hours into the game, you get duty officers that you get to send on away missions. These are not missions that you do, but rather as a captain you need to assign the right people for the job. Its a nice little add on, but not needed for sure. The officers have jobs and personality quirks like stubborn, a team player, logical and so on. The missions specify what traits and jobs are best suited for each away mission.In all, with no voice acting for the flat characters and meh dialog coupled with mediocre missions I can't get into it and I'm a big fan of the lore. I really think that the game makers missed the point of StarTrek and that wasn't space exploration it was drama. Sure you travel to far away planets and dogfight against other starships, but the point of the TV series and movies was the characters and this game has flat characters. The game doesn't really feel like an MMO. After 15 hours I've never really interacted with anyone except for seen them flying by and the big boss battles. Nothing seems to have consiquence, there could have been factions and alliances instead of just Federation vs Klingon. Or your own personal alliances like Morrowind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2012"}

However you have enhanced speed and attack power so you can do a lot of damage in the short amount of time until your gauge drains or you or the boss dies which ever happens first.

But you know, it's certainly nowhere *near* a classic because it's basically a watered down, less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweet-looking explosions.  Actually, the explosions aren't necessarily better than the first two Prime games, but I found myself admiring them more this time around (perhaps because I was bored out of my mind in so many other ways).Remember the original Metroid on the NES, Metroid 2: Return of Samus on the Game Boy, and Super Metroid on the Super NES? These games were released a long time ago, and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on \"exploration\".In Metroid Prime 3, you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see. While it's somewhat fun, the lack of exploring hurts the game a LOT and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value. I also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game. It was never like that in the past (playing the 2D Metroid games, I mean).  Are you kidding me?  20-30 minutes to completely eliminate ONE boss battle?  Why in the heck does it take so darn long???  This complaint holds true with the previous two Prime games as well.  That's a major, unforgiveable problem.Also, and this is a pretty big complaint, the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous, one-way hallways are usually small, horribly animated, and just boring to watch/fight.  NOTHING compared to the enemies in the first two Prime games.  We're talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them.  I'm extremely disappointed here.  It makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by Nintendo.Besides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because you're doing nothing but talking to soldiers like it's a borderline RPG game, exploring generic computer rooms that we've seen to death in thousands of other video games, and admiring constant blue/grayish colors throughout *every* single wall located on *every* single hallway (yes that's sarcasm) the game eventually changes so you're exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship.  Too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous Metroid Prime games.  Actually it's more like a poor imitation of previous efforts.That's not quite the biggest issue I have with the exploration feature however.  The BIGGEST problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even MORE miniature and narrow hallways.  You're probably wondering why I keep saying \"narrow\" and it's because, for the most part, the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting.  It's like so much effort was put into the background graphics (which are overrated by the way- the game doesn't look *that* great) that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design.  I don't think so- if a game's not fun to play, it's not worth my time.  Basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you.  The areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice, or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in Prime 1 and 2.Ice missiles are a really bad idea.  Yes, you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself.  Who cares?  These aren't the kind of improvements that take advantage of the Wii's capabilities.  It's not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either.  Grappling doors and enemies isn't very fun either.  In fact, you might even say it's downright cheap.  While grappling an enemy, most likely another enemy from off-screen will shoot laser balls at Samus and drain a good deal of your health.  Meanwhile you can't do a darn thing about it because you're stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy.  Oh sure, this entire process only takes a few seconds (by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields) but SEVERAL of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ball-shooting maniacs, so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy.  This means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough task.Lock onto enemies, fire repeatedly until they die, rinse and repeat.  It's predictable and boring now.  This is exactly what you'll be doing the entire way through.  You'll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures.  I prefer the 2D games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys.  With enough practice you'd actually be able to *master* the games.  This is probably not entirely THIS games fault- but 3D games in general.  Ugh, enough is enough.Speaking of the Wii, who's bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the Wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot?  Yes, I'm referring to grappling again.  No, you don't have to do these commands for EVERY door you walk through- just specific ones.  It's still a terrible idea and it's more annoying than anything else.Speaking of doors, why in the WORLD does it take 10-15 seconds to load a door?  Are you kidding me?  This game was released in 2007 (not 1996) so it's absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open, especially when this wasn't even a problem in the first two Prime games.  Ridiculous.  Also -while waiting for a door to open up- make sure you've taken care of all the enemies in the room (and I mean ALL of them).  They WILL find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast Samus from behind.  Such a dreadful gameplay flaw.Another enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task.  Many times, after spending more than 20 minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways,  I just shut the game off and say \"I'm done with this BS\".  I strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game.  I can't tell you how many times I was *almost* finished and an enemy became a distraction and I either couldn't finish the puzzle or died.  Frustration to the highest extent.The one positive is that Hypermode is pretty awesome.  No, it doesn't actually speed up the gameplay (like I originally thought when I first read about it).  Instead, Hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beam-type weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves.  It's pretty awesome.  However, there's a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly that's a bit overbearing and therefore annoying.  It's only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out you'll be fine after that, so I can't complain about it TOO much. I can however, complain about something else- that being, when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away, and you have ZERO time to react and therefore you die immediately.  Cheap, uncalled for, and severely flawed.The first three Metroid games ever made for the NES, Game Boy and Super NES were REALLY different from each other and that's another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere.  Alright, so the first two Metroid games aren't THAT much different (besides the obvious color and graphic differences) but certainly Super Metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different direction.The first three Metroid Prime games however, are all basically the same. It's *really* not like Nintendo to ever milk a series (with the exception of Mario perhaps) but for some reason, they're letting it happen with the Metroid Prime series. It's probably time they stopped working on making Metroid games and focused on another creation, because innovative gaming in the Metroid series is probably now a thing of the past.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2007"}

Unfortunately, the newer starfox have strayed away from the games roots, with not-so-fantastic results. This newest starfox hopes to change that, and succeeds at taking the series back to space combat, but some new changes do not sit too well with the overall gameplay.This game is a space shooter, and all active gameplay is played through the cockpit of a spaceship. The last traditional Star fox game, Star fox 64, handled controlling your ship with ease by using the analog stick on the N64. In command, there is a new control scheme, in which you use the touch screen to maneuver your ship and target your enemies. This takes a little gatting used to, and granted it is not the best way to play star fox, it does work in delivering precision and handling on the most basic level. But this gets very dificult when trying to make a turn over 90 degrees, because the ships turn slowly, unless you want to look down and push the 180 turn button at the bottom of the screen, which is a chore. Also speeding up and breaking is done by double-tapping either the top or bottom of the screen, which is a nighmare while in an intense dogfight. But the worst of the meneuvers is the barrel roll, which is done by scribbling back and forth on the screen. This is increadibly unresponsive and takes way to much effort to pull of the move, which in earlier games, could have been taken care of by the push of a button. These issues are big and definately pull the game down from being great.The next dissapointment is the inclusion of turn-based strategy portions of gameplay before each battle. These parts of the game are not fun, and are very frustrating due to the interupting fog. This also leads to the inclusion of a time limit. It is supposed to represent fuel, but if this is true, how are all of your ship sharing the same fuel tank? It is a stupid idea to make it a huge part of the game, and could have actually worked if it was less crucial, and more developed.This leads to my final gripe about the game. The game is very repetative. You wont be doing much more than flying in an empty open course shooting the same old enemies, and looking out for that darn time limit. All the environments look different from each other, but they all play the same because there is nothing there. You wont be seeing much else in the game, and the childish story does not help much either. The next Star fox should feel more epic, not kiddie. Multiplayer also has no variety, just flying around an empty course, shooting the other people. Its fun for a few times, but it wears of rather quick. The whole game's novelty wears off rather quick. Once you master the controls, you realize that there is not much more to do.This game would make a nice rental. What was mentioned above is mostly what is wrong with the game, but there is fun to be had here. This game is a pathway to putting the franchise back on track, and it does make changes, but it is too flawed and shallow for its own good. That is why I give it a 3 out of 5.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2006"}

(The reloading animations are very good.)- Plot twists and an engaging story (one hour of in-game engine cinematics)- Some puzzle solving, mixed with adventure, and thrown together with a lot of action, equals a pretty well rounded game. (The variety is nice, as certain areas you have to climb and figure out how to get from point A to point B.)- Interaction with non-player characters keeps it moving. (The jeep chase is one example of a hair-raising action sequence.)- Perhaps the most amazing water effects in any game. (Drake's clothes get wet when he dives into water and then they slowly dry--really amazing effect that adds incredible detail to the graphics.)- A lot of action, whether gun fights or close quarter combat. (Some people complain about the game having too many enemies to fight, but it really adds to the feeling of Drake up against overwhelming odds.)- Musical score is very good and definitely is reminiscent of a Hollywood action movie score.- Roughly 10 hours of game play (Again, for those who play games always on \"easy\" and run through the game like their house is on fire, it could easily be 6-8 hours.)What you may dislike about the game:- Headshots are not easy to pull off as the enemies move very erratically and sometimes super-humanly fast. (The sniper-rifle is your best bet.)- Some character animations can be \"jumpy,\" but not terribly so.- The puzzles are not hard to figure out.- Hand-to-hand combat is never really necessary and when performed, it can lead to a quick death, especially when trying to execute combos. (I died more often trying hand-to-hand combat, than the most fierce gunfights.)- Only one vehicle mission where you can control the vehicle- Very few locations and some of the tunnel or underground locations are too dark, with the tiny flashlight Drake is equipped with- Game is a bit too easy, even on Hard.- Use of Sixaxis is really an after thought and is more frustrating than useful while trying to keep Drake balanced on fallen trees and beams.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWR6M","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Brady","summary":"Fun game with minor flaws","reviewText":"At its core this a great arcade racer. If you're expecting Gran Turismo, go buy Gran Turismo. I do not buy a ton of racing games, so for me its a great purchase. NF:MW is rooted in fast and furious street racing, with traffic, cops, and brutal crashes. The racing is fast paced, hectic, and challenging. The graphics are beautiful, and the open world concept is flawlessly executed. The mix of cars you can drive and the styles of racing is diverse, and adds a ton of value to the game. The multiplayer is frantic and fast paced, and the single player campaign is really deep with cars and challenges. The game is fantastic to play in long hauls or short spurts, and is my favorite Vita game to date. It's a true console experience on a handheld, which is what we all thought we would get when buying a Vita. Kudos to Criterion on that front.Some minor gripes with the game are numerous, but I really don't feel they take away from the enjoyment of the game. The most talked about is the lack of body customization. A full kit and paint customizer would have done a lot to the game, and I was disappointed to see it was left out. The drag style race was also left out, which on a pure speed rush could have added some variety. I also think the crashes, while cool looking, should do more to hurt your cars drive-ability. I hate that I can flip a Porsche 19 times in the air, destroy its body, and then speed off like nothing happened. I also wish each car had a few more races and challenges. I feel like you get your car fully loaded, and then you have to move on to the next car. Some really challenging races utilizing the full gamut of upgrades would have been welcome. My biggest complaint is the upgrade system though. It drives me crazy that you can't upgrade your car by pausing the game, and the upgrade menu takes up the entire screen. The whole point of the system used is to make it fast, but mid-race it just makes you crash and burn. I just end up picking a configuration depending on the race and sticking to it. Lastly, where is the manual transmissions?!As far as syncing with the PS3, it's kind of incomplete. They allow your Speed Points, which allow you to unlock Most Wanted races, to carry over from system to system, to cross save. This sounds great in theory, but proves frustrating because your cars, customization, and other progress don't carry over with it. A true cross-save capability would have made this game a home run.Overall the game is a blast and a great buy. I haven't taken it out of my system since its release. I'll continue to play it and enjoy it, and hope a NFS Underground remake is in the works.PROS:Identical to console experience. I own both, and they're almost identicalBeautiful graphicsFast and frantic racingHuge variety of cars and race typesOpen world is fun - especially picking a fight with the copsFun, fast paced, and approachable - great for people looking for an awesome arcade racerIdeal type of game for the Vita - you can play for hours or minutes and it works just as wellCONS:Damage is purely cosmeticCar customization is way too shallowAs soon as you upgrade your cars to max stats, you don't have any races left with that carUpgrade system is really slick, unless you're racing when you need it most...Cross save capabilities (and lack thereof) only make you want more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

Raillard","summary":"Challenging, Beautiful and Original","reviewText":"I orginally thought this game would be like a Metal Gear Solid clone with better graphics.  To my delight, it has turned out to be better than MGS in every aspect.  What always annoyed me in the Metal Gear games (otherwise fine games) was 1)The cheesy, unrealistic storyline (how can it be realistic when you have to fight a boss character every stage, or when the villain is a big robot?) and 2)The weak enemy AI.Splinter Cell fixes both of these problems; the AI is very good (hard!) and less dense than in MGS, and more importantly, the game feels very, very real.  The backstory is very plausible and up with current events (terrorism), and the action mimics real life as closely as possible (ie: a single bullet to the head is always fatal; there are no bosses that require 208 hits to die).GRAPHICS: Amazing.  The best I've ever seen on a home system.  The atmospheric real time light effects are so beautiful I sometimes just look at them instead of playing.SOUND: Again, amazing.  Since much of this game is based on stealth, any sound you make can give you away.  This game is so in tune with that fact that your feet make different noise depending on the surface you are walking on (carpet, wood, metal, broken glass, etc).CONTROL: Very good, although at times the camera needs to be adjusted and at others the buttons don't respond as quickly as I'd like them too.  This is not a reflex based game, so it's a minor gripe.GAMEPLAY: Incredible.  This game is old-school hard, meaning that most of us will have to replay portions of a level multiple times to get through them.  It's never cheesy, though, and you can take different approaches to get by many situations).  Stealth is usually the best and most suspenseful; crouching in the dark with a single round of ammo left, hoping that a passing guard doesn't spot you is an amazing feeling.  The various gadgets (parabolic microphones, lock picks, fiberwire optics to peek under doors!) are great.Overall, I can't recommend this game enough.  It really redefines the stealth action genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2002"}

Wake is able to sleep again, but after he meets a mysterious woman, he begins to have terrible nightmares. As he puts these nightmares on paper for a new book, he soon notices that all the things that happen in his book are coming true right before his eyes.Using cinematic effects and technology such as real-time lighting, shadows and reflections, you'll be treated to a game that is oozing with atmosphere and able to invoke an emotional response from the player. The realistic environment features real-time weather and light changes that effect the game play for a remarkably immersive experience.Explore an Entire TownThe town of Bright Falls is 100 square kilometers, and players will be able to roam through this incredibly detailed area any way they like, roaming the town or wandering out to the lakes, forest, satellite towns, and more. The game gives the player goals, but how he chooses to go about completing them is up to him. Clues are scattered throughout the town, and solving mysteries will require players to pay close attention to the little details.Intense CombatIn addition to solving puzzles and exploration, the game also pushes players into serious action and combat; when night comes, creatures will take their best shots at Alan, and you'll have to be quick with strategy as well as weapons to beat them back.Alan Wake presents an unusual and new gaming experience that features a riveting, multi-layered story while giving the player the ability to freely roam a giant environment. It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Deer in head lights (surprised in a good way)","reviewText":"When I first caught wind of \"Alan Wake\" I was apprehensive. Aka many stated the story left more questions than answers or that \"nothing made sense\". I must have been on a different page on account most everything in the game was not only easy to understand for me but quite compelling to boot!I beat the game in a single gaming marathon but this was because I couldn't really put it down. Certain gamers have stated you can get through Alan Wake's campaign in 8 hours but because I went off the beaten path and took time to immerse myself in Bright Falls my journey was twice as long. As a matter of fact the rustic locales are so beautiful and filled with detail you're doing yourself a big disservice if you hurry to each check point at break neck speed.Story wise Alan Wake is about a writer taking a vacation with his wife Alice in order to tap into some inspiration. The poor guy hasn't had a single good idea in 2 years. This has put a strain on his career and his relationships. All to soon Alice ends up missing and the revelation dawns on Alan there are sinister supernatural forces at work in league with his wife's kidnappers. Along the way our beleaguered hero finds manuscript pages to a book he does not remember writing. Needless to say the opening \"episode\" pulls your leg. Nothing is quite as it seems but I rather have the game do the job of taking you down the rabbit-hole so I do not divulge too many spoilers.Alan Wake's most diverse element is fighting possessed towns-folk called \"The Taken\" with illumination. A flash light gradually burns away their shadowy auras leaving them vulnerable to gun fire. Additionally \"flare guns\" and \"flash bangs\" instantly incinerate targets into dispersing glowing cinders. Unlike other games that try to be suspenseful but fail Alan Wake is good at it. There are moments it's better to flee angry mobs and \"ammo\" never is over abundant. Alan's guns are realistic to what you would find in a small town. Aka you're stuck with a revolver,hunting rifle, and shot gun. Not many people in the boon-docks own rocket launchers and automatic smgs after all. Sadly there is no crack pot red-neck gun enthusiast around to \"bail you out\" when things get out of hand. Though certain gamers may find the lack of fire arm variety to be discouraging to me it adds authenticity to the setting. At its' heart AW is a suspense thriller adventure game and not an adrenaline pumped shooter. For those that desire the later I'd suggest looking into Gears of war 2 and Resident Evil 5.Many of the side characters are endearing. Barry of course is my favorite for his flamboyant way of dressing and non apologetic way of calling out Alan for being a jerk. It's often stated \"true friends\" tell you what you need to hear instead of what you want to hear and Barry fills that role delightfully. In addition you will come across two crazy old men who used to be Heavy Metal musicians, a wise yet scattered woman afraid of the dark whom has holed herself up near an electric power plant, an overly obsessed disturbing fan girl, a cute tom-boyish female sheriff with keys to every conceivable building on the grid, a sly and manipulative psychologist in charge of a therapeutic retreat for creative eccentrics, and a disgruntled FBI agent that takes the terms \"pushy\" and \"unreasonable\" to whole new levels. The supporting cast certainly isn't an area where Alan Wake is lacking!Each of the game's 6 chapters end & begin like a television series complete with fitting songs and a re-cap of previous events. This was a welcomed gimmick drawing me deeper in as did the farcical \"Night Springs\" clips found throughout the game that are a tribute to The Twilight Zone and a parody of AW itself. Obviously Remedy put a lot of love & hard work into their game and it shows in spades.However I do have a few gripes to get off my chest. The biggest complaint is Alan Wake wasn't at all scary for me. Possessed farm equipment, flocks of cawing birds, and angry men dressed in hard hats and hunting attire do not seem intimidating even when they're hell bent on killing me. Additionally this all has a pretentious vibe. Aka best selling wealthy author vs. the under-paid average Joe blue collar working class. I know this wasn't Remedy's intent but that's the contrast that was created. Concerning my lack of fear I'm not knocking the game for it too hard. Different things scare different people and likely my youth spent on an isolated mountain dulled my sensitivity to dark nights, over cast shadows, and weird noises coming from the bushes. If you \"are\" scared by small dirt pathways winding into a foreboding moonlit wilderness this game will mess with your head on many levels.Additionally there are parts that required driving which I thought were mostly unnecessary. In many instances you were doing the same thing in a car that you were doing on foot. Use head lights to weaken taken, push forward, and don't take too long looking back! Admittedly the first couple of \"joy rides\" are guilty pleasures but the section involving getting to Cauldron lake was a tedious chore in frustration. If Alan Wake had stayed a free roam sand box styled game the driving would have been welcomed but being that it plays out in \"episodes\" more akin to a linear novel it's not required as a means of getting around nearly as much.The \"dodge function\" is a mixed bag. In certain situations it works perfectly. The epic \"slow down footage\" of barely avoiding an axe chop or sickle blow is sublime. Yet there are moments it doesn't work when it should. You will take unfair hits no matter how well you master this mechanic. Silver lining? Well, this is a suspenseful horror game. If you could deflect or weave around each attack would there be any feeling of dreadful tension? Personally I enjoyed how relieved I felt making it to a check point without getting my skull cleaved in half! Those hair trigger \"I almost didn't make it\" situations are what defines Alan Wake as fun.Overall Alan Wake gave me much more than I thought it would. I wish I would not have listened so much to the naysayers on account this game is worth its' original retail price. Finland should be proud Remedy represents them in a flattering high regard concerning game design!Pros+ Wonderful story+ Even the supporting characters are interesting+ Alan Wake is portrayed as likable but flawed. Aka he can be a prick but that adds credibility to the flawed human condition.+For the most part the way Alan Wake handles is silky smooth. No, he's not empowered but he doesn't control akin to a tank either.+The environments are \"beautiful\". I cannot stress that enough. Whether you find yourself in a trailer park, forest, cabin, abandoned mining town, power plant, or junk yard the sheer amount of detail is amazing. Some people snarkily state you are just running around in the woods but that's because of the setting. I could say in GTA you're just running around in the city or in Dead Space you're just running around on a space-ship. Aka it's a pointless critique. A \"setting\" establishes certain rules concerning terrain types. A hodgepodge variety of overly flamboyant tacky land marks put in to be \"diverse\" would break Alan Wake's spell of eerie \"realism\" rather quickly.+ The music in the game is heart felt and gets you excited for the next episode.+ Though the game is very serious it also knows when to lighten up. Barry using Christmas lights to repel \"the taken\" was hilarious and the satirical similarities Night Springs has to Twilight Zone can make even a curmudgeon crack a wry smile!+ The gimmick of using light to weaken enemy defenses is incorporated seamlessly. Though it may seem awkward in concept it is graceful when put into actual practice!+No mind bending annoying puzzles+Voice acting is spot on.+Areas are very interactive. Aka you can climb ladders, run along fallen trees, jump across ravines, and even use spot lights to your advantage in a fight. This is also one of the few games of its' ilk in which there is just as much risk falling to your death over a cliff or being electrocuted as there is being killed by an enemy lynch mob.Cons-I understood the story crystal clear but other gamers have voiced being confused, confounded, and disappointed by the cliff hanger ending. Personally I loved the conclusion. I seem to be in the minority though.-I think the game itself would make a great book but the actual \"manuscripts\" Alan finds to his unwritten novel come off as dry, uninspired, and lacking in detail.- Driving parts are unnecessary on account AW is episodic instead of being a free roam sand box.-I have the inkling that if you could combine AW with Deadly Premonition it would be an unsurpassed master-piece for the ages. As it stands both games have that \"almost timeless classics but not quite\" air about them.-The facial animations with certain characters are a tad off but it really didn't bother me at all. When everything else is done so well things like these become trivial.- If you actually enjoy \"brain teasers\" ala Silent Hill 1,2,and 3 AW will disappoint you.-The dodge mechanics are dodgey. Nuff said. Still, it's a morbid delight to see an axe fly by your head and cleave off a few of your hairs in slow motion!-Though this is subjective I wasn't impressed with the enemy selection. If you're deathly afraid of construction workers, park rangers, deer hunters, birds, ornery bull-dozers that drive themselves, and possessed refrigerators you are welcomed to disagree with me!- It's good Alan is \"vulnerable\" and \"inexperienced at combat\" but I cannot really relate to a guy that lives in luxury, is a best selling author, and has card board cut-outs of himself plastered around town. One thing I enjoyed about Silent Hill was that the lead protagonists were non famous everyday people.- No extra modes beyond playing on harder difficultiesOverallYou would be right in noticing I gave AW as many cons as I did merits. Aka you may ask yourself \"Then why is this quack giving the game a perfect score?!\" My answer is that though I'm obligated to warn you of a game's faults to help you make a well informed decision this does not mirror how much or how little I enjoyed it personally.When I award AW \"5 out of 5\" it means the moment I got it I couldn't put it down thus its' imperfections were non consequential for me. In the technical department Remedy likewise excelled. The environments in Bright Falls are fun to explore, I encountered no glitches, the difficulty was challenging but not ridiculous, and the presentation value is astounding on all fronts. Whatever hiccups AW runs into are minor and not the least bit game breaking.On its' story alone I can recommend Wake as a great purchase. When responsive tight game physics and mostly smooth controls accompany a riveting narrative what's not to admire?Maybe there's a whiff of unoriginality on account Bright Falls borrows a tad from Stephen King, Twin Peaks, Lost, Twilight zone, and Outer limits but if you \"love\" those references it's a better reason to own this title. Even successful creative visionaries are inspired by the story tellers whom proceeded them. Nothing is new under the sun. It's how we deliver the punch line that counts!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Samuel Ray \"RPG Fan\"","summary":"A guided movie with a terrible plot","reviewText":"It's pretty. Nobody is going to doubt that. However, pretty is the only highlight of the game.The choices you are given are supposed to have impact on your ending, yet it seems as though the only real choice is near the end. Another problem is that events that are supposed to be tragic or shocking are spoiled by the game. How? The timeline bounces back and forth, from adult to child, in seemingly random order. While they try to make you concerned, it seems more like a collection of &#34;just move on, I'm tired of this scene&#34; moments. Play with friends and crack jokes, like about making people crazy or just not following the doctors that are directing you, it really passes the time in the tedious walking around scenes.The story itself isn't all that spectacular, and generally opinion is divided, but I found it difficult to connect to any character. The scripts were bland and the situations were very cliche and played out. I predicted most, if not all, of the events of the game while playing, and you will too unless you're blinded by the very well done graphics.As strange as it sounds, during most of the game I felt as though it could have just been a blu-ray movie, where you had to interact with your remote to move forward. After all, the parts where you do have &#34;full&#34; control feel tossed into the game and were slow and boring, and more often than not left you confused as to what it wanted you to do.My main complaint and praise is the movement/quick time events (which is essentially every activity in the game). If you play on &#34;I rarely play games&#34; it will show you which direction to move the right stick (though I messed up a lot and for some reason it counted as successful), but if you play on &#34;I play a lot of games,&#34; it doesn't show you and while you're supposed to guess, it's nearly impossible on your first or second playthrough. Jodie's movements aren't really clear through most of the events, but supposedly they are supposed to be (a situation where you think you should duck is really one where you should move right, and that makes her duck...). Luckily, you can mess up just about every encounter and not suffer many consequences. That's what the game is really: a guided movie with so-so endings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

Yes the menu/inventory system could be better. It's especially tedious and frustrating if you are trying to store items in a chest. For whatever weird reason, while your inventory is categorized, chests are not.That is my biggest gripe about the game in 42 hours played: Storing lots of items is a pain.Yes there are too few voice actors for a game of this size. Yes the guards all sound like Ahnold Shwazneger. Yes your Thane companions are irritating and their AI is lackluster. Yes the difficulty curve is uneven mob to mob. But in the end you won't care about any of these things because you'll be too busy having fun.I could go on to type up a 2000 word review listing all the good things - but it's been done by others. In short - just buy it. Look at all the negative reviews - vast majority is just people griping about Steam or accusing Skyrim of consolitis.

{"product_name":"B00005043P","description":"Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for Sega Genesis, no case","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Classic, but not the best","reviewText":"I actually played this game as part of the Sonic Mega Collection disc for the Nintendo Gamecube, but this was the one title that really elicited a strong reaction from me. As far as classic gaming goes, Sonic 3 is as much a keeper as its predecessors. It's also much better than most of the modern day 3-D sequels. But when you put Sonic 1, 2, and 3 side by side, Sonic 3 comes up short.Technically, the game is improved over Sonic 2. Much more colour, a smoother graphics engine, and niftier effects and animations. It's the kind of look thats obviously dated by todays standards, but still beautiful to look at. Where Sonic 3 comes up short is everywhere else. Music is only so-so. Levels are much longer than the previous games, taking almost 3 times as long to complete, but there's actually very few of them. Supposedly this and Sonic and Knuckles were originally 1 game, but hacked apart so Sega could make the release date. It shows, and the real Sonic 3 experience is when you lock-on with the Knuckles cartridge, which doubles the levels.But what really hurts Sonic 3 in my opinion is how the environmental hazards are placed. The subtle difference between the first two games and this one is that while the first two encouraged you to blaze through the levels at top speed, narrowly missing hazards, Sonic 3 changes the timing so that you *will* be hurt if you blaze through recklessly. See a long stretch? Better walk instead of run, because at the end of that stretch after you've collected all those rings, some cheap enemy will suddenly appear and take everything from you. It happened to me multiple times, and it really hurts the experience. For a game about speed, it doesn't encourage you to speed at all.Overall Sonic 3 is a classic Sega title, and its worth checking out either on the original Genesis or emulated on todays systems. It's just that the game's flaws are obvious when closely compared to the other two.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2005"}

Besides racing, you can also do battle mode. This is where you try to destroy your opponent with shells, bananas, etc. It's only for 2-4 players and sadly you can't play against the computer. There are also alot of characters to choose from (I think 16) and you can also choose which cart you drive. If you want power choose the huge carts or if you want speed choose the lighter carts.As for the gameplay, it's easy to get used to. The controller is just perfect for this game. The graphics are also good and better than the previous Mario Kart games. The music fits perfectly to this game and some remind you of the previous games. The challenge of this game is nothing. It's just so easy even if it's on hard (maybe because I play more challenging games) and you could easily beat it in one day.Overall, it's definitely worth your money and time. Even the whole family can enjoy such a wonderful and fun game. And for the price you can't complain.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2006"}

I'm fortunate to have a wife who loves gaming almost as much as me.  This means that a game without local co-op only gets played when my wife is napping.  Sacred 2 doesn't have intense non-stop in your face action, which is perfect for me.  I like a slower paced game that allows me to relax while playing.  The ambient sound is very relaxing too.  The sound of waterfalls, waves on the beach, wind blowing through the trees and birds chirping has lulled our baby to sleep on numerous occasions.  (Ok twice, the game's only been out 2 days ;)In all of the Lego games we enjoyed smashing stuff and collecting coins.  In Resident Evil 5 we really enjoyed looting crates and upgrading our weapons.  Sacred 2 is all about killing, looting and upgrading.  A perfect combination that we can't get enough of!While Sacred 2 may be perfect for me, it's not a perfect game.  I had to knock off 1 star for all of the minor \"nitpicky\" flaws.  I was unpleasantly surprised when I first popped the game in, that it was a top down third person perspective.  I was put off by this at first but I've grown used to it and being surrounded by enemies it's best to be zoomed out so you can see everything.  There are minor frame rate drops and occasional pop-in and screen tearing, but for me it's not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the game.  There are other glitches where an enemy will be stuck in the ground, or won't take any damage.  Reloading the area (by entering and exiting a cave) always solves this problem.  Plus with a game this time consuming it's much more likely to come across glitches here and there.My only other complaint with this game is that you cannot pause the action.  I can understand this when you're playing online co-op, but when playing offline, there should be a pause feature.  The only thing you can do when you need to pause is save and hope you don't die, or run to the nearest town (where you're usually safe) and set the controller down.  (side note: if anyone has found a way to pause this game please post in the comments section)If you read any of the scathing professional reviews it's important to understand the terminology:1) Breaking the fourth wall:  This is when a character acknowledges the audience.  It comes from theater where a set on the stage will have 3 walls and there's an invisible 4th wall between the cast and the audience.  One memorable quote from Sacred 2 is when a bad guy dies and says, \"I knew I was just an extra.\"2) Loot Grind:  This is a descriptor for this type of game.  You basically hunt down loot from bad guys and dungeons, while you grind through leveling up.3) Diablo Clone:  Apparently Diablo was the first to perfect the \"loot grind\" (never played it myself) and many games including Sacred 2 have tried to mimic this formula.Another thing to note when reading professional reviews is that the PC released several months before the console versions, and was quite buggy.  The Xbox 360 version has fixed all of these bugs (as far as I know) and yet still gets worse reviews than the PC.So if you know nothing else about the game, you start off with a choice of 6 character classes.  You then have a choice of light or dark campaign and a choice of which god to worship (this essentially gives you a really powerful \"divine gift\" or magic spell).  You have character specific missions, main quest missions and side quests.On your face buttons you can equip magic and weapons, and can bring up a second and third set by pulling the left and right triggers.  Your divine gift is permanently assigned to up on the d-pad and you can assign potions to the other 3 directions on your d-pad.In combat it seems you hold down the button to repeat the same move on an enemy.  You can switch enemies with the left analog stick.  You can assign your combat arts (magic) to combos so you can use 2 spells at once.In local and online co-op you can bring YOUR character with all of YOUR armor, weapons and skills to a friend's game.  (Unlike Fable 2 where you were just a henchman)  When you join someone else's game you take all of your experience and loot back to your personal game, but the completed quests do not carry over.Bottom line: if you're able to get past this game's quirks it's a very enjoyable co-op, action, adventure, rpg, Diablo clone, loot grind that breaks the fourth wall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2009"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

The open world is sort of open, as the game progresses more of it is unlocked. The gritty world affects are very good and it makes a good use of lighting design. The game feels pretty linear but at the same time, there are different ways of defeating the bad guys, and there are xp points to upgrade Cole's powers. That's somewhat the equivalent of buying better guns in a mission based game setup, but Cole is able to do superhuman hero stuff instead. The game also doesn't set you far from where you are if you were to die, either.The bad parts is the missions feel tedious after a while, and the sidequests are not fun, either. The story could use some work, it's not as riveting as it could have been. Have you played this type of game before? Probably. Think of Assasin's Creed without the stealth mode while jumping along rooftops, turning on switches for electricity to power up things. This game is fun for a single player experience but there really is no depth to it or ability to expand the game unlike GTA with DLC's.The mechanics of the game are fine tuned, the environment looks good with a lot of detail like neon signs and buildings feel and look different. This is a good single player game because the controls are great and it looks good, but it's just not very exciting once a week passes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"On the fence with this one","reviewText":"I typically am a FPS guy, but I LOVE MARVEL. One of my favorite games of this generation is MUA. I've played through it about 6 times and unlocked and collected every possible item. MUA had tremendous variety as it followed a story created specifically for the game that allowed to introduce a hodge podge of characters in different locals.I had super high expectations for MUA2. I can't say that I'm dissapointed, but I don't think it's as good as it's predecessor.I'll start with the presentation. The characters look great. The specialty \"fusion\" moves also look awesome and allow for some moments that will remind you of battles straight out of the comics. The environments on the other hand are really bland. The nature of the game, a level grinder, means you have to see a lot of the same enemies. MUA had you traversing all over the Marvel universe, so each level had a fresh look. You can't really plan on battles in space when most of the story takes place in an urban environment. The cut scenes are okay. Some are terrible, some are pretty cool, nothing on par with Square Enix to drop your jaw.The gameplay is similar to MUA with the exception of the commands and fusion moves. You can no longer direct your heroes into battle, which means they do a lot of following you around. I can't remember a teamate disabling a shield or taking the initiative to attack enemies that were surrounding me. At times they were practically useless. I played through twice, once on casual (easy) with my yongest son and once on difficult. On the higher difficulty level, there were times I wanted to chuck my controller because the teamates stood around and watched me die. Another new touch that I like is being able to swap squadmembers on the fly. As long as they are not dead, you can switch out, so if you really want Storm and Iceman's fusion for a paticular level, put them in. If heavy hitters are working, grab Luke Cage and Thing. Several characters are locked throughout depending on wich side you choose, so playing through twice is a must. That really adds to the replay value because you do get some differnt boss battle and looks at the levels.I didn't play online, but I did play with 3 players at home. Although it was easier having human teamates, there are times where it is nearly impossible to tell where your character is. Perhaps the game deserves credit for truly epic battles, but some of the boss battles are very dissorienting. The camera also doesn't pan far enough back and will warp you, a la Nightcrawler, to your squad. Unfortunately it will leave you open to attack or move you away from a supervillian you may have been attacking. Very frustrating.I was also dissapointed in the unlockables. The number of characters is smaller. The are fewer costumes to unlock and they are purely cosmetic this time around. I've read the articles on IGN regarding the mountains of NPC's in the game (Non Playable Characters). In MUA, if you ran into someone, chances were pretty good that you were going not just going to play them, but unlock and upgrading two or more costumes with differnt abilities. Not so this time around. Obviously there are plans for downloadable content. The great thing about MUA2 is that it is REALLY fun. If Activision decides to release episodic DLC, MUA2 could have a long life span. Who wouldn't want to play Secret Invasion or World War Hulk? The game engine is there to make it happen. If it ends up being ten or fifteen dollars for a costume pack or three bucks for a new character, MUA2 will find its way to the shelf.Ultimately, MUA2 is missing the variety, upgrading and customization of MUA. It feels like it took a step back away from RPG territory and more into brawler territory. It is a lot of fun to play, if not more stripped down. The DLC will end up being the key to how good MUA2 ends up being.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2009"}

Besides the overheating troubles, there is not a must-play game scheduled for release until possibly Far Cry in late March.  After that, the next wave of decent looking games are going to be released in September!  My advice is to save your money and wait until more (and better) games are available.

Recently, a batch of great SRPG games came out, Jeanne D'Arc, FF Tactics, Disgaea on the PSP, all 3 had it's specialty.Fire Emblem - Don't see what all the hype and rave reviews are about.  After just 1 week, I've already put this down to play Disgaea, it's far more fun.Characters - too many, so many that you do not feel attached to them, and many of them are unbalanced.  Which means some are crucial to the gameplay, some it's better to just leave them or let them die.Customization - There is none, each character has specific powers.  You select a weapon, but there is nothing else you can customize, no armor, nothing.  Yes, there is the relationship build up and skill, but it's stil lacking.Story itself - This is not bad, it's worth taking the time to read thru the text.  Though by this generation systems, you expect a little more graphical power or design flair, it's a tad bit boring presentation.How to generate funds / bonus items -  It's done thru fixed talks with NPCs.  There's no point to read thru those text, just click + and skip to the end and receive the funds or item.  IMHO, this is done poorly.Gameplay - Some characters are absolutely critital if you want to advance thru the harder levels.  It's easy to get killed, and I think most of us would like to keep all charactere alive.  To do so, you will need to reload the game A LOT.  Here's the problem, there is NO LOAD GAME option, you have to quit to Wii menu and start over.  This alone makes the whole process painful.Overall - If this game came out at the beginning of the year where there was absolutly no SRPG games, then it would be a solid 5 star.  Just in these few month, you get 3 awesome tactics games:  Jeanne D'Arc, FF Tactics, Disgaea, Fire Emblem just doesn't hold it's own.  If you don't have a PSP and love SRPGs, then Fire Emblem is the definitely a good choice and only choice.  For sure I'll play it later when the SRPG games dry up, but for now, Disgaea is a far more fun.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2007"}

His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items.

I started with MW2. It's a good game. Then to MW1. Now to black ops.Black Ops is developed by a different developer than the modern warfare series. I'm not really aware of any other major game franchise that pulls off something like this, having two different devs working on the same IP. The differences are subtle. Infinity Ward is more serious and somber while this game is laugh-out-loud funny. IW tends to have lousy briefings but really impressive in-game moments. Treyarch (the devs of this game) seems to place more emphasis on the writing and characters than IW. The level design isn't quite as inventive and the scripted moments are not as awe-inspiring.So, in Black Ops I found myself caring more about the plot and story compared to MW, while I was less impressed with the events that happened in the missions. When you die in MW, you get treated to a quote from a serious world leader or intellectual. In Black Ops, the missions start with this comical blacking out of information, making it literally a \"black op.\"I tend to play games like these as RPG's, in that I pretend that I'm actually in the setting. So it's an interesting tradeoff. I would recommend going in the order I played, since what gets you at first in gaming are the in-game moments. Later on as the game formula becomes apparent, having good characters starts to matter more.This is one of the best story-driven game narratives I've ever played. I'd rank this as better than any Bioware game, even. There's a really cool Forrest Gump feeling you get playing the game, due to the retro setting. The characters are amazingly charismatic. To convince, just let me mention that one of the voice actors is none other than Gary Oldman.Another nice thing about COD games is that you never feel alone while playing the game. You always have an AI friend guiding you through the mission and yelling encouragement.I believe that this game has enough serious literary merit that it will be revisited in years to come like a classic novel.So yes, the SP is pretty incredible. That alone is worth the purchase.Now, as for the sequel, well, skip it. The sequel has some impressive moments, but is missing a lot of the playful spirit of this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2013"}

Wagstaff \"kirkwuk\"","summary":"Beauty in the eye of the beholder","reviewText":"I admit during my first play-through of Dishonoured I felt slightly less than entertained. To someone used to modern first-person games, the charm of Bethesda's 2012 release Dishonoured does tend to swoop over heads, myself included in that matter. Maybe I was just ignorant, maybe I am formularised to only enjoy the carbon copy games. This deserves a second play-through, the one I enjoyed most, where I realised how special and rare this game is.You play Corvo, a bodyguard who is truly that of the games title; framed for murder of a figurehead in a huge governmental cover-up. Corvo attempts to uncover the mystery of why he was framed, setting out to prove his innocence and expose others in a world which is comprised of the future-industrialisation of Half Life 2, mixed with Thief's quasi-medieval city setting. Disease is rife in the form of the plague, as well as the supernatural; power granted to Corvo enables him to teleport to any position he wishes in the near vicinity. Other magic allows possession of living creatures (including humans), abilities to see through walls, and stop time.Dishonoured truly shines in moments of realisation that this world is a living, breathing entity; the levels present themselves as thriving with artificial life. The huge, sparse environments contain a feeling of depth and warmth (and sometimes isolation), that many games struggle to reach or even attempt. NPC's talk to each other, stories are told, secrets can be eavesdropped - everything feels \"real\". Stealth is promoted at every turn, players are penalised for killing and are always encouraged to \"ghost\" - the act of manoeuvring the levels unseen and remaining undetected. You are even penalised for completing cadaveric mission objectives, so alternatives should be considered. This makes sense since our mute character can prove killing is not in his nature, which by default underlines his innocence of the murder charge made against him.It borrows heavily from Thief: The Dark Project, even referencing it in \"easter eggs\" - but Dishonoured has its own style and unique setting which allows you to forgive the developers and separate it entirely from Looking Glass Studio's classic title of 1998.The third mission, House Of Pleasure, is probably my favourite mission of any game in recent years. It uses the same environment as a previous mission but takes place in the day, with added exploration opportunities such as hotels, a dock, and a massive mansion. Initially levels may appear small, but explore a little and you discover an awful lot. The attention to detail and the depth in not only present in the mission structure, but also the text in the form of books and letters in the many homes you raid. The characters in the game are interesting and act humanely. There is plenty of urban settings contrasting with domestication. The atmosphere Dishonoured builds is like a rollercoaster. This can be at times tense, then others sinister, then on finishing a mission, back to the calm of your seaside village. The thought of returning to your cosy retreat in the Fox And Hound makes you feel all fuzzy.Dishonoured is a rare treat, and looks simplistic yet effective in both style and immersion.  It's a game which proves beauty is in the eye of the beholder.9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

David Swan","summary":"Spectacular But Not Perfect","reviewText":"Mario Galaxy 2 is currently the third highest rated game ever on gamerankings falling directly behind the first Mario Galaxy. Gamerankings uses an aggregate score drawn from dozens of professional online and print reviews across the industry. It's pretty staggering to think that after over three decades of video games Mario Galaxy 2 is the third best reviewed game OF ALL TIME. This is most definitely, without a doubt, a five star game but is it perfection as IGN would imply with its extraordinarily rare bestowing of a 10 out of 10 score? In fact it's not perfect and I will focus on the few areas where it falls short of expectations.Despite its stellar reviews Mario Galaxy 2 is not my all time favorite Mario game, that would be the hugely underrated Mario Sunshine and it wouldn't even be my favorite Mario game of the past year, which would be New Super Mario for the Wii. Mario Sunshine was groundbreaking in its use of water physics and even the underwhelming Luigi's Haunted House was pretty amazing in it's handling of light and fabric physics. At the time I was pretty excited that Nintendo was pushing the envelope with its simulation of real world physics but since then not much has happened. New Super Mario did some pretty amazing stuff for a side scrolling platformer but about the only thing Mario Galaxy explores are the physics of gravity but in this case they're purposely all wrong. Even if I were to accept that these tiny planetoids possessed super dense gravity causing them to be somewhat equal to the gravity of the mushroom kingdom how would the gravity of a cylinder cause Mario to revolve around it like a satellite. The water physics in the game haven't really advanced since Mario Sunshine and the use of light is very sparing. All in all Mario Galaxy 2 is pretty much a rehash of the first Mario Galaxy and explores few new areas and no, I don't really consider any of the new Mario suits revolutionary.The first 3D platformer that really blew me away when it came to level design (besides that granddaddy of them all, Mario 64) was Banjo-Kazooie. I can still distinctly remember many of the levels twelve years later. Never before had I experienced a game where I truly felt the depth of vision and when I climbed a tall structure and look down it was exhilarating. Mario Sunshine took this concept of height and depth and added in beauty. Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 continue to add polish to the series but particularly with number 2 the level design just weren't very memorable. Sometimes it isn't the amount of polish that makes a level memorable, sometimes it's the intangibles. Mario Galaxy 2 contains around 50 levels and most have two or three shines to collect which for me meant I could blow through most levels very quickly. In fact I plowed through the game much faster than any Mario game I've played in the last decade or so and having completed the game less than a week ago none of the levels stand out in my brain. Mario Sunshine burned them into my brain because of repeated playing and because many were very creatively designed. My point is it felt like Mario Galaxy 2 chose quantity over quality. I would have preferred 10 spectacular, mind blowing levels over 50 very good levels errr... galaxies.I would never want to imply that Mario Galaxy 2 is anything less than a spectacular game that should be in every Wii owners' library. It is a magnificent platformer and a proud addition to the Mario franchise. It just doesn't move the franchise forward more than an inch beyond the first Mario Galaxy. One thing I would love to see is a real high quality game like Mario Galaxy on the 3DS because it's always a little difficult moving precisely in a 3 dimension world when you have no real depth perception particularly when stomping on enemies. True 3D would really be the end all be all of Mario games. Don't hesitate to pick up MG2 but in my opinion it falls short of the stratospheric reviews heaped upon it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2010"}

The achievement system is ingenious and would make me purchase the 360 version of a game every time over another version. The design of the hardware is nice and the controller feels good in hand. The games at this point in the life cycle are pretty nice and I see the 360 making it really hard for PS3 to win this generation at this still early stage (I am not biased and just care about the games not the system. It will take some major exclusives for the PS3 to catch up with the late start.)The problems though are significant. Many of my friends that own 360's have had considerable problems with hardware failure. Mine has worked since I bought it, but never right. I always have to power up and down 3+ times (sometimes 5) for the system to actually boot fully and I am finally getting around to sending it back to MS and had to jump through a bunch of hoops to get it done (I extended the warranty through MS). One of my friends, having luckily purchased BestBuy protection, has had 3 different systems and he didn't get his until recently. I have never had or heard problems like this before and I am typically an early adapter. I am also not cool with the XBOX live trickle content for pay thing which I can only see getting worse. The games come out shafted for content only to see the developer and MS extort you for more tidbits of content while you are already paying for the service. I think this will cause the games to get more and more shallow on original purchase content while costing the same or more. Do I want to end up pying $100 for the game plus all of the content? I sure hope not.Overall, I think the 360 is a great system, but they need to iron out the hardware kinks better (especially after being out for more than a year) and make sure game content doesn't suffer for pay for play on XBOX Live.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2007"}

Where action and dialogue choices define the story as it plays out.  If that is what you are after too?  Then I am positive you will enjoy this game too.  There are many deep fundamental choices that change what missions you are on immediately and even later on in the story.There are some minor bugs and graphic problems but the fell far short from hurting how much I love this game.  That is they failed to impact actual gameplay for me.

However, it does much more....it works on both PC's and MAC's without any additional software installs.  And now for the review:Box Includes:Logitech Microphone2 AA Batteries (Thank you Logitech)Two nylon hand straps. (use if you need them)A base with a usb cable that attaches to your console/computer (essentialy the receiver and a stand for the mic).Manuals (which I didn't even need to use to get started, but did read to see if I was missing anything.)Xbox360:**Note, couldn't test on a real game on PS3 since we don't have one, but device was recognized and usable.XBOX 360:  We have rock band for the 360 and my son is an addict when it comes to drumming, guitar strumming etc...he has his sister do the singing via a Logitech wired usb MIC made for the 360.  Naturally the wireless model was a welcome change and has a bit more of a professional MIC look and feel.  Off they went, tearing the roof off of our home and in the end it seemed that the performance of the microphone was on par with a wired model.  In other words their scores were the same....the voice recognition worked as it should in Rockband.Unfortunately we do not have any other games that can use a MIC, currently...but RockBand is pretty popular around here.PC/MAC - I am a cross platform user and naturally anything with a USB port has to be tested on my computers...I mean that's what a USB port is for, isn't it?  So first I plugged the MIC in to my Windows 7 x64 machine and the drivers installed on their own.  I went to the audio section and made sure the MIC was listed, which it was...as a Logitech USB Microphone.  I did the usual tests of blowing in the mic, whistling, etc...perfect.  More on the test below.  Once I was satisfied with the PC I plugged the MIC into my Macbook Pro and voila, detected and installed without issue..same series of tests through the system preferences/sound icon.  I am now a happy camper...but I only use a mic on my computers for Skype...so it was time to give it the ultimate test.I made three lengthy phone calls and clearly explained to the other party that I was testing a wireless MIC and that I would be moving away from my computer at regular intervals. (2 of the 3 calls were on a PC and 1 on the MAC).  I basically moved away from the computer at 2ft intervals for a total about 20' and clearly into another room.  The callers actually said the voice quality was perfect, in-fact there was no loss in clarity and or volume at any distance.  I could get very detailed here...but the summary is that it does work and it works flawlessly.  Naturally walking 20ft away from a computer for a phone call is strange since you have to turn the speakers up to hear the other party.(**The MIC does have a push button on it that acts to power on the device and power it off.  It can also be used to pair the mic to the base station should they ever lose connectivity)Logitech has another stellar product on their hands, and I would not expect it to be any other way.  I will be updating the review to inform you of real world battery life.  But for the time being this MIC gets a 5/5 in my book for the look, the feel, and the over all quality and compatibility that it offers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2009"}

Most MMO`s that I have tried at release usually disapointed me and usually quit within the first month. When rift was released I was amazed at how well polished this game was. You can tell the Devs had put alot of love into this game. While no game esp MMO`s arent perfect the devs / trion really seem to care about making a product that people will like. Rift may not be for everyone but I would highly recomend to atleast try the game before trash talking the game as would some WOW fan boys / girls would do.Here are some of the things that I like about Rift.1. there is no cookie cutter spec`s in this game and plenty of room to experiment on what you want to play.2. I think personally that the quests are fun, some may not like them but questing isnt for everyone i actually like to level toons its what i like about mmo`s.3. the community seems too be less hostile and more friendly than some mmo`s esp WOW.4. the devs are constantly trying to improve the game.5. there is always an event going on and there is some nice things that you can get from them.6. there arent many bugs in this game and trion / the devs try to squash them quickly.7. less down time for maint unlike some mmo`s like wow for example.8. the avitars do not look overy cartoonish and look like a more modern game unlike WOW.9. A coin lock feature that locks your account, if a hacker tries to hack your account saving you. since it was implemented i rarelly see any one complaining about their accounts being hacked any more.and its simple too unlock it by simply visiting your own email and typing in the code they send you.All in all i find rift enjoyable, some may not but like all things you cant really say you trully hate something unless you try it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2011"}

It shows.I was offended by the grainy resolution of multiplayer.  I later learned that the screen goes fuzzywhen an EMP is detonated.  At first, I just thought it was bad graphics, because the grain effect isn't much differentthan normal play.  The most playable part of the game is survival mode.  As a noob, just practice running around the map,letting the bad guys come to you, and drop a preditor on an attack chopper.  When you get better, find a roof orcorner where the evil army can only come at you from two points.  Learn how to use claymores and grenade launchersto survive.  Multiplayer lobbies are VERY hit or miss.  I have fun when I feel that it's possible to shoot the enemy.Deathstreaks are no fun.  I often feel that people use hacks in the game, because players can see you through wallsand have sticky aim.  I'm aware that high ranking players have access to pocket radar, but I doubt it's as effectiveas hacking the game.  Connection issues in MP are minor, but noticable.  Unlike Blk Ops, you never lose stats.The best graphics in MW3 are in the campaign.  The campaign gameplay feels fresh, but not overly exciting.The special ops missions can be fun, tedious or punishing.  There's great variety in missions.  The 16 base maps also varyin appearance and playability.  Some maps have open areas, tight corridoors, passages, multi layering and one has aninteractive death machine.  If you love shooters, you'll find at least one way to enjoy MW3.  It seems alot of peopleare dissapointed with the game due to subpar graphics, lag and non-overpowering quick sniping.

{"product_name":"B00027CXEM","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Impressive, but hamstrung by LucasArts' rushed release schedule","reviewText":"Knights of the Old Republic II is to its predecessor what The Empire Strikes Back is to A New Hope: the grittier, more brooding and more philosophical sequel with a dark, ambiguous conclusion. However, it doesn't match Empire's primary achievement - of being a sequel superior to the original - for various reasons.Knights of the Old Republic II's biggest problem is the incredible vagueness of the story at the start of the game. KotOR I put you in a big city with lots of options and quests to do right off the bat and plenty of characters and politics to interact with. KotOR II instead has you exploring a space station pressing buttons for what feels like ages (it's actually about an hour and a half of fairly tedious running around) and you're not really given a reason for doing so. Your character is also curiously unwilling to ask questions of the strange old woman, Kreia, who has appeared out of nowhere to mentor you. It's about halfway through the game before you can even ask if she's a Jedi, which is the question I wanted to ask about two minutes after meeting her.Once the oddball opening sequence is dispensed with, you find yourself on Citadel Station orbiting Telos, and the more familiar playing style of the first game kicks in. From here you have lots of quests and sub-quests to pursue, different factions to ally with or play off against one another and several characters you can recruit to your party. The relationship between your character and Kreia also develops impressively, as Kreia has adopted a philosophical relationship with the Force which is fairly unusual and complex, going beyond the simplistic Light Side = Good, Dark Side = Bad notions of George Lucas and some of the less thoughtful other Star Wars writers. This gives rise to some fascinating conversations and some excellent dialogue. The game's main designer, Chris Avellone, was also the creator of possibly the greatest computer roleplaying game ever made, Planescape: Torment, and KotOR II covers some of the same ground as that earlier game. Avellone has a good claim to being the best writer of dialogue for computer RPGs around at the moment, and examples of that can be found throughout KotOR II.It's an interesting approach and KotOR II does have a pretty unique atmosphere and feel to it. Lightsabres and the Force aside, its dark story about challenging moral simplicity and questioning identity feels like it's come from some other universe altogether. This is also possibly the game's downfall: Empire Strikes Back may have been an altogether more sophisticated take on Star Wars than the first movie but it still retained the core humour and warmth of the character relationships and still 'felt' like Star Wars. Matt Stover's novel Traitor, often heralded as another successful 'dark' take on Star Wars, also succeeds in retaining that core identity despite going to places George Lucas would be very uncomfortable with. KotOR II often fails to uphold that identity, and its coldness and lack of humour sometimes makes it hard going, especially compared to the manner in which KotOR I nailed those elements so successfully.A major success of KotOR II is how it handles your party. In the first game it was possible to simply keep picking the first two NPCs you meet at the start of the game and take them through the whole game, missing out on the storylines of the other members of party. Whilst it is broadly possible to do this in the sequel, there are several quests which take place simultaneously, so you have to pick a second party from your character pool and have them doing stuff at the same time as your 'star party' is on a mission, which is an interesting and refreshing approach that gets as much of the plot as possible on screen and really gets the characters across in a stronger manner.Unfortunately, this is slightly problematic as the NPCs in the second game are not quite as interesting as those in the first. They are fairly low-key in personality and the fact that they are a pretty depressed and brooding bunch who have often committed horrible crimes makes empathising with them hard.Nevertheless, the game's story unfolds in a consistently intriguing manner, with enough mystery and plot development to drag you through its bumps. The game skirts against true masterpiece status a few times towards the end of the game through an impressively-executed plot twist (although not on the level of the central twist in the first game), but then things start falling apart again towards the end. This time the problems have a straightforward explanation: LucasArts wanted the game released for Christmas 2004 no matter what, and denied Obsidian the extra time needed to finish the game off properly. The result is that the game is incomplete. The designers managed to do enough to tie off the primary storyline at least, so that tracks coherently, but several quests are simply not solvable and most of your NPC allies' individual character arcs are left hanging in mid-air, with a cheesy dialogue exchange at the end of the game explaining the fates of the other characters. Two characters (well, sort of) are left in a life-or-death situation that is simply never resolved, and another character's solo quest is not implemented in the game at all. This means the end of the game is extremely abrupt with many loose ends left dangling. Obsidian made a heroic effort to solve some of these problems through post-release patches, but LucasArts denied them the funding to actually finish the game through a content expansion.As a result, what could have been (despite its lame opening) a five-star game and another classic is left wounded and broken. It's actually a tribute to the team at Obsidian that the game remains playable and compelling despite this significant problem. A mod team have been working for some time on restoring and completing the abandoned content (made possible thanks to Obsidian cheekily putting all the half-finished stuff on the game CD-ROMs for this specific purpose) which could immensely improve the game, but no release date has been set for this so far.Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords (****) is a fascinating, compelling and altogether different take on Star Wars. It is intelligent, philosophical and refreshingly well-written for a computer game, although it doesn't skimp on the action and combat sequences either. However, a dull opening sequence and the incomplete content does leave the game feeling distinctly unfulfilling, especially compared to its near-flawlessly-executed forebear.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

I brought the Enhanced Version as I didn't know that there was a Director's Cut that followed it. Anyway, I installed it and downloaded and installed the 1.5 patch and the Director's Cut patch and it cranked right up and ran without a problem. (My System: Win 7 32-bit; P4 3.0 gig CPU; HIS HD-4570 1-gig RAM Video Card; SB Audigy Sound card with 5.1 Speakers.) My first problem was no Xbox 360 support, but that was a minor thing, as the game has two ways you can use your mouse and mouse and KB together. (I chose mouse mainly as I use the mouse with my left hand and most games seem to want a right handed mouse.) Anyway, this choice turned out to work out really well. The control on this game is really a bit better than the second but I liked the &#34;feel&#34; of the second Witcher better.  Running the action with a mouse instead of a gamepad is a bit harder for me. The one thing I didn't like was I didn't have enough time to get used to the world before I was thrust into a battle. In the second Witcher, you have a long tutorial before you are engaged into the story. I like this in my games as it give the player a chance to &#34;get use to the world&#34; sort of speak.

I have been sitting down and playing my fair share of video games from NES, to X-box 360 so I can get some reviews out there. Anyway with this game, I think it offers a lot to the gamer especially if you liked the first game, There are a few flaws so let's get right into this game.Presentation..I think this department is pretty bad I think. I mean the graphics are pretty good and offer a lot of new scenes and such like snowy conditions and such but it looks as choppy as the other game, I mean there are a few times where I cam across other people in the game that all look the same like the exact same person as I was just standing next too, I mean common you are making a game as big as Call of Duty and you can't add some new faces.. Other then that the audio is pretty good and the over look is alright, really looks like the same as Call of Duty 4. 3/5Graphics...This is yet another department that lacks, I mean it is really cool that when you shoot a sniper from a far away spot you see blood like fly around and such which is awesome, or when playing through the campaign you will see blood on the floor and such, but when you are right next to someone and shoot them in the head with a pistol there is no blood just what looks like sweat, common it is 2010 I'm sure you can put blood in the game. Other then that the feel and overall look of the different missions and levels look pretty good. 4/5Audio/Sound...This is pretty good, I mean there really isn't much to listen to, just the sound of explosions and gun shots which are all pretty good. They have some of the same characters from the first game back for another round so that is pretty good, Other then that all the other sounds are spot on and such, not much to say here. 5/5Game play...The game play is pretty good, it follows the same controller configuration from the first game so no complaints there, plus there are a few new things you can do for multiplayer that is, From choosing your own icon, and pictures for your name, and plus you can customize your kill streak rewards and such, that is a nice little thing to have I think. Overall the game play is good and easy to get used to if you are a first time player.. 5/5Story...The story does a good job of picking up right where the first game left off. In fact there is a nice little video montage in the beginning which recaps what happened in the last game which is good for anyone who forgot what happened. Now in my opinion I didn't like the first campaign in the first game so this one had a lot to do too sway my mind and if really didn't. I didn't like it. I thought it switched from one person to another way too much and I thought a lot of the missions were just overused and over done too much. Anyway the campaign is playable and you will find a few parts that leave your breathless... 3/5The Wrap Up....Well this game is alright considering it came fresh off the heels of the first game. I still think there are a few things that they can do to make it a little better like I stated above in the comments. Other then that this is a game that is basically used for multiplayer which is the best part of the game I think. Anyway if you liked Call of Duty 4 then I am sure you will like this one and pick it up. My final score for this game would have to be 3.5/5 Keep on checking here for more reviews in the future...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}

It was amazing.  I was hooked even before I had left the first area of the facility.  It was a mood and a style of play that needs to be experienced.Now comes RE Zero.  For the first time you can actually have 2 usable, working charactors on the same screen, something no doubt that many players of the other games wondered about.  This fact alone greatly increases the fun off the game...and the annoyance level.  Nothing is worse than getting a player trapped in a room because he or she is being eaten on.  It is difficult of not impossible to bypass tough enemies with both players at once.  And oft times, the shotgun armed charactor will shoot a leech on the ground, wasting a precious shot unless watched.These gripes aside, you will find that the possibilities of play with two charactors are endless or nearly so.  Boss battles take on a whole new ideal thanks to the ability to quickly change perspectives.  Puzzles are now even a little fresher due to the need to use both charactors.But this is still RE, the game many love to hate.  A friend of mine was watching me play and asked politely,\" how do you know theres a zombie on the screen?  How do you know you are hitting him?\"  This is a common problem of the game.  To fully build the ideal of a scary movie, most areas are broken into set scenes.  This means that unless your in the same scene as the enemy, you'll be unable to see him.  A normal experience for the vetran but a terrifying one for newbies.Finally, there has been a lot of general marryment over the completion of the story.  This is Zero, the first RE.  But I felt things were just a little dis-jointed in comparison to the origional.  By my thinking, Rebecca should have been leading Chris around the mansion after experienceing all she did.  Just a few small things.So buy it if you like RE, think carefully if you passingly like the idea, stay away if you prefer killing in first or 3rd person.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2003"}

This game has Dreamcast style visuals, which I actually completely welcome, because I grew up with the Dreamcast, in fact, that was I was introduced to RPGs, as my first one was pretty much Evolution, and I also played the PS2 port of Grandia II. If you want a game that lifts you off of the real world, it will be this one! The soundtrack of this game fits with its perspective locations and is beautiful. Grinding is great in this game as it does not take that long to level up, and the in-battle controls do not take that long to grasp, and the story is very entertaining with events that naturally correspond with the storyline. This game easily has some of the most beautiful fantasy environments I have ever seen, and the characters are completely full with personality, and they change quite a bit throughout the course of the game. I'd wager that probably one of the complaints of this game that I could see that others may have could be the combat style.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A great concept gets ruined","reviewText":"On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"What...happened here?","reviewText":"Gosh...I feel like I jinxed Nintendo with mySuper Mario 3D Landreview. I stated that every time Nintendo makes a Mario game, it turns out to bepure gold(no pun intended). New Super Mario Bros 2 is a sequel to the2006 smash hit that revived classic Mario action on the DS. However, I can't tolerate the fact that it doesn't offer new music, graphics, or even different environments anymore. New Super Mario Bros Wii differed from NSMB enough to be worthy of a sequel. NSMB2 isn't.New Super Mario Bros 2, like I just said, lifts the same environments, graphics, and music fromNew Super Mario Bros. Wii. That said, the territory sure is rather familiar, considering the fact that I've seen these same grasslands, deserts, icelands, and lava areas for three games in a row in the same series. The objects are also mostly the same. We've got the average enemies (Now with skeletal Piranha Plants???), the average obstacles, and the average Red Coin Ring.Although the lack of originality is astounding, the level design is still brilliant (for the most part), and that alone is why I gave the game 3 stars. The classic Super Mario gameplay is intact and plays as well as ever. If you don't consider the coin-collecting Goomba-stomping platforming fun to be a winning formula, then you are just plain heartless. And although the Racoon Leaf, the Mega Mushroom, and Reznor boss fights are techincally rehashes, their inclusions in NSMB2 are welcome.But now comes another problem with the game: The coin-grubbing gimmick it promotes. I know, I know. Everyone loves collecting coins in the Mario games, but Nintendo took this WAY too far. Coins are EVERYWHERE you go, and there are even new power-ups specifically designed to give Wario a run for his money! A block that Mario wears on his head spews coins as he runs, a new type of Fire Flower turns crap into coins, and there's also a power that gives the enemies a golden makeover.You'd think this would make for an awesome new premise if done correctly. Unfortunately, it WASN'T done correctly. Apparently this time around, Nintendo didn't look too much into the fact that collecting 100 coins rewards you with a 1up. So guess what? You'll end up getting hundreds of extra lives BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW IT. It's nice to see that there's a Coin Rush mode for going on a rampage for coins, but why the heck is it like this for the actual game?! Why couldn't the coin opportunities be ONLY for Coin Rush mode? So basically, the game becomes a lot easier, and the challenge depletes.But wait...How could the challenge go away? You'll never know what kind of challenge the levels could offer, right? Well, the levels certainly are fun and challenging, but the loads of opportunities with the coin-collecting affect the overall difficulty. No level could be a total bother because you have a lot of lives to spare. You could just simply learn the level by trial-and-error to get through.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL. If you die a lot of times on a level, you'll be offered a White Racoon Leaf, which basically gives you invincibility for the rest of your time in the level. I tolerated this in Super Mario 3D Land, but in a game that's already easy, this is BULL. The challenge is totally ruined! Players could just lazily romp through the levels this way. They have a million lives left, so you could just beat all of the main 6 Worlds this way.Overall, this is classic Mario made unnecessarily easy and unoriginal. If you want to buy a Mario game for on-the-go play on 3DS, get yourself Super Mario 3D Land or, for a less expensive title, the first New Super Mario Bros! Both games are much better in every way, really. As much as I hate having to bash on the game series I love the most, New Super Mario Bros 2 is only worth playing for the new levels and/or if you're not that great at Mario at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"OJ Silk","summary":"Way too many button combinations","reviewText":"I've played many UFC games going back a while, including THQ's UFC Undisputed series & EA Sports MMA.Here are my first impressions since the game just came out -- it's OK.  I have three main gripes so far:1) Way too many button combinations.  You'll need to invest a lot of time to master these. It's hard to dodge punches & defend takedowns.2) Unrealistic striking as the amount landed is insane.  Most of them don't show proper/necessary impact. Many strikes just bounce off without damage.  You can land a perfect strike & the damage will be that of an ordinary jab.3) Striking graphics are also strange & not as good as the Undisputed series or Fight Night (Boxing, EA).  The knockout animations are inferior to prior offerings. Sometimes a strike doesn't seem to land (or barely graze), yet it's the knockout blow (almost like a ghost punch).On the positive side -- the game is still fun to play & the roster is great. It includes current, retired (ie. St. Pierre) & legendary fighters (ie. Liddell).  As many know, Bruce Lee was also included (pre-order bonus).  Royce Gracie can be unlocked or purchased as well.  All the fighter models look great.I will post an update as I spend more time with the game (career mode, etc.).  But wanted to give a first impression for anyone who wanted to get an opinion from someone who's actually played the game.  So far, a little disappointing but that may change once I spend more time with it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2014"}

Granted nothing is top of the line anymore but the card a Radeon works fine with everything else I have.  When Fallout 3 came out and everyone reported errors, I counted myself fortunate now I feel their pain.Word of mouth I have heard on this is kind of a mix some say the main quest is worse then Fallout 3 and they aren't to impressed others say that the \"evil\" factions in New Vegas felt more fleshed out.  I wish I had first hand experience to offer you guys.  I can't get past the program launcher.  Some conflict between Windows 7, Steam and my Graphics Card drivers I would assume.  I have been trying to get the game to run ever since I got it Tuesday, I don't have the patience for it anymore.  I don't expect much from a game but the simple ability to run it on a system that is supposedly able to handle it would be very high on that list.Steam is another issue entirely, yes as far as mandatory programs you have to download or the game will not work its the easiest and most user friendly of the bunch.  That being said it still leaves that bad taste in your mouth like Bethesda is treating potential customers as they would treat potential Pickpockets.Overall-Crashes I can deal with but a 50 dollar paper weight that I can't get to start (although not from a lack of trying) isn't worth my time.

I'm not into the multi-player aspect even still, but the single player campaign is very good, very similar to Halo: Combat Evolved.Once again, you are Master Chief fighting off the Covenant through familiar territory. The weapons and controls are familiar, as are the graphics. Ok, so this game came out 4 years ago on Xbox and 2 yrs ago on the PC, so why get it? Well for one, it's cheap and still fun. Why not get it? The hardware requirements are surprising for a game with modest graphics, at best. My pc is a core i7@ 4ghz with a heavily overclocked 9800 gt gfx card. Even on my machine, the graphics are dated, but not completely 2d and terrible.The games for Windows thing, yeah, it's annoying.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

That is why one of the very first games ever made for the PS2 is still a gem to play today ...however Tekken is not what is used to be.To be honest Namco's Tekken entries since the initial release of the PS2 have done nothing but knock this fighter flat on its face, but before we get to the cons lets talk a little about the pros. Tekken Tag boasts 30 players, numerous fight settings and so the possible tag combinations between characters is almost unlimited making for plenty of variations in game play. This is why TAG is so good. Tekken provides about 50 moves for each character however some of the moves become frequently observed in other characters meaning that you start to see half of one's characters moves spread between three other characters. So if you are looking for more unique moves then really you should be looking towards Tekken 4, however TAG wins Tekken 4 in terms of its lifespan (even if you own Tekken 4 friends will still ask you to put this disc in), so the tag game play makes this game. Basically you must balance between the two characters health as you fight (the man-out regains health) meaning that on infinite time settings good players can really battle it out, however Tekken Tag does suffer from the old `this character is better than that character' syndrome, which to be honest, has never changed in any game series as some character moves are simply impossible to pull-off with years playing with them. TAG's graphics let it down badly. The background is visibly disconnected with the fighting platform (you can see the bad anti-aliasing moving out of sync with the background creating a dizzy fighting experience that is unpleasant on the eye. The fighters only look a little notch up from the PS1 Tekken 3 and their moves are not a whole pile changed. Although appearing fluid at first that illusion subsides very quickly, but you keep playing because the TAG option rulez it. Quite simply, you and your friends are going to be spending some time on this game even though it is not even remotely close to the kind of quality that Namco could deliver on... and believe it or not, Tekken 4 isn't a whole pile better either. This was made in 2000. It is now nearly 2005 and the PS2 has not had the good Tekken gamer it deserves which is sham because Tekken is only available on the PS2!Pros:- Tag!- 30 Characters and lots of fighting combinations.- Game with a very long lifespan.- Nothing else like it.Cons:- Not much better than PS1 graphics.- Terrible backgrounds.- Character strength mismatches.- Multiple moves shared with many characters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

Here's what I thought of it.The PSP Go I have to say has been well built, feels sturdy and to me, does not feel as cheap as the psp-2000 or 3000.The position of the controls might bother some people, specially people with big hands the L + R buttons will feel as you dont have much room to press because of the back side of the screen and the analog stick though sturdy, is a lot smaller than the previous one. But the directional pad and square,triangle,circle,x feel a lot better for me than the previous installments.With the above said, I was able to pair my PS3 controller because Sony incorporated Bluetooth 2.0 on this psp and all I can say is this is by far one of the best things they added. I was able to do everything from surfing the xmb menu, to playing games, with the psp go's controlls hidden. For me its awesome cause is like having a mobile ps3.Why do I say mobile PS3? since I can actually remote play with the ps3 like the psps before it, this psp go takes it one step further, and thats allowing you to tether with any cell phone or device thats 3g. Basically with the older models, you would have to look for a wifi hotspot. If you have a cell phone with unlimited 3g data plan, you can actually link it to your psp go and viola, you are playing online anywhere, and best of all, you can remote connect to your ps3 from anywhere now, given you have that cell phone or 3g laptop around. With remote play as of now, you can only play one full ps3 game Lair (correct me if i'm wrong) but you can still watch movies and look at pics you have on the ps3.I did notice that the screen has the same interlacing problems that the 3000, eventhough the screen might look a bit brighter and is a bit smaller, I did notice those interlacing lines. No ghosting though. So for some, this might be a turn off. I dont mind them much but I thought I'd put it out there since i have not seen it in any reviews yet.This psp go does not play umd games nor there is a umd conversion (as of yet) but I really think that someone out there, if not Sony, in the near future will come out with a program or solution to enable you to convert your umd games to play on the Go.Also, you can not remove the battery on this psp. Well, let me say its a bit harder to remove it because the battery its internal, so there is not back door to remove it unless you start unscrewing stuff on the psp and it might void your warranty.Rockband Unplugged voucher is included with your PSP Go, just redeem code and download in the PSN by registering with it with 5 playable songs, and you get Patapon 2 demo pre-installed.The charger box is smaller than the previous ones, so it will be easier to find a pouch or carry bag that is not hugely big for carrying purposes.This psp go also comes with an embeded 16gb solid state memory and a slot to add more memory when you need it via way of M2 cards.So all in all, the PSP Go is pretty cool, still has its drawbacks, but a few additions like bluetooth and tethering are something I always wanted in a psp..... now, if only Sony will incorporate that second analog..... oh wait! Ill just use my ps3 controller, well maybe sometimes....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

However, their peaceful life is soon interrupted when a series of events unfold pulling Kazuma back into the shadowy past he thought he had left behind. Making its first appearance exclusively on the PlayStation 3 platform, the rich story and vibrant world of Yakuza 3 lets players engage in intense brutal clashes within the streets of Okinawa, and the pulsating and often dangerous city of Tokyo where only the strongest will survive.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"An Underworld Worth Diving Into","reviewText":"You're being surrounded by a bunch of yakuza punks in a small children's park. They were hassling a woman, trying to take herback to their boss, until you and your buddy stepped in. Soon, you're fending off these five or six thugs with kicks, uppercutsand curb stomps. All of a sudden, when it just comes down to you and one other punk, you spy a pair of pliers lying on theground; you don't know why they're there, but you don't give it a second thought and quickly snag them. In a heartbeat, you'vetaken the last punk in a headlock and messily ripped one of his teeth from his mouth, throwing him to ground and watching himroll around in pain. This isn't the latest blockbuster action flick; it's just one of the many crazy moments from the superb world of \"Yakuza 3.\"Story: A-An ex-yakuza chairman, Kazuma Kiryu left behind his path of violence and destruction in order to open up an orphanage on theisland of Okinawa. After a brief period of peace, he's soon sucked back into the world of violence when a developer threatensto run him and the orphans he cares for out of their home, in order to build a resort and military base so as to stimulateOkinawa's waning economy. This sets off a series of events both serious and lighthearted in nature. Moments of violenceand gritty crime drama are interspersed with missions which involve taking care of your kids and finding food for a stray dog.Unlike the plot of \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", which was a more or less monotoned look at the criminal underworld, \"Yakuza 3\" craftsa truly complex and intricate web of a plot, laced with heart-pounding action sequences and more conspiracies than you canshake a stick at.Gameplay: A+To some, this may seem like a run-the-mill button-mashing affair; you've got your square button for light attacks, triangle forheavy attacks, and circle for grab. However, this is prevented from getting stale by the colorful assortment of moves Kazumahas at his disposal, as well as the fact that a great deal of objects can be picked up and wielded with deadly proficiency.Hammer a street punk down to the ground with a nearby bicycle, or smash a boss stage in the face with a leather sofa. Howmuch enjoyment the combat provides is directly tied to just how much you like wreaking untold levels of unrealistic violence.Very light RPG elements are also involved, as you gather experience from beating up gang members and helping out citizens, whichcan be applied towards health expansions and new fight moves.As far as exploration is concerned, you guide Kazuma through the streets of Okinawa and Tokyo, searching for side-missions whileat the same time following the main plot of the game. A few of the locations you can visit include weapons shops, crowded market-places and seedy bars. Wandering the crowded streets never gets dull, because much like the random battles of a traditional RPG,there is always a threat of some lone punk stepping out of the shadows and challenging you to a fight. There are no load screensbetween the battles and the exploration, which makes it all the more enjoyable. \"Yakuza 3\" has the right balance of action andexploration, striking the right chord with both seasoned gamers and newbies alike.Sound: A-The game includes superb voice acting, which is all in Japanese, and a varied soundtrack which jumps from J-Pop, to orchestralpieces, then all the way to classic Japanese enka music. Sound always fits the mood perfectly in this game, and that is a bigfeat in and of itself.Graphics: AIt's rare to find such an accurate depiction of Japan in a video game (\"Persona 4\" did a pretty decent job; however, it was a littlefantastical because of the overall tone of the game itself), but \"Yakuza 3\" nails it spot-on. Streets are packed to the brim withpeople, tiny alleyways are all over the place, and real-world locations are rendered with the utmost accuracy. Also noteworthy isthe use of real Japanese products (Boss canned coffee, C.C. Lemon, and Young Magazine, to name a few), which add to the overallauthenticity of the game.Character models are very well constructed, facial movements are convincing and never feel strained, and the aforementionedlocations you visit are truly immersing. The only complaint I can warrant are the deceptive cutscenes, which are gorgeous, butthen set you up for thinking the in-game graphics look THAT good, which they definitely do not. Not that the in-game graphicsare BAD, but they definitely aren't as beautiful as the cutscenes would lead you to believe.IN THE END:\"Yakuza 3\" stands as one of the exclusive titles that PS3 owners can flaunt proudly. Japanophiles will love it for it's accurateportrayal of the country they love so much, and action junkies will love the variety of ways they can defeat their enemies (Hint:handheld flamethrower + random goon's face= good times!). If you have PS3, then there's really no reason you shouldn't be playingthis game.OVERALL GRADE: A+Note: For those (like me) who didn't play the first two entries in this series, and fear that they will be alienated by the plot, don'tworry: from the main menu, you can access two extended cutscenes which explain the events leading up to \"Yakuza 3.\" Plus, the story isreally easy to jump into, and after about five to ten hours of play, you have a good idea of who's who in the plot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}

While I know the \"in\" thing was to play Halo (or now COD) Gears of War is definitely where the best gaming is at.As a single player, this game can be difficult (on the harder settings). I ended up playing this through with my husband to beat it on Insane. Personally I think that's what makes a game great! It has to be hard, but still beatable in some way, shape, or form. At the same time, the casual setting is easy enough that someone playing for fun would have an easy enough time playing it they wouldn't want to just put the game away.Speaking of playing it with someone else, this game has my absolute favorite co-op, especially in a time when co-op doesn't seem to be the popular type of game anymore, when everyone is more interested in multiplayer. I did not play the multiplayer on this game, but my husband did and he said he really wasn't in to it (we liked it in the second).The third person shooter, ability to cover, chainsaw, reloading, etc. are also aspects that make me love this game so much more than others.

{"product_name":"B0050SZE2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"Far Cry 3 with more features than the first two","reviewText":"It began innocently enough as you are on vacation with your brother and friends in a lush tropical paradise. But while skydiving in the rook islands your friends land in various places and are taken hostage to be sold by the pirate lord Vaas. As you are captured you make your escape but will you have the courage to find your friends and save them? These are the questions asked in the newest installment from the great minds at ubisoft in Far Cry 3.After you play thru the tutorial which explains not just how to move and shoot but how you can capture radio towers that unlock portions of the map. These are important especially if you want to fast travel to these locations. But don't worry you won't just be walking around the islands as there are loads of vehicles that you can commandeer. You will have choices on land (atv's  and jeeps) sea (boats and jetskis) and even the air (hang gliders) to make travel around the vast map easier.The game is an open world and can be played in basically any order you choose. You can just pursue the story missions to rescue your friends or you can tackle sidequests to give you more resources. As with Far Cry 2 there are enemy outpost that you can take over and while it is hard it does have it's advantages. First it rids the area of roving pirates so you'll be able to explore and hunt that area easier and you can fast travel to that location as well. The islands are also lush with various wildlife that you can kill as well and you'll need this to craft better gear for yourself. This impacts everything from how many weapons you can carry to how much loot you can drag around.Far Cry 3 looks amazing whether it's on the PS3, Xbox or even the PC as the graphics look as if you're dropped deep into a jungle. The characters look great and they will split up and attack you so you need to watch out for that. The only problem I have with this game is there is a story mission that is completely stealth based. If you are spotted they raise the alarm and you will fail the mission and have to start over from the beginning. Needless to say I had to do this mission countless times until I finally cleared it.If you are a fan of first person shooters and love open world games as well then getting Far Cry 3 is a no brainer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I must say im having more fun with this game on the ps4 mainly because sony's game launch is in desperate need of adventure games. Since Watch Dogs was pushed back, this sort of saved the day. For the past month or so i've just been using my console to watch people stream videos which led to me turning on my ps4 for about five minutes a day but now that TRDE is out, i've been playing for about two hours at a time. The game looks great but only if ur playing in 1080p of course. Great storyline and voice acting. Wish it had more choice of weapons but the scenery is breath taking.

This game is about as close to Castlevania as Moto GP is to Gran Turismo.

The sound effects and music are mediocre, especially compared to the incredible music and sounds that the Castlevania series is so well known for.

Blasiman","summary":"Good and fun most of the time but not great.","reviewText":"With out a doubt this is the most fun and immersive FPS since Half-Life. While that might sound ground-breaking, it isn't. It feels more like 80% of what it might have been, and that would have made it an instant classic.Most of the action is a blast. A favorite part of mine was later in the game you enter an open courtyard in Cloud City. With out warning a pair of Dark Jedi attack. The following battle is a frenzy of crackling lightsabers and clashing Force powers. Yet moments like this take time getting there.For the first few missions you wonder around looking for the right button to hit while fighting a seemingly infinite army of Stormtroopers. It is strange that a game still makes button flipping a major game play aspect. Nor is your destination always clear, some levels are a maze at times. On top of that you do a lot of jumping. A lot, after awhile it reminded me of Frogger. It is here that the flaws of the game are the most obvious. The AI is not stupid but not clever either. Some of the graphics are very good, like the character models, lighting, shadows and weapon effects. However much of the textures are lower resolution and bland. There is only a sky box, no sky effects making the outdoor areas life-less. Oddly absent is the detailed mapping that the Quake3 engine is known for. Yet once you are strong with the force it is a blast-a-second to throw Stormtroopers off a cliff, choke Imperial Officers to death and cut down Dark Jedi. It never gets old to fry, blast, blow up and vaporize hordes of bad guys right out of the movies.I was surprised to find an interesting plot in the game. In a nutshell it is another attempt by a crazy Dark Jedi and an Imperial faction to overthrow the Republic. However there were some plot points that I did not expect and made it worth following along. More than that the voice acting was better than most computer games. It was entertaining to listen to the dialog as each charactor hade a perfectly matching voice.While the voice acting was well done, the music needed some polishing. The classic Star Wars score is over used. It is used in every single Star Wars game to date, would it hurt to come up with something new?The single player is entertaining but I found the mutiplayer to be less thrilling. Some will find it awsome, but in games with out force powers or limited power it boils down to the same old run'n gun. A little less conformity and more innovation would have made it worth while in my opinion. MP is also played out on the MSN Zone, also in my opinion a hassel.Over all it is still the best Star Wars game to come out since the previous Jedi Knight. It is a cool game and one of the best to come in a while. Yet the uninspired MP and sometimes irritating level design weaken what could have been amazing game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"Hearts of Darkness","reviewText":"There is an indescribable exhilaration that comes with being let loose on a tropical island armed with a locker full of weapons to fight pirates, skin tigers, and ride ATVs off a cliff into shark infested waters.  Far Cry 3 successfully delivers its promise of an open world sandbox of tropical mayhem while also delivering a memorable, at times even thought-provoking story with a strong backing in classical themes of survival and madness.  This was my first Far Cry game and I must say it leaves a lasting impression.The plot of Far Cry 3 feels very much like a contemporary version of Heart of Darkness with the protagonist journeying deeper and deeper into madness, encountering increasingly mad characters and situations the further he goes.  Of course the standout character is the game's antagonist, and poster child Vaas, who captures the protagonist and his friends with the intent of selling them into slavery.  Motion capture performer and voice actor Michael Mando really knocks it out of the park portraying this mentally unstable pirate, making for one of the most memorable video game characters of the last decade.I'm not a game critic, so I can't speak much of the gameplay other than to say it works and is a lot of fun.  Far Cry 3 combines the best elements of the FPS genre, open world sandbox gameplay with the exploration of Tomb Raider, and the level progression of an RPG.  The graphics are impressive for the Xbox 360, and I never encountered any game breaking glitches or bugs.If you're looking for a fun single-player FPS experience that offers freedom, open world exploration, and an interesting plot full of memorable character you definitely should give Far Cry 3 a play.P.S.: If you enjoy 1980s sci-fi action films the downloadable game \"Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon\" is worth checking out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2014"}

My take:The game mostly assume's you are familiar with the AC games, you will find yourself confused about the modern day desk job cutscene and sometimes wondering where to go and what to do. The sync'ing isn't explained (where the map reveals itself slowly) among other things. So expect to feel out of touch on how things work the first few hours of the game. I asked a friend to fill me in a bit and that helped.Basically its a pirate world with things to collect and things to kill. Not much else.The world is pretty but everything feels static. Nothing is truly interactive. Its nice to have a colorful vibrant world but for me it didn't seem real or immersive. Mainly because I felt like I was a superhero running around in the city filled with automatons. Nobody moves or acts like you, so it makes the whole thing seem fake. It's hard to explain.Its fun at times but more often that not I got bored. If you love collecting things and killing things then this game is pretty good (or if you love pirates). Personally I found the enemies\\people rather stupid and easy to \"assassinate\". Walk right up to them and click the \"assassinate\" button and your done. Rinse, repeat. There's the occasion where you chase after some normal person who hops around roofs better than you do and also another side activity like chasing some flying musical notes. It can be absurd.The storyline and stealth game play leave much to be desired. Its more of a Spiderman runs around city killing and collecting type of game. Its silly but I can see it being fun for some people, maybe just not for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXOW","description":"","reviewerName":"Courtney L. Osborn","summary":"The Most Fun I've Had Since Assassin's Creed 2","reviewText":"Intro:Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV: Black Flag was released on October 29, 2013 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.  It was subsequently a release day game for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.  Like the rest of the games in the Assassin&#8217;s Creed series, this one is also a historical action-adventure open world video game both developed and published by Ubisoft.  This entry in the series is a sequel to Assassin&#8217;s Creed III but is a prequel to its story.Story:The story follows the adventures of Edward Kenway:  father of Haytham Kenway and grandfather of Connor (both from Assassin&#8217;s Creed III).  Edward is a British privateer until eventually becoming a pirate where he runs into both the Templars and Assassins.  Just like all of the other Assassin&#8217;s Creed games, this one splits up your time in both present day and in a historical setting.  The historical setting for Black Flag is in the Caribbean during the early 18th century.  An era sometimes referred to as the &#8220;Golden Age of Piracy.&#8221;  Edward sails the Caribbean in search of riches as the typical pirate would have done.  He meets real life pirates such as Blackbeard and other historical figures along the way.I do not want to spoil the present day section for those of you who have not played it yet, but I will say that it was a very interesting twist on the previous games.  What I can say is that during the present day section you will be able to uncover details about Abstergo, the Templars, the Assassins, and Desmond Miles (former present day protagonist; Assassin&#8217;s Creed 1-3).  I actually enjoyed the present day story more than I enjoyed the historical portion just because of all of the backstory you get to uncover.  This is not to say that the historical section lacked in the story department; it just wasn&#8217;t quite as interesting to me.  Where the historical portion shined was its gameplay, which I will get to.Presentation:I cannot rave enough about how beautiful this game is.  I played it on PlayStation 4 both before and after the 1080p patch so I cannot say how it looked on other platforms; for ideas on that go look up comparison videos on YouTube.  On PlayStation 4, this game will just blow you away.  Before the patch I was simply stunned at how realistic the Caribbean looked, how amazing the ships were, how awesome the cities and forests were, but there was still a problem: how the people looked.  Edward and all of the non-playable characters skin looked glossed over and fake; there was almost no texture to it.  Everyone&#8217;s hair looked like it was &#8220;last-gen,&#8221; especially facial hair on all of the pirates.  I am happy to say that this was all resolved in the 1080p patch!  Now everything looks exactly like you would expect from a &#8220;current-gen&#8221; game.  I noticed this most on Edward since you play as him the entire game.  I dare you to play this game on PlayStation 4 with the patch and tell me that it is not gorgeous!The sound quality of this game is also phenomenal.  I am not just talking about sound effects; I mean the voice acting, the music, and the pirates singing their Sea Shnties.  Just like the rest of the games in the series, Black Flag sports an amazing cast of voice actors.  It shows off yet again how amazing the voice actor field is for video games.  Black Flag continues the familiar Assassin&#8217;s Creed trend of having an amazing musical score, but this time with a pirate-y twist!  The Sea Shanties are songs that you can discover in the many different cities around the Caribbean.  These songs will be sung by your crew when you are sailing the seas to your destinations.  I LOVE these songs! They are so catchy!  I found myself singing along with them more times than I would like to admit, and am now considering finding them online to download.Gameplay:Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV: Black Flag stands out in front of the rest of the series because of its gameplay.  The fighting, stealth, climbing, and city exploration remain the same as its tried-and-true foundation found in each of the last few games.  Where the game changes things and really shines is during the naval sections of the game.  Black Flag does not hold your hand through an excruciatingly long introductory segment like Assassin&#8217;s Creed III; but instead opens up the world and allows you to explore at your leisure almost immediately.  There are seemingly endless things to do if you go this route.  I chose that option and started exploring the Caribbean.  Take it from me; you can lose countless hours without even realizing it by just sailing from one location to the next and trying to uncover all of the secrets and collectables.  This however is completely optional and you can just continue the story if you wish.While sailing the open sea, you can attack and plunder other ships.  Doing so will reward you with money, crew members, and materials for upgrades.  The bigger the ship, the more rewards you get for plundering it.  After successfully boarding a ship you are also given the option to repair your ship, lower your wanted level, or add this ship to your fleet.  All of these are valuable options so choose wisely.  Upgrading your ship costs both money and materials.  It will require a long time to gain enough money and materials to max out your ship so if you plan on doing so, work ahead by starting immediately!  I loved upgrading my ship and testing it out against bigger and badder enemies.  There are also several forts strategically located around on islands.  These will attack you whenever you get close, but if you are strong enough you can attack back and take down their defenses before ultimately capturing the fort for your own.  I loved the challenge these provided!Multiplayer returns in Black Flag with a few new modes, locations, and characters but is ultimately the same as in previous entries of the series.  They are all land based which I found odd.  Being as this is a game about sailing the open seas and being a pirate, you would think that there would be some sort of naval combat multiplayer.  Honestly I think Ubisoft missed a great opportunity here and this brings down the multiplayer portion of the game.  The modes left over are still fun, but become stale if you have played them for the past few years.The Verdict: 9.0 out of 10The best way to describe Assassin&#8217;s Creed IV: Black Flag is to say that it is the second best in the series.  It is right behind Assassin&#8217;s Creed II in my opinion, and just barely at that.  This says a lot coming from me.  When Black Flag was announced earlier this year I was extremely skeptical I would even buy the game, and now I feel like I was a fool to ever think that as it has become one of my favorite games.  This game was fun from the very beginning and it never slowed down.  It treated you like you have played both Assassin&#8217;s Creed games and open world games before and didn&#8217;t need to hold your hand.  There is still a learning curve as with any game, but this one just felt different.  Black Flag added an interesting twist on the present day part of the game that was both awesome and unexpected.  Meeting historical figures like Blackbeard was as awesome as it was in previous games.  But what stands above everything else was the incredible naval exploration and battles.  Assassin&#8217;s Creed III laid the foundation for this and Black Flag nearly perfected it!  The graphics are stunningly beautiful if you have the 1080p patch.  If you are looking for a launch title on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, I HIGHLY recommend picking this up.  It is everything you could want in an Assassin&#8217;s Creed game.  Even if you can&#8217;t afford one of the new consoles, I still believe that you need to experience this game; it is absolutely phenomenal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Reggie","summary":"3 reasons why Mass Effect 3 DOES-NOT-SUCK!","reviewText":"1) I only paid $16.01 for the game. So, for that price alone, and the 45 hours of entertainment it provided me... it doesn't suck.2) Since I didn't spend the last 10 years of my life thinking, plotting, planning, discussing, developing, writing, producing, directing, drawing, coloring, animating, programming, editing, testing, managing, composing music,  arranging music, recording music, singing songs, praticing, localizing, doing voice over work, translating, designing, creating visual effects, special effects, sound effects, strategy guides, financing, marketing, promoting, shipping, distrubuting, selling, stressing, wondering, wishing, dreaming, and hoping that the Mass Effect series will be a success... i'm not gonna talk crap about it at all. I'm just gonna do what my sister tells me to do if I get into her car and start complaining about her driving. (she tells me to just shut up, kick back, and enjoy the ride). So i'm just gonna shut up, kick back, enjoy, and appreciate every bit of the years of hard work that many people spent working on this game in order to get it into my hands, and just consider myself lucky that I got a chance to play it.  Since I don't have any technical skills to create a video game, and don't have a company to produce, promote, and sell a video game either, imma just say \"good job\" to the team at BioWare who put this game together. (well done). So, for this reason too.... it doesn't suck.3) Most rpg's come from japan, and while japanese rpg's are extremely good, I wish they'd stop cluttering up the entire screen during battles with a menue system. (for example: final fantasy 13, uggghhh~!!!). I'm sick and tired of... \"FIGHTING IN THE MENUE SYSTEM\" ...and having to CONSTANTLY access it in order to do something. It&#65279; takes away the fun of playing the game. The japanese need to learn from western type rpg's and not \"over complicate the game play\" as games like Fable and Mass Effect have already figured out and are now doing. Now... does this mean that gameplay should be dumbed down? NO!! I dont think that gameplay should be dumbed down to just simple button mashing so that a person with the attention span of a pineapple can enjoy playing it. I just wish that what I see on screen isn't constantly blocked by too much \"words & numbers\" that really don't mean anything to me.  Visually, I wanna appreciate what I see on&#65279; the screen without words and numbers getting in the way. So, since Mass Effect 3 doesn't over complicate their battle system... it does not suck.And so... for these 3 reasons... Mass Effect 3... does not suck.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}

What have they done to you Vincent? Final Fantasy VII for the Playstation was an instant classic. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children also received fine reviews. How then, could Dirge of Cerberus be bad? Well.. if it was done like this I guess.This game is unique to the Final Fantasy world because it is an action game, not the usual RPG. Also, it stars a side character from an earlier game which hasn't been done yet either. However, in this case change isn't good. For starters many of the guns are basically the same thing. Of course there are a few differences, but none really too noticeable. Also, the action just becomes stale after awhile. Sure, the enemies change but it's never anything special. All you really have to do is click the R1 button a few times and they all die. Not to mention, the game designers seemed to try and make it as annoying as possible. There are constant loading and saving in the middle of the game that really bogs down the action. But, even after all these saves mid-mission death takes it's toll. You can run through three parts of a four part mission, waste a bunch of time doing boring gun fighting, and then die. And sometimes when you die, they send you all the way back to the start. ...That sucks.Still, for fans of Final Fantasy the game does have some redeeming qualities. The CG cutscenes are beautiful and the story of Vincent Valentine is rather interesting. Still, when those cutscenes are just popping up two or three times every mission it can get a little tedious. Not to mention, there are load times between the cut scenes and the action. So, you have to wait through that as well.It is also good to note, that it is cool to hear voices of the characters from a game from 1997. The music isn't too bad either. But, compared to Final Fantasy games from the past it really isn't anything to write home about. Overall, this game doesn't really last too long if you go through it quickly, like I did. But, after you beat the game there are a bunch of extra missons that you can take on for fun. I would have added more value for that, but Square decided to scratch the online portion of this game. That makes the additional missions mute.A Final Fantasy fan will probably buy this game regardless of what I say. But, as a fan of the series I'd reccommend just renting it. You can easily play through the game in 5 days, and with no online or anything to make it worth keeping, the replay value isn't great. Dirge of Cerberus delivers on telling a story of a very popular side character, but fails at actually creating a decent shooter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2006"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Texas-sized thrills - a 'must have' unless you really hate Westerns","reviewText":"It's not every day that you see a game so original, so unique and so 'fun', you're wandering why didn't anyone else think of that until now. Red Dead Redemption deserves a 5 stars not only because it falls into a class of its own - ever played a Western RPG on a console? I didn't think so - but because it's stunningly good when it comes to its taking advantage of PS3's capabilities, because of its most innovative story line, its unparalleled humor and the games ability to fully transport the player right in the middle of late 19th century Texas, living inside a Western story plot. But, since it all takes place on a huge open map and because you are in control of your character, just about anything can happen and you almost always have a say in it. So, expect to have A LOT of fun and occasionally to go into the 'wow' mode as you are playing it.The funny thing is that I didn't play the game myself a lot because I'm still hooked into Demon's Souls but I've watched my son playing it and watching him playing was almost indistinguishable from watching a movie, that's how good the PS3 rendition is. Only when I yelled 'shoot him', unlike in a movie, I could see it happen.When you play this game it feels like you are really living someone's real life. You don't always have to stick to the story line. You are allowed to break free of the story line for a while and go back to it when you feel you are ready. Red Dead Redemption holds very many things to do on the side like maybe a few hands of Texas hold 'em in a cantina, South of the border but, beware, there's cheating going on and keep your watch on the game, ignore the senoritas :). So, it will take you a very long time to be bored.Multiplayer holds games that you can play with other people. You can do team death match and many more types of game modes. While in multiplayer you can start a gang and go around and do things around the map. Just about anything goes, from destroying fortresses full of gang members to fighting off waves of wild animals in hunting grounds. If you can somehow get bored of doing that you can saddle up your horse and try to assassinate anyone in multiplayer with you.So, if you are into 'Western', shooters and wide open world RPGs, this game is it and it's having it all: local color, accents, dialogue, shooting action and lots of unexpected thrills but I won't be spoiling anyone's fun by disclosing too much._________________________________Note on language:The 'M' rating is fully earned because the game makes no compromises. Most cowboys didn't complete finishing schools and the game makes them talk like they did in 'real life'. When characters talk it's not just their accent that's authentic. It's not only 4-letter words but also some quite frank talk that most parents would rather not have their kids hear and then ask questions about :).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2010"}

To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"It's Another GOW Game","reviewText":"There's really no need to read this review, either you've played every Gears of War game for hundreds of hours and you absolutely love it, you've played some of the games and think they're OK, or you've avoided all of the Gears games. Nothing is going to change your mind, especially this game. By no means is GOW3 bad, but there is absolutely nothing different or new in this game. To me, it feels like a game that receives annual releases like Call of Duty and all sports games. The gameplay is exactly the same as the previous titles, except that it has less crazy and awesome set pieces and battles than in previous games. There are basically only 3 kind of cool moments that are memorable in the game, the Kraken battle at the beginning of the game that is really pretty basic fare, a flying beast battle at the end of the game, and a really fun but short semi-Tower Defense event where the horde are attacking your base. I also found the way that the Lambent spawn is annoying. Previously, the horde coming out of the ground kind of made sense, but now, I can't figure out how the lambent pop out of the stalks with weapons, it just doesn't make sense.The story, like the previous iterations, is probably the weakest part of the game. I won't go into any spoilers (not that anyone would care), but it essentially boils down to just finding your father who has created a Deus Ex Machina weapon that will destroy all of the glowy creatures and perhaps the horde as well to end the trilogy. There definitely isn't as much glaring machismo in this game, but it's replaced with a bit of childishness, where I thought it was really awkward how Marcus kept talking to his Dad. It especially wasn't helped by the voice actor who sounded really weird in the dialog where he talks to his father or about him. Also, there isn't any character development, and they are all completely interchangeable, making me feel absolutely no emotion when certain characters die. Their deaths by the way were completely pointless, there was no real reason for them to occur, and for one they didn't even explain why it happened, other than for the developers to cut off possible loose ends. The big story reveals are really just obvious duds, and they end up adding more new unanswerable questions than answering old ones. However, no one plays the Gears of War games for the story, so take my complaints with a grain of salt.The weapons are another thing I found annoying about the games, I almost feel like since they made one of the greatest FPS weapons in the chainsaw machine gun, they don't want to make anything that would trump it. Every other weapon of the game has multiple limitations artificially attached to make it so no one that plays the game will ever not be carrying the chainsaw gun. Most of these limits are obvious and seen in other games, like the kick-ass weapons having very limited ammo and reload times, but the artificial limitations are the most obvious in the new machine gun, with a bayonet instead of a chainsaw. This gun is the most unstable of any gun I've ever shot in a video game, where even if you try to fire it in bursts the reticle will be erratically moving all across the screen. The loading screen says the gun makes up for it by packing a bigger punch, but I didn't really notice any difference. It's a shame though, as charging with the bayonet out is pretty awesome. There is another new gun that is a modified rocket launcher that goes under cover, but it is very seldom available, and felt kind of gimmicky. My least favorite of the weapons is the sniper rifle, which is the worst iteration of it in any FPS. It only has one shot, and when reloading you lose your positioning. It's just really annoying, and I feel like if they can create all of the other weapons in the game, they could make a sniper rifle with a clip.The multiplayer is the other big part of the game that I'm sure a lot of people would love, but I'm just not a huge fan of. Gears competitive multiplayer just isn't my cup of tea, I find it to be very slow, yet the cover based mechanics of the main game just aren't as applicable in multiplayer. It's also frustrating, where if you die a certain amount of times you run out of respawns. This is fine, as it makes sense that a weaker player doesn't bring down the whole team, but it it extremely annoying when you have to just sit there and watch other people have fun. Then if you get tired of it and quit, the game can punish you by taking away almost a whole level, and the levels take a decent amount of time to increase. For co-op play, the only real disadvantage to it is that the whole gameplay is so tied around the 4 player team, that when you're playing solo the AI can at times be frustrating. The most memorable moments are the times where you're supposed to be stealthy. For some reason, none of the AI characters will pick up a sniper rifle and take out the other guard when there are two of them. So it is practically impossible to get through those sections in solo-play without alerting the camp, and spawning a crazy amount of soldiers. Thankfully though, I didn't experience too many glitches with the partner AI.So in the end, if you've liked the previous Gears of War games, I'm sure you'll love GOW3. While if you don't like the series, there's nothing that will change your mind here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}

I love every minute of it! I just can't go on it for five minutes: it turns into five hours!The whole point of the  game is to create a cool theme park and have so many guests in the park and  a certain park rating by year 2, 3, or 4. I love building roller coasters  on this game, although it can be tough (most coasters I build get an  intensity rating of ultra-extreme and nobody rides it). But lets not forget  merry go rounds, food stands, bathrooms--all the small things.However,  this is not without its faults (what game is?). For instance, the goal of  the scenario. If you surpass the amount of guests in your park and the park  rating is above the required (usually around 600), and it's only year 2,  you gotta wait. And that can be aggravating. Second, why can't guests go on  the ultra-extreme coasters? It's not like they'll kill them or  something.All in all, this is a great game for your PC. It's like a  drug, how addictive it is.

{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"Patrick_91 \"Patrick\"","summary":"Great First Generation DS!","reviewText":"Like the above says,the first generation of the DS was pretty good though it had some problems, It was an overall solid performer.This first model DS gets points for having a tough exterior (very hard to crack the casing) although the 3 hinge setup proved to be a troublesome mistake from Nintendo,with so much opening and closing,as well as everyday abuse from youngsters,the ends of the hinge(s) would crack rendering the DS pretty much unusable. Another negative point would be that the screens only had one brightness setting! (the PSP had 3 or 4 out the gate) One thing that was a smart move on Nintendo's part was to include GBA functionality,making the transition from GBA to DS so much more easier though on a side note with no cover or no game in the GBA port the unfilled hole felt rather flimsy. One thing I personally didn't like was that the top of the case reminded me of an extended GBA SP. At the time,I was amazed that the DS had the graphical power of a N64 (hence the few N64 ports we got) I was actually disappointed that Nintendo never ported over Zelda:Ocarina of Time to the DS.Nintendo remedied all the above problems with the release of the DS lite,it had a two piece hinge design,4 brightness settings,dust cover for the GBA slot,and improved speakers. Although IMHO the case was not as durable as the regular DS.Nintendo again upped the ante with the DSi,bigger screens,improved speakers yet again,stronger case,etc... But,and this is a big but,they removed GBA functionality from the DSi,I can only guess they had assumed everyone who's buying a DS at this point wont care much to play GBA games.Overall,at this point in the game,I cannot recommend the DS when there is the much improved DSi (or if you want a GBA slot the DS lite)To summarize.Pros:+Durable Case+Wide range of colors+As powerful as an N64Cons:-Weak hinge-Only 1 brightness setting-bulky-No accessories available at retail stores-Overall dated look (imo)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

Customization is here, in fact you can do tons of different things with your ATV, but most of the changes you make are hardly noticeable unless you're a hardcore offroad racer. I also found the game to be relatively repetitive when playing in single-player mode and advancing through a career. Sure, there are tons of different trick combos to try on jumps, but after that... there's not much else here. Online play is a little more fun, but again can get repetitive.

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Va- Bank","summary":"Very Good - not as good as last one.

Rossi","summary":"Game is linear - gameplay is contrived.","reviewText":"I read the reviews and I don't know what people are raving about.  I've gotten to love \"sandbox\" games and while I didn't expect a sandbox like GTA series or Borderlands, I expected a lot more options as to what to do and when.  The missions are linear, and there are very few ways to do them other than how the designers want you to do them.  Plan on A LOT of saving and restoring.  One little mistake and you will get mobbed by a huge number of guys and you'll be hopelessly outgunned.  The missions are all made so there are little secret tunnels to find and go through.  It's very contrived.  It's almost like someone play-tested it and the would add a couple pipes for you to hide in and sneak through if the level was too hard.  There are \"open\" areas of the game, but there is very little to do other than try and make your way to the \"action locations\".  This is not an interactive world.  It's a contrived, linear, mission based game.  Honestly I loved the first Deus Ex, but I played it so long ago it's a distant memory.  I really enjoyed Deus Ex 2 and System Shock, enough to play them through twice. I played all the Thief games through at least once and loved them.  This seems to take the same game philosophy, but I'm just getting really frustrated.  There are huge open areas and although you can see where all the enemies are, and what direction they are looking, it's overwhelming.  It's also silly because the \"guards\" of which there are MANY are all on a fixed pattern of where they patrol.  Timing, where they start and stop, etc.  There is a path to get through, but it's almost as though there is the designers path and timing or you will get mauled.  I might un-install now.  I have Fallout- New Vegas to install.  Fallout 3 was a fantastic game, get that if you haven't played it before this puppet show.**EDIT**Well, I didn't uninstall it, I pushed on.  The game actually gets easier as you go on.  It remains very linear, but the levels are reasonably well designed.  Your character has a special ability where he can knock out or kill human enemies if he is right next to them.  You can take out guards one by one using this method and then just hide until the AI status goes back to normal.  (normal/alarmed/hostile)  It's still linear and contrived, but it's kind of fun.  The graphics are pretty good in my opinion, if you have a decent graphics card.**EDIT#2**Okay, I went ahead and finished this game.  It's one of those strange games that doesn't get any harder as the game progresses.  In fact, the first \"boss\" I had to beat was extremely difficult and I had to re-load probably 20 times before beating him.  The last one took 15 seconds and was very easy.  (due to my chosen augments)  If you start playing and don't like it, I recommend you push through the first couple hours and keep going.  Yes, it's contrived, yes it's linear, but it is fun.  Prepare to re-load many, many times over the course of the game.  As with the other Deus Ex games, there is a lot of story that analyzes humanity and what is right and wrong.  This is done very well, in a very adult, well thought out way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2012"}

While it borrows minor elements from recent titles such as the metal gear series, there is nothing here that feels like it is an outright rip-off; the biggest influences are from the original game. DE:HR sticks to time-tested role-playing and story-telling mechanics but delivers an experience that feels fresh. As a result, the game feels unique among the increasingly competitive single player role-playing landscape.STORY AND SETTINGI've spent about 29 hours with the game, and yet I honestly don't think I'm near the end. I'm probably through the half-way point and it feels like there is a third or a quarter left to go. Through it all, the story is consistently brilliant and will hook you in from the opening chapter. Decisions carry weight, and can take you into widely branching paths.If you are fond of delving deep into the `lore' of the world like I am, then you will be busy indeed as there is plenty to read. There are detailed articles about numerous topics ranging from politics & economics to the environment & technology. All of these well-written pieces flesh out a game world that feels very much plausible. I won't be giving away specific details about the plot, but there are several twists and turns throughout.GAMEPLAYChoices. That's all you need to know. The game offers numerous ways to approach a given situation and each approach feels consistently rewarding. Want to jump down from a five story building and unleash a deadly hail of miniature explosives? Go ahead. Want to avoid a fight altogether and sneak around the group? That's certainly viable. Want to sneak, but still take down enemies 1 or 2 at a time? You can do that tooHowever, the effectiveness of each approach depends on how you progress your character. In the early levels, spend some time thinking  about the style of gameplay that you prefer and then allocate the valuable praxis points used to upgrade/unlock your augmentations accordingly (a linear progression of 5000 XP nets you a new praxis point).In my opinion, the stealth approach is the best way to experience the game. Sneaking is tense yet fun and involves a mix of exploration and hacking. Nothing quite as fun as hacking into a robot and watching it take down another robot. I'm proud to report a 0 body count (not counting a couple of bosses, where killing them is the only way through).The hacking mini-game is fun but may be a little too frequent in certain areas. When compared to the rubbish mini-games in the likes mass effect and Dead Space 2, this is the best of the bunch as it requires actual strategy and not just a twitch-based response.GRAPHICS AND DESIGN PHILOSOPHYThe art direction in Deus Ex is refreshing and unique. The design team has crafted a world with a very unique and clear visual identity. Environments do not feel recycled unlike some recent RPGs. A two-tiered city in China has a distinctly Chinese vibe, while Detroit has a proper mix of industry and futurism. The hubs aren't gargantuan, but they are big enough that exploring them feels rewarding. This is largely because the levels aren't linear. There are hidden rooms and a great sense of verticality (esp. in China).However, the graphics feel like they are a generation behind. There are some nice DX 11 effects peppered here and there, but the game doesn't look like a solid DX 11 game ought to. The character models (esp the faces) can look awfully rigid and blocky. Combined with awkward animations and some shoddy texture-work, the visuals are the biggest drawback to an otherwise stellar experience. Also, the same fleur des lis motif is a little too prevalent. In all fairness though, the gameplay and story is so good that you really won't care about the game's looks.SOUND DESIGNThe sound effects are well done. Guns sound and feel right. The music is perfectly in tune with the setting. The voice acting is largely A-grade. The lead actor, in particular, stands out as he nails Adam Jensen's lone-wolfish persona.OTHER THOUGHTSAfter a decade+ absence, Deus Ex is back in a big way (pretend the second one never happened). I didn't think this game was ever going to come out. Given that the first teaser appeared in 2007, and then everything went dark until 2010, this was a common feeling shared by many. I am glad that I was wrong. Moreover, I have a newfound respect for the team at Eidos Montreal who have resurrected this franchise. I am very excited to see what they do with Thief 4 and will be lining up for pre-orders when the time comes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00008URUF","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"The benchmark SNES classic goes portable!","reviewText":"The big punch for the SNES back in 1994, \"Donkey Kong Country\" was the evolution of platform gaming, with graphics unlike anything the world has ever seen. It achieved two things: It revived perhaps the oldest video game franchise (Donkey Kong), and it gave Nintendo another mascot to market besides Mario (who never dulled, mind you). The GBA port was inevitable, and could not have been more welcome in my collection.Donkey Kong and his spry little sidekick Diddy Kong must reclaim their stolen banana hoard from the reptilian swine who took it. The story is simple enough, but the adventure is anything but. There are massive levels with varying degrees of difficulty, and sometimes the game is frustratingly hard. But let's start with the graphics. They are excellent, even by today's standards. The fluid animation and detailed environments are a sight to behold, and they translate pretty well on the small screen. The only drawback is that the characters look overly pixilated at times, and it is sometimes hard to make out certain objects like jump tires and ropes (especially in the darker levels) due to the small size of the screen and the massive amount of detail contained within. The music is as we remember it, though slightly altered in parts to accommodate the GBA's monophonic speaker.The one complaint I had with the original SNES version is that it was too easy at times. Certain elements have been changed to make the GBA port more difficult, such as adding extra enemies or changing the boss battles slightly (the Giant Wasp boss in particular). It makes the game more rewarding, and sometimes frustrating. On the plus side, all the bonuses are still intact, so achieving 100% completion is still an incentive to play over again.The extras are not a big deal, and definitely don't make it worth the price of admission alone. There are two \"mini-games\", a fishing game and a dance game. The fishing game, hosted by Funky Kong, requires you to catch as many different colored fish within a specific timeframe. It is pretty dull. The dance game, as hosted by Candy Kong, might excite fans of \"Britney's Dance Beat\", but it's nothing more than a reflex test where you are giving buttons to push and they move a character on the screen.  There is also a bland picture stills gallery (you add pictures by collecting camera icons scattered throughout the game), which is something you are unlikely to get excited about. However, the one extra I do like is the \"save anywhere\" feature, which is handy at every turn of the game.The GBA port of DKC should satisfy any gamer, since the it perfectly balances gameplay with ample eye-candy graphics. The tweaks made to make the game more challenging are both a curse and a blessing, and the extras are pitiful, but the game itself makes it more than worth getting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Very good sequel to a classic","reviewText":"I played Diablo 2 shortly after playing the first game and was immediately impressed by the improvements.  (Note: I played Diablo 2 with the expansion, Lord of Destruction, installed, along with patch 1.10, both of which I highly recommend.)  Not only was the expanded choice of characters refreshing, but the ways that you could customize the characters with the skill system was a vast improvement over the first game.Gameplay: Very similar to the first game--a lot of mouse usage, along with the keyboard for hotkeys.  This game is a bit more linear than the first Diablo, since none of its 21 quests are randomly selected (they are the same each game).  However, the story is well told through first-rate cut-scenes and dialogue with NPCs.  This game is much bigger than the first, and there are four different areas that you adventure in, including a desert, plains, a jungle, and, of course, hell.  Most fights are resolved quick and nasty; however, the bosses at the end of each act (there are four acts) are all good fights.  Diablo himself is much nastier than he was in the first game.  You can hire a NPC to travel and fight with you, which is a nice feature that adds more excitement to the battles.  Gameplay is overall quite good for a hack-and-slay action adventure with a sprinkling of roleplaying elements.  There are really just two big problems.  First, the game places quantity over quality when it comes to encounters with monsters.  After you wade through literally hundreds of creatures, you will likely only remember the tough ones which infrequently appear and the end bosses.  Although there are dozens of monster types in the game, they all become rather monotonous after you kill 50 or more of each type.  The other problem with the game is the save system and what happens to you when you die.  As others have said, Blizzard made a big blunder by having a game-save system that does not allow you to save the game where you are.  Instead, when you save, you must exit the game.  When you play again, you start out in the local town.  Also, when you die, you are \"resurrected\" in the local town, but you must go back to the spot where you died in order to claim your equipment from your corpse.  And of course, more likely than not you'll have to fight your murderers to get your stuff back.  This system, and the music, are the only things that are inferior in Diablo 2 as compared to the first game.Graphics: Good in 800x600 resolution (which you can only get with the Lord of Destruction expansion).  Monsters, scenary, spell effects, and combat all look convincing.  It looks as good as the Baldur's Gate games.  The cut-scenes are the best I've ever seen.Sound: Sound effects are generally well done.  Voice acting is okay, although most NPCs don't speak with the kind of urgency you'd think they should have when facing the end of the world.  The music is decent, but not as good as the thunderous drums of the first game.Replay/value: If you liked the first Diablo, you'll probably like this one at least as good or better.  And for the current price, it's worth it. It took me about 45 hours to finish everything with a Paladin character.  Treasure, monsters, dungeon walls, shrines, and other things are randomly generated.  Also, the game can be played over the internet, which should appeal to online gamers.  I personally have no desire to go through it again, since none of the quests are random.  However, the game is designed to encourage repeat play, especially since each character class is very different and the game has online capability.Overall, Diablo 2 is a very good game, but not a great game in my opinion.  It should offer many hours of gameplay and does have replay appeal.  Don't look for the kind of depth that you would find in full-fledge computer roleplaying games such as Baldur's Gate or Morrowind.  Diablo is less about acting out a part in a grand story (although there is some of this) and more about the instant satisfaction that comes with arcade-style action.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2004"}

Combat is unique, and there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it you'll enjoy the depth of strategy involved.

One of, if not THE, year's best.The one major flaw-- it has already been mentioned how complex the combat is. Managing so many moving parts is pretty much impossible. You've got scratch points, direct damage points, physical damage, and another half dozen different types of damage that you have to constantly be aware of. If any one character falls too low, they all go into critical mode. That means none of them can do much more than cower and take more damage, often leading to mission failure. Just to demonstrate how complicated the combat is...I've often thought the battle was going well for me until I found myself unexpectedly in critical condition--seemingly without rhyme or reason. Probably because I still don't understand everything that's factoring into my HP, and probably never will. Very punishing, very unforgiving combat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2010"}

It is just there to give you a hell of a crazy and over the top game that you can just pick up and go nuts with. There's not much to say about it as, like I say it's not very deep in regards to a storyline. Your basic goal is to win the trust of factions and do jobs for them, blowing up buildings, collecting bounties etc. That's basically it and depending on who you are it depends on you carrying out the mission covertly or with all guns blazing.The main gem of this game is the surprising look and detail of it as due to the size of the map and the destructability, the detail of it is excellent and the displaying of the tropical setting is truly jaw dropping. The vehicles are plenty and range from heavy set high artillery tanks to fast sport cars. Other vehicles such as army helicopters and a range of boats also allow the game to be more flexible and fun.I must admit that I use the cheats whilst playing the game and just like going nuts and blowing everything up. One of the cooler weapons in the game is the introduction of the Nuclear Bunker Buster. That's right a Nuclear bomb at your disposal. It's not the type of Nuke you'd expect but it's still pretty awesome to target a building and watch the mushroom cloud expel from the grouns with flames afoot.My review isn't very detailed, but there you go. If I had to tell you one thing that would make you buy this game it would be this. This game is just so much fun I'm not even kidding.

{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Well that just happened","reviewText":"Dragon's Dogma has a lot of things going for it. I think that's why the more I played it, the more frustrating its negative aspects were. Because there were many things I really liked about it, the fact that there are such serious flaws were heartbreaking. Before I get to the meat of the review, let me say that overall I really enjoyed Dragon's Dogma. That being said, if the game is never patched, I will probably never play it again. So on to the review...As I said, there are a lot of aspects of this game that felt original and fresh. The one that should be first on everyone's list of pros is the pawn system. In the game, once you create your character, you then create your main pawn. In the DD universe, pawns are humanoid beings whose sole purpose is to help your character defeat the dragon that has stolen your heart and marked you as the Arisen. Basically what happens is, you design your main pawn, and then if you are playing while connected to XBOX Live, that character is uploaded to a place called The Rift, a gateway that connects you with a wide selection of everyone else's main pawns to recruit, and where other people can recruit your main pawn into their game. The idea itself is just really cool to me. That any pawn I recruit (you can have two on top of your main pawn and yourself) is something that is purely the creation of someone else. Then, your main pawn adventures with other people during their game, and when they are released from another person's party, they/you can choose to send them back with an in-game gift, and you can rate their performance. In this way, your main pawn accumulates more experience on top of what they are gaining in your game. Everything gets updated every time you rest at a camp or inn, and that's when you can receive the gifts from other players. I think this is the single greatest strength to the game, and without it I don't think I'd have enjoyed the game nearly as much. The novelty never wore off, and I still believe the system is fantastic, and the best usage of single player online connectivity I've ever experienced. If you don't play online, no worries, the game either has a set population of scripted pawns you can choose from, or ones that are randomly generated by the game.Second, also a huge positive, is the boss battles. As far as combat goes, this is one of the most original things about the game. Even though none of the functions are new in and of themselves, I've never played a role playing game where you can climb onto a dragon and slash at its heart, or climb onto a cyclops' head and stab its eye, or mount a chimera and cut its snake tail off, and then kill the goat and lion. It's fantastic, and there are plenty of them to be had. It never feels too repetitive either, since there are so many different ways to approach battle with them. It's especially fun once you're a sufficiently high level, because then you are be more inventive and experimental with your approaches.The third noteworthy thing about the game that I loved was the variety and depth of the items. I put 60-70 hours into the game, exploring most of it quite thoroughly, and I know there are probably dozens of items and crafting materials I haven't even found yet. Most enemies drop loot, and there are chests, barrels, crates, plants, minerals, and an assortment of other items to be found, picked up, combined, used to enhance weapons and armor, or just sold for some major cashola. If you played Capcom's awesome Resident Evil 5, you'll be familiar with the inventory and combining system. Except in the case of Dragon's Dogma there are hundreds and hundreds of items to be acquired. It keeps the game feeling fresh when you're interested to find or use various new rare items to enhance weapons and armor. Each weapon and piece of armor in the game has a 3 star tiered rating system. The first tier only costs money to upgrade to. And then the second and third tiers require a specific number of a specific item to upgrade to. The better or more rare the equipment, the more expensive and difficult it will be to find those items.Another worthy mention goes to the landmass of the game itself. The world of Gransys is quite large, even if it isn't terribly varied. Elevation is used frequently to change things up a bit, and it works well, providing long falls for unlucky enemies (or adventurers).So on to the bad parts of the game. There are going to be more than four things listed here, but I still maintain that hidden in the mess that is Dragon's Dogma is a truly good game.There are two main problems with the game, and I could go back and forth about which one is more irritating all night: The (lack of) fast travel, and the way pawns interact with the world.First off, fast travel is almost nonexistent. There are items called Ferrystones that you can carry with you that will instantly teleport you back to the biggest city in the game world. Aside from that, eventually you will also be able to take what's called a Portcrystal with you, which you can set down anywhere in the world and then your Ferrystones will transport you there instead of the city. And that's it. You get one Portcrystal, and aside from that, you can only teleport to the main city. This becomes more frustrating the more you play the game, unless you're a masochist, because the world is quite large. And not only is it quite large, but since the terrain is so varied, you cannot ever travel any great distance in a straight line, so you end up sprinting until you're almost out of breath, and then jogging while your stamina regenerates, and then sprinting again. And over and over and over to your destination. The game tries to provide a couple of shortcuts between areas of the world, but it's really not very helpful. A lot of your time in game will be spent running from one place to another. Not only does this get really grinding after a while, but enemies also respawn in the exact same places every time, so you will have the exact same fights again, and again, and again. And then some more. To the point where I pretty just ran past them and kept going. Because it got so tedious. And then if you don't have a Ferrystone, you have to run all the way back to where you came from. And not only that, butSecondly, your main pawn and the two you can also have with you will repeat the exact same lines of dialog when you hit certain markers in the game. The exact same lines, in the exact spots, every single time. It got so annoying I went to the options to see if I could turn off the voice volume for just the pawns. You can't, unfortunately. If I had a quarter for every time I heard the phrase \"Perhaps we'll find aught of use,\" I would be seriously loaded. The main problems in the game all kind of flow into the other, and they make it quite a big mess. Even just describing it, it probably seems to someone who hasn't played the game like it's really not worth it to even give the game a chance. If you like highly polished games, you might want to pass on this one. So yeah, the pawns get really annoying after a while. If they would just change it so they only spoke when you initiate conversation with them.If Capcom fixed only those two problems, the fast travel and the pawn irritation, the game would easily earn a four star rating from me. However, those aren't the only problems with the game...As stated, fighting normal enemies becomes tedious after a while, because they appear and respawn in the same places every time. It makes that combat repetitive and very boring, even though the combat itself is pretty fun. There are only so many ways you can kill goblins after the four or five hundredth one.Texture pop isn't actually an issue that I noticed in the game. What is an issue though, is people pop. From the start of the game all the way through, I'd find myself running into people because the streets would be empty, and then suddenly three appear, and then ten, and then twenty-five, all of a sudden. It's not so much an irritation as it just feels lazy. There's no way they didn't come across it when they beta-tested it.Lip-syncing is godawful. Which is to say it's laughably bad, or just nonexistent. I don't particularly care if lip-syncing is bad, but this isn't even bad, it's like the already bad lip-syncing wasn't matched the recorded audio, so characters are speaking when their lips aren't moving, and vice versa. Another thing that just felt pretty lazy.Side quests are extremely boring and unoriginal. Most of them fall under two categories: escort missions, and kill set number of [this creature]. Almost all quests not in those categories are main story-related. Kind of disappointing. I think this might be because there are only actually two cities in the whole game world. And no real villages or just lone houses at all. So there aren't quirky people giving you odd quests out in the middle of nowhere.One of the most bizarre things to me about the game was the \"love interest\" aspect. Or lack of, I don't even know. I'm still not sure if it's possible to even have an implied relationship with any of the characters you meet. I think this is one thing that maybe I just don't get, because I'm not a fan of Eastern-style RPG's, and am much more used to there being a clearly defined list of things that can or won't happen in a game as far as role playing relationships. There are a few cutscenes in the game where your character will exchange...let's call them \"significant stares\" with other characters...and then that's it. It's never revisited or mentioned again or anything. And I'm not sure what the point of it is, or what the payoff is either. It's just kind of baffling to me. Music swells and two digital people are staring into each others' eyes not saying anything...and then it ends and nothing.The save system is also lacking. The game only allows one save slot. It autosaves, and you can save when you want as well. But it's all one save file. If it corrupts, you're screwed. I imagine this will be one of the first things addressed if and when there is a patch for the game. But poor design in the first place, and pretty unacceptable for an RPG.The last thing I can mention are the graphics, which I'm only mentioning so I can say that if a game is engrossing enough, graphics really don't matter that much. And in this game, they don't. They are function-only, and it works that way. I'd much rather have this deep and varied universe with pared-down graphics than a gorgeous backdrop with no real substance.So, with so much working against a game, how can I possibly still actually like it? The honest answer is I don't know. I think because the things I like about it outweigh the things I don't like about it, and because I see a ton of potential for this to become a really good franchise if certain simple changes were made. Towards the end of the game I was really reminded of playing Alpha Protocol, which is another highly flawed game that I really liked. So much was wrong with it, and yet I loved it, and saw great potential for it to grow into something really great. That won't happen now, of course, but as with it, I think if Dragon's Dogma gets a sequel, it will be far better than this one as long as a few key things are addressed.If you're on the fence, I would recommend you at least rent the game to see if it's something you'd like. As I said before, I'm convinced there's a really great game buried in this mess. As I did, you will probably alternate between total immersion and utter boredom. In my opinion though, its pros outweigh its innumerable cons.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006VB2W08","description":"","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"A must buy launch title","reviewText":"When the original PSP launched, eager gamers weren't really given many choices in good launch titles.  Most hardware launches are saddled with ports and quick money grabs that lack the quality of games released months later.  So it was with the PSP, and this eager gamer couldn't care less because it had one awesome gem: Lumines (pronounced luminous).  When I had that game in my hands, it didn't bother me that the PSP didn't have a single other great game that appealed to me.  I'd just sit there happily bobbing away to the infectious music and the addicitive puzzle experience.  So now we have the PS Vita launch and, surprisingly, there's quite a few launch games that are actually really good.  But, again, this eager gamer could care less because I have Lumines: Electronic Symphony.  And I don't need anything else.Electronic Symphony is very similar to the Lumines I've known and loved.  Squares containing differing patterns of two colors still fall from the top of the screen.  The object is still to make a block of four or more of the same color.  A bar still moves horizontal across the screen.  The music and images still mix perfectly with the action on the screen, building as you string combos together until you're assaulted in an audio-visual splendor of sound and graphics.  And it's still the most addictive and fun puzzle game I have ever played.  You don't mess with perfection.Although developers Q? Entertainment did.  Incorporating some of the Vita's defining features, Q? added some interesting functionality to the game.  You can control the action the traditional way with the directional pad and buttons, or you can also use the touch screen.  I'm not a fan of touch screen controls for puzzle games and I don't think it's very practical once the speed picks up in the later levels (or \"skins\").  A more substantial gameplay affecting addition is a new special gem that rearranges the board.  I'm not sure how I feel about this new addition because sometimes it can completely destroy my complex design that I'm building; however, in later skins, it can sometimes be a difference between game over and continuing if it comes at the right moment and rearranges your quickly filling up board.The final unique change is that your avatar can present you with special abilities.  For example, the beginning avatar will give you a special block with a jewel in the middle that allows you to chain touching colors together, even if they aren't in a 2x2 block.  Your avatar's skill needs to be filled to 100% before it can be deployed, requiring you to chain skills together to fill it up or by using the other Vita functionality: the rear touchpad.  If you tap on the back of the PS Vita, it will slowly recharge your ability even faster.  While I do like the concept of it and it ties directly into the whole musicality of the game, I wish it was used a bit more intrinsic to the songs.  All you do is tap on the back as fast as you can.  It can be distracting at times and I think Q? missed a golden opportunity in not requiring you to tap in time with the beat to fill the ability quicker.  As it is, just tapping away furiously fills it, which seems to go against the whole presentation of the action, sound and visuals tying together.As for the song list, I'm glad to see Lumines go back towards its electronic roots.  Q? brought together quite a diverse array of artists and songs to make up the 34 track list, including some well-known artists like LCD Soundsystem, The Chemical Brothers, Faithless, Aphex Twin and Mark Ronson, as well as artists I've never heard of like Kaskade, The Go! Team and others.  It's a very diverse and impressive electronic list.Ultimately, while I find my time pulled in different directions with my Vita since it actually has a surprisingly good launch line up (Uncharted, Rayman Origins and Escape Plan are stealing a lot of my time), I still keep going back to Lumines: Electronic Symphony.  It's fantastic and just as much of a puzzler masterpiece as it was when it launched on the original PSP.  Definitely a must purchase for your new Vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

For its day the graphics was awesome, the gore was a nice over the top gimmick nobody else was doing, and it was a fun mono a mono game to play with my friends.This version gets a nice graphics update and the Characters look nice and crisp.  The DC super heroes look very detailed and just very well done.  Not only that but they provide a lot of cut sceens to explain how these two groups have come together and why they are fighting.  Playing through the story mode was entertaining and even unlocks a new character to play as.The controls are very similar to the older games so if that is what you like, then you should be right at home.  For me the controls felt clunky and dated compared to other games on the market these days.  The combat while offering combos and such is not as fluid as Soul Caliber or Tekken to name a few but is very similar to the controls from the original games.  The issue I see is that technology has advanced a lot in those years and games can do a lot more.I did enjoy some of the extra combat stuff such as knocking people down a floor or through a wall.  Those were neat gimmicks but not much more than that.Overall the game is fun but falls short of what a modern fighter game should be.  The addition of the DC is great and well done which makes the game for me.  I am still glad we got this game used but the other games we have are getting more play time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2009"}

Little to my knowledge one of my friends was paying attention and then *bam* there it was out of the blue...literally the box it blue...(just kidding) there it was, he had bought it and gave it to me as Christmas early, said if he hadn't he'd have ended up opening it up and playing it.  I wouldn't have blamed him either, the device is amazingly small, much, much smaller than the one I bought with a slide open lid, something more becoming of the original ps1 or \"thin\" ps2 but with darn near 10 times the space inside.  The technology has also improved, having wifi @ my home I'd occationally have a decent enough signal to pull up hulu or amazon prime on the ps3 but it would always have buffering problems.  The new one has little to no problems, streaming video with ease, and with the addition of an HDMI cable (sold separately) connecting to my TV...wow the quality of the games, of the movies and blue ray discs...  Outstanding!  Then there's the game, Assassin's Creed 3 obviously follow the franchise, but it's simple enough that beginners could easily learn, and what's more the game is during the American Revolution a fantastic work of fantasy that the creatures took painstaking efforts to get right down to the minor details of the Native American tribal grounds and language.

The \"new super mario bros\" concept has been done too many times. This game in some aspects is more primitive than its 8 and 16 bit counterparts. In super mario bros 3, you can hold about 32 - 40 items, dont remember the exact number, but in this game you can only hold ten. Also in super mario world, the first new super mario bros and super masrio 3D land, you get to hold a secondary item that automatically drops down when you become small mario. There are star coins in the game you can collect, but there is almost no incentive for collecting them. In the previous mario games, collecting star coins in the previous mario game allows you to unlock certain gates or play bonus levels in the overworld.Another problem I have with this game is the challenge mode. The pacing of the difficulty in this challenge mode is just terrible. There is a difference from challenging and just being cheap and unfair. Many of them need to be done perfectly and in a specific way to be completed. The challenge mode is just hours of frustration, But one major complain i have about this game is that it is not in 3d. It is basically the same game from the DS from 2006. There has not been enough 3D mario games that are inspired by super mario sunshine or super mario 64. Nintendo does not care about its true fans, they are only releasing gimmicky games that look nice but take little to no effort to create.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2013"}

You put it in, it's still the same game (Madden), with some tweaks, and you can get right into it.  Pretty smooth gameplay without requiring a PhD to play.  They've added something called Madden IQ, so it constantly tracks how you're doing, making even Madden a competitive pressure-cooker for the truly obsessed who curse themselves for dumb plays, turnovers, and sloppy execution.  Actually, this feature is supposed to adjust the difficulty to your level on multiple fronts (pass offense, run defense, etc).  Or you can play the old levels.It's all here.  And who am I kidding?  I just got the thing, I've not played every feature.  It doesn't matter.  You're either gonna get Madden, or you won't.  The reviews are not going to be bad---EA is not going to put out a 'bad' game, just a undercooked version now and then.  Whatever--just get it, if you're thinking about it.And I like to heroic music paying during the instant replays.After further consideration (re: hours), Madden 09 is right up there with the classics.  It's still Madden, it still has its little quirks in the service of the best game engine.  They still love interceptions, sacks are tough to get, you will scream at the TV, and you'll be downloading the songs that much quicker, at least the ones you like.

{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"Huge RE disappointment","reviewText":"While it may have \"Resident Evil\" in its title, Operation Raccoon City is about as far away from the Resident Evil series as a game staring Mario and Luigi would be.  Emphasizing squad-based, cover action shooting far over survival horror, Raccoon City seems determined to drive the final nail in the coffin of the long-running series.In terms of Resident Evil continuity, the game is set around the time of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis at the time of the outbreak in Raccoon City .  Umbrella Security Service (USS) Delta team enters the Raccoon City Underground Laboratory, to rendezvous with Alpha team leader HUNK. Their mission is to stop Dr. Birkin from handing over his T-Virus research to the U.S. military and retrieve the G-virus.  Little do they know that Birkin has infected himself with the virus, turning himself into something looking like Moe Howard of the Three Stooges crossed with the Incredible Hulk...with a giant eye on his right shoulder.  I kid you not...I could not make this stuff up.  What sounds like an interesting storyline in theory turns into a horridly executed mess.There are multiple playable characters in the game such as Vector, a recon expert who is equipped with a cloaking ability; Beltway, the explosives expert; Bertha, the medic; Spectre, the marksman; Four Eyes, the scientist, with the ability to program the bio-organic weapons; and Lupo, who is the team leader.  You can play single player or co-op mode with 4 players.  You can also play single but allow other players online to join at anytime or make the game private.  Here's a big hint...PLAY CO-OP!!!  RE: Operation Raccoon City has just about the worst AI-controlled teammates in any game I've ever seen.  These pylons are damn near useless as they will only be too happy to let you get pummeled by Birkin-Hulk as they stand around small-talking.  Ok, ok...I'm exaggerating but not much.Furthermore you have no control over this group of NPCs and they will wander off, into areas already completed or into mines.  They seem to do almost no damage against enemy forces, leaving you to do the bulk of the killing and also absorb the lion's share of the attacks.  About the only useful purpose of the AI characters is that Bertha will throw a cure your way when you're hurt.  But when you combine the fact that ammo is always in short supply (as is typical for RE games), most of the enemy killing is on your shoulders, and enemies are bullet sponges that seem to take at least 6 rounds or more to take down, it makes for a problematic experience to say the least.  On the plus side though, the enemy AI is just as atrocious, even for the foes who are not mindless zombies but still act like they are.And here's another gem of gameplay stupidity...the cover in the game is automatic.  Rather than hitting the X button for example to crouch behind an object or slide behind a wall, you virtually stick to any wall you go near.  So much for tactical play!  Things do improve a bit once you start encountering the zombies.  A well placed headshot can take them down and at least there is some gratification there with a spray of blood...far more of a reaction than you get by shooting enemy soldiers.  The brutal kill melee system is also fun but becomes repetitive.  Visually RE: Operation Raccoon City gets no better.  It's muddy, dark, and gloomy.  To a certain respect it fits with the tone but one would think the laboratories would have more of a clean, bright, sterilized look to them.Besides the campaign mode the game features four multi-player modes, each supporting up to eight players. Heroes mode offers a four-on-four team match that lets you play as notable RE characters (Leon Kennedy, Claire Redfield, Jill Valentine). Biohazard is basically capture the flag, only you're trying to capture lost G-virus vials. Survivors is a fight for survival against human and computer-controlled enemies that doesn't end until the extraction helicopter arrives, and Team Attack is a team deathmatch.  Multilplayer somewhat improves the value of Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon city but it can't make up for horrid gameplay and uninspired visuals.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

I had 3 of the smaller version with no analog sticks at the time and I pushed the newer version aside and labeled it as too big.  When I finally bought a PS2 in 2002 it came with a Dual Shock 2.  I have since changed my opinion about the Dual Shock 2.  The PS2 controller is perfect for people of all ages and hand sizes.  I've tried out the Dreamcast, Xbox, and Gamecube controllers and I have to say that they all fail in comparison to the simple, yet wonderful design of the Dual Shock 2.  The Dreamcast controller was horribly designed period.  Nintendo and Microsoft seemed to have good intentions when designing their controllers but their awkward designs are uncomfortable and hurt your hands after using them for an extended period of time.  Microsoft even released a redesigned version of its Xbox controller that emulates this one.  Several companies like Logitech model their PC controllers after this one as well.  This controller is durable as well.  I had 2 Dual Shocks for the PS1 and still have them today (you can also use them on most PS2 games, eliminating the need to buy an extra controller when buying a PS2 system).  I've never had the analog sticks break nor the vibration function to malfunction.Sony has earned universal acclaim from gamers for its superior controller design.

A hybrid between vampire horror and Western shoot-em up.  If you're looking for a first person shooter, Darkwatch is the game fore you.Capcom offers intense gameplay and presents a original excellent presentation of new characters.It's refreshing to see a first person shooter with a theme that isn't played out which makes it well worth checking out.Jericho Cross hardly does the talking.  Others speak for him while he jumps and robs trains.By mistake you release the soul of Satan's son, Lazarus, who curses you to a vampire. He unleashes his undead minions to plague the old west.The only organization that can stop him is a secret army called the Darkwatch. Cassidy, one of the army's \"regulators\" witnesses what you did on the train. You'll spend the beginning of the game by her side, as she leads you back to the safety of Darkwatch. You begin to understand the new powers you have as a vampire.You'll of course have access to a variety of different weapons, ranging from pistols and rifles to my personal favorite the exploding crossbow and a rocket launcher.Each gun offers different strengths and weaknesses, and each one is fun to use in its own way. Since the enemies in Darkwatch take location-based damage, it's possible to blow off the heads and limbs of most enemies with the more powerful guns.Each gun also offers you a powerful melee attack, and the weaker enemies in the game will actually go down with just one satisfying strike.The power of these attacks and pacing of the gameplay make melee a viable option, particularly in caves or other close-quarters areas. You'll also have access to dynamite that you can throw, which serves the same role as a grenade.Stationary turrets are also sprinkled throughout the later levels. Cross can carry only two weapons at a time, so you'll often need to make important tactical decisions about which guns you want to pick up and drop as you make your way through each of the game's single-player missions.It all adds up to fast-paced, eye catching gameplay that will keep you entertained throughout Darkwatch's single-player missions.Your vampire powers will become the key to staying alive even though your undead. Which seems like a plot loop hole at first but once you realize that he quickly regenerates his health, I'm sure I won't find you complaing about this when 20 skeletons come running at you with TNT or butcher knives.One of my personal favorate powers is the double-jump!  You basically feel like you can fly and control your direction in midair, which is useful for getting up on rooftops or jumping from steep ledge to ledge.  Don't worry, there isn't any real platforming neccessary in the game. Another vampire-related power is the blood shield, which acts more or less like the shield in Halo.You'll love your blood shield and then get back behind cover and let it recharge before taking damage.Blood vision is another Vamp Power that will allow you to see the weapon pick ups and power-ups by highlighting  the screen.Enemies leave behind blood clouds that not only increase your health and powers but follow you when you get near.This makes the BEST Auto health restore and Save feature in any game I have seen to date.  No only does it replenish your health but it also charges up a special power meter, which lets you unleash your special vampire powers once full.There are eight total of these special powers in the game, four that are \"good\" and four that are \"evil\".  These unlock throughout the campaign as you come across innocent victims who've been cursed by Lazarus.One cool feature is that you choose to cleanse their souls \"GOOD\" or devour them for your own selfish pleasure \"BAD\".As you make choices, you build a reputation as either good or evil. So you're encouraged to stick with one side until you've maxed out your powers then start choosing the other.This aspect of the game probably sounds more interesting than it actually is, as the choices you make don't really affect the story, aside from one major choice you make toward the end that determines which one of the two different endings you'll see.The single-player campaign of Darkwatch is varied, but definitely not lengthy. A single play-through shouldn't take more than 10 hours for most people (FIVE for me personally) and even if you went back to the mission that branches the storyline and replayed from there to see the second ending, it would only add about an hour or two more to your gameplay time. The good news is that while the game is short, it's pretty fun while it lasts. There's a good variety of monsters to fight against, ranging from scythe- and gun-wielding skeletons and zombies, to banshees that float around high in the air, to blood-spitting demons.  These repeat throughout the game.The endgame boss fights are also fairly challenging, but not overly frustrating, as the midpoint of each fight acts as a checkpoint.Darkwatch's enemies offer no rest for the weary.Speaking of checkpoints, Darkwatch's missions include a liberal amount of them, which is good as it helps keep the action flowing. The designers also did a good job of keeping the actual missions varied. A couple of missions have you fighting on horseback, including one where you must eventually try to jump onto a train. Another mission has you driving a heavily armed buggy, which lets you run over lots of skeletons, a la Army of Darkness. Yet another is set in daylight, where your vampire powers are useless. This is a particularly intense level, as you desperately fight from shadow to shadow in order to maintain your shield and other abilities.Darkwatch's presentation values match the excellence of its gameplay. The graphical style has a very comic book feel to it, with the slightly exaggerated proportions of Cross and the other Darkwatch team members. The other character models in the game are well detailed and animate nicely. Perhaps one of the nicest touches is the location-based damage. There's nothing in the game quite as satisfying as seeing the bad guys literally come apart from the limbs. That is, unless you prefer the fun rag-doll effects from dynamite and TNT explosions. The generous number of cutscenes advances the story between most of the missions, and as for any graphical differences between the two versions of the game, there really aren't any. Both the PS2 and Xbox games look near-on identical, so you're not missing much graphically if you go with one version or the other. The game's sound quality is also very good, with kitschy Western tunes as the soundtrack, and impactful sound effects punctuating every explosion and gunshot. Though Cross oddly never utters a single word throughout the game, the extensive voice work for the other characters is noteworthy. Video game veteran Jennifer Hale voices your guide, Cassidy, and Charmed vixen Rose McGowan lends her voice to Tala, who plays your sultry sidekick later in the game.The game's visuals offer up a delightfully dark atmosphere.Unfortunately, it seems that the work that went into creating such a compelling single- player campaign in Darkwatch was not matched for the multiplayer aspect. The game offers online competitive play for up to 16 players over Xbox Live, as well as split-screen action for offline play (which is the only multiplayer you can get on the PlayStation 2). There is a solid selection of maps, based on levels from the single-player game, as well as original ones designed specifically for multiplayer. Only a small handful of game modes are offered, which include your usual deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag, rendering the multiplayer aspect of the game much like any other first person shooter. You're pretty much just running about looking for the best weapons to blow away your other enemies who are also running down the weapon spawns. The only unique game mode is something called soul hunter, where players run about the map collecting blood in order to fill their blood meter before the other players do. None of these modes are especially great, so if you are looking for a game specifically for the multiplayer action, you may want to give pause before you consider Darkwatch.Despite the lack of satisfying multiplayer, Darkwatch's enjoyable single-player campaign and satisfying run-and-gun action make it an appealing shooter that's easy to recommend. The game's excellent presentation and unique style should also make it attractive for action fans seeking a shooter that doesn't rely on one of the tried-and-true settings, but still offers excellent action.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005MA97","description":"This is an original PS1 memory card Not branded or manufactured by Sony by fully compatible with the Playstation System.","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"awesome","reviewText":"I received a Playstation memory card as a birthday present in July 1996. Unfortunately, one year later I started seeing that everything was going 3D, and that was the preferred choice among most gaming fans because everyone wanted realism, and me, growing up with the Super NES, wanted the PSX to continue having 2D games. It didn't turn out that way, and I decided in 1997 that video games were something I didn't need to bother with anymore.Warp ahead to 2005. I want to go back and discover old games I had missed the first time around. It turns out I missed a LOT of good games. First of all, here's the games I had from 1996-1999 (yeah, I continued to buy games after 1997, but not that many)-- Crash Bandicoot (the first one)- Mortal Kombat Trilogy- Mortal Kombat 3- Loaded- Road Rash- WWF Wrestlemania: Arcade Game- WWF In Your House- Syphon Filter- Dino Crisis- Castlevania: Symphony of the NightThat was it. Back then I thought for certain Mortal Kombat Trilogy would go down as the best fighter of all-time. Funny stuff! I also thought Loaded and Wrestlemania: the Arcade Game would be considered classics, too. I had NO idea that Castlevania game would still be considered popular in the year 2007. Owning that game when it came out was the best decision I made back then.That means I missed out on such wonderful, influential games like the Resident Evil series, Silent Hill, Medal of Honor, Metal Gear Solid, Dino Crisis 2, Crash Bandicoot 2 and 3, a whole bunch of RPG's, the Spyro series, the Mega Man Legends series (including X4) and a lot more.I have to be honest with you- I'm really glad I discovered these games in the year 2005-2007 (and I'm not done) because if I had gotten into them back when they first came out, memories of high school (I hated it with a passion) would have caused a distraction and a lingering feeling in the back of my head sparking memories I'd rather forget. I was in high school from '96-2000. Those were important years in the life of the Playstation. It was good to get away from gaming back then.So I'm happy I cleared my head and bought a bunch of fresh classics the last couple years. Even that Castlevania game sparks memories I'd rather forget. Luckily, nothing lasts forever, and the memories are starting to fade so I can approach those games I originally bought (and received) in a clear-minded light. However, if I DIDN'T have to go to high school, I'd love to go back and experience some of these games for the first time. Especially Silent Hill. Probably my favorite PSX game at the moment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"A Customer","summary":"Serious FPS!","reviewText":"First person shooter fans, remember that feeling you got when you first played DOOM, or Duke Nukem 3D?!

Now, Yoshi and the four young superstars must set out on a wild and colorful quest to rescue the kids and investigate the ominous island hovering overhead. Thanks to the power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of Yoshi's Island span two screens.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Very good if you've never played the first Yoshi's Island.","reviewText":"Yoshi's Island for the SNES is usually hailed as one of the best platformers of all time. Not just on the SNES, but on any system. It took everything that made Super Mario World great, and went further, adding a couple of basic yet innovative elements to the gameplay, and had a distinctive style of its own. Everything looked like it was drawn in crayon, but didn't look too kiddy. It's also one of those rare games that still holds up if you play it today. But the game went a long time without a true sequel. Yoshi's Story on the Nintendo 64 was ok, but got a mixed reaction from the fans, mostly because of the visual style being aimed more towards younger kids. So how does Yoshi's Island DS do? Well, long story short, it'll be a blast for people who never played the original Yoshi's Island, but for everyone else, this feels more like a remake of the original than it does a true sequel.The story here is a lot like the first game's- you play as a bunch of different colored Yoshis on their island, trying to reunite Baby Mario with Baby Luigi, and freeing other babies and the stork from Bower's clutches. But this time, there's more to the story thanks to short cutscenes that are actually pretty cute and funny if you pay attention to them. As Yoshi, you'll run, jump, eat, throw eggs and butt-stomp your way through dozens of levels, defeating castle bosses and finally making it to Bowser. Levels get increasingly difficult as you go on, especially ones where you need to go through different paths in the same stage just to get multiple keys to open doors. Some levels have special transformation bubbles that, when you touch them, Yoshi turns into vehicles(!) like a helicopter, digging mole machine, or a submarine. Most of the enemies in the game are your standard Koopa, Piranha Plant and Shy Guy, but there are lots of odd enemies as well like the indestructible giant Chomps. And as the game goes on, you'll get new characters to ride on Yoshi, each one with a unique ability that makes them useful. Well...most of the time. All in all, anyone who's ever played a Super Mario game will have no trouble adjusting to Yoshi's Island DS. It's pure platforming fun, and fairly long, especially if you want to get the bonus stages in each world, which requires getting all the red coins, stars and flowers in each stage.So if it's so fun, why am I giving it 3 stars overall? Like I said earlier, there's not much new for this game. Gameplay is very much the same, as is the level design. Pretty grassy area, cliff area, cave area, castle. A lot of stages look the same, and a couple of them strongly resemble levels from the first Yoshi's Island. I could've done with some more unique new enemies too, especially the boss fights. The standard boss fight here is a regular monster grows to gigantic proportions when Kamek the wizard Koopa uses his magic on it, and most of them are beaten using regular tactics, though one ghost that uses the bottom screen as a mirror was pretty dang cool. This might not bug some people, and it doesn't make the game any less fun, but more variety would've been appreciated, and I expected a little more for a sequel for such a praised game after all these years. There's also the multiple characters thing, with Mario, Peach, Donkey Kong and Wario (and another towards the end that was a bit of a surprise) riding Yoshi. Throughout the level, there are stork signs that let Yoshi switch out who's riding on him. Mario can make red blocks with the letter 'M' appear and causes Yoshi to run faster and jump further. Peach has a little umbrella that lets Yoshi float around wherever there's a strong wind current (they're more frequent than you'd expect). Donkey Kong can climb vines and has a super strong rush attack, but slows Yoshi down a bit. The same applies for Wario, but his ability is that he has a magnet that pulls coins towards him, and he can move metal platforms/blocks with magnet symbols on them. Honestly, Wario is essentially useless, since the metal blocks and platforms are few and far between, and most of the time, I found alternate routes for getting around them. He's really not very useful at all, and most of the time you'll be using one of the other three babies. Wario seemed like an afterthought for when the game was nearly done.Visually, the game looks MUCH better than the first Yoshi's Island, and the animations are beautiful. The game doesn't push the DS to its limits by any means, but the art direction is a treat for the eyes, and there'd be times when I'd just let Yoshi stand there while I watch some of the animations on enemies and what was happening in the background. The music and sound effects are all what you'd expect, but none of the music got stuck in my head at all like, one again, the original's did. I hate to keep comparing the two, but it's just another thing that could've been improved.I don't know what happened, but Yoshi's Island DS apparently is no longer being made, or hasn't been for at least the past year. It's not worth more than the original price it sold for, but if you can get it for that much or cheaper, it should provide you with some platforming fun, and a few challenging levels. But for anyone hoping for a new experience giving them the same feeling they got when playing the SNES game, you may be disappointed. Don't let that stop you from trying the game though- as you can see I gave it a 4/5 for fun and a 3/5 overall. This is still a good game, but it just could've been better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2011"}

I'm an experienced gamer, gaming since the early 80's when the Commodore 64 was out (yes, I'm dating myself) and have kept gaming up until the present.  We have 2 Wii, 2 PS3, 2 Nintendo 3DS, and 1 Nintendo DSi consoles in our home.  Suffice it to say that I've played many games and I'm used to varying levels of difficulty as well as ranges of playability.So understand that Deer Drive Legends' playability is, indeed, frustrating.  In addition to constantly swerving around for a target (don't bother with the D-pad or analog button - they won't help) by using the touch pad, you are also simultaneously trying to shoot with the top buttons.  REALLY?!?  If that wasn't bad enough, it doesn't seem like the targeting is all that effective and unless your target is less than 80 feet away, forget about trying to hit something running at full force in one direction versus another.The 3D aspect of this game actually seems to be a detriment to the gameplay rather than an enhancer.  The fact that they bombard you with the \"oooo...look it's 3D!!!\" aspect by constantly zooming in and out of the game's opening splash screen is bad enough...I was already getting a bad feeling about it from the get-go.  The gameplay aspect is even worse.  My vision is nearly 20/10, but I had a hard time picking out a doe from a deer and by the time I had correctly assessed my target, it was already gone.  Even with the brightness fully cranked, the game seems dark to me.I tried the first level for a full hour and nearly threw my 3DS through the window out of frustration.  The game controls are finnicky and hard to use and it's far from fun.  If I'm having this much trouble at the beginning, I can't imagine what \"hard\" is going to look like...nor do I even want to try.Even if this game were $19.99, I wouldn't bother.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Better than expected","reviewText":"With the recent slew of comic based films hitting theaters, video games based on the films are along for the ride as well.  Most of these games hardly live up tp their licenses, but The Hulk almost succeeds where others have failed.  Long time fans of the comic series will appreciate the game's storyline, which manages to tie the events in the upcoming Hulk film with events from the comic, and features appearances from Hulk regulars Betty Ross and The Leader.  Where The Hulk shines is where most other games get repetitive: you basically run around from the beginning of the level to the end of the level smashing and bashing anything and everything you can.  It sounds boring, but believe me, it is pretty fun getting to smash down walls, throw around enemies, and generally wreak as much havok as humanly possible.  The basis of The Hulk is as simple as that, but where the game begins to sag are during the segments where you play as The Hulk's human alter ego Bruce Banner in a few stealth like missions that don't seem as well put together as the sequences where you play as The Hulk.  Also, the level designs get very repititious after a while, and while some may wow at first glance, they can quickly become quite bland.  The graphics are very well done, combining cell-shading designs and 3-D environments to give the game a gritty, comic book feel to it.  The sound is substandard and your basic action game fare, but the presence of The Hulk film star Eric Bana providing his voice is a very welcome addition.  Despite it's flaws, The Hulk is one of the best licensed (comic or film) games to come along this year, and next to all the other hyped licensed games (Blade 2, Reign of Fire, X2: Wolverine's Revenge, and oh yes, Enter the Matrix), The Hulk clearly outshines them all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2003"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Socom II offers a wide range of guns to choose from and an awesome online experience. If your thinking it's like a Halo game when it takes 60 bullets to kill someone, you're wrong. Socom II has a more realistic gameplay and it takes about 1-5 bullets to kill someone that if you actually hit them. Don't get the game unless you have a broadband connection because the single player experience is alright, but the multiplayer is what makes the game have any value. You can play up to 16 people online. 8 players per team. SEALs vs Terrorist in about 22 levels. I have to warn you about glitchers or so called \"noobs\" and \"scrubs.\" There are many glitches in the game, but most of the time people don't glitch. There are rooms called \"GNK\" (Glitch No Kill) where people practice glitching. And the people that call people \"noobs\" and \"scrubs\" are just whinning because they suck and can't get a kill. The noob/scrub guns are the IW-80-A2 and the M14. I'll break down the game.Graphics: 4.5/5 The graphics are pretty well done with the shadow effects and the rain falling in the water. The cinimatics are nicely put together.Controls: 5/5 This is pretty much the only third-person shooter I've played, and by far the best of them. The controls are easy to get use to and you can toggle different controls on and off.Sound: 4.5/5 The sound is very excellent in this game. The effects of gernades blowing up in your face and the explosions of the bridges are absolutely fabulous.Fun: 5/5 Socom II is fun right when you enter a game, but when you first play it, its a little hard, but you'll get use to it. The game has a very high replay value along with the nice ranking system. But I have to say that some people rank up. One thing though. You must get the Sony Headset for the game.

I recommend Duracell or Energizer batteries for thiswireless controller.The only downside to this system is that it does not playoriginal Xbox games even though it has a 4GB Hard Drive anddoes not come with an internet adapter.The system includes the following:Xbox 360 4GB S ConsoleXbox 360 Black Wireless ControllerXbox 360 Composite A/V cable (standard definition)One Month Xbox LIVE Gold Membership1 year limited warranty on consoleAll in all a great system.I bought mine from Gamestop brand new for $220with tax and it worked great for well over a year beforeI had to trade it in for cash during a financial crisisI had.Overall, I give this system 4/5 stars.This is my Gamestop review of the system btw:The Xbox 360 4GB system was a good buy from my localGamestop for $199.99 brand new plus $20 tax overa year ago when I bought it.I had no problems setting it up; it was pretty easyto do and the software that comes with it or operatingsystem is easy to use as well.With a 4GB hard drive built in it you'll have plentyof room for saving games; 1 game save takes upanywhere from 4MB of ram to 16MB of ram.The graphics are excellent and on par with thefastest gaming PC's running ATI and Geoforcegraphics cards; I think Microsoft may have includedone in this system and other Xbox 360's as wellThe sound is great though both the graphics andsound are better running on a flat screen TV.  I havea 13' TV at the moment that has AI input and RFU inputand I had to buy a RFU adapter for the Xbox 360 as theAVI input does not work on it. The Xbox 360 still looks fineand sounds ok running on an older TV set from the 90'sand an RFU adapter. The system can hook up to S-videoand composite ports and AV ports I think as well as HDMIones as well. You'll have to buy an RFU adapter separatelywhich I found on Amazon for the Xbox 360.The Xbox 360 can play DVD's and music CD's like theoriginal Xbox can and does a good job of it though sometimescertain DVD's cannot be played or have trouble running or withthe picture or sounds sometimes both at the same time.The wireless Xbox 360 controller is nice and hassle freewhen it comes to not worrying about a cord to trip overor getting twisted and tangled up  However you may wantto invest in a controller with a wire in it as two AA batteriesonly last about 28-30 hours at most though some may lastlonger. The controller is heavy and big and takes getting usedto as well.The system is quiet and not loud. It is capable of connectingto the internet for DLC downloads, multiplayer and other stuffbut not internet browsing like on the Playstation 3 or NintendoWii which really sucks. It is Wi-Fi enabled and comes with anEthernet adapter as well.Be careful if not standing the system up to not spill anythingon top of the system as this is where the fan is and it can ruinit. I prefer to keep my system laying down and not standing upanyway.The only drawback to this system is that you cannot playoriginal Xbox games on it straight out of the box and haveto invest more money to buy a Xbox 360 hard drive to playoriginal Xbox games on it which is lousy of Microsoft tomake people spend more money. For $50 more plus taxa 250GB system can run games straight out of the boxI am pretty sure. And again no internet browsing. TheInstruction manual is good and easy to read.All in all this is a solid system that is built well and  hasa ton of great games on it such as Oblivion, Skyrim,Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, GTA IV, and much more.I give it an 8 out of a 10 for being a good video game systemthough not a great one from Microsoft.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}

Ramos","summary":"Clash of the Titans","reviewText":"There's been a sad trend in multiplayer FPSs lately. It seems that games like Call of Duty and Battlefield have taken a page from the Apple playbook and decided they could maximize profits by playing it safe and offering customers more of what they're used to with minor updates to provide incentive. That's not necessarily a terrible thing in every case (look at Madden for instance, same thing every year with a new coat of paint), but it is for the shooter genre which has infinitely more creative potential. That being said, Titanfall is a breath of fresh air for myself and many other fans of the genre. It's a bold new take in a market that's been stagnant for too long. And though it does have it's faults, it has more than enough strengths to tip the balance in it's favor.I've decided to focus on the NEW features of the game for this review, since basically everyone is familiar with the core elements of an FPS (aim down sights, put bullets into things that aren't you until those things are dead).[Titans]:These 30 ft. tall mechs are the real stars of the show in this game and after playing it, it's easy to see why. The Titan gameplay is definitely a refreshing and somewhat relieving change of pace for an online multiplayer shooter. Some have wondered why the addition of Titans in an FPS is a \"gamechanger\" for the genre. Here are the 3 biggest reasons.1). DurabilityPlaying as a Titan is in stark contrast to the COD/BF formula, where your soldier feels about as fragile as tissue paper against your opponents. In a Titan you no longer have to worry about \"campers\", \"spawnkilling\", \"noobtubers\", C4 or even lag! There are really no cheap deaths with Titans and everyone gets a fair chance to live for more than 10 seconds.2). Survivability (is that a word?)Titans are also different compared to vehicles in other games, like Battlefield, because Titans don't explode instantly when they're finished and they can also eject players. Basically that equates to being able to survive a vehicular destruction and continue playing on the same life. In most shooters with vehicles if the vehicle goes down, it's taking you with it. Or even if you manage to hop out at the last second, what are the chances that whatever destroyed your vehicle isn't going to blow you up as well? Thank you eject button!3). CustomizationPretty self explanatory, but it's still a first. In BF or Halo you simply find stock versions of vehicles scattered around the map. Now you can tweak these walking tanks to your liking in a variety of different ways to suit your playing style.[Bot Reinforcements]:This is something that may need some tweaking to reach it's full potential. Bots, or \"grunts\" and \"spectres\" as they're called in-game, populate much of the battlefield in Titanfall. They do a surprisingly solid job at creating a full scale war illusion. It takes a humble 6 vs 6 scenario and turns it into a massive conflict. They definitely bring something to the table, but for the most part they behave like they haven't really decided what they're supposed to do with they're gun yet. At times you'll encounter them and they'll simply stare for a moment before shooting you with what must be a pellet gun, because it awkwardly takes it's time sweet time to kill you. They can be dangerous in groups, but that's pretty much it. It's bad enough to make you feel embarassed when one kills you. But it's still plenty of fun to take them down. Everyone loves a free kill, and these guys practicaly gift wrap it for you. Perhaps they deliberately went for the brain-dead behavior so little kids or your golden retriever can take pride in the fact that they made something dead.[Multiplayer Campaign]:This is where the game falls short the most, but since this is a multiplayer ONLY game, it's hard to really be too disappointed about it. Even after playing through the campaign with both factions, you'll most likely have no idea what the story was about. There's simply too much going on in-game to pay attention to the talking heads that pop up intermittently. If they wanted to present a story, they should have done it in cutscenes, not while a Pilot is riding your Titan like Seabiscuit trying send it to robot heaven.[Burn Cards]:Burn cards are little bonus perks that are one life use only. You get them frequently, but you can only use 3 per match. Truth be told, they just seem very unnecessary and slightly unbalance an otherwise pretty well balanced game. For example, some of these cards will straight up give you an enhanced version of a gun that does more damage. That doesn't quite feel like an even playing field, but there are probably many who would disagree. However, there are also cards like Double XP that feel perfectly fine. So it's obviously a mixed bag here.[Jetpack]:You can finally double jump in a FPS... and it's beautiful. No, but seriously, it makes getting around so much easier and it's a lot of fun. Don't know why this is the first FPS to do this, platformers have been doing this for decades.[Parkour]:Overall, the parkour elements of wall running and wall jumping are pretty hit or miss. It's not that these moves don't work, it's just that there are numerous times where it can feel a bit clumsy and imprecise, resulting in maneuvers that can only be described as a fail.Pros:+Titans+Mentally Challenged Bots+Jetpack/Double Jump+Vehicle CustomizationCons: (All Very Minor)-Story Campaign-Burn Cards-Occasionally Clumsy ParkourOverall: 9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"mkllby","summary":"Horrible","reviewText":"I don't know where to start here. There are some pretty vast improvements in Dragon Age 2 (DA:2) compared to Origins (DA:O). Improvements I actually enjoyed and which I feel deserve praise. Namely the combat is far superior in DA:2. The strategy of the more turned-based style combat like in DA:O is still fully intact, but without the turn-based delay. It does give it a more hack-and-slash feel, but that is deceiving as the strategy and \"special attacks\" are still key components. I actually found myself needing to think and analyze a little more through some battles in this game as compared to the original.Unfortunately, I also have some qualms with the combat in this game. While it does require you to be a bit quicker in reacting in some cases after a while every battle starts to feel the same. This is because enemies level up as you do, and every battle is comprised of enemies of the essentially the same set of attributes as the previous enemies. To clarify take walking through the city at night when you first arrive in Kirkwall, by this time you are probably around level 5. You will be swarmed with around 10 enemies which range in two classes, ones with health bars it takes you 3 hits to completely kill (or one hit using a special attack playing as a rogue) or ones it takes about 10 hits to kill. Well at level 20 plus the same type of enemies will attack you and because they level with you it takes the same amount of hits to kill one enemy. So using the exact same strategy you worked out in the first few hours of the game you breeze through almost every fight and your 500th fight seems just like a carbon copy of your first fight. It gets pretty monotonous after a while and boring to the point you start hoping you won't even run into any enemies.The graphics in this game are beautiful. DA:O's were decent, but far from beautiful really. IThat unfortunately is where my list of improvements ends. Though even that wouldn't be bad IF other elements of the game were even at least close to being on par with DA:O. Here my biggest gripe is the story...or should I say lack thereof. Obviously a story of sorts is being told in this game, but it lacks one key element, literary conflict. Literary conflict is used no matter what type of story being told from comedy to drama to horror to drive the plot forward. DA:2 has virtually none. What this leaves you with is a game full of rather meaningless tasks to complete to get from one point to the next. I actually thought I would hate the narrative story telling they chose to do here, but that part worked, was done well and was the high point of the game's lacking story. So it isn't that they decided to tell a story in a different way from Bioware's typical format that I disliked, it was that there was no real story.Don't get me wrong there is story of sorts here and it is supposed to be about the role you played in lead up to the mage uprising/rebellion. But this is not really built upon in any real way to create literary conflict in a build up to the crescendo of events of the game's finale. Apart from the last few hours of play the whole mage thing really just seems like an annoying component to the game. What I mean is there is an obvious conflict with the mages being mentioned throughout the game, but I am not given any reason to care either way about it and to be honest I really didn't and still don't care about it. That is where the literary conflict is missing. Nothing is built into the overall story to make me care about it and the first two \"acts\" of the game aren't even dealing with this issue in any way except to have mages and mage-haters whining incessantly.Then there is the \"world\" itself. You will explore every inch of every part of the \"world\" in this game in the first 5 to 6 hours, then you'll spend the next 30 or so hours bouncing back and forth back and forth between these same 10 or so, rather small areas. Each area is VERY small, and I am not sure why this is. I mean you can literally go through the entire map of an area (minus the time for battles and/or conversations of course) in around a minute. Therefore you are going to set through hundred and hundreds of fairly long load screens. This becomes almost unbearable given there feels like there is no real point (because of the lack of any real conflict in the story) for you even playing the game. I mean I was glued to the screen playing DA:O. I lamented that I had to work as I couldn't wait to get to the next point in the game, but at the same time not wanting it to end. Playing this game I seriously couldn't wait for it to be over and had this not been a Bioware game and had I not been one of the biggest Bioware fanboys of all time I wouldn't have even been able to finish this game. I seriously had no desire to even play it really after the first few hours.Even to talk to your companions you have to go to each one's \"home\" and talk to them there. So you have to sit through even more load screens just to interact with and they all a different \"home\" except for two being in the same place. At least Mass Effect had everone on the same ship (base), even if you had to go to each one's room to speak with them. I also think the companion's in this game lack any real depth to them. It is more about having them there solely for quests. Before I felt a connection to them and actually got giddy at the cameos from my DA:O companions, but the companions in this one don't seem to be interesting but definitely have more quests but no depth of character. I did a lot of running around and killing for these guys but could careless about any of them really (though Isabella is one of the hottest video game characters of all time in my opinion). They weren't that interesting and neither was any of their stories and could've cared less about battling and killing some of them in the end. They meant nothing to me, where as I couldn't finish my DA:O play through when Anora had Alistair executed when I wanted to make her queen.I don't know what Bioware was thinking here, but this whole game seems amateurish compared their known ability in crafting an excellent story and characters. I seriously would not have finished this game had it not been a Bioware game and even being a Bioware fanboy I can't give this game even a decent mediocre rating. Without a doubt the core reason for this is because of the incomplete story that lacks the main ingredient of any story...conflict. Without conflict the story doesn't move forward and I think Bioware thought they could get away with this because the narration would be used to push the story forward in between \"actb\", but seriously that fell flat and failed miserably. Even with narration the story itself must have and build upon the conflict and that just doesn't happen at all with this game and therefore it becomes tedious and outright boring to play especially with the repetitiveness of the battles, continual repeats of the same areas being used/visited and seemingly endless load screens that must be endured. As a Bioware fanboy I must admit this game is honestly borderline unplayable and is definitely not a game that has any replay value at all. DA went from epic with Origins to boring and virtually unplayable in this installment. Absolutely horrible Bioware and I pray your writers get their stuff together real darn quick...or did EA make you get rid of /run out all the good ones already perhaps?","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2011"}

Great ValueThe CE comes with a good amount of stuff that makes you feel like you got your money's worth.  Specifically...2. Diablo 2/LOD (1920x1080!!) on USB DriveYou get D2/LOD on a funky 4GB USB drive shaped like a soulstone (that has a red LED light in it that lights up ominously when plugged in).  It's great, and to be quite honest, a better game than Diablo 3, but that's neither here nor there...  Also nice is that D2 plays full screen on my 1920x1080 23\" LCD monitor and looks pretty darn good.  I assume it's stretched to 16x9 aspect ratio, but if it is, you don't notice it and it doesn't look odd or unnatural.  Maybe it's my video card that's responsible, I don't really know.  In any case, it was a very nice addition since D2/LOD costs $20 separately.3. Unique In-game Angel Wings and DyesThe user account-tied \"artifacts\" are nice bonuses.  The angel wings are nice because it makes you stand out and looks pretty cool too.  The dyes are more standard stuff, white and black-ish (not quite totally black), that are useful because they can be used repeatedly without running out.  Totally aesthetic and not functional, but nice to have.4. Soundtrack CDIt would have been better if it was a multi-disc sountrack with D1 and D2 soundtracks included also (I prefer those more minimalist, moody scores to the overly bombastic score of D3), but that might be asking for too much.  As it is, it's nice to have the CD although I will probably never listen to it.  Minor quibble, but I hate the paper/plastic \"digipak\" CD case that is used instead of a standard plastic jewelcase with liner/notes.5. Making of DVDIt is 2-discs and has a lot of content, including many behind the scenes and development segments, many interviews, a variety of trailers (although minimal D3 trailers), storyboards, etc.  My favorite is the retrospective that is fairly short (~11min) but very interesting as it talks about the development of D1 and D2 also.  Interesting to hear that D1 was shopped to Blizzard initially and later that small company was acquired by Blizzard and turned into Blizzard North, which later got disbanded/dissolved around 2005 (not surpring how this affected how D3 turned out).  Also has all the cutscenes on it.6. Art BookIt's very hefty with thick, glossy pages and has nice artwork of the characters, locations, items, and other aspects of D3.7. Guest Passes for D3 and WoWNice touch for them to include a few guest passes so that your friends can give it a try if they are on the fence (as they should be, to be quite honest).BAD:====1. Smelly Diablo HeadWho would want that smelly, rubbery Diablo head?  I sure don't, and keep it safely tucked away in the box that (thankfully) keeps the horrid chemical smell safely sequestered inside.2. Digipak Soundtrack CaseAs mentioned previously, it would have been nice for the soundtrack to have a jewelcase with liner/notes packaging instead of a cheap \"digipak\" paper/plastic case.3. TrailersIt would have been nice to have more trailers from D1 and D2 on the making of DVD.OVERALL:========A great value overall with all the goodies they include with this CE.  Definitely worth the $40 over the standard edition release, although I don't know how much more than MSRP it would be worthGame: 1/5Collector's Edition: 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

Bullet Time in videogames was still a shiny new concept and the unexpectedly over-the-top &quot;film noir&quot; style kept fans shooting away, despite complaints that, really, you were just doing the same thing over and over.To a lot of people, however, Max Payne was a game that was far more than the sum of it's parts. Many people (myself included) fell in love with the gritty, absurdly heavy style of the game. Those that didn't really &quot;get it&quot; complained about Max's constant use of insanely overwrought metaphors, ever-present gloom, and ridiculous storyline, but everyone who was able to see it as the campy homage that it was had a blast.When part 2 was announced, I was thrilled. Max Payne is a series that lends itself pretty well to a sequel because, really, you don't have to change much about the game mechanics. They're pretty simple, and they work fine. It had already come to light that there were going to be no fundamental changes beyond some minor tweaks to Bullet Time and a completely different plot, so it sounded good to me.And, upon playing through the game in one sitting, that's exactly what I got.What this means is, if you liked the first Max Payne, you'll like the second one, if you didn't, you won't. Easy as that. Gameplay is IDENTICAL. There are a few alterations to some of Max's moves and skills (i.e. There are now deeper levels of Bullet Time, attained by winning gunfights while under the effects of slo-mo) and a few new weapons (An AK-47 and a somewhat impossible dual-Desert Eagle approach) but that's it.The really marked improvements over the first game in the gameplay/technical regard are the graphics, which are gorgeous (and Max no longer looks horribly constipated), and the physics engine, which now means Max can bump into and knock over things.The biggest change, though, is the level design, which is absolutely outstanding. The Fun House stage gets special mention for sheer brilliance in showing what can be done within the game engine if you're creative enough, and thankfully the more annoying stages from the first game (namely, Max's fever dreams) have been completely redone to be much more playable.Plot wise, this game has me with some mixed feelings. The story is much tighter this time around, and both it and the rest of the game feel toned down from the slightly insane events of the first game. Depending on what you actually thought of the first game, this can be seen as either a good or bad thing.For example, while the game has kept the much-beloved &quot;graphic novel&quot; storytelling, Max's own personal narration on things (read: some of the most ridiculous metaphors ever recorded) has been mostly dropped in favor of dialouge. There's no massive snowstorm this time around to act as a parallel to Max's own battle, and neither killer designer drugs, evil corporations, shadowy secret societies, or the occult play a role in the story. Instead we have the less fantastic but more solid plot concerning gangsters, lovers, assassins, and lots and lots (and lots) of bullets.Again, this garners mixed feelings. If you liked Max Payne 1 but thought it was just a little too warped in the story department, then part 2 will be dead-on for you. Personally, I slightly prefer the story from part 1, but there's no denying that Max Payne 2 is the better game in all other regards, and it's not such a radical departure that it feels weird. This is still Max Payne, and the game developers were well aware of this, make no mistake.On a final note, someone on the Dev. Team also figured &quot;Hey, since the game is M-rated, why have we been censoring the curse words, anyway?&quot; It's a good question, and one I was asking myself during Max Payne 1. I don't think that games should be loaded with curse words just for the fun of it, but when I have a mob foot soldier calling me a &quot;freakin' cop&quot; repeatedly, I almost feel more insulted than if he'd just let fly with the F-word. I mean, Max Payne (either of them) make no bones about the fact that they're adult games, and they're already violent enough that kids should be nowhere near them, so maybe we could actually let our mafia bullet-sponges let out a blue word or two?Max Payne 2 does just that, and thank God. In the same way that The Sopranos does, Max Payne 2 lets it all hang without actually drawing attention to it, and the result is dialouge that sounds a lot less, well, video game-y.So, bottom line, Max Payne 2 is an outstanding game in it's field, which is straight-up, heavily stylized action. It's about as long as the first game, has better graphics, has MUCH better level design, and is really everything fans of the series could have asked for. PC and Xbox versions are near-identical, so go with whichever is more comfortable, and get ready for a Max Payne love story.A violent, bullet-riddled, hard-boiled love story, but is there really any other kind?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2003"}

All-new dungeons and dialogue scenes to challenge and thrill gamers","reviewerName":"S.

It seems that with \"Dawn of Souls\" Final Fantasy I and II have finally been perfected.  If you have \"Final Fantasy Origins\" you might as well toss it and pick up this title before it becomes a relic!Both Final Fantasy games are basically ports of \"Final Fantasy Origins\" but they look a bit better on the GBA.  For starters, the graphics look more crisp and clear than they did in Final Fantasy Origins.  There's more to see and the enviroments look more decorative.Final Fantasy I, the earliest in the series, is about four warriors who come forth with the crystals to save the world.  Light warriors, they're called.  But being the first in the series it suffers from age.  The main characters don't talk much at all and the characters remained undeveloped throughout the entire game.Final Fantasy II however, is about three orphans escaping the Emperor.  They later join a rebellion against the Emperor and set out to take him down once and for all.  Final Fantasy II has a twist when raising characters.  Rather than raising character based on level-ups, they're raised based on their actions in battle.  This is both good and bad.  It's good because its \"different\" than what we usually see.  It's bad because when stats go up, others go down.  It's impossible to have a perfectly balanced character.  That and magic will almost never amount to anything.Both games sound beautiful from the GBA.  Many gamers will recognize their favorite tunes.  The sound effects are a little changed up from the original NES titles.  But I'm sure that's nothing to go crying home to mom about.Also, both games have a set of extras.  In Final Fantasy I after you defeat the four fiends of chaos, four optional dungeons open up.  These dungeons are brutally hard.  You'll also run into enemies seen in later Final Fantasy games.  You'll even run into a few bosses that'll look familiar. Final Fantasy II, presents an extended epilogue.  Unfortunately FFII doesn't present much more than that.However, the problem is... both games still suffer from their drawbacks.  Final Fantasy I paces much too slowly and you'll often times feel bored or robbed of your money.  Final Fantasy DOES pick up the pace and you'll be glad you did spend you cash on it.  Final Fantasy has also been toned down in its aspects of difficulty.Final Fantasy II's level up system still has bugs that just don't work out well.  Unless you subject to attacking your own characters you won't benefit from their actions.  Final Fantasy II also doesn't tell as good of a story, even with the new extended scenes to better explain it.As a whole the games are excellent.  But there's also the problem of whether or not you already own Final Fantasy Origins.  Are the extras worthwhile just to spend more money to buy two games that are virtually the same as \"Final Fantasy Origins\"?However, putting that last con aside, the GBA is where these two classics belong and is where they should've gone in the first place.  So I say this: Dump your Final Fantasy Origins and pick up Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls.  It's much more worthwhile and worth the money.The Good+Delicious graphics!+Great sound+Remake of two classics: They're PERFECT this time+Extras... not many but extras!+Most of the bugs from the NES and Origins packages are worked outThe Bad-Final Fantasy I still paces too slow-The level up system in Final Fantasy II still needs work-If you have Final Fantasy Origins you'll ponder whether the extras alone make it worthwhile to buy virtually the same game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2004"}

They've gone back and souped up the older games and offered a new experience of old favorites.GTA: LCS re-does GTA III by returning to the crime-ridden toilet of Liberty City in 1998.  This time you're Tony Cipriani (sadly not voiced by Michael Madsen), working for Don Salvatore Leone (yes, Frank Vincent) and going through the usual mayhem, insanity, and blood-drenched violence on the streets.This is a straight port of the PS2 game from 2005, and it comes off very well.  If this makes sense, the game does seem more 'squished' into the frame than earlier proper titles (III and Vice City), but presumably this is because they lifted it off a tiny screen and fitted it to the PS2.  The graphics are better--smoother, tighter, brighter, and less subject to those whacky effects of things disappearing and fading when you've been playing the game 72 straight hours.The missions are definitely easier, perhaps on purpose.  This is a game of pure fun---all the familiar Liberty City locales and characters and antics, just enhanced.  Motorcycles appear (even with a story on why they weren't around in III), the guns are better, the cops are still insane, there are the usual gangs to whack, more cars, and more radio.  This gets an impressive radio soundtrack, even keeping in theme with previous and future games.  This is a very intricately scripted game series with a ton of continuity points.  Players may not appreciate these things as they ram police barricades, cripple bystanders, run down firemen with blood-slicked tires, bomb intersections, blow up helicoptors, chop off heads, torch people alive, burst heads with sniper shots, and beat people to death in front of others.Excellent game, an absolute-no-brainer for GTA fans, some may even prefer this over earlier titles.  All the greatness of III, and then some.  Followed by Vice City Stories, a similar concept and treatment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2008"}

That's fine but the chance of missing with either 1 or 2 is crazy high.  It's not a game breaker at all, but I can see some gamers getting impatient with the process of taking down an enemy tank.Weapon and armor upgrades are sorta pointless -- you dont have a lot of choices yet the game makes you go thru a process to buy them anyway.You can save at any time including during combat, so the high difficulty level is to some degree lessened by being able to save.Otherwise, it is a very very solid turn based game and one of the PS3 games out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2010"}

Some games that don't look like a carbon copy of others are sometimes considered not good. But AP is different. If you like spy games and RPG's, then here it is. Although you can, to compare this to either Metal Gear or Splinter Cell would just be an injustice. So here goes. When you start the game, you have 4 different classes that you can start as or the extra 2 which one class (recruit) starts you with a blank slate of skills. This is obviously the more challenging class to start as. However, if you beat the game with this class, you get access to the 2nd special class known as Veteran. This class actually gives you a bonus in all categories when you start. The combat is awesome. Depending on which class you start as (and especially recruit) you might find that your shots don't hit like they are suppose to. But if you level up in the areas of pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, then you will see a considerable shift in your precision when you shoot at someone. You can also use hand to hand combat in which it looks very similar to Snake's with the only difference being that you can upgrade your combat skills allowing you to have more than just a 3 hit combo and maximizing it so that you have up to a 7 hit combo. And it works even against enemies with armor. Dialog is extremely important in this game. You get files that give you a heads-up on the people that you talk to and some of their likes and dislikes. This is essential if you want the conversation to go the way you want it to. After all, you are a spy. The game also has Mass Effect dialog tree where you have to choose between being professional, suave, or aggressive with your responses. There is also a timer so you don't have all the time in the world to decide as you did in Mass Effect which makes conversations flow more fluently. Based on those decisions, you may or may not have access to certain places to do missions. But that makes the game have a real good amount of replay ability. The only problem that this game has is that it doesn't have a sequel coming which is disappointing because they could have really benefited from a sequel. However, there are multiple endings which bring the game to a close properly. Again, you can upgrade all of your skills from guns, to sabotage which involves mini-games like lock picking, or hacking computers, to your health and how much health packs heal you, to stealth and being able to be totally invisible to the enemy. People have criticized your characters pose when sneaking, but believe me, it is minor and petty. The graphics are solid enough to be good. It looks like a first generation PS3/360 game. It does not look like a last gen game. It is definitely worth a play through and you will be surprised. The story is the best part of the game and you see the results of what your decisions cause. I highly recommend it.I give Alpha Protocol a '5 out 5'","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2014"}

We stress test our systems very heavily. We are playing on all three (the PS3, XBox 360 and Wii) pretty much constantly. If you are looking for my basic reviews of how the PS3 differs from the other two systems, I wrote that up in great detail with our initial review of the PS3 20 gig -PlayStation 3 (20GB)When my son went off to college, we sent that 20 gig unit with him and got ourselves the new 80 gig model (i.e. this one) to do our testing with. Here are my notes on how this upgraded PS3 differs from the previous models.First, it is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE. This is a killer change for many people. We don't mind because we also own a PS2. However, someone who is getting a PS3 explicitly to play current and past games should not go with this one.However, if you are NOT interested in playing old PS2 games (or don't mind having a PS2 around for that purpose) this unit is awesome. It is VERY quiet. When we play regular DVDs on our XBox 360 the fan noise on that unit is outrageous. When we play BluRays on our PS3 it is whisper silent. We play a ton of BluRays on the PS3 and the quality is head and shoulders above traditional DVD quality. Definitely anyone with a high def TV should be looking into getting a BluRay player - and the PS3 is perfect because it's cheap compared with other players plus it has the added bonus of playing games :)There's only 2 USB ports on this, but there are so many multitap types of extensions out there that it really doesn't matter. Its built in wireless is pretty standard on consoles nowadays, but of course is quite nice.We've been pounding heavily on this unit pretty much since it came out and it's been working like a charm. I can't say as much for our XBox 360 which is currently off at Microsoft being fixed for red-ring-of-death (our second failure in as many years).I know some people will complain about the lack of ability to play PS2 games. However the unit is so quiet that I am MORE than happy to have made that trade-off. Again, PS2 units are cheap and you can get one for the times you want to play those games - and for all the rest of the time you can have a quiet, well playing system which is perfect for both games and for home entertainment.Highly, highly recommended.------UPDATE - IMPORTANT NOTE - *Before* August 2008 there was a PS3 80 gig model which WAS backwards compatible - it also was noisy and had other problems. Since market research showed Sony that people cared a lot about a reliable quiet system - and didn't care as much about playing old PS2 games - they came out with this NEW model (the one I'm reviewing here) which is NOT backwards compatible but runs much more quietly, takes less energy, etc. So these are two DIFFERENT models which are both 80 gig in storage but with different functionality. This new model released in August 2008.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLTDC","description":"","reviewerName":"ObiWanShinobi","summary":"Pure Video Game Goodness","reviewText":"There's a lot of really cool idea's that are a part of modern video games. From highly developed stories that take 40+ hours to complete, to really cool conceptual artwork, to robust multiplayer experiences. The modern video big-budget game is usually a deep, well-crafted work of technological art.Vanquished on the other hand... has none of those things: And that's a big part of what makes it great. The story isn't an intellectual assault on Objectivism, it's kind of corny. And there's no multiplayer. Also conceptually it's just a guy in a cybernetic suit running around shooting robots (which in video game terms is pretty well-tread ground).And you know what? That's fine by me.Because while this game doesn't have any of those things, it does have one thing going for it, and that's simply that It Is A Total Blast To Play. From start to finish things are blowing up, flying by, and you're right in the middle of it all... zipping around/guns-a-blazin'. And for a video game - that's all I really need. On top of that the graphics are fantastic, the control is as tight as it gets, and the gameplay mechanic owns.You really feel like you're a cigarette smoking, cornball fighting evil commie robots in a sweet looking robotic suit of armor. Being able to slow things down at just the right moment as you pop out of cover and unload a couple of clips into an enemy, while their bullets whiz by you in slo-mo never gets old. Like not even for a second.So if you're into 3rd person action games pick this one up. It's a shame that a game like this doesn't get the credit it deserves.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"James Duckett","summary":"Focused on FUN at the right price","reviewText":"With the release of the three next generation gaming consoles (XBox360, PS3, and Nintendo's Wii), the Wii was supposed to be the \"also ran\" of the group.  I am now wondering if Nintendo could turn around and win the console war this round despite the higher end graphics offered by the other two.The biggest advantage that the Wii has is price.  To get the entire console at $250 is amazing!  And I appreciate their simplicity in offering only one console instead of a core system and a higher-end system, something that aggravated me about the other two consoles.On the innovative side, the Wii comes now with the remote and nunchunk.  I was pretty surprised while playing to learn that the remote actually has a speaker inside.  That is pretty new as well.  But the remote looks like a small TV remote and adds a new level of flexibility to gameplay.  For one, if you point at the screen then it can pretty much function as a mouse.  It can also detect if the remote tilts in one way or the other.  For instance, while bowling if you tilt the remote to the left when releasing the ball then the ball will curve left.  In boxing, if you lean to the right then the body of your boxer leans to the right to dodge a blow from your opponent.  There is a driving game where you can use the remote as a steering wheel.  Again, this is completely innovative on Nintendo's part.One complaint I have heard about the Wii remote is that it is easy to break once you get into the game.  I can see why.  While playing baseball or golf you swing it like a bat or a club.  Also in baseball you throw it like a baseball while pitching.  Instinct almost kicks in and makes me want to let go of the remote during the pitching part of baseball.There is a learning curve to the remote as well.  However, the Wii comes with Wii Sports to get you familiar (like how Bill Gates threw in Solitaire into Windows to help learn the mouse).  Wii Sports will not keep you entertained for long because they become quite boring after you master the use of the remote but it does do a good job of getting you over the curve.The remotes are also in short demand right now and most games seem to have written the use of the remotes into the games as an afterthought (the largest exception being Zelda).  But I think games in the future will be written throughout with the remote and nunchunk in mind and these games are going to be amazing.The graphics are not as impressive as what you'll see on the XBox360 and the PS3, but the DVD quality is good enough when you are more interested in playing and having fun.  Don't get me wrong, the 1080 resolution is very impressive.  But after you get into a game, the graphic difference becomes irrelevant if you are having fun.  And the Nintendo Wii is a load of fun!!One last note.  While searching for a Wii I went to many stores (Best Buy, a few WalMarts, Target, several Game Stops and many others).  I noticed that a lot of the XBox360's and PS3's were frozen or out of order.  Very few demo machines actually worked.  But I never once saw a Wii not working though all but once had a classic controller instead of the new remote.  I've read that PS3's can overheat and the XBox360 can crash on occasion (Windows!!  Typical).  So I'm glad that the Wii comes out quite solid.So, Wii loses in graphic capabilities but wins in price, fun, stability, and innovation.  Choose which is more important to you and then go with that decision.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2006"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"Surprise: Cost of XBOX 360 = Cost of Wii","reviewText":"I want to be very clear that my review takes on a different twist than most other reviews. I bought the system and all the accoutrements' for my son's birthday in a few weeks. We haven't had the chance to play it yet, because it is a surprise. We have three Nintendo DSs in my house and I have absolutely no doubt that the Wii system will bring many hours of enjoyment to our family entertainment time.However, after spending $400+ dollars and have yet to buy a game, I had to put the details in my head together to compare it to the monies spent on my XBOX 360 and equivalent equipment.For starters, anyone purchasing the Wii simply because of the perception that it is cheaper better think again. I recommend purchasing the Wii for those folks who want to experience an entirely different take on video games, if you trust in the quality of Nintendo products and game franchises, as well as it obviously being kid-friendly.However, when you do the comparative $ math, the XBOX 360 is actually on par with Wii. Here is what I spent for 360 vs. Wii and you'll see that it is a straight-out wash. Please note that I tried to keep an apples-to-apples comparison as much as possible:XBOX 360 and an additional controller for a second player = $450. Special note: The XBOX 360 $400 model comes with a hard drive, and it's resident controllers and memory can handle the original XBOX games, as well as all XBOX Live Arcade games.Wii base = $250,Extra Wii-mote and nunchuck for second player= $602 GB SD memory card = $302 Wii Classic controllers to play virtual console games = $402 GameCube controllers which is a system requirement to play GameCube games = $50GameCube memory which is another system requirement to play GameCube games. You can not use SD memory = $20Grand Total = $450Other things to consider: If you don't have a wireless router, then you either need to get one or purchase the DS/Wii Wifi USB Adapter to hook your box up to a LAN cable = another $40. On the other hand, in defense of Nintendo, if you wanted to go wireless instead of a LAN cable connection on XBOX 360 you would have to spend about $90 for the Wireless adapter. In addtion, if you want to see a progressive scan picture with the Wii, you need to spend another $30 for component cables, something that comes straight out of the box with a XBOX 360.As some folks already know, the Wii's graphics are currently 480p max and only capable of Dolby Pro Logic II sound. XBOX 360 can reach 1080i (1080p with additional hardware) and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.In summary,  if you only want to go with one system, you have to choose between what you are interested in with a next-gen system. If you want real next-gen graphics and sound, I recommend the XBOX 360 (or PS3 I guess, but I don't have one of those yet). If you are looking for an innovative way to play games and love the Nintendo franchise games, then go with the Wii - if you can find one that is.........","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"korova","summary":"Notes from an old fan of FPS games","reviewText":"Many reviewers have already covered BioShock's story, features, and gameplay extensively, so I'm just going to talk about a few things that I've noticed as a long-time fan of first-person shooters.*BioShock is one of the most well-written games ever. Even if you aren't familiar with Ayn Rand, the story is rich, moving, and deeply satisfying. The voice acting, character development, and cutscenes are all of very high quality.*The underwater setting is unique (finally, a game not set on a distant planet, a tropical island, a military base, or some combination of those) and beautifully realized. The music, environmental sounds and Art Deco graphics are all well done and add a lot to the playing experience.*Each level is designed well and contains a fair amount of territory to explore. You are on rails more or less, as in all FPS games, but there is enough freedom to avoid making the game feel oppressively linear.*Overall, the game is not terribly difficult. Boss battles are only slightly harder than fights with generic enemies, for the most part, and there aren't any ridiculously difficult puzzles to solve. The developers focused more on the story and on making all aspects of the game fit together holistically, rather than on trying to come up with mega-challenges for diehard gamers.*Replayability is high, due to the way weapons and powers are earned as well as to the ability to follow different strategies throughout the game. Having said that, BioShock isn't as chock full of hidden features, secret abilities, and obscure actions as Japanese games (the Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil series all come to mind here. And yes, I know SH and RE are survival horror games, not FPS's).-----Bottom line: despite showing its age a bit, BioShock is still one of the best games I've ever played. Anybody who enjoys FPS and action games will dig BioShock. Judged on gameplay mechanics alone, BioShock is a four star game but the stunning graphics, high production values, and outstanding storyline push it to five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Wading through the darkness...","reviewText":"Konami's classic Castlevania series has had a pretty good track record in the portable gaming world, and The Dracula X Chronicles is no different.  Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles features the never before released in the U.S. Castlevania: Rondo of Blood.  The game has been remastered and puts you in the shoes of Richter Belmont (and eventually a girl named Maria as well) as you take the fight to Dracula once again.  The remastered game features some numbing difficulty, a nicely realized mix of 2-D and 3-D graphics, and some brilliant level design as well.  While Rondo of Blood is a little on the short side, there are some extras (one in particular) that are worth the price of admission alone.  The original Rondo of Blood can be found as well, but the real meat and potatoes is the fact that Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is an unlockable extra.  Yes, that's right, the classic game that is one of the finest games ever made is available as an unlockable extra, and even better, it runs virtually flawlessly on the PSP.  Whether you manage to beat Rondo of Blood though is another story, as the game does offer some quite unforgiving difficulty.  This really shouldn't be too much of a surprise for veterans of the series, but be warned, casual gamers will get turned off.  That aside, Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles is a great excursion in the long running and beloved series, and the fact the legendary Symphony of the Night is included makes this game an absolute must own for PSP owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000JHMJDA","description":"Need for Speed Carbon PS3","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Extremely Fun, But Ridiculously Easy","reviewText":"I've not played a need for speed game since the utterly brilliant Need for Speed Underground. That game was simply so good, it seemed almost impossible to top. Which is when, the fantastic Need for Speed: Carbon became the first game of the franchise to hit the PS3. What a debut it was as Carbon is sincerely one of the most fun games to be playable on the PS3 in the first few months of its release.The game itself goes back to its underground routes with the night time racing and different race types that take place in a canyon or on the treacherous mountain roads. These two different racing modes are without a doubt the most fun additions to any series, even ahead of the customisation abilities of the past. The drift races are easily the most fun and something I enjoy more as I've mastered the technique to the point in which I do not touch a wall and end the race with an unimaginable point score (I dare you to challenge me :)Drag races have been removed but have been replaced by something known as \"canyon duel\" in which you are racing one on one and the goal is to remain as close to your rival as possible during the race. Another new feature within gives you the ability to amass a crew that can be selected to help you win the races, as good as an addition as this is, it becomes almost too much of a help to the point in which the game is very easy to complete.The visuals are without a doubt stunning, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the standard considering it's a game of the PS3. The customisation is more detailed than any previous games, giving you the ability to let your imagination run wild. The games plot pits you against 3 separate racing gangs which you must beat in a number of exciting races and challenges in order to progress to the final race. As you progress through the plot, you gain new friends that join your crew and also win some bonus cars as a reward for beating your challenger. I didn't play Most Wanted, but I believe it follows on from that.Because of the free roaming capability, you can go about particular races or side challenges at your leisure, or if you're bored, you can just speed through the city until you grab the cop's attention and just take chase. The whole combination of the cool race additions such as the duel and the drift, the ability to roam the city at your whim, the capability to develop a crew to help you out and the immense customisation options combined with stunning visuals and a well defined city present an amazingly fun game that anyone can pick up at any time and enjoy.I would highly recommend this to any casual PS3 gamer. Be warned, however, as the game that followed this was a blatant spit in the face to the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2009"}

Especially to fans of the Hitman series; this game comes to us from the same developers and plays somewhat similarly to Hitman. In short, the story is good and this is a fun third-person shooter with well-developed characters. Unfortunately, this game offers very little in terms of lasting appeal. It's worth a couple of play-throughs, but that's about it. Because it's not particularly popular no one plays the multiplayer anymore which is too bad because it looks pretty fun.

Baseball is fun as well but the games are rather short with only three innings. Boxing isn't my favorite but it is good exercise swinging punches like crazy for 5 minutes. The only part of the game that I really didn't care for is the golf because it just didn't seem very realistic and didn't have many club options. The game also comes with a training mode and Wii Fitness that will ask you to complete tasks in each of the sports except for golf and it will judge you and assign a \"Wii Fitness Age\" with the lowest score being the best.

It has exactly same game mechanics, auction house, and annoying announcer that you cannot skip.  As before, in MOST races, you will start 2/3 of the way back and have to work your way to the front (still no qualifications, test drives in career mode, etc).  And then there are the chase races (finally, something &#8216;new&#8217;).  You again start in the back and have to pass a myriad of kamikaze AI slow drivers that constantly swerve in front of you.  There are no improvements to the AI as they drunkenly swerve from side to side.  Additionally, they removed difficulty from the game.  I know that it&#8217;s on the list, but it&#8217;s only for toggling your assists.  Turn 10 decided to remove difficulty from the game.  Supposedly, the AI gets better as you play.  What actually happens is that they just keep increasing the car stats until you lose.  It&#8217;s funny when you see the EXACT the same car as you are driving in front of you, pull away like you&#8217;re standing still.They also still have the exact same rewind function &#8211; easily the worst rewind function in racing simulations.  It never rewinds to the right point.  It&#8217;s either in the middle of your mistake, or you need to go back a mile.  Why can&#8217;t we control this?  Is that so hard?  Additionally, they now have an ex wife in the programming, critiquing EVERY pass, turn and drift as you drive.They still haven&#8217;t improved the basic racing function of the slide.  They simply turn off your steering, put on some kind of delay, and then turn it back on. This game still also has the magic sand that will slow you from 200 to 0 in a second - more lazy coding.  Turn 10 really does love their sunlight reflecting off of the road.  Speaking of which, it will ALWAYS be sunny when you race.  No rain, not even clouds.  It would take away from razor crisp renderings of the cars.  They must have put all their effort into reflecting sunlight instead of trying to actually improve their game.  There are a couple of new tracks, and they continue the pathetic trend of nickel-and-dime-ing you with many cars having to be purchased separately (not just Forza does this).  I truly feel sorry for those that paid full price for this marginal improvement to an average racing sim.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2014"}

The play is very reminiscent of other franchises such as god of war, tomb raider and the level up/red orb collecting courtesy of devil may cry. The action never lets up nor does it get repetitive as the game test the player's platforming and puzzle solving skills. One of the elements that I like about the game would be upgrading the wolvie's skills, powers and abilities.If there was one complaint I would have about the game would be the disoriented camera during gamplay and the occasional slowdown when the action gets a bit too heavy as there tends to be too much going on all at once.Oh, and there's the occasional sub boss battles between Logan and giant beasts primarily the wendingo prototypes. I was hoping to face off against other characters from the marvel U like omega red, silver samurai, nick fury,etc. however I have yet to finish the entire game so maybe there might be a cameo appearance from one of the many xmen characters.

The battle screen in FFX loads quickly, battles are bug-free (remember the 'mblock stat' and 'dark status' bugs in FFVI), and the turn system in FFX takes into consideration character speed and execution time for moves, in order to determine when to give each character another turn, rather than working in battle rounds, like in FF 1-3. The result is a battle system tactically similar to the ATB system, except which allows for easy character and equipment swapping, and features no delay between the selection and execution of a move, keeping the battles moving along at maximum speed. The quality of battle action animations are at a series high in this game, and overkill bonuses, plus the ability to fight using Aeons, give the player extra battle mechanics to consider, just when hacking and slashing start to get a little dull. Although originating in Lunar, the in-battle voices in this game add a lot to it, with what characters say in battle often determined by the opponent, or combination of characters in the party, rather than merely the move being executed.The voice acting in FFX is generally high-quality, although the abundance of voice acting serves to disguise the fact that the characters have much less to talk about in FFX than in FFVII through FFIX. Like FFVII, FFX often features five-minute cutscenes filled with dialogue, although the actual amount of dialogue present in five minutes' worth of voice acting is significantly less than in five minutes' worth of text boxes, with the final result being that FFX features a shallower story with less character development. The game's story has an annoying pattern of explicitly emphasizing moral dilemmas which should already be obvious to the player (ex: dialogue such as: \"Is it really okay to hate the Al-Bhed?\"), overemphasizing the emotion of particular scenes (\"Nobody could believe that Yuna was about to call the final Aeon, and that meant...\"), and allowing its characters to act too much like themselves (Wakka's continued objections to disobedience towards Yevon's teachings, even after exposing Yevon's corruption). After the reasonably mature stories of FF7-9, this game's story comes of as positively childish, despite featuring a good amount of philisophical content regarding the nature of death, because the dialogue is written with a constant degree of paranioa that the player won't understand the significance of certain scenes, and most of the time, the characters exist not to interact, but rather to be different from one another.One particularly annoying flaw in FFX is the field exploration screen, where the edges of navigable areas do not in any way correspond with the position of walls and barriers, so the majority of the time, field avatar Tidus is exploring a dungeon or forest until he runs into a barricade of... absolutely nothing! This causes the player to spend more time looking at the minimap for the position of the abstract walls than the field screen for the position of the illustrated ones, and actually discourages the player from enjoying the level of detail that the illustrators have put into the game's environments. The music in FFX, while not bad, is also unspectacular.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"JRP","summary":"What can say that hasn't already been said","reviewText":"I thought that I'd review some James Bond 007 video games the games that I own. You know it's going to be The 50th Anniversary this year which I might see Skyfall but I'm here to review the best 007 game by far Golden Eye on The Nintendo 64 which was a game that was only exclusive to The N64 meaning back in 97 it was like hey you need to go out & buy a Nintendo 64. I remember playing this game a lot in 1998 it's an amazing game all around of course the multiplayer is what stands out I played it a lot with my brother, my friends & cousin a lot. The single player mode is well done the game play is great & the weapon selection is the best of all The 007 games. For what it is it does a good job of following the movie Golden Eye going through the 1st 3 levels it deals with the beginning of the movie. Where you think 006 Alec Treyvelyn was kill & where Bond escapes in the plane. There is a level you saw in the movie Servenya that you go to. You have to go there twice the 2nd time is where you meet Natalya who in the movie you meet in the helicopter explosion. Of course you meet Janus at The Statue Park who turns out to be Treyvelyn. You get to use a tank just like in the movie you get to go through the train depot which isn't in the movie the train level is pretty good & there are lines that Alec Treyvelyn says in the movie on this level. The last 4 levels is pretty much the movie towards the end. This game is 1 of the best 1st person shooters out there it changed the genre. If you never played Golden Eye on The N64 I can't reccommend it enough & I'm not talking about the new 1 which I have yet to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC4ZS","description":"Metroid: Other Mis a single player shooter for Wii that takes the belovedMetroidfranchise into uncharted and exciting new territory. Set between the events ofSuper MetroidandMetroid Fusion, the game features unprecedented access to the backstory, thoughts and in-game interactions of the usually closed off heroine of the series, Samus Aran. Developed jointly by Nintendo and the celebrated Japanese development studio, Team Ninja, the game also features exciting play options, including the ability to switch between first-person and third-person perspectives, pointer and sideways Wii Remote controller orientation, stunning in-game cinematics and a classic blend of Metroid action and puzzle-solving gameplay..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Give it a chance","reviewText":"Ok, I know there's plenty of negative press on this game.  Personally, I think people need to step back and take a fresh look at this game.  Most people complain that Samus doesn't act according to what they conceive to be her typical persona.  I disagree with this.  No other Metroid title ever tried to convey a real personality or characterization like Other M does.  And to think that Samus shouldn't show emotion throughout the game just doesn't make sense to me.  She's a female, and she's human.  And she still overcomes her fears of Ridley and kicks his butt.  We never knew that she felt this way because no other Metroid title actually tried to convey her emotions, but now we get to see the introspective side of her.  IMHO, this is a very refreshing approach to the series, and helps flesh out Samus' character in some great ways.  it makes me care about her as a character more than I ever have before.Characters in video games don't need to be emotionless robots that take on all challenges without so much as a frown.  Emotions are what drives humans in everything they do, and it's great to see these all important aspects of humanity being explored in Other M.  And she is NOT portrayed as a whiney wimp.  Rather, she is portrayed as an individual overcoming her own personal challenges.  Otherwise she wouldn't handle herself so well in the circumstances she faces in this game.  But anyway, let me get to the actual review.Controls/Gameplay -- Amazing.  Even though you play with the Wii Remote only (held sideways most of the time), it feels natural and very classic.  The mix of Third Person Side-Scrolling, Third Person Free-Roaming, and First Person (can't move, only aim) perspectives add lots of variety to the game.  The auto-aiming isn't as cheap as I thought it would be.  You only auto-aim when enemies are relatively close, and there's still plenty of challenge.Graphics -- Excellent Wii graphics.  I have nothing to complain about here.  The cut scenes are spectacular, and the colors are vibrant.  What else can you ask for?Sound -- Wonderful as always.  Great music, good voice acting (IMHO), and nice sound effects.Overall -- Is it perfect?  Of course not.  But I must say that I enjoyed it as much as the Metroid Prime Trilogy, if not more.  Definitely better than Metroid Prime 2, possibly better than Metroid Prime 3.  Just give the game a chance and be open-minded.  And if possible try not to have any preconceived notions about what kind of person she is.  Otherwise it might shatter those preconceptions and make you hate the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"The evolution of Evil continues on Wii","reviewText":"It has been well over two years since Resident Evil 4 first debuted. It was definitely a milestone for Capcom's now infamous Resident Evil series, breaking away from the franchise's traditional outlook and implementing a more free action-oriented approach along with fresh gameplay additions such as quick action response time as well as buying and selling items. Despite the obvious drastic changes made to the game, it is very much Resident Evil at heart. The puzzle-solving, the herbs, and the typewriters are all still here. And now RE4 graces the Nintendo Wii, creating a new way to re-imagine this modern classic. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is assigned to rescue the U.S. president's kidnapped daughter in Europe. The Umbrella Corporation is gone, but a brand new evil is about to emerge.A lot of gamers became a bit worried when they realized this would have to utilize the Wiimote, which did not fare too well with other ports such as the disappointing Prince of Persia: Rival Swords. I'll tell you right now, the controls themselves are surprisingly quite intuitive. They are among the best when it comes to responsiveness, in contrast to the sensitivity issues that have plagued other Wii titles. The guys over at Capcom seem to have understood the Wiimote's capabilities well. The graphics, while they haven't gone through any significant change, are still impressive by today's standards. Everything from the detailed towns and caves to the monsters and elemental special effects are a stellar sight to behold. The framerate hardly ever falters either. The music, sound effects, and voice acting are top notch as well. Fans will be happy to know that all the special features from the PS2 version have also made a return here.Seasoned and experienced RE4 veterans may find the new Wiimote play mechanics more of a handicap than anything else, thus making the game a little easier than before. And be warned though. Some gamers, especially first-timers, may grow weary and exhausted too soon due to the amount of action and thrills the game exerts on the player. Now that RE4: Wii Edition requires a little more physical activity, it may turn away those who didn't expect this much tension for a game. A lot of today's games are more action intensive, so hopefully this will just be a minor problem for the most part. Also, some action game purists may be a little disappointed by the fact that you cannot run or strafe while killing enemies, something that has always been a Resident Evil trademark. If you are concerned about violence and gore, then I would suggest you stay away from this product.Such issues aside, for anyone who has never had the opportunity to play the game when it first came out (which I don't consider a requirement in order to play this one), this new edition may prove to be a very fun yet unique roller coaster of a ride. For those who have already played RE4 (on either the GameCube, PlayStation 2, or PC platform), it will serve to be an alternate but far more interactive experience to revisit an already great title. It really is the most well-made game done with a Wii makeover since The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and one of the better titles on the system overall. It's almost as if this game was always meant to be eventually ported over to the console. As an excellent showcase for the Nintendo Wii, it is a good way to tide things over until newer more anticipated games for the system are released later on. The $29.99 price tag also makes this one well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2007"}

I loved the series through first and second gen, and then it just began to fade.  I re-entered pokemon for Platinum and then tried Black, and just felt too much of the same.  I actually picked up and fully beat White but that's only because I was SO hyped for X&Y.;  The nintendo directs, concept art, and new features that were announced for X&Y; totally sucked me in.We finally have a pokemon game that utilizes the 3ds capabilities!  Not just the 3D, but the online features. You can wonder-trade with random trainers across the globe, you can see what your friends are doing (to a small degree), there is a new Fairy type, and there are now mega-evolutions (Black Charizard?!@#?) awesomeness.There are no spoilers here, only data that's been released in Nintendo directs and trailers is referenced.Now for Gameplay (10+ hours in): The battle animations are smooth through and through.  I've been waiting for an animation to be glitchy or lag, not a single time!  At first having a 3D character to maneuver around the world on a not as rigid Grid based movement system can feel a bit weird; but that's only because we've been playing as a 2D sprite for over 10 years.The pokemon development progression has been modified nicely.  Those weary of adding even more ridiculous looking nothings to the pokedex, don't be too worried.  There is always a new one that makes you wonder what some developer was on when he decided to draw that, but overall I've been very pleased.The Pokebank comes out this December and then we can store all our pokemon online with easy transfer from X&Y.;  While some could say it's a gimmick, anyone that's had to transfer from HG/SS to White/2\\Black/2 knows it's a bit of a pain.  It saves you having to transfer from one cart to another, AND from having to own two handheld systems if you've got no one nearby to trade with.I don't want go into too much detail because I truly want this to be a genuine fresh (and fresh it is!) pokemon experience for everyone.  No matter if you've played them all since Red&Blue;, left the series a few generations ago, or your new to the series; this will not let you down.  This is the most significant leap forward in the series since online trading was implemented.  THIS is the Pokemon game we all dreamed could be since 2nd gen came out.  The battle sequences are like watching the anime.I can't urge Pokemon fans, old and new, how much they need play this.  This is also a perfect time for someone new to the series to jump in.  Enjoy everyone!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}
