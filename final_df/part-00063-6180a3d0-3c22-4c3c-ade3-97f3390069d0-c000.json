{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Another masterpiece by Rockstar","reviewText":"The Good: Revolutionary motion capture technology, using this to interrogate suspects is unique, great story and characters, variety of cases, historically and accurately renders Los AngelesThe Bad: Repetitive investigation process, shooting is average, not much to do when driving around, the interrogation feels like guess work most of the timeWhen you see Rockstar's name on a box you expect a dark, mature, and innovative single player game and L.A. Noire is just that. Meet Detective Cole Phelps. A World War II war hero who was given the Silver Star. He is now LAPD's newest officer and you start rising up the ranks. The game has four desks to play as you move along which are Traffic, Homicide, Vice, and then Arson. The story is very weird because about 2/3 of the game is just case by case and the overall story doesn't really start or pick up until the very end. It's nice to have little stories within a huge one, but the ending is riveting and shocking so expect something good there.The game play consists of walking around realistically rendered crime scenes and finding clues to add to your notebook. You will hear music playing in the background indicating there are still clues in the area. When you walk by one a sound will chime and your controller will vibrate. When you pick up a clue you can manipulate it by rotating the analog stick or some times you will have to investigate further by opening something, or finding certain info on a piece of paper. There are so many different types of objects in the game it's insane. Everything is beautifully and realistically rendered and this helps make the game one of the best looking ones to date.Los Angeles is rendered fairly accurate from the time period with the use of actual city logos and protocols for LAPD. Real street names are used and even landmarks from the city are accurately rendered in the game. This also helps in cases because you might actually know where the area is if you are familiar with it. Going back to investigating there are so many different types of cases that I could spend days describing them all. The variety is great, but the actual procedure is repetitive. You drive to the marked spot on your map, investigate, search for clues, then go interrogate. Rinse and repeat over a dozen times.interrogated and questioning people is what makes L.A. Noire such a big deal. The new motion capture technology for facial animations is just 100% realistic. Every muscle moves, you can detect twitches, neck muscles move in their neck, you can see them swallow hard when nervous, this is the first game that has true realistic facial animations. You will be stunned when you first see this and it's also kind of creepy how real it looks. Of course this ties into game play because you have three options which are Truth, Doubt, Lie. After each question (which is why finding clues are key or you may not be able to question them properly) you choose one of the three. If you pick the right one you will hear a certain tone. Accusing someone of lying requires showing evidence so really make sure you have it before doing so. If you have trouble with this you can use intuition points that will take away an answer or you can ask the Social Club community.I love this game play mechanic, but a lot of the times I felt like I was just purely guessing because someone would make a straight face and you think they are telling the truth, but the next person may be doubtful when they have that face. Cases get longer and more complicated with lots of clues to sort through and I got frustrated thinking I had the guy then later found out that I failed a case because I didn't accuse the right person or question them right.Of course there is shooting and it's average. There is a cover mechanic which is a bit finicky but it works, and the guns are 40's era weapons, but the shooting sections don't come up often and I found this was fine. The driving in the game is just like GTA and pretty much works the exact same way. The cars are familiar to the era, but all pretty much drive the same. There is one side mission type and that's fighting street crime. Some times a call over your radio will give info about a street crime and you can respond to it. There are 40 in all and they usually consist of on foot chases, car chases, or a shootout. These get repetitive as well after a while, but it's there to make you feel like a true cop.Overall L.A. Noire has amazing motion capture technology that's revolutionary as well as superb storytelling and great characters. Investigating cases is fun and exciting, but the overall process grows tiresome after a while due to the same steps being taken over and over again. The shooting is average and the driving will get old after a while since there's not much to do there. L.A. Noire is a must have for fans of Rockstar, crime fighting, or excellent single player games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I know a lot of people like getting new swords and helmets and whatnot in other games that make your character look different but this does not happen in COH, there is no equipment looting in this game.2) No PvP.  Ok, a lot of people consider that a plus but it's a shame to have human-player Super Heroes and no human-player Super Villians to go up against.3) Pay-to-play.  Worth mentioning, this is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game.  You play with a great variety of people and that doesn't happen for free.Good Stuff:1) Character creation gives you a TON of options.  In a week of playing on the busiest server I have not yet seen anyone that looks like me.  Frankly, this makes your character more unique than in a typical game where all high-level players tend to have the same high-level gear and look very similar to each other.  I've made several characters that I don't play just because the character generation is that cool (note: you need to uncheck the &quot;color coordination&quot; button if you want to play around with the colors of each piece of your suit).2) There is a planned expansion called &quot;City of Villians&quot; which will apparently have optional PvP between heroes and villians, good news for me.3) Combat is excellent, more more interactive than other MMOG's.  In fact, there really is no &quot;auto-attack&quot;.  Every attack requires a press of a button, some special move you want to do and there's a big variety of special moves.  You can't watch TV and fight at the same time in this game.4) AI is excellent, honostly the best I've ever seen in a MMOG.  I don't want to bore you with names and details, but let's just say that when you get to fight the group called &quot;Tsoo&quot; you'll understand that this is some vicious AI that someone put some time into.5) Missions are fun and maps are excellent.  Best &quot;dungeons&quot; I've seen in a MMOG since Everquest, with a lot of detail to them.6) Instancing.  I didn't think I'd like it, but it works well.  When you enter an office building on a mission, that is your &quot;instance&quot; of it.  Your group joins you there but another group doing the same mission in the same place will enter a seperate &quot;instance&quot; -- you have the building all to yourself.  This makes for more sensible missions as your group can clear it from top to bottom, beat the boss and go get another mission without interruption or annoyance by random other people who show up.7) Great variety of superpowers.  Not only does nobody look like me, but nobody totally fights like me either.  Blaster is one of 5 available archetypes, so there's lots of Blasters like me.  But Blaster has 5 major powersets (pick 1), 5 minor powersets (pick 1) and I'm not sure how many pools of extra abilities (can pick up to 4) plus every individual power can be customized with &quot;enhancement slots&quot; (for an eventual total of 40) -- more damage, more range, more accuracy, etc, pick what works for you.All in all, a surprisingly strong game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2004"}

First, there are no left handed control options and for a lefty such as myself that's a negative. However, it did force me to learn to play right-handed which is a good thing. Second, using cover, normally an essential function, is problematic and difficult at best, especially in comparison to shooters such Gears of War and Call of Duty 4. In fact, most of the time I didn't even bother to try and use the cover for shooting because it was such a pain. Third, at times I got bored with the lack of variety in the game. There are long stretches where nothing much happens and the objectives are all quite similar. Some other complaints: the graphics are a bit bland, the game isn't very deep, it's easy to hit the wrong function on the d-pad, and the flashlight always temporarily runs out of power, which doesn't make any sense. I do like how ammo is automatically picked up and I wish most games employed that feature and the slow motion is feature is really, really fun.

This time you play as a member of the Ecclesia, an organization that has sworn to defeat the evil forces of Dracula. Use the brand new Glyph attack system which has more than 100 different combinations to battle Dracula and his minions throughout 20 explorable areas.

Rhodes","summary":"One of the Best Castlevania's","reviewText":"Pros:+A good story+Glyph system is incredible+A good challenge+Very addictive gameplay+Backtracking and getting lost is kept to a minimal+Good artistic design+Fantastic SoundtrackCons:-It's challenging; you will dieIn 2005, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow brought the franchise to the DS and is often considered one of the best games in the series, rivaling Symphony of the Night as the best Castlevania title out there.  Just two years ago, however, Portrait of Ruin didn't make as strong of a run.  Portrait of Ruin was a good game on its own, yet switching between two characters felt like a gimmick after a while, and it was obvious that some of the exploration was becoming a drag.  Order of Ecclesia works to put some life into the franchise the same way Symphony of the Night did in 1997, and the way Aria of Sorrow did in 2003.  Fans will be pleased to know that it does a great job.Order of Ecclesia puts you in the role of Shanoa as she has to go forth and once again vanquish Dracula.  While Castlevania has never been too much for story, it has slowly begun to put an emphasis on its story through the years.  While it centers firmly on its gameplay, Order of Ecclesia actually has a pretty good story, and Shanoa is easily one of the series's most likable characters.Since 1997's Symphony of Night, Castlevania has abandoned it's level by level design and has a had a more Metroid style approach ever since.  Order of Ecclesia holds onto that, but it also brings back the level by level run.  You'll got to a \"level\" but you'll be able to explore it in the Metroid style way you've no doubt become accustomed to.  It helps keep backtracking and running around aimlessly to a minimum.  Most of the areas aren't too big either and it's a little hard to get lost.  Yet there are plenty of optional things to do later on that will lead you back to these areas.  So while it has a level by level design, exploring is still encouraged.Order of Ecclesia's biggest strength is its glyph system.  Throughout the game, Shanoa can absorb glyphs that give her certain abilities.  At first it starts off being very basic things such as using a Rapier or being a magnet to shoot yourself from one spot to another.  But they get more complex and allow for several different combinations.  If you enjoyed the soul system from Dawn of Sorrow and Aria of Sorrow, you'll love the glyph system.  It allows for many more combinations than the soul system does and allows you to utilize the glyphs more strategically.Streategy is especially important in Order of Ecclesia.  It's a tough game.  One of the hardest Castlevania titles out there to be sure.  While you probably won't have too much trouble getting through each area, you'll be put to the test in the game's boss battles, and they are by far some of the toughest moments in Order of Ecclesia.Despite that, Order of Ecclesia is as simple to pick up as any Castlevania before it.  Not only that, but the game still has a beautiful art design.  As far as 2D Castlevania games go, Order of Ecclesia has some fantastic art design.  You'll admire many of the backgrounds.  In particular, the boss designs are some of the best the series has ever had.  Artistically it's fantastic.  On the other hand, it's not really a step above Dawn of Sorrow or Portrait of Ruin.The biggest strength of Order of Ecclesia (and the Castlevania series in general) is easily its fantastic soundtrack.  The Castlevania series is well known for having some of the best music in gaming and Order of Ecclesia sets a new high for the music in handheld video games.Order of Ecclesia is one of the best Castlevania games out there.  In terms of the DS games, it rivals Dawn of Sorrow as being the best on the handheld.  If you're a Castlevania fan, you'll love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Two And A Half Dimensions","reviewText":"I'm a longtime fan of the DoA franchise, due to the inherent tongue-in-cheek humor and lighting fast bouts signature to the series. When it was announced that the game would be brought to the 3DS, I was beside myself with excitement. After all, the only other fighters announced for the system were \"Super Street Fighter IV\" and \"Blazblue Continuum Shift II\", and both of those operate on 2D planes. This was the only 3D fighter slated for Nintendo's fledgling handheld, and at the time of this writing, it still is. Being a fighting game nerd, this made it one of THE games to have for my otherwise stale 3DS. Now that I have it, though, my excitement is all at once quelled and killed. \"Dead or Alive Dimensions\" might as well be called \"Dead or Alive Light\", because it seriously skimps on many of the things that won over fans in the first place.The arcade mode feels dumbed down immensely, now operating on a ladder system unlike any other entry in the series. You start off with a series of bouts, which you can probably clear in under two minutes by simply mashing buttons. That unlocks another, along with a new character, followed by another and another. Rinse and repeat, with each ladder getting progressively more difficult, and you have the core foundation upon which you unlock characters and extra content. For fans who loved the challenge of unlocking characters and costumes in DoA 2-4, this is kind of a slap in the face. Granted, it's somewhat necessary, because you start off with a pathetic amount of characters unlocked in the first place, which brings to mind the question why Team Ninja didn't just start with more characters and make arcade mode a standard, more challenging affair. Overall, it's a nice little mode, but frustrating to start out with compared to past entries. The wealth of other modes, however, such as survival mode, fare much better and make the experience much richer than it would've been with only story and arcade mode.Most of the thought in the game, though, seems to have been spent on Chronicles, which is the game's story mode. This may actually be the best aspect of the game, if not the best story mode in the franchise. While it doesn't house the deepest story, it does keep in line with the series chronology, telling a large overarching plot different from the snippets of personal narratives seen in the previous games. I like this model, even though it's been done before by other games, and think that it suits the franchise well. Hopefully this is something that the developer will do in future entries.The most important part of a fighting game, of course, is the fighting, and this is one area where the game does not falter. Dual-button combat is the name of the game here, as it has always been for the games, and it works perfectly. Combos are displayed on the lower screen, so gone are the days of pouring over the pause screen for move memorization. Series staples such as juggling and countering have all made the transition smoothly as well. In short, if you're familiar with the series, you'll feel right at home; if not, the game is very easy to get the hang of.Graphically, the game is gorgeous. The backgrounds are much more detailed and fluid than those seen in \"Super Street Fighter IV\", and the characters move with the style and grace they always have. Every ripple of muscle on the men, and jiggle of the mammary gland on the women, are rendered with close attention to detail. Sadly, turning on the the 3D effects makes everything look noticeably worse, even slowing down the game. It's sad, because the actual illusion of the 3D is fantastic in this game, looking best during the cutscenes within the story mode.Audio in this game is great, especially the stage and menu music. Everything serves it's purpose of getting you in the mood to pummel kick some polygonal butt, maintaining fast tempos and making liberal use of guitars and synthesizers. However, the English voice acting is positively cringe-inducing, and should scare you into changing the spoken language into Japanese, stat.On the online front, things aren't as pretty. I have a very fast WiFi connection in my house, but trying to fight was a laggy pain in the rear. If this changes, I'll update the review, but insofar, fighting online is a bit irritating and could've used some more fine-tuning, what with it's vanilla layout and laggy fights.Little bonus features wrap up \"Dimensions\" into a neat little package, like it's StreetPass functionality, the ability to take 3D pictures of your battles, and collecting figurines of all the characters. While not particularly deep in the least, it's nice to know that Team Ninja didn't just slap together some modes and release the thing. Some definite effort went into making this a rich experience, and it certainly shows.\"Dead or Alive Dimensions\" is home to what fans have always kept coming back to Team Ninja for, and throws a few new curveballs at the player that mostly work. With it's improved story mode, great gameplay and fantastic graphics, this is a worthy buy for those looking to play something new on their 3DS before the storm of summer games hits, and a must-buy for fighting fans. \"Dead or Alive Dimensions\" will be getting a good amount of my attention in the coming months, and it deserves yours as well.Gameplay: A-Graphics: B+Music: B+Sound: C+ (English), B (Japanese)Overall: B+UPDATE (day after): I'm becoming closer to saying this is one of the better handheld fighters I've ever played. The story mode gets very in-depth, and hitting the higher levels of the arcade ladder gets you all of the characters you need to have a diverse selection. While the arcade ladder is a bit too short for my tastes, it turned out to be a nice mode that wasn't worthy of my initial scorn. The only other handheld 3D fighter I've played that rivals this would be \"Tekken: Dark Resurrection\", but this actually offers more in terms of what you can do. If you have a 3DS, you should probably get this.FINAL UPDATE: Okay, it's settled. This is a fantastic game. After playing a ton of non-laggy matches, sinking more time into the story mode, and becoming addicted to unlocking figurines, as well as making friends and perfecting strategies in the various modes, I must say that this is the best handheld fighter I've put my hands on. My initial review was four stars, but this game has staying power on a system where great games are seemingly few and far in between. Thus, my score is raised to a five. If you have a 3DS, this is perhaps the most in terms of content you'll able to get for a while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}

As earlier reviews have pointed out, this game is not for the faint of heart. The story concerns Harry, an average man who comes to the small town of Silent Hill, a town with a scarred history. He is on vacation with his daughter, Cheryl, and on their way, there is an accident. When Harry comes to, he finds himself alone, his daughter missing. Add to this, the town is deserted. As you might expect, there are dangerous monsters lurking about. The purpose of this game is to find Harry's daughter and unlock the secrets of Silent Hill's past. It won't be easy, though.&quot;Silent Hill&quot; is better than RE in that it provides much more realism. Harry is an average person like you or me, not a hero or arsenal on two legs. Like most humans, he is not an expert at conflict, so this makes the battles much tougher. The atmosphere is where this game reallt excells. The deserted town is creepier than anything out of a horror movie, with fog so thick that you cannot see 10 feet in front of you. The snow falls steadily. The music is subtle, adding to the creepiness. The monsters come out of nowhere, and there are many occasions that will make you jump.There is less action than the other survival horror games, but in a game like this, it is not a big loss. The game is more about solving puzzles than blowing monsters into oblivion. Unlike RPGs, there are no  experiece points, no levils, no benefit to fighting every single creature. Running from fights is often the best move.The one big flaw, which prevents this game from getting five stars, is the clunky controls. I pity the person who plays this game without the analog joysticks. Harry is very difficult to move around, thanks to the complicated control system. It takes a while to get used to them, but by that time you will have gotten killed a few times. The monsters come out of nowhere, and you have mere seconds to react. With controls this complicated, battles are really frustrating.But all in all, this is a fantastic game. Lots of depth, thrills, and scares. Sadly, this title is out of print, so grab it if you can find it. But it comes with a warning, it is violent and disturbing. Use with caution.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2001"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

There are a lot of kiddie games like Pokemon and Animal Crossing and all those other little girl games. Games like Zelda and all the remakes are great. GameCube constantly moans and complains that they get no sales. They should do what they did for Zelda, remake the oldies. There sales will go up if they made remakes of Mario games and Donkey Kong games. It's not because they are kiddie, it's because we all grew up with these games.Anyway, GameCube is just an average Nintendo system.

Fable 2 expands on the interactivity of Fable 1 in many key ways, but sacrifices some things from the original as well.The game takes place a few hundred years after Fable 1 - long enough, essentially, for the world to have changed, but with some elements still remaining either as modified forms of their original selves (like towns) or as ancient myths and legends (such as the exploits of the the hero and the other characters in the original Fable). Your character is an oddity - a hero (male or female, as opposed to Fable 1's male hero) who has arisen after they were thought to have died out. While the world is still a dangerous place, there's a shift from the epic struggles of the world of Fable 1 - which quickly resurge as events unfold. The fashions and styles have changed as well; rather than a traditional medieval fantasy setting, the world of Fable 2 is more of a 17th or 18th century world. Armor is essentially non-existent, and bows have been replaced entire by crossbows and guns. Melee weapons are roughly the same, though their style has changed slightly.As a whole, the game is a lot more content to let you explore the world. Fable 1 had a lot of interactivity, but there were always nagging demands from the omnipresent Heroes' Guild to do quests and so on. In Fable 2, after a relatively short introduction, you're free to do what you want, for the most part. Doing the main story unlocks new areas and towns, but essentially most of the game is available from the start. Certain changes have been made to emphasize the shift from a sponsored guild to a lone hero. For example, doing quests and killing monsters no longer gains you money; you either have to get a job (represented by a minigame or a short mission) or go digging for treasure. However, because of this, it's easier to accumulate money from the beginning of the game. Most of the items used for customization (haircuts, clothes, and dyes) are fairly inexpensive (in comparison to combat items like potions or weapons) so it's reasonably simple to find a look that suits you. The only downside of this is that there are remarkably few clothing items in the game; since they only serve a cosmetic purpose for the most part, you'd think it'd be easier to have more.The other aspect of customization is your character's alignment; the concept of this has been drastically expanded from Fable 1. In addition to good and evil (which has essentially been changed to helping innocents or killing innocents, respectively) there's also \"purity\" and \"corruption\" which involve lesser sins like gluttony, sloth, and lust (consorting with prostitutes, specifically). Abstaining from such sins will make you more attractive, while partaking of them will reduce your attractiveness. People can also be afraid of you or think you're funny, depending on what emotions you use near them; growling or threatening them will make them afraid, while telling jokes will make them laugh and treat you less seriously. Each character has their own unique preferences for what actions will make them more friendly, as well. Your interactions with people aren't limited to mere interaction - shopkeepers who like you will offer discounts, and if a person really likes you (and their sexual preference allows for it) you can propose to them and make a family. Fathering/mothering children has been added to the game - though pregnancy is essentially instantaneous, presumably to prevent female adventurers from trying to wander around while heavy with child.Combat in the game handles roughly the same as the previous game, though it handles slightly worse. Certain abilities (blocking, dodging, combo attacks) need to be unlocked by advancing in the \"strength\" or \"skill\" path. Magic handles the most differently from Fable 1: there's no more Will Points, but every spell needs to be charged up before it is fired off. Essentially, there's a line with a set of checkpoints lying along it; every checkpoint represents a spell level, and whatever spell (fireball, lightning bolt, etc) you have put in that spell level will be used if you release at that time. It's an overly complicated system that doesn't really help the game at all, and in a lot of cases it simply became easier not to use spells. Finally, due to the lack of armor and the reduced number of potions, you will take a lot more damage unless you've got a lot of skill. The game wants you to rely on food for health, so that you'll have to make the decision between your health and your waistline - a decision that doesn't make sense considering the fact that you are swinging a sword or axe around for most of the game, which should more than cover the amount of calories you're taking in.As a whole the game is promising, but in truth - and in terms of content - the game is barely equal to Fable 1. The size of the world is about the same - if not smaller - and the few towns are nearly identical (whereas in Fable 1 each town had its own theme and population). For this reason, while the game starts off promising, once you've gotten into it everything seems the same, and you've run out of new things to discover - new clothes to wear, new vistas to explore, new haircuts to get, etcetera. Much of the content is based on unnecessary sidequests, and the main quest fizzles out too soon with an entirely anti-climactic finish. Fable 2 provides only about ten to fifteen hours of actual gameplay; the rest of it is essentially wandering around doing tasks for people, buying houses, or raising a family. These things are exciting, but they should be side tasks for the main adventure, not the primary focus of the game. As a whole, though, the game is reasonably fun for the time that it has.6/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

In a time where Japanese RPGs dominated the market, BioWare was sitting in a little studio churning out one of the best RPGs of all time. I remember when I was younger how much of a big hoopla this game was. For someone who didn't own an Xbox or a PC that could run the game it still slipped under my radar. I eventually got a chance to rent the game years later on 360 and quickly got bored due to its age. I finally picked it up again on the PC and I am glad I did. The game may feel very dated and old (an entire decade), but there's no denying the excellent story and well crafted atmosphere that truly feels genuine in the Star Wars universe.You play a custom character that has to defeat the evil Sith Lord Darth Malak. He has found some sort of Star Forge to use against the Republic, so you are shadowing his footsteps to find the Star Maps to this Star Forge. This takes you across several planets such as Tatooine, Dantooine, Kashyyyk, Korriban, Yevin, and even Taris. You acquire companions along the way of all types and endure some pretty tough battles and story choices. You have to constantly choose between the light and dark side during choices, and there's plenty of ways to go about the story.Firstly, you can choose any world in any order. Each one is roughly laid out the same with a large hub area then an area beyond where your main quest and some side quests lie. I got rather annoyed with the constant similar layouts and wished for variety. Each world has the Star Map area blocked off until you fix some global catastrophe on the planet. Some are so serious that your decision will determine if you are allowed back on later. Besides running around and talking to people to get quests and buy stuff, the combat and customization is fathoms deep; fans will be pleased.You can customize your character with a plethora of items such as implants, shields, different weapons from lightsabers, blasters, vibroblades, belts, armor, robes, headgear, and I haven't even started on leveling up. You should pick your character based on how you're going to fight. I chose to use melee weapons because you eventually go through Jedi training and get your first lightsaber. I have to say that this brought a smile on my face when I inserted my crystals and watched my character whip around those sabers with the classic lightsaber sounds. Nothing can top that.The game allows you to customize all your items by inserting upgrades that you find or buy. This is mandatory because there really isn't a \"most powerful weapon in the game\". You just get a powerful weapon and you have to upgrade it or it won't do you much good. Other than this there is the deep leveling system. You can choose an attribute, feat, power, and skill. Feats effect what you use physically in combat and what combat attacks you can use. Powers are force powers and there are plenty of them. All light and dark powers you can possibly think of are here. I had a lot of fun using them in combat and getting an edge over certain enemies. The level cap is at 20, but most people probably won't even hit that by the end. I finished at level 18 and didn't have too hard of a time finishing it. You can even choose how your companions level up because you can control them too! This is great for people who like a variety and can't have every skill available for your character.Combat is turned based with die rolling behind the scenes. I really would have like real-time combat, but what's here is exciting and fun on its own. There are tons of different enemies to fight on each planet, and some are harder than others. I found the game really hard at first, but after a while you will level up and find the game very balanced. There are some issues in combat that just really annoyed me. There seems to be a targeting problem in small areas. When you click your action you want the characters will get stuck in an endlessly looping animation if there is someone in their way. This can cause you a battle because you have to disengage and restart the attack or move around the obtrusion. This happened quite a lot, but you will learn to just live with it.While the story is interesting and choosing how dialog will change it is fun, there are some issues here. Instead of your choice being final, some dialog trees will allow you to go back and change your answer or no matter how you persuade or force persuade neither will work and you can't continue the dialog. This is usually in side missions, but I have never seen the persuade option fail so much in a BioWare game. No matter how much I leveled up my persuasion attribute I failed an awful lot. Other than this though, my other issue is that some dialog just drags on way too long. I found myself skipping a lot of it or just reading ahead of the voices. These, again, are just minor issues that can be overlooked.The graphics in the game look old and terrible these days, but back in the day they looked amazing. I can see why it looked so good then, but you can still feel the Star Wars atmosphere and that's what counts the most. The character models and animations are stiff, blocky, and repeat a lot, but overall it works. Even some of the voice acting is spotty at best, but overall it is pretty good.KotOR is an amazing Star Wars experience, but the age may turn a lot of people off. My biggest issue of all is that the game doesn't give any clues on where to go ever. You get no hints and are left on your own to just figure out what to do. I had to use a walkthrough through most of the game because I had no idea where to go, or some quests were very cryptic. This is a huge no-no for me and really hurt the score the most. Overall, this is an amazing Star Wars game and any Star Wars fan will love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

It is not too hard and it has a cute story. Don't expect Wind Waker game play, however, because even though this game is based a bit on Wind Waker, the story is a lot less deep, and the game is a bit simpler.I don't hate the touch screen controls, but I am not the biggest fan of them. Overall they work pretty well, but once in a while when you try to do one thing, link does something else. I personally would prefer if they just used the buttons on the DS, but again, to me it's not the biggest deal, and it doesn't take anything away from the game play.This is where the but comes in. My only real issue with this game is that riding the train is time consuming. Of all the great things in Wind Waker, they had to put another slow mode of transportation. I don't like to sit and wait for the train to go from one place to another, just like how in Wind Waker I hated waiting for the boat. At least they put a cannon on the train, so while you are riding you can shoot things and monsters.

She has thwarted their dastardly efforts before. She stopped them from amassing an army of Metroids and she kept Mother Brain from retrieving the last known Metroid larva. Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Wow! One of the best games of the year!","reviewText":"The 8 year layoff in the Metroid series has left Samus fans in a state of longing.  Her appearances in both &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; games helped slightly, but there was no replacement for the fun and adventure of leading Samus in a battle against Mother Brain and/or the other Metroids.  With the frustration of Metroid having skipped the N64 system, fans were getting restless.  It can be said, unequivocally, that &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; for GameCube brings Samus back in a big way and more than satiates the cravings of all Metroid fans.It should be noted that &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; is actually a prequel of sorts.  It takes place before the events of &quot;Super Metroid&quot; (on Super NES), but still presents some familiar foes (Ridley, anyone?) while introducing a plethora of new ones.  One obvious area of concern for Metroid fans would be how this game could be translated from the perfect side-scroller into an effective game in GameCube's dynamic 3-dimensional environment.  The same concerns existed when &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; made a similar transition on the N64 system.  &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; made a smooth transition that opened up new worlds and new perspectives for fans of that series.  &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; accomplishes the same goal, but on a grander scale.  There is an initial battle scene aboard a battle-ravaged space station (similar to &quot;Super Metroid&quot;) that helps players get the feel for all the controls and how the game functions.  It is not overly difficult.  It is just very different.As Samus, the player employs a 'first-person shooter' perspective that comes complete with special visors and scanners that allow Samus to view a variety of different items in her travels.  In the beginning, Samus has combat and scanning visors that are necessary to all actions in the game.  The combat visor allows Samus to lock onto a fire at targets while the scanning visor allows her to scan for information from computers, about creatures, about artifacts, and various other bits of knowledge that will help Samus on her way.  There are thermal and x-ray visors to be acquired later that enable Samus to have different ways of viewing her surroundings.  They makes some boards easier to see, reveals some necessary secrets, and are absolutely essential to defeating some of the later bosses.  In addition to the visors, Samus can (and will need to) acquire up to 4 different types of weapons.  She starts with the power beam, but will also end up acquiring the ice beam, the energy beam, and the plasma beam.  The ability to charge these beams for extra destructive powers returns from the earlier games.  Missiles and morph bombs also return.  What is most fascinating about Samus' arsenal is that there are combination attacks that can be acquired throughout the game.  These combination attacks will combine the power of a specific beam, the missiles, and the charger to create a vicious attack.  Acquiring these weapons and then learning how and when to use them is one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game.The game, itself, involves Samus traveling to the world of Tallon IV, the former home to an ancient species of alien called the Chozo.  Tallon IV was devastated by an asteroid impact some time earlier and the subsequent poison gas, called 'Phazon', was released and effectively destroyed the Chozo species.  Of course, in the current time frame, the infamous Space Pirates decided they want to try and harness the destructive, but powerful, Phazon energy to fuel their weapons of destruction.  Samus must travel to Tallon IV to thwart to Space Pirates and help rid the planet of this toxic presence.  Samus goes into an exploratory mode similar earlier Metroid games.  Samus has four regular zones in Tallon IV to investigate (Tallon IV Overworld, the haunting Chozo Ruins, the fiery Magmoor Caverns, and the calm, but dangerous, icy Phendrana Drifts.), plus the important Phazon Mines and Impact Crater zones.  Samus must travel back and forth through all of these zones (except the Impact Crater) looking to recover various Chozo artifacts that will eventually allow Samus to enter the Crater and destroy the cause of all this misery.  Make no mistake, though, this is not your father's Metroid.  Whereas earlier Metroid games (and even the new &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; for Gameboy Advance) could be completed in 3 hours or less of elapsed time, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; will take closer to 20 hours!  There will be a lot of back tracking, searching, and battles with numerous enemies (sometimes repeated).  A lot of time and effort must be invested to win this game, but there is no doubting satisfaction that is to be derived from accomplishing that goal.  &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; continues to raise the bar on Nintendo's games and sends a message to other platforms that this is THE standard to strive for.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2002"}

You can bank with the R Button and tip down your nose while making jumps. You'll need all the control you can get, too, as you roar through the twists and turns ofF-Zero's 15 deviously difficult courses. There are four hover cars to choose from, each with its own strong points and weak points. Most beginners find the durability and handling of the Fire Stingray easiest to use (despite poor acceleration), but veteran players will often choose the more-balanced Blue Falcon.Strategy plays a big part in this speedfest. In this one-player racing game you will need to find shortcuts, elude hazards and snag power-ups if you want to beat your savvy competition. Keep an eye out for sand, land mines, magnets and other trouble spots, but always be ready to get a boost from a speed or jump plate. You'll earn one Super Turbo per lap, and part of the strategy is knowing when to use it.When originally released in 1991,F-Zero's graphics were light years ahead of most of the competition. It still impresses mightily, thanks to innovative use of Mode 7 scrolling that immerses you in the adrenalin-pumping action.Sonically,F-Zerois one of the best SNES titles.

I think the graphics are very impressive for its time, and it is blazing fast for a SNES racer. The music is also fantastic techno, the best music i've heard in a racing game, and better than most games in general. The vehicles are pretty cool, each having advantages and disadvantages. There are many difficulty settings, and many courses depending on the difficulty setting you chose. Beating the game on the hardest difficulty can be extremely difficult, especially at the later courses. The only rip I have on this game is that it should have been two players, and after you beat it so many times/ beat it on the hardest settings, it gets old (I played it non stop before i mastered it, now it isn't nearly as entertaining.) But for when it came out, it is definitely a classic, and to this day I think it is the best racing game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

To me, this game is an IMPROVEMENT on all of them. Is combat too easy? Yes. But that's always been the case in the Fable games. This isn't Ghost Recon or even Oblivion caliber combat. It's supposed to be accessible. Quite frankly this is why I have enjoyed ALL the Fable games, because, in essence, they're easy. It's a refreshing change from most games, some of which are so difficult they go beyond merely presenting a challenge, and cause stress and frustration. I play games to ESCAPE stress and frustration. Anyway, on to the details:Starting Out: After a clever opening scene that always comes with a Fable game, (If you have played before you will understand the use of the chicken, otherwise, never mind), you choose to play as a male or female, as in Fable II. Then you go through an introductory sequence and have to make your first couple of \"good\" or \"evil\" choices. After this, you start your journey with your mentor. You get introduced to your basic magic spell, and the \"sanctuary\" which, after the introductory parts, you can access at any time by pressing the START button. This basically replaces what used to be your inventory and map. There are rooms that hold the clothing and weapons you own, and sections of the wall where you can check your progress and manage the game. Now, this leads to the one complaint I have, and I don't understand why this is: THERE IS NO QUICK SAVE. You CAN save manually as long as you are not in the middle doing something, but evidently there are only two save slots, the auto save, and where you make saves. This is not good. As with all the previous games, if one or the other gets corrupted, you can lose hours of work. Bad, bad, bad, Lionhead. Why have you not changed this? Anyway, in the sanctuary, in the middle of the room there is a map of Albion, with all the areas you will be visiting. As in Oblivion, once you have traveled to a location, you can \"fast travel\" there; for new areas, or if you prefer walking it to see what hostiles, treasure, etc you can find, the good old (or pesky, depending on your view), \"Golden Bread Crumb\" trail is back. The last room, or at least the latest one I can get into is the \"Treasury\" where it shows how much gold you have, a ledger book with details, and a wall showing your in game achievements. I actually like the sanctuary better than the inventory. Maybe I'm odd.The other major change is how you level up. Instead of XP, as you complete quests, get combat experience (i.e. kill people and creatures), you accumulate \"guild seals.\" Once you have a number of these you are transported, or will get a cue that you can go to, the \"Road to Rule.\" This area has chests that contain upgrades that you can purchase with your seals, for example Level 1 Melee for 20 seals, or whatever. This is how you raise your level in skills. I sort of like it; it's different.There are plenty of side quests. On this I agree with others, they are sort of annoying it usually involves talking to someone, finding the thing they want, and bringing it back to them. But that's OK, cause you can walk there, kill wolves, bandits, etc, and build up your guild seals, also your relationship (assuming you are playing a \"Good\" character), will improve with the townsfolk. If you are playing evil, well, you won't care about the side quests anyway, probably.The dog is back, and I still love it.The side jobs that I have found so far are \"Pie Maker\" and \"Lute Hero.\" You press the keys it shows on the screen at the speed it shows, as you can go faster you raise your \"gold multiplier\" like the side jobs in Fable II. Apparently there is still a \"blacksmith\" job, but I haven't found where it is yet. One thing I miss (or at least I haven't got to a town that has them, is the pub games.So the point of the game is, you complete quests, and enlist enough followers so that you can try to overthrow the evil ruler. (Or I guess the ruler that is even more evil than you if you're playing evil). I plan to play through this time as \"good.\" Maybe I'll try \"evil\" next game.It is interesting how, so many games people rave about them and I don't care for them, and some games everyone hates, but I enjoy those. Oh well. I recommend this game. I will be playing it for a long time. If you don't like it, that is your choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Downright Amazing!!!","reviewText":"Let me first say I never was a fan of motion controls, never got into the Wii, or the recently released PS Move.  I've played both but neither interested me much...not enough to warrant a purchase at least.I should probably also mention I purchased Kinect strictly for the voice commands, and navigating with gestures.The above statement was short lived after receiving the unit today.  After I took the sensor out and set it up (it was bigger and heavier than I thought, not a bad thing just a pleasant surprise)  I mounted it under my LED TV, with theXbox 360 Kinect Wall Mount.Installation and setup is a breeze, I'm using an Xbox 360 S, so one single cable is all you need.  I mounted the sensor, plugged it in and powered up the console.  Long story short a few screens with tips and positioning graphics, a quick little tutorial and you're on the way.My very favorite feature, the one that blew me away is the voice recognition.  I cant wait to see what Microsoft does with this down the road, after seeing it in action...it can only get better and better.Next up was a few games of Kinect Adventures, online with a friend.  I must say I have never been so impressed with motion control gaming until today!  The obstacle course levels and rafting are simple concepts that turn out to be just an absolute blast!  When you get a couple 27 year old men laughing and giggling like school girls, that's a good time!A side note, this is one heck of a workout, absolutely hard to believe you can feel the burn and excitement of a workout with a video game, and alot of laughs!Not holding a controller is hands down the main selling point for Kinect, and Microsoft has marketed it that way (You are the controller) The way the camera reads and displays your every move is something out of a sci-fi film. Ducking, jumping, dodging, striking poses to collect coins, everything is fluid and responsive.  Alot of people ask about lag, but surprisingly the two games I've played (Kinect Adventures & Kinect Sports, more on that later) show minimal to no lag whatsoever.  You duck, your avatar ducks, you throw your hands up in celebration, your avatar reflects it perfectly...amazing.Now onto Kinect Sports, this game is a down right good time, bowling, boxing, table tennis, track and field, all just so much fun! All in all, I'm just downright blown away.  The lack of controllers to charge, store, wave around, etc, makes Kinect the absolute best motion controller(free) experience around.I have nothing against Move or Wii, I own a PS3, and enjoy it the alot, however when it comes down to motion games Xbox wins my praises.I cant explain the fun to be had with a Kinect with just words, you literally just have to hook one up in your home and have a blast.  Kids and adults alike will enjoy hours of fun and entertainment, just be ready for a good workout!*One more thing, Netflix voice/motion controls are not available yet, but it should be coming soon, that should really take Kinect over the top.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2010"}

Forget all that. Snake Eater revives the spirit of the first Solid, with an intriguing scenario, intense action, and a long adventure that stays riveting almost every step of the way--all wrapped in high-gloss cinematic cut-scenes and voice-overs that could have come from any A-action film. The game's long, but not overly so (save a few boss battles that go a few rounds too many), and it brilliantly combines the wide outdoors with confining interiors. The game's Cold War 1960s setting puts Snake right at cloak-and-dagger home. His mission is to infiltrate Soviet territory and rescue a nuclear scientist before he can create a weapon for a renegade group of Russian soldiers called the Cobra Unit. Complicating matters is Snake's former mentor, The Boss, who has defected to the Russians for personal reasons. The Solid titles dish out some intriguing boss characters, and Snake Eater features a pack of self-loathing, suicidal psychos condemned by their own murderous skills. Defeating them requires brains (The Sorrow), brawn (The Fear), or a combination of both (The End). Although it's set an era long gone, there's an effective arsenal of weapons and gadgets to collect. Dealing in stealth, there's a camouflage system where the uniform, face paint, and stance determines how well you blend into an environment, but to keep his stamina high, Snake must gather his own food, heal serious wounds, set fractures, and even cure diseases. It adds excellent depth to the game and makes the main character that much more human. Close-quarter combat is emphasized this time, as Snake can take on enemies in an up close and personal fashion by using his knife and pistol combination to extract information, create a human shield, or silently dispose of his prey. The solid controls keep the multiple functions literate and easy to remember. However, one of the few hitches is trying to fire your pistol while you use an enemy as a human shield. Somehow, you must keep your thumb on the [C] button and tap [SQ], which is quite a feat to accomplish. The game's lack of a custom-controller configuration doesn't help, either. The aesthetics pack a huge punch. The steaming jungles are fittingly brought to life, albeit with a tad of slowdown and other minor distractions for the otherwise-steady frame rate. The audio is first-rate, with the usual excellent voice casting, poignant sound effects, and rousing music score--some of the best the industry has to offer. Games of this high caliber don't come around often, but they're certainly appreciated when they do. Rumors abound that this is the last Metal Gear Solid game. If this is the case, Snake Eater is a superb swan song...and one of the best games of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

It's too close and causes the movement to be jerky and annoying especially when turning in a circle.- I am not all that crazy about not being able to hit a town and get more of the story.  Just buy stuff 'online'. Not cool at all and running across a save point every 20 mins?  Really? Also the game is pretty linear...but for this type of game, this is needed as it's long as all get out.- The Graphics on the PS3 are wonderful. Eyepopping even. In some places you can't tell the cutscence to the scences you are supposed to play.- I am noting how much more this game plays a little more like recent RPGs  where you really only control one character during battles. It's kind of fun because it takes some of the micromanaging away but at the same time, I do miss being able to command my characters during battles. I do enjoy the Paradigm Shifts during battles but I do hope there are more enemy varieties than what I have seen in the first 6 hours of playing. Also I am mixed right now on teh whole auto heal after battle as that has never been done before in any FF game but this feels more 'western' than others.  I also enjoyed in FFX the ability to swap members in the middle of fights and that is also gone now..what's the sense in having 5 members if you are only going to be using 3?- I wasn't all that crazy that for the first 3 hrs of play was a 'tutorial'. The only thing that saved it from being a complete lete down is that they used this (learning how to fight, learning how to use items etc) to move the story along.- So far the voice acting is really on point.  Playing this game is akin with playing a CG Anime.- The datalog concept is great. Something that you are finding more and more on RPGs with tons of reading without cramming it all into a book.if you are a fan of more traditional western RPGs (Dragon's AGe and Mass Effect) and never played a Final Fantasy game, you may want to steer clear but if you have at least tried one JRPG and Final Fantasy in particular an dliked the experience, this is for you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0023CC0M4","reviewerName":"M. Ram","summary":"A decently fun game for this adult...kids might like it too!","reviewText":"I found MN to be a pretty enjoyable game, though there are only so many enemies and only so many ways to beat them. In terms of gameplay and combat, it's almost like \"Ninja Gaiden lite\" in that you have regular attacks, special attacks and magic attacks (and collect essence from enemies, etc), and surprisingly you actually use most of the various characters and items available towards the end of the game. The game's structure reminds me of older generation games in that there are 3-4 levels/areas with regular enemies that lead to a single boss which requires a totally unique strategy to beat. These were some of my favorite parts of the game; usually I don't like QuickTime Events but these were a refreshing change after running around some of the repetitive areas and hitting the square button a thousand times.There are four big downfalls to the game. First (as I was leading to), it starts to get monotonous around halfway through. There are areas stocked with enemies (and collectables) you'll probably bypass rather than play through, as there's no real point to fight the same guys and gather the same items over and over. You can return to levels later on, but unless you're a completist or trophy hunter, there's no real reason to once you beat the game.Second, for a cutesy game aimed at kids and teens, there's no co-op or multiplayer. There are several characters you can play as (or you can play the whole thing as Hiro, for a challenge), but you have to play it alone.Third (as others have mentioned), towards the end of the game there's a level where you have to escape an avalanche while riding down slopes and across ice fields. Not only is it incredibly difficult, there's no preparation for it and it's the only time in the game you're forced to switch to an unfamiliar scheme to proceed. HINT: Turn off \"motion sensing\" in the options menu so you can use the left stick to turn (instead of having to tilt the controller). I finally beat it once I did this, after trying several dozen times...The final (and biggest) annoyance is the camera. The aforementioned (2000s) Ninja Gaiden is known for having a wonky camera, but at least it stayed focused on the action and you got used to it after some time. In MN, it's the same style of camera used in Super Mario 64, in that it's a \"solid object\" and gets stuck or swings around wildly and gives you an angle of the ground or the sky (while you get killed). I died more due to the camera than anything else!I do have to say that if you have older kids or young teens, Mini Ninjas is one of the few options for family-friendly gaming on the console. Well, until everyone gets bored with it and switches back to  LittleBigPlanet.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

Perhaps it was the sense of complete freedom, which allowed players to spend their income however they saw fit, completely disregarding the story in favor of video games and little toy capsules. Maybe it had more to do with the utterly enveloping environment, which went further toward becoming a totally immersive scenario than any other game in history. Who knows, maybe it was the game's setting in mid-80s Japan, two cultures I've always found fascinating (80s pop culture and traditional Japanese culture). One thing's for certain, it wasn't the emotionless, deer-in-the-headlights expression constantly sported by the story's hero, Ryo Hazuki. Regardless, I was hooked on this story of revenge, reality, and the kind of awkward relationships characteristic of our teenage years.Though the Dreamcast sequel never arrived in America, Sega revamped the title, added a few new features and finally released it on Microsoft's Xbox. Alongside Halo, it was my first purchase for the enormous black and green machine.Bar none, the coolest thing about the Shenmue series is its outrageous attention to detail. There exist hundreds of storefronts, people, objects, games and environments that don't have any impact whatsoever on the story itself. They could've just as easily been left out, yet their inclusion broadens the game's scope substantially. Almost every doorway can be opened, every object, from the fliers hanging in a popular street corner to the televisions hidden away in the corner of a pawn shop, can be examined in detail. Sega even carried on the tradition of including emulated versions of Suzuki's arcade hits, this time packing in Afterburner II, Out Run, Hang On and Space Harrier.There's no such thing as a cut scene in Shenmue II, everything you see is live rendered. And, while that was a real feat for the Dreamcast (producing graphics on the fly that rivaled those of the Psone and N64's pre-renders), it's not as impressive on the Xbox. Though it gives it the old college try, Shenmue isn't as visually impressive as Rygar: The Legendary Adventure on the PS2, Metroid Prime on the Gamecube or even Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee on the Box itself. Honestly, though the visuals are improved slightly, this still looks, feels and functions much like a Dreamcast game. The water effects, especially, pale in comparison to what we've already seen the Xbox can do. The game looks above average at best. Not great, but still good. As I mentioned earlier, the real strength of Ryo's world is the tremendous variety in the storefronts, environments and various items, and this is something that helps set it apart from the pack.Occasionally, Ryo will be drawn into a fight scene, which functions like a strange blend of Final Fight and Tekken. Visually, the transition between \"wander and talk mode\" and \"fight bunch of guys mode\" is almost seamless. Very rarely are these fights one-on-one affairs, and you're usually called upon to take down upwards of a half dozen guys at one time. You've got an impressive list of moves at your disposal, with more available as the game progresses, but really only utilize about ten or eleven on a regular basis.The musical score to Shenmue II follows in the footsteps of the original; it's epic. Every one of the arrangements in the game serves to broaden the scope of this already impressive, expansive title. It truly feels like you're playing a character in a major motion picture, and it invokes your emotions at just the right moments. Near the game's conclusion, when Ryo stands atop the roof of the tallest building in town, staring into the sunset, you really feel as though you're coming of age along with him. When he first rides into port aboard an enormous ocean liner in the game's opening scene, the music further emphasizes that this is the beginning of a tremendous journey. It really is that solid.Pity I can't say the same about the voice acting. Every one of the characters is just as wooden and emotionless as Ryo himself, which is one of the dark clouds that seems to have followed this series throughout its existence. Though everyone in town has a distinct voice, they all share similar traits; nobody gets excited about ANYTHING, and they all place intonations on the wrong words with frightening regularity. Ryo himself is one of the least appealing characters I've ever played, and nearly everyone in the world seems to share this disposition. It's hard to get excited about the revelations involving Lan Di and his relationship to Ryo's father, when those making the revelations are themselves completely disinterested in the proceedings.Included with the Xbox version is a DVD containing the majority of the cutscenes from the original Shenmue for Dreamcast. I found this to be a great, somewhat quick, refresher course before diving into the new events. It'd been years since I last ventured into this world, and I was reminded of several small threads I'd have otherwise forgotten. On that same hand, I can imagine how much the inclusion of this disc would have aided players with absolutely no experience with the Dreamcast. A great idea, and something I wish more gaming dynasties would consider.Overall, I found myself enjoying the first Shenmue more than I did the sequel. This is still a series I'd be interested in seeing pursued, but no matter what you may have heard... it HAS taken a small step down with this release. While the first game focused much more on Ryo's inability to relate to his peers, his awkward social life and his pure intention to avenge his father's murder, the sequel delves more into the spiritual and political ramifications of his actions. It wasn't quite as much fun as the original, though the overall feel was very similar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2003"}

I don't know why, it just doesn't.That said, I really enjoy this game, and it's got me coming back.I can see how some people would complain that this game is too hard, and others that it is too easy, but to me they got the difficulty just right.  At first, certain parts of World 1 were kicking my butt.  But before too long I got the hang of it, and I have had a whole lot of fun with it.  Some stages can still seem difficult, but not too difficult.  And at first, it seemed impossible to find secret exits.  That's a good thing.  I do wish that finding all the star coins was a bit more challenging though, it may only take you one heavy day of playing.I think this actually has less classic mario enemies than Super Princess Peach has.  Guess that was because they were trying to keep this game fairly simple.The one part of this game that I think they could have done better is the music - none of the tunes really seem catchy to me.  But the enemies and Fire Flowers sure seem to think the tunes are catchy - sometimes I let enemies live just so I can watch them dance to the music.If you find that you don't like the koopa shell that Mario can wear, then this game is a little low on power-ups.

{"product_name":"B004Z4ZKL6","description":"","reviewerName":"OJ Silk","summary":"FIFA 12: A good game improved with a Realistic Feel","reviewText":"FIFA 12 has a realistic feel to it. The game's tempo feels right. The already good gameplay from FIFA 11 has been altered a bit. Tactical defending adds a new dimension to the gameplay (you have the option of turning it off but not online). Patience and how you play off the ball feels like advanced simulation as opposed to tackling and sliding all over the place. You can get help, double up an opponent and jockey for position which will force mistakes (ie., like real soccer). On offense, you have better ball control which is especially good during tight situations. The dribbling is a lot more precise and when done well, you can free yourself up for scoring opportunities or to set up a teammate.Meanwhile, visuals have also improved a bit. At first glance, it will look like FIFA 11 but the animations have improved. Primarily due to the added realism in player collisions. These along with the excellent player likeness makes an already good game more polished. (although IMO Konami's PES has the best player likenesses in soccer). In addition, the stadiums and lighting effects look phenomenal. Last but not least is the commentary, which no longer features Andy Gray. It is not repetitive and annoying like say, Madden 12. For those that love online play, there are tons of modes & features.Pros: Tactical defending, Precision Dribbling, Polished Graphics, Solid Commentary and Lots of Online Modes & Features.Cons: No game's perfect, there are always little glitches & not a huge leap over FIFA 11 -- just a little better.Bottom Line: FIFA 11 was very good and FIFA 12 is even better. Worth buying? Well, that's up to you. If you have $50-60 available for video gaming and like soccer, I'd say yes. If you're on a tight budget, not worth it if you've got FIFA 11.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"Reginald M. Lumagui \"green_lantern_2814\"","summary":"Very good game..but it's not for everyone.","reviewText":"One reviewer already said he prefers Metal Gear to Shenmue so if that's your cup of tea then maybe this game isn't for you. But taken from an rpg/reality simulation game, this game is the best so far. You have to train and discover new fighting moves on your own. At times there are QT scenes where you gotta react instinctively for certain events to unfold. How many out there were too slow at first and managed to get the ball to hit the little girl? ;) You can raise a little cat while you're on your adventures. There's just alot of little mini things that may or may not have anything to do with the plot which makes this interesting. So, if you're the type that just wants to blow stuff up and likes a fast paced game, then Shenmue isn't for you. But if you're like me and love little distractions and have patience, then this game is great. Heck, I once spent 15 minutes just stalking one guy in Tenchu and that was fun for me. Of course, the game isn't perfect. There are little flaws like the dialogue becoming repetitive at times, not being able to skip certain scenes you've been thru before, or my biggest gripe..no analog control. It does get a bit inconvenient at times when you're in a cramped space and only have digital control. But still, this game definitely ranks up there as one of the great games. But like every great game, it might not be your cup of tea. If you don't like a particular type of game, why buy into the hype? That would be like me buying Madden when everyone says it's one of the greatest games, but I don't give a care about sports games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2000"}

However, with the release of Diablo II Expansion: Lord of Destruction, those of you that put Diablo 2 down, or have reduced your playing hours, prepare to be sucked back in to the world of Diablo...With Diablo dead and his soulstone destroyed, it seems that the world is at peace again.  However, there was one major oversight: Baal, Lord of Destruction(and my favorite of the three Prime Evils) has been amassing a great army during your hero's trek into Hell to battle Diablo.  This tremendous oversight has now come into fruition, as Baal has invaded the Barbarian Highlands in the Northen regions, thrusting you once more into battle with one of the most powerful forces of Evil in existence...With dozens of new monster types, you will find yourself fighting for your life against some of the most difficult monsters yet encountered in the game.  Some, namely the Reanimated Horde, simply just do not want to stay down!  They may require you to kill them up to 3 times just to keep them there!  However, each time you kill it, it is as if you are killing another monster entirely, giving you even more experience and possibility for items.  These are just some of the many new monster you'll encounter, including a few unique 'Boss' monsters, including The Lord of Destruction himself!Two new classes headline this expansion set, which are the Assassin and the Druid.The Assassin is an incredible class.  She has 3 skill trees, one of which is Martial Arts, which give her the ability to perform magical martial arts moves, as well as the addition of 'charge up' moves that, when charged enough, will result in a fantastic display of effects and heavy damage to monsters.  Another skill tree is the Disciplines tree, which allows her to master her art of using Claw weapons(the assassin unique class weapon) and other abilities such as blocking, elemental resistance, even creating a 'shadow' version of herself, capable of the same destructive force that she is!  Her final tree, Traps, is a great tree that allows the assassin to deploy devices such as fire bombs, lightning webs and others to keep enemies at bay.The Druid is very much like the Necromancer class, with one extra unique and awesome ability: the ability to shape-shift into a Werewolf or Werebear!  Aside from that, the druid is a master of Earthly magics, with the forces of nature at his command.  He can also summon the animals of the wild and spiritual realms, such as Dire Wolves, ravens and Grizzly bears!  Definitely a formidable fighter, he is sort of like a revamped NEcromancer on steroids.Also in this expansion is one final act with 6 quests, Act V.  Those of you who have beaten Diablo II already are saying: 'One act? That's it?  Is it worth it?'  All i can say is YES.  Act V is almost TWICE the size of Act III, which was the longest Act in the original game.  The playfields are huge and beautifully detailed, and yet another masterful musical score accompanies the new act, fitting nicely with the chaos and drama that happens throughout.Finally, there are thousands more unique, set, magical and rare items added to the game's original thousands!  This should make adventuring alot more desirable, and up the replay value a few notches.The expansion also includes two more cinematics, again, in excellent quality and worthy of the standards set by Blizzard in the past.  The opening cinema to Act V is incredible.  If you didn't like Baal previously, trust me, you'll like him now.  Excellent voice acting and casting, dozens of new creatures, thousands of new items and 2 new incredible classes all stuffed into one HUGE Act make this well worth your time and money.  The addiction is going to come back...and its gonna hit HARD.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2001"}

I never got into Soul Caliber, Tekken, Mortal Kombat etc etc etc. In fact, before this game the original Street Fighter 2 was the ONLY fighting game I ever enjoyed playing. Street Fighter 4 takes everything the original Street Fighter 2 was, polishes it up with next-gen graphics and smooth controls, and throws in a few new fighters for you to play with.The thing that I love most about Street Fighter 4 is the controls. To me the current 3D fighting game controls seem sluggish and trying to do super-powered moves is a pain. In SF4 the controls are not only tight, you'll find yourself amazed at how easy it is to pull off some fancy moves and set up combos. Also, it's nice that EVERY character has their own unique controls so you never feel like you're playing the same fighter twice. One more thing I should mention is this is very much a 2D fighter and controls as such.The graphics as I said are very flashy and up-to-date. The characters move smoother than your average anime and every facial expression is captured perfectly. Everything just moves fluid and looks natural.If there was a bad thing to mention about Street Fighter 4, it would be the story....or more how it's presented in Anime cutscenes. Not only do the characters looks NOT match up to the in-game designs, the voice acting is terrible and badly written, and the story adds nothing to the game what-so-ever (assuming you can even make sense of the cut-scenes). Each character has their own intro and ending cutscene, but not a single one is memorable or worthy of mention (actually Dan has a mildly amusing one, but nothing to write home about).Street Fighter 4 looks great, is easy to get into and is an absolute blast even if you're not a fighting game fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Darkly Knighted","reviewText":"Damn, what a breath of fresh air this game was!  A solid, fun throwback to the old days of platform narratives and the first kick-ass batman game possibly ever.  If you haven't played it yet, seriously put it on the list right now.  Bump it up a few notches if it's already there.So let's jump right in; this game does everything right.  There are some minor imperfections here and there but they aren't even worth mentioning as nothing harms the experience overall.  Sometimes the animations aren't cleanest, some of the investigating is repetitive, blah blah who cares.Gameplay can be broken into three parts: multi-enemy battle royals, stealth sections, and investigation.  Which, if you're making a Batman game, is probably about as perfect as you can get.  The fisticuffs are incredibly fun and designed to put you alone against a group of unarmed or lightly armed badasses.  It plays out like a rythm game (which the game was originally intended to be... seriously, google it) and Batman's at his best when he's moving swiftly and precisely from one punk to the next.  Once you've got the beat down (no pun intended) you can really build your combat multiplier which unlocks more speed and more bone-breaking attacks.  It's the most definitive 'easy to learn, hard to master' style I've ever seen: it's only a couple of buttons, but getting to the point where you can take down twelve inmates weilding knives and stun batons without taking a hit requires real practice and some quick reflexes.Occasionally the inmates of Arkham actually manage to pick up a gun or two, which force the Batman to hide in the rafters and take down his enemies one by one.  These sections are harder, as being spotted means being gunned down pretty quickly.  But thinning their numbers with suprise attacks, explosive booby traps and what have you is incredibly satisfying.  Leaving unconcious bodies for the others to find, like some kind of twisted calling card, really gives the feeling of being a vigalante lunatic baddass.  By the end of the hunt, the remaining goons will be twitchy and nervous, scanning the room for you and shooting at shadows.  It's a real reward and makes all the patient planning feel worthwhile.Each of these segments are distinct and, on their own, wouldn't make for a terribly impressive game; fun but not impressive.  It's the moving from one to the other while trying to piece together the pretty tight storyline that makes it all work so well.And speaking of... all of this rests within one of the most fun video game stories I've ever seen.  I put it up there with Bioshock, only without those repetitive fetch quests in the third act.  Without spoiling much - we open with Bats bringing the Joker into Arkham Asylum... which In Gotham, I guess, doubles as due process.  But whatever.  After a brilliantly tense opening walk as you lead the Joker to his cell, he finally springs his trap!  From there things go downhill: the inmates have been released, the Joker's in control and Batman is trapped in what feels more like a house of horror than anything else.  Seriously, I was shocked at how much the game plays out like a horror movie or something, or like being trapped in a really awesome amusement park funhouse.  Especially the mind-bending segments with the Scarecrow, which are probably the best in the game.  The Joker racks up a serious body count and the stakes are pretty high.  The atmosphere is taught and consistent, the voice acting is top-notch (Mark Hamill's Joker steals the show by far); again, Rocksteady pretty much did everything right.I've gone on long enough, but it's a game so well put together that most anyone will find something to like about it.  A real step in the right direction.  Here's looking forward to Arkham City!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}

Chances are, if this game is indeed going to be up your alley, you've already heard of it, and probably own it. If you're not sure, however, or maybe if you're a vanilla gamer who's out to try something new, then this might just be the next big thing.The plot of Disgaea looks relatively simple from a distance. Laharl, prince of the Underworld, awakens from a two-year nap to find that some things have gone wrong while he was dreaming. His father has died, and since he wasn't conscious to acceed the throne, the former vassals of the king are now scurrying to take the position that should rightfully be his. Laharl gears up and sets about to reclaim his place as ruler through any means necessary.And from here, the plot will quickly descend into what can only be described as Japanese Insanity. In Laharl's travels, he'll encounter Angels that want to be ninjas, soldiers that want to be The Power Rangers, demons with lost memories, zombies made ultra-powerful through a particularly unusual endowment, spirits of the dead that serve pennance dressed in penguin costumes, alternate dimensions hidden within items, and an Underworld Governmental Assembly where \"physical persuasion\" is often necessary to get laws passed.Seems relatively straightforeward, right?Ah, but therein lies the rub, and also where the game gets it's charm. All that plot insanity carries over to the game's actual play mechanics as well. Disgaea is not a game that takes itself seriously. In fact, it doesn't take anything seriously whatsoever, ESPECIALLY basic game mechanics. It isn't ten minutes before starting that the game is gleefully skewering nearly every convention of the Tactical RPG genre imaginable.For example, most Tactical RPGs keep statistics on the player's characters. Win battles with them and they become more powerful, typically indicated in the character's \"level.\" A level 3 character at the beginning of the game will usually cap out at level 80 or so, with 99 being the absolute maximum. This holds true with Disgaea as well, and in a standard game, a level 90 character is indeed quite powerful and can stand up to some of the toughest battles in the main storyline...But why stop there? The maximum character level in Disgaea, should you feel like putting the time in to train them that high, is 9,999.Yeah.It's completely pointless, as there is no way that even the most powerful enemies in the game's most secret hidden dungeons (of which there are several) could ever stand up to such a powerful character, nevermind how long it would take to level them to that point - we're talking well over 100 hours, and that's if you're doing it really fast. However, at the end of the day, it's POSSIBLE to do such a thing. Really, that's the most important statement here. After all, you may not NEED to get your characters to anywhere close to that level, but if you WANT to do it...Why not?Why not, indeed. One gets the feeling that the game's designers have long been fans of the genre, but when the time came to make decisions on things like level caps and attack ratings, the question \"Why not?\" came into play quite a bit. Ten controllable characters at a time? Well, why not? The ability for characters to pick each other up and toss them around the map, thereby getting around most movement restrictions per turn? Sure! Exploding penguins? Exploding penguins! The list goes on and on...This could be a problem in other games, but Disgaea manages to pull it all off because, at it's heart, the tried-and-true methods of the genre are all here, and they all work flawlessly. They're just completely unshackled, and the really mavelous thing is that it still works.And it's this key aspect that may very well kill the game for a lot of people. In order for Disgaea to be fun, you have to see all this as a good thing, which, to the uninitiated, is a difficult thing to do. The concept of going through a 100-floor randomly generated dungeon in order to level up a particular sword's base statistics will strike some people as brilliant, and some others as stupid. The fairly low (though very efficient) production values don't really give the game any added punch, and as a whole, it's really something that's aimed squarely at fans.The game knows it's audience, but doesn't try to extend beyond that. If the features mentioned in this review strike you as something you'd want to play, then buy this game; you won't regret it at all. If you're unsure, however, then chances are this game's brilliance will fall flat for you.It's a fans-only party, but those who \"get it\" will have an absolute blast.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00008URUA","description":"Join Yuna in mission-based, non-linear gameplay, as she and her companions travel across Spira in this epic Final Fantasy adventure.","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"Fun, But Nothing Like FFX","reviewText":"This game's prequel, \"Final Fantasy X\", was a truly fantastic game I would absolutely recommend playing.  But be warned, \"Final Fantasy X-2\" is nothing like the previous game, and even if you loved the first game, you may not like this one.  This game may take locations and characters from the first one, but that is where the similarities largely end.  This game is lacking the beautiful story or the wonderful characters or the heart that made the last game so great.The game actually follows Yuna's story this time around, but this is not the Yuna you remember.  Now she's, I can't believe it myself, a pop singer.  That's right, a pop singer.  And she is often shown with guns.  I don't know why they decided to take this sweet, humble, selfless character and turn her into this.  It just doesn't suit her.  In addition to Yuna, your party consists of Rikku (who now wears much less clothes and is much more annoying) and a new character named Paine.  I think Paine is cool, but she is not really that interesting, and I feel she adds nothing to the story.  She is mainly there to be the third character to fight alongside you.  Actually, Rikku doesn't add much, either.Anyway, to sum things up character-wise, I feel the characters are much less likable in this game.  Most of the new ones are not that likable (Leblanc is just obnoxious, and her clothing is just ridiculous, which maybe shouldn't matter, but it bothers me nonetheless), and I think Yuna and Rikku are less likable now, too.  It's especially a shame with Yuna, as she was really a great character before.  Now, there's nothing to make her stand out from anyone else anymore.The story is not that interesting, either.  Yuna, Rikku, and Paine are sphere hunters.  Remember those spheres that played movies?  Well, when Yuna saw one that showed a man resembling Tidus, she decided to become a sphere hunter to try to find more in the hopes that maybe she can find him.  That sounds okay, but while that does play a role in the story, that idea is actually dropped.  Basically, the story kind of doesn't go anywhere for a while, and then when stuff does happen, I just didn't really care by that point.  Aside from my usual motivation to play a game through so I have the satisfaction of beating it, there was nothing else making me interested in seeing what happened next.I'd also like to mention that the majority of locations in the game are identical to the locations in the first one, so you will be revisiting many places you've already seen.  Kilika has changed, and there are a variety of featureless caves and tunnels they've added to various locations, but that's about it.  I wish we could have seen different parts of Spira or something.  Surely we didn't see every inch of the place in the first game.  Also, the music is done by a different person, and a lot of it is much more modern.  I thought much of the first game's music was truly beautiful.  This music is not.Now I get to my biggest complaint.  This game is much less serious than the first one.  That could be fine, but I often find this game to be downright silly, from the silly dialogue during battles to watching Yuna sing and dance, including the opening scene of the game showing Yuna singing in a concert in Luca which seemed to have no relation to the game's story in any way whatsoever.  And it wasn't even Yuna, but someone disguised as her, and I still can't figure out what that was about, but as I said, that has nothing to do with the plot.Another silly thing is the dresspheres.  The battle system of this game is much more fast-paced.  It is turn-based, but it is more real-time, so enemies are attacking while you are making decisions.  Characters only have a limited set of moves at a time, like only white magic or only sword skills.  Then, they can switch to other roles during battle to suit their needs.  That is all fine.  But, each of these roles is called a dressphere, so when you change a role, your character changes into a new (often revealing) outfit.  I just feel so very goofy watching my characters change clothes right in the middle of a fight.  I am not at all interested in trying on clothes in real life, and I don't wish to watch my characters in a video game do it, either.  Yeah, yeah, Yuna just switched to a white robe to be a White Mage.  Can I get on with the fight and bring Paine back to life already?  I have much more urgent matters to attend to right now.And that's not all.  The characters don't switch clothes very quickly, either.  (But, I suppose if I was trying to change my outfit in the middle of a brawl, I'd take a few moments, too.)  You actually get a little cut scene every time you change.  I really don't care to watch a clothes-changing scene.  And I especially don't want the battle being interrupted by this.  It is boring.  They are usually short scenes, but still.  I actually try my best not to change dresspheres during battle unless my current arrangement is really, really bad.  I usually wait for a battle to end, and then I switch in the menu screen, so I can skip the scene.But, I've complained a lot.  I do have some good things to say about the game.  It is fun.  It is challenging (some boss battles are tough and so are some extra missions).  The game adds the option of jumping or climbing in certain locations, which makes exploring a bit more interesting.  The dresspheres do add a nice variety.  There are a good number of them, and each character gets a special one.  Unfortunately, you must switch to every dressphere on your Garment Grid during battle to use it, which can be annoying.  (So you may want to use a Garment Grid with few spaces.)  But, the special dresspheres are very useful.  Your character fights on their own, but they are very strong, and they still have a team of three.  I still haven't found Paine's, but I like Rikku's a lot.  She gets to fight with this pretty cool machina, and the main part can use strong attacks, while the other two parts can use other kinds of moves or even heal.  These special dresspheres are wonderful in really tough battles.  Sometimes, I couldn't do it without them.And I like that the more you use a dressphere, the more moves you learn.  It gives me a reason to use each one.  In the list of abilities for each one, you can even choose which move to work towards next.  Then, once you've used that dressphere a certain number of times, you learn something new.  And it has nothing to do with an enemy's strength.  You know how the higher your level is or the weaker an enemy is, it eventually takes forever to level up?  Well, the enemy has no bearing on this.  Just use that dressphere, and it will level up.  I even sometimes had everyone be a White Mage and use Pray over and over to get new healing spells faster.The game also has a lot to do.  There are various missions and mini-games all over Spira, and it can take a while to do everything.  But, a warning to those who get the game.  Make sure you do extra missions early on.  I found the hard way that if you work through the main part of the game, some missions will no longer be available.  I wanted to work through the story, then, do all the extras near the end, but most of those were gone by then.  I missed a lot of dresspheres with no hope of ever getting them in this save file.  I do wish the game didn't do that.  I'm sure it would have been fun to do all those things I missed.Anyway, you likely want to know if you should buy the game or not.  If you're looking for another \"FFX\", look elsewhere.  This is not it.  If you are fine with all the flaws I mentioned, then maybe you will like it.  It is disappointing compared to the first one, and I was bothered by certain aspects at first, but when I got into it more, I did start to have fun.  I still don't like the story or the characters or the silly, revealing outfits, but I can't deny that it is fun.  No matter how silly, it is a very fun game, and I do look forward to playing again and getting all the things I missed.  Not a fantastic game, but not a terrible one, either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

There's a lot of things to blow up, but not a lot of plot.I appreciate that you can be a male or female character, and that they customize the dialogue and situations around the type of character you have chosen. The graphics are reasonably OK, although not nearly up to the level of most other current release games. For example, I was convinced there were leaves falling around me in one scene, but eventually realized they were bizarre moth creatures which were \"clipping\" into the ground.You have minimal choices at times - do you kill your targets, or bring them in as prisoners? Most of the time you are just tracking down more weapons, blowing up more items, gathering up more money.There are mini-games that help you hone your skills, but even these are pretty simple - shoot at some targets, blow up some statues. We cranked the dollar value for each game up to the maximum and got through them rather easily.That's not to say the game isn't fun if you simply take it as a destruction game. It can be fun blowing up buildings, blowing up cars, shooting things of course. However, as an actual mission based game, along the lines of Grand Theft Auto, Saint's Row or even Just Cause, there is a lot missing here. It's sort of like a \"light\" version of those games.If you really enjoy blow-things-up game then certainly this game could be perfect for you. Not every game needs a plot! Heck, I love Super Mario games. If you're on the fence, though, rent this one first and see how long the appeal lasts for you. It might be that a weekend of it is enough. On the other hand, if you find you really get into the game and enjoy that let-loose aspect of it, you can then buy it.For me, though, there's enough blow-up aspects in several other games I own that I would rather play them than to play this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2008"}

That's just annoying.Unpolished.  Obviously EA should stick to publishing and not creating games.  If you like enemies spawning every where then you'll... like... this?  For me, if I cleared out an area, I don't expect another enemy to spawn right in front of me.During a mini-mission where I had to destroy 4 nazi bridges, the mission worked as planned.  After destroying 3 bridges the 4th one was missing something.  I climbed on the certain locations on the bridge to plant explosives, but I couldn't.  There wasn't any shadowy like explosive to indicate that I put it on the correct location.  In fact it did do anything.  I basically had to give up.It's 2009 and it will be 2010 next month.

I would say the game is 50% Pirate 50% Assassin.  This game stays true to the assassins creed formula and playing it feels the same.  Now your thinking ok whats new.True open world game which allows you to really do what you please even if you start playing the story missions you can still do side activities.  People have always complain that the money system sucks because you become a millionaire and theirs nothing to use the money for.  This time the game makes you feel like a pirate because no matter how much money you have its never enough, damn its never enough, you actually have to think and plan what do you want to use the money for and what's worth purchasing first.  You need money for your hideout, for ammo, weapons, ship ammo and upgrades.  And ship upgrades is a must if you want to survive in the long run.  Even after completing the game and having about 40% of side missions completed how much treasure do I need to find, How many men do I need to continue to kill to have the money to fully upgrade my ship.  and the thing is not only do you need money you also need materials to upgrade your ship so you need to go hunting, exploring or go plundering other ships.If you played Assassins Creed 3 Naval Battles then this is what Black Flag is all about and you will enjoy it.  In the beginning your gonna try to avoid the big bag guys to being fearless and destroy any ship that comes near.Activities-Treasure hunting on Land, Islands or under water-Assassination Contracts-Templar Hunts which is a short story about you trying to find the 5 men with the key to the ultimate Templar outfit-Plunder other ships- Searching for Collectible itemsExploration-Islands, oceans and wreak ships-For hunting there are a variety of animals and you can also go hunting in the oceans for sharks and whales.After completing the game is it still worth playing.  Yes because I need to fully upgrade my ship in order to battle the Legendary ship which is a beast.  I get destroyed whenever I try my luck.  So the ultimate challenge would be to send that ship to hell.  Not one but 4 Legendary ships.Graphics 9/10Controls 8/10Sound 10/10Story 7/10Side Missions 7/10Replay Value 7/10Game Play 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2013"}

NCAA seems to have more bugs this year on release date then previously. For reasons explained in interviews with the game's developers available online, EA Sports doesn't have the ability currently to do a large scale beta on the game before its released. Its not until the game is released to 100,000+ users playing the game that these issues are showing up. Interviews with developers said in the choice between waiting to release a perfect game no matter how long it takes and releasing a game on the deadline date with full update support after, they choose the latter. And that is the same formula EA has used for their sports games for several years now, release it at the same time each year and then patching it afterwards.But EA Sports seemed to forget who is buying their game, mostly teenage boys, who have little patience to wait several weeks for a patch, nor care that EA Sports can't do a beta and its the reason they can't ship a more bug free game. Online forums are filled with unhappy customers who have returned the game almost immediately because of various issues. It doesn't help that it takes EA Sports a few weeks to release patches. That is because they don't fix 1 thing at a time, they usually fix/tweek 20 to 30 problems and then do a QA before release. Also, they don't give many details on when or if they are going to release an update, leading to customer frustration.If you have played the previous versions of NCAA, not much has changed in either the game play or features. They have tweaked the lighting and added some of the NCAA Pro Combat uniforms. The result is that while the game isn't the eye candy ofMadden NFL 11, it does look better then previous years.Online Franchise has probably changed the most. No longer does your team have a HQ page. Instead it has been replaced with the Dynasty Wire. The Dynasty Wire has story capsules of each dynasty member's game with a minimum of 4 photos of the game that are automatically uploaded to the online Dynasty web page. You can add up to 10 photos and 5 videos from each of your games to tell the story of that grid iron battle. Afterward you can go to the EA Online Dynasty website portal and add a story to each game's uploaded highlights. An editable headline and description is automatically generated and added added to the uploaded photos from each game. Every game from every season is available at the online website while in the game you can look back at the current season's game highlights and stories. Along with that, you can create a story using photos and videos from any of the previous games, including photos and videos from games from players that no longer are in the franchise. You can also post an update to Twitter or Facebook linking the webpage of your game's story and photos for all to see.Season Showdown is different now in that everyone is in it vs. last year where you had to sign up for it. The result is that people that don't care about the effects of negative sportsmanship points (from going for it on 4th, running up the score, etc) bring down the ranking of schools with fewer people playing who have chosen that team as their favorite.Overall, they have fixed most of the issues of the game since its been shipped. The one issue they are still working on is the lack of enough player progression each year. People complained last year that the way players progressed, over a few seasons, the number of A rated teams swelled unrealistically. This year they went too far the other way trying to fix last year's issue and the way the game was initially shipped, after a couple of seasons, there no longer were any A teams. They have put out a couple of fixes to work on that issue.  There is a new way other then patching to adjust certain aspects of the game called Tuning. While it can't do major fixes like a patch, its cool that they can tweak many aspects of the game faster now via the built in Tuning feature. Several Tuning adjustments have been released in an effort to perfect player progression.ProsGame Play is pretty solid, especially when compared to how Madden 11 was initially shippedThe new Online Franchise up-loadable game story and highlights feature brings realism to the game as well as the ability to look back at every game form every year.The game looks better then in previous years along with more realistic ESPN integration, its more like watching a real gameTeam entrance films show the rituals that some teams have before every gameEA Sports has made more of an effort to get team play books closer to realityOnline ESPN content, and during the season, weekly college games recaps by a couple of the game's producersExtensive website that allows you to do many non-game activities such as edit and create new storiesAlthough it may take a few weeks, EA Sports issues patches to fix the gameConsReleased with enough bugs to make many return the game (most are fixed now)Probably the worse rosters to ever ship with an NCAA game (thankfully, they are editable)EA Sports keeps its customers in the dark about updates on upcoming patches/tuningThe website is not perfect and I do not recommend it to do recruiting because often glitches in the website will end your call earlyNo updates to offline usersThere still are reports of people having problems with connecting to others for franchise games as well as commissioner's not being able to access their dynasty, but seem to mostly be fixed.You have to pay for extras, like the ability be the commissioner of more then 1 online dynasty, for everything, its a whooping $29.99!Overall, its the better playing game between Madden and NCAA this year. The environment of the game is more realistic then last year. Most issues are fixed via the patches and tuning. The bad rosters are fixable, websites like Operation Sports have user names of PS3 users with better rosters. If you enjoyed last year's NCAA and even Madden 10. you most likely will enjoy NCAA 11.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

I am a huge fan of San Andreas, I think it was the most complex game ever made, and I have been dying for a true sequel, (GTA IV is good, but can't compare), well this one I think takes the cake.  So heres some things you can do in the game.You can choose to be a boy or a girl (yay) any race, you customize everything, there face, body, clothes, their walk, the way they talk, taunts, everything.  This game is action packed, you start out locked in a prision and escape spraying gunfire at anyone who gets in your way, thats a great way to start a game I think.You ride around completing mission, just like in GTA, the game also has things called Activites, and theres plenty to do, you can go to a fight club and when money with each fight, you can be a bodyguard, you can get it on with some girls (thought they dont show it) You can sell drugs, you can even ride a four wheel engulfed in flames and just drive around causing destruction, for money! I wish that was a job in real life.You get to own all kinds of property in this game, and you can spend money to pimp it out, you can turn a shack into mansion and have all your gang buddys hang out there.  There is all kinds of car customization, you can customize the car to the style of your gang or whatever you want, you can even put spikes on the sides of the wheels that will flatten other peoples tires.  You can actually buy weed and beer in this game and smoke and drink and get high, awesome!  Also there's planes and helicopters to fly in this game just like in San Andreas but I don't think there's a jet-pack lolIn some ways this game is more complex than Sand Andreas, in some ways not.  But overall this game is great and should have been GTA 4.  It has tons of replay value and it can take you months to finish everything.  If you like sandbox style games with mindless blooshed, check out Saint's Row 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2011"}

I think so.The graphics in the game are amazing once again. Definitely better than the first Gears. There are more scenes in the game where the creators of the game really fleshed out the power of the graphics engine, and you will notice it.The sound in the game is great. Some similar to the first game, but always enjoyable.The controls are very easy to learn, the controls are just about identical to the first game, so you shouldn't have any trouble learning them. There is a new addition in the game called the saw duel, where you have to quickly tap B to overpower another player to cut them before they cut you.The single player is very fun. I enjoyed it more than the first game. The length of GOW2 is similar to the first game, maybe a little longer. Some of the enemies you seen in GOW1, but never got to fight, you will be fighting them in this game. There are some awesome fight scenarios in this game that are fun, but very tough if you are playing on a harder difficulty. The same guns are in this game, but a few are different, and there is even a few new guns (stronger ones :-P).The multi-player is also really fun. There is a new playlist called \"Horde\", where you can four more players can survive wave after wave of Locust, and it can last a whole 50 levels (if you live that long!), its fun but takes a long time and can be tough after a while. The team vs team play lists are similar to the first Gears but fans of 1 will enjoy the multi-player here definitely. The only downfall to the multi-player is once again the matchmaking, sometimes its glitchy, and not as organized as lets say Halo's matchmaking is but its still not bad and playable.Overall, awesome shooter, definitely recommend it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2008"}

The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players.

I skipped this title browsing Amazon for a long time with the assumption it was for Occult fans or a vampire/zombie blaster. It is very far from that..Now that I am a bit more knowledable on it...It is a game world based upon White Wolf's Pen and Paper RPG (Yeah an RPGlike Dungeons and Dragons complete with 20 sided dice and Stridex pads). The world is very developed and what makes this game extremly fun (5 stars) to play is the fact the story in it is very very good. The entire main plot and subquests are extremly well done and engrossing. Additionally, each quest has multiple ways to complete it. You can sneak through it, blast through it, talk your way through it or a combination of all of the above. The more creative you are completing the quests the more expierience you get to improve your character.The opening sequence enters you well into the world of the Underworld of the Vampire and Supernatural. It's no mere Dracula game, but an entire shadow world beneath the mortal world which is very interesting (I might even look for some White Wolf novels if there are any).Here is a brief list, in my opinion, of all the good points and a few bad.Pros- Excellent story- The music is some of the best i've heard in a game, even if you are not into Goth/Alternative. It's very atmospheric and fitting- Lot of replayability based upon you can play a wide variety of Vampire Clans who all specialize in one thing or the other and the game changes in significant ways depending on what you focus in.- Graphics based upon the Half-Life 2 Source Engine. Nuf said.Cons- Only thing that prevented a 5 star rating was the fact there is some minor annoying bugs. Jump around too much and get stuck between boxes, doors get blocked too easy etc...but very minor in the overall gameplay.BottomlineDefinately worth picking up if you liked Knights of the Old Republic type games, although this has more interaction in the fighting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2005"}

Even when you land on the street , the car and driver dont even swerve or notice you. There's zero interaction. The entire city feels dead , almost depressing in a way.

You aren't going to be lugging this around unless you *really* need to.If you enjoy Rock Band games, or the later Guitar Hero games, you'll find a lot to like in the Logitech Wireless Drum Controller. My favorite thing about it is that the pads are so much quieter than the stock kits. You don't hear the stick hitting the pad as much as you do the music in the game, and that's a nice feature. You don't need to whale on these pads for them to register a hit. They'll improve the game and make your family happy when they stop hearing you banging from across the house, too!The box is a little tight, and I would have liked to see them make it a bit easier to re-use, so I can store the drum controller in the box. Apparently, they want you to buy an official case, though, so they make the box functional only as a means to get the drum controller from the store to your home. Once you unpack the product, it's pretty much not going back in the box easily.That's a minor quibble, though. Really, if you're a fan of these games, you owe it to yourself to go for something better than the stock kit. Logitech did it right.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}

The game does support better graphics during the game and you get great visual cut scenes that you can replay after finishing the level but the controls and the way it feels is so reminiscent of REUC that it feels a  little like deja vu to much to say it's really different from the previous game as some advertiser have said.  The game allows you to customize your weapons but instead of gaining star points to do it you have to find gold and when you have enough than upgrade which will take a while to do for some weapons, also there is no camera control at all in this game so you can't use the nunchuck to scope around the level looking for hidden cache of items like REUC allowed but unlike REUC you can save up on health plants to use latter on in a crunch instead of using it automatically like the REUC game did.  You also can see how you did with your score over the  Nintendo's WI-FI against other players on the net and see your standing which is kind of neat.  The game like REUC has three game stories the first has you  play either Leon Kennedy or Jack Krauser in South America looking for a dictator who might have acquired a known virus weapon, the second has you playing wither Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield  as you try to escape Raccoon City after it's been overrun by zombies(RE 2), and the third will have you play either Claire Redfield or Steve Burnside trying to escape from the infested again(RE Code Veronica X).  So at the end for all Resident Evil fans here's a great release to get for your gaming collection today and for fans who might be interested I'd advise trying the demo at a friends or game store first to see if the game is for you you might just get a kick out of the game enough to buy it too...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2009"}

In order to find out, Professor Layton and Luke will embark on an odyssey filled with challenging puzzles which may lead them to an object known as the Elysian Box, rumored to kill all who open it.","reviewerName":"Rorke Haining","summary":"a slice of heaven","reviewText":"As with the first Professor Layton title, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is sheer perfection, a must-play title.  Play for a few minutes and you'll likely get sucked in and want to finish the whole game. It's also a great game to show off the power and sophistication of the DS platform to your friends.This game is a fusion of two very different forms of entertainment:  a collection of puzzles woven together into an intriguing mystery story.  Not every video game fusion attempt succeeds; this one is flawless.  The story is engaging and nicely complements the available puzzles (even though most of the puzzles are irrelevant to the storyline).  Graphics and audio -- both music and voice acting -- are superb.  I enjoy the audio on Professor Layton titles more than any other DS games, particularly the mysterious, atmospheric, and vaguely European soundtrack.The game has an astonishing degree of polish and finishing touches.  Once you've encountered a puzzle in the main game, you can also access it via a master puzzle index.  Here, you can tag your favorites for easier recall later.  Better still, you don't have to worry about missing hidden puzzles, as they are made available to you later if you miss them during the story mode.  Another example of polish is the fact that the game gives you 1 screen's worth of \"scratch paper\" for each puzzle; that's a bit cramped, but it sure beats switching back and forth between the DS and a pad of paper.  Also of note are the many interesting side games and unlockables, which keep the game fresh and compelling.This game easily earns a full five-star rating, but alas, nothing is perfect.  I called this game a \"slice of heaven\" to draw attention to its primary drawback:  it's short.  Hard-core puzzlers such as myself can solve this game and all side content in a weekend.  The game designers attempted to address this limitation by providing the ability to download extra puzzles from the internet, but the reality is that you'll move on to another game rather than be fully entertained by the slow pace of new puzzles online.  On a related note, if you're looking for original, brain-busting puzzles, look elsewhere; a handful of puzzles in this collection are difficult classics, but most are original puzzles which are very approachable to young adults and casual puzzlers.  Furthermore, many of the most complex puzzles are reduced down to multiple choice answers, probably to make it easier to check the player's input.Still, I strongly recommend this product to all players, with one caveat.  If you haven't yet played the 1st game in the series (Professor Layton and the Curious Village), I recommend playing them in sequence.  This game, the 2nd in the series, spoils some of the secrets of the 1st game.  There's one big, unavoidable spoiler at the beginning of game 2 in particular.  While the 2nd game has some minor technical improvements over the 1st, there's no compelling reason to play them out of order.  If you like any game in the series, you're going to like them all, so you might as well get the older title first to avoid spoilers.  For that matter, the older title might be cheaper, so you could save a few bucks to give the series a try.  But fair warning:  if you try any game in the series, you'll be hooked!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-14-2009"}

I saw it in the store, checked out the back and I ended up purchasing the game later on. I figured it was going to be one of the old school collection games that has mostly garbage with a few good games strung in there. I couldn't be more wrong... this is mostly amazing games with a few not-so-great hits strung in there.Once I got this game home I decided to pop this game into the PS2 and see what was on the disk. I was amazed to see so many games - but not only that... I was amazed to see so many GOOD games. These are the games I used to play as a kid. I recognized quite a few of them.My favorite games on the disk are Altered Beast, Alex Kidd, Decap Attack, Golden Axe Series (I, II and III), Phantasy Star II, III and IV. Sonic The Hedgehog 1 and 2, Shinobi III, Vectorman 1 and 2. That's a total of 14 games that I absolutely loved as a kid and still love to this day. The other games in this collection are good too, such as the Ecco series, Comix and a few others... most of the other ones are games I haven't played before (except Super Thunder Blade... but that game is a bit iffy in my opinion). Another reviewer here provides a good breakdown of all of the games in this collection.The biggest suprise was the Phantasy Star series. You get II, III and IV!! Phantasy Star IV is considered by many to be one of the greatest RPGs of all time. Just this series is worth the measley $20.00 price tag. There are hundreds of hours of nostalgic gameplay in this collection. All games are emulated very well and look fantastic.If you are looking for a great collection of old-school games then look no further. It's hard to beat this package. With so many great games in here you are sure to be playing with this collection for hundreds of hours. If you aren't familiar with any of these games then I still urge you to pick this up. A lot of games in this series have stood the test of time and are still very fun - even by todays standards.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2006"}

My favorite was GT 3. The menus in GT 5 are just flat out ridiculous to navigate, and it's like one big jumbled mess. The graphics are nice and I can't complain there. The download times took me about 2 hours to complete. Yes, it's a long time, but it wasn't a big deal to me. It also seems like there were more races/courses in the previous GT games than this one. It just feels like there is alot missing with GT 5 and nothing ever makes you say \"wow\". Everything you do seems to take longer than it should or that it was easier in the past GT games. Plus, I have 20/15 vision and a 50\" plasma TV, and the font is really small and hard to read.There are A spec races and B spec races. The A spec races YOU are actually the one racing the car, while the B spec races, you are actually the CREW CHIEF and are instructing your driver how to race. YOU DON'T RACE B SPEC RACES!!! In the B spec races (which is half the game) you are literally telling your driver to increase their pace, decrease their pace, maintain their pace, pit, pass the car in front, or nothing at all. That's it!!! For half the game you are literally watching your driver race.With the cars included in the DLC, you can choose the Red Bull Prototype (which is the best car in the game at 1600+HP), start a B spec race, and then.....go do laundry, vacuum, do the dishes, dust, clean your car, eat something, take the dog out, run to the store, do whatever you want to do, and then come back 20/30/40 minutes later to watch your driver finish the race and come in first. Then repeat for the next race. That is honestly how I completed the B spec races. I actually didn't mind the B spec races, because after completing these races, you do win money and cars that you can use for the A spec races (which are the races that you actually drive the cars and not your driver). Plus, I got work done around the house which pleased my wife. So I was killing two birds with one stone! LOL!Something else I didn't care for, was that in previous GT games, you could sell the cars you win. In GT 5, I would guess maybe 75%-80% of the cars I won I could not sell? It says it will remove it from my garage, but I cannot sell it. I don't know if removing from my garage permanently removes it from my game, but I'd rather keep it than find out I lost it. Plus, because of all of the DLC cars in my garage, I have completed probably 60%-70% of this game, and only purchased about 10 cars. I have about 90-100 cars in my garage, and I do have about 7 million dollars burning a hole in my GT wallet, but there really hasn't been a need to buy better cars. You either get the best cars with the DLC, or wind up winning them.Overall, for $20, I have certainly been entertained for hours upon hours, and it is worth it. I think this game could have and should have been soo much better based on the previous GT games. But, if you have enjoyed the past GT games, I would have to recommend this one - especially at this price. It's not a bad game, and there are hours of gameplay, but it could've been better. I'm not disappointed with GT 5 XL, and I will buy GT 6. But for $20, why not!?!?!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}

In aerial-combat action gamePanzer Dragoon Orta, you are that hero, and you'll employ multiple weapons and dragon powers against a variety of enemies. The game features unlockable subquests, that allow you to play the game from the enemy's perspective, and a branching story line with unique encounters.","reviewerName":"Seppo Helava","summary":"Panzer finally comes to the masses","reviewText":"While Sega's Panzer Dragoon franchise is beloved among gamers who have played the earlier games in the series, it's always been confined to the relatively small audience that actually puchased a Sega Saturn. Finally, the rest of the world can see what those who've experienced the series have been raving about, with Panzer Dragoon Orta, the series' first installment on a non-Sega console. While Panzer Dragoon Saga brought the series into the RPG genre, PDO returns to the shooter-on-rails genre where the series began.While that might initially scare off some gamers, don't be fooled - though PDO's confined to \"rails\", the degree of freedom the gamer feels, and the sheer sense of scale and majesty that a fixed camera offers the developers makes PDO one of the grandest, most impressive xbox games available to date. Easily more beautiful than any other game on any system available, PDO's graphics live up to the hype. Huge, detailed worlds are filled with huge, detailed enemies, and the sheer size of some of the things in this game, from an airship easily ten thousand times the size of Orta (the girl you control), to a squadron of \"Dragonmares\", similar to Orta's steed, but pure evil, the environments in PDO have to be experienced to be believed.In terms of gameplay, it's substantially more complex than either the previous installments of the series, and even more complex than the sum of the individual parts. Orta can shoot her gun, or lock her dragon onto a number of enemies, and her dragon can speed up, slow down, or change between three forms. The base wing, heavy wing, and glide wing. The base wing is the all-around form, the heavy wing has fewer lock ons, but does twice as much damage, and the glide wing can move faster, and rapid-fire in such a way that you can shoot missiles out of the sky with relative ease.Each form also has a unique berserker attack, and each is useful in different situations. What these controls allow is for a tremendous amount of stratey and depth on top of the standard shooting game format - you'll find yourself changing forms often, and using the strengths of the various forms to your full advantage. You'll need to, because in anything other than easy mode, the game is *hard*.On top of the standard game, there's a whole gallery of things to unlock, from almost as many sidequests as there are main missions, to volumes of information on the Panzer Dragoon world, and the events that took place in the past games. There's even a complete version of Panzer Dragoon, for those that never played the original (shame that Zwei and Saga were not included, but I suppose the Saturn conversion is tricky (the original was ported to the PC some time ago, and thus, was relatively trivial to convert to the xbox).Overall there's simply no reason not to buy this game. Classic gameplay, tons of extras, combined with the best graphics in any game to date make for an entirely worthwhile purchase. I can only hope that this game reaches a huge audience, and drives Sega to make a Panzer Dragoon Saga II.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2003"}

Even the menus are easy to read and navigate.On the other hand, half of the females wear clothes intended to show off their skin - even when it's snowing out. Can't there be an RPG with women in NORMAL clothing?Like all RPGs you spend time creating new items, building up characters and battling to gain experience. The combat is real time which is great for people with good reflexes but can be tough on those who would rather strategize and think through what they are doing.The music ranges from great to iffy. Sometimes it gives a moody feeling - and sometimes it is completely inappropriate.If you're an RPGer looking for more of a futuristic environment, give this one a try!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2004"}

Everything this game does san andreas did better except for the graphics, and I was kinda dissapointed. I bought this game and then later bought MGS4 and then I stopped thinking GTA4 was a great game just ok.

You can literally play for hours and not even scratch the surface of what the game has to offer. I spent 30min just in a bar playing pool last night. And then I took my date home and she invited me inside. How much greater can this game be?There are imperfections. I've experienced some slow down, walking through people, pop-up shadows and stuff. The controls take a lot of getting used to as there is so much you can do. It seems a little complicated at first but the more you play, the less of an issue it is.The graphics are often times mind blowing. They look the best when you're viewing the city at a distance. The level of detail is incredible. Graphics for characters have been better in other games but given the amount of information that is crammed onto this one disc, a few less polygons on the characters in GTA is forgivable.That being said, I still have so much more to experience in this game.

They're there, they're cool, and the two games aren't worlds apart.  The character wheel for talking to companions speeds things up in a nice, clean way and the ammo building/camp fire options add a fun level and some variety to scavenging.  Oh, and you can aim down the iron sights now... awesome.  Sure, why not?  Every game has to look like Call of Duty, right?  At least a little bit, otherwise no one will buy it?  Never mind that a third of the weapons in the game don't actually have iron sights.  so I'm looking down the barrel of my fancy pants, melt-your-face 9000 energy thing only to be obstructed by lots of sci-fi nonsense where the iron sights would be on my AK-whatever.  Hooray.  But you can turn it on and off, so it doesn't really matter.Oh, and if you haven't played Fallout 3, go take care of that, you're missing out.There isn't much to be said about the bugs and the glitches (and there are plenty) because they're pretty similar to those in Fallout 3, or just about any open-world game this generation.  They're there, they're annoying for five seconds, they can be ignored.No, what sets Fallout New Vegas apart from and considerably below Fallout 3 is the level of immersion.  In that, you know, it's much less.  And I know there are a few features designed to improve immersion (the awesome 'hardcore' mode comes to mind) and that's all well and good, but here's the thing; who the hell is this 'courier' I'm supposed to be playing as?  And furthermore, why do I care about him/her?  I knew who the lone-wanderer was in Fallout 3, it was ME.  The game starts with your characters birth:  the BIRTH for crying out loud!  there's blood, there's light and then you see your father-and he looks similar to how you've chosen your character to look!  And he's voiced by Liam Neeson!  !!! You shape the lone wanderer from infancy through adolescents and then into adulthood, you choose everything and anything possible.  How do you top that?Well, you don't, actually.  In New Vegas, we start with a cut scene:  a cut scene?  Why not an in-game moment?  Why not an expository scene where you play as the courier, learn some stuff about him/her and then get to be part of it when the bad guys shoot you in the head?  Why should all that be separated from me, why do I have to watch it in a brief movie?  It sounds like a small thing and maybe it is, but it was amazing how much harder it was to get invested in the story and forgive the glitches (save often!) without that longer intro.Maybe it's not fair to judge this game against it's predecessor, but it's impossible for me not to notice that, in one crucial and very specific way, the developers fell short of a bar they set themselves.  They set it in Oblivion (you craft that person's entire history, for crying out loud), they easily met it in Fallout 3 (BIRTH!! LIAM NEESON LOOKS LIKE ME!!!) and then just let is slide in New Vegas (oh, you got shot, you'll be fine, happy trails!).  It's weak story telling and makes New Vegas feel more like an expansion when it really is a stand alone title.And it is a stand alone title.  Apart from my gripes, everything that worked about the previous Fallout works here, some things work better.  The Mojave (and it's inhabitants) is a triumph, without question.  Sound design, music, all seamless (even voice acting has been bumped up a notch). The Quests are clever, the factions are specific and well drawn out.  It's a phenomenal game and among the top tier of titles today.Still, I don't imagine I'll be playing through it more than once...  Maybe twice.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

Miles \"dkmiles1\"","summary":"Classic Rockstar and A Nice Tribute to The Movie","reviewText":"I remember when The Warriors video game was announced, I was literally counting the days to its release.  I grew up in the 80's and \"The Warriors\" was one of those movies that would appear on \"The Movie Channel\" on a fairly regular basis.  To this day, I can still recite some of the movie's more famous lines.  The movie was pure escapism, especially for young suburban teens.What makes the game so great is the first half of it takes place BEFORE Sirus's infamous speech that lead to his demise.  You learn (I presume made up by the minds of Rockstar) how some of the more famous characters became Warriors in the first place.  This portion of the game plays like a cross between \"Manhunt\" and \"Grand Theft Auto\" - i.e. mission based, free flowing environments.  Though, the graphics in The Warriors are not up to snuff, the game play is anything but second rate.  The missions themselves are very entertaining as well.The second half of the game is a replay of the movie from start to finish - it's a nice tribute, and you know how its going to turn out - with the notable exception of the finale - it doesn't end nearly as ceremoniously as the movie, but it's fun just the same.Solid gameplay, average graphics - Rockstar digs deep to strike a creative vein from start to finish.Very worthwhile effort.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2006"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways. First, players will have access to theChinatown Warsas well as the greaterGrand Theft Autocommunities through the Rockstar Games Social Club. Here they can chat, trade commodities, purchase special in-game items with in-game currency, check the leaderboards and compete in online tournaments. The DS' Wi-Fi capabilities also gives players the opportunity to take their game online as they battle for supremacy in their own little corner of Liberty City in both head-to-head and co-op multiplayer battles.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"A surprisingly complete GTA game on the DS","reviewText":"Despite the positive reviews, I was skeptical that the Nintendo DS could handle a free-roaming game like Grand Theft Auto while still having a solid story. Sure, there were older GTA games for previous Nintendo consoles, but they were all pale imitations of the franchise's rebirth in Grand Theft Auto 3. Much to my surprise, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is not only a solid entry in the series, but is arguably one of the best GTA games to date.Using a new graphical style, GTA presents the story of Huang, a rich kid whose Triad boss father just died and who finds himself fighting his way through Liberty City's underworld as the Triads get ready to appoint a new leader. The game is as in-depth as any other entry in the series, with dozens of side missions, an engrossing plot, and all the variety in weapons and vehicles we've all come to expect out of the series. It also features some improvements, including a GPS to help you navigate through Liberty City and an option to let you replay missions after you're done with them (not to mention the \"Trip Skip\" feature, which lets you cut through the \"drive to X\" parts of said missions). The game is a real Grand Theft Auto game, as good as any that have appeared on the Playstation or X-Box.I only have two minor complaints about the game. First, although the touch screen features of the DS are utilized very well, the interface takes a bit of getting used to. Driving takes some practice, unless you don't mind ramming into buildings at random, and projectile weapons such as grenades are harder to use in combat because they require you to focus on the touch screen while your character on the upper screen might be getting shot at.The second complaint involves a spoiler about the ending, so if you want to avoid it, stop reading this review now.SPOILER SPACEMy other complaint - and this is quite nitpicky, mind you - is that it lacks one of the major plot elements that made entries into the series like Vice City so fun. In many of the other GTA games, you get to go from being a low-level criminal to a major crime boss. This game concludes right at the point where you can become a crime boss. While you do help Huang become a Triad leader, you don't get to really enjoy your time as a mover and shaker in the criminal underworld. Granted, there are some extra missions after the end credits, but they all retain the same type of feel as the missions from the rest of the game. This is in keeping with the spirit of Chinatown Wars, which is a more gritty entry into the GTA series, but I found myself really hoping that the game would have some more story after Huang becomes the Triad leader, allowing you to enjoy your criminal empire a bit. Ah well...maybe in a sequel.END SPOILERSAll of my complaints about this game are quite minor in the end. This is a huge game with many hours of fun to it. Most importantly, it is a worthy entry to the Grand Theft Auto series. One can only hope that we will see some more GTA games on the DS or 3DS in the future, because this is an excellent first outing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2010"}

Same ole same ole.","reviewText":"After reading my title and saying ahaha what? That pretty much says everything about this game. This is the reason people pirate and download games from the black market/torrents from other countries. I believe it should be mandatory to have a  pre demo/beta released for every game put out. It's not that big of a deal if companies would do it, then just pull it down about a week after the games release. Much like you can stream albums before you buy. It would save people money and a whole lot of headache. This game is nothing new under the sun. I'm not going into explicit details because there are 211 other reviewers who do that. I played the PC version, was planning on getting this version as well. That killed it. The graphics maxed out didn't even look anything close to \"next gen\", the only great thing about it are the psychics. And Battlefield 4 beats this game like a redheaded stepchild when it comes to that. Even though they are both pretty bad. You aim down enemies only to miss even when shooting them 2,3,4,5, even 6 times. You're thinking, I can't be this bad of a shot!!The missions are mundane, the campaign is lazy and just like every other campaign they have made in the past 6 years or more. I actually likeds MW3 a whole lot better and it wasn't that good. The only thing I liked was having the German Shephard who would go after bad guys and take them down, well, sometimes. Other times he would just run (standing still) up against a wall!! Can we say horrible glitch. At one point the animal got stuck (in the air, mind you), and they kept calling for him and nothing happened. I just kept going then he magically came back. Also it moved like an animals from the PS2 era. I would say the graphics, aren't that much of a step ahead of that either. Just on  steroids. So this is just another bad edition to the series. And i'm DONE, i mean DONE with this war FPS genre. I'm looking forward to playing Deadfall Adventures, if you don't know, is like a first person Indiana Jones with demons and monsters. Also a lot of tomb raiding. It seems like it won't be great, but it's different and anything is better than this. Stupid AI once again, bland maps, and just a feeling of deja vu, that we've been down this road of war before.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"stephen Garry","summary":"Mario","reviewText":"The fact that this game is a Mario title should be enough to make you buy it, but this game really is good.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

While we've seen greats like Sonic The Hedgehog have great titles over the years for the PS2, and the Wii, it is definitely easy to get complacid about the beginnings of what made Sega so dominant in the first place. Back in the 90's, Sega really delivered some of the greatest video games imagined that have withstood the test of time for its well-received Genesis system. There were so many great games that really influenced the way we play video games today. But as time went by, Sega made systems like the Saturn, Sega CD and Dreamcast that have made Sega lose tons of interest to others like Sony with the Playstation 2. Now, Sega and their biggest glory days are finally available in a new best of series that is just built for hedgehog speed.Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Xbox 360, is a great buy for nostalgic gamers that definitely want to relive the classic days Sega is still widely recognized for after all these years. The game features over 40 cllassic Genesis titles that still are constant in our gaming universe. The games are remastered well, and redesigned to specifically recognize HD gameplay. The compilation features all your favorite classics from Ecco The Dolphin, all your favorite Sonic The Hedgehog gems like Sonic 3, Sonic & Knuckles, and Golden Axe. The graphics look just like they've done years earlier, and the control is very easy to pick up with the gameplay. While there are all of Sega's best from the Genesis days, I was a bit upset that there were some titles that could've been highlighted here like Virtua Racing and other games popular from the franchise like Ren & Stimpy: Stimpy's Invention.All in all, when it comes down to right, the price definitely delivers with Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Xbox 360. You get so many classic games at a great price, over trying to download classics that would eat your budget away.

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

It is nothing like the aforementioned masterpiece. The story was slow to get going, which I was sympathetic to, since it was like that in FF VII too, but after hours it was still lame. For one thing, you have a \"military ranking\", and it goes down when you explore the towns! I mean come on, the whole point of an RPG is exploring! But that is not the worst part. The magic system has been redone, and it's HORRIBLE. Instead of the product-of-genius Materia system in FF VII, they have the \"draw system\". You have to collect magic spells, and use them, like petty items! This is, by far, the worst idea ever.And then there were the characters. After falling under the spell of Cloud, Aeris, Sephiroth and all the rest, I felt like hiding under my blankets and sobbing after meeting Squall, Rinoa and the other lame characters. Their dialogue is lifeless and cheesy, and I didn't feel attached to them at all.Although it's a small complaint, I must mention the graphics. The cutscenes are amazing and far better than FF VII's, but everything else is awful. The blocky, toon-like models of FF VII have been tossed out, replaced by characters that try to shove in the detail of real humans in tiny little models. The result? Stiffly animated, bland graphics.Overall, do not buy this game. Buy Tales of Symphonia, Chrono Cross...anything. Please, do not waste your money. These are the parting words of a weeping gamer.

Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy.

It's quick to hop in to, doesn't have a whole lot of plot for you to forget (this was kind of a downpoint, but having played the game on and off over about 3 months it's become a good thing), and you can make accomplishments with about 10-15 minutes of gameplay (or even save during game in a pinch).  It's perfect for travelling.The gameplay is fun and addictive.  It's been a while since I played the Playstation original, but the classes seem better and more balanced, and more meaningful when you combine abilities.  It's a great way to kill a half hour here and a half hour there.Now the things that drag it down.The Law system is by far it's most annoying feature.  It's basically  a list of things you can't do in a particular battle.  There are two results to breaking said law: 1) for a minor transgression, you get a yellow card.  after the battle, it will do somethingbad to your character like lower stats, etc.  2) more severe violations of the law (usually KOing someone with the illegal move) will take you out of the battle and put you straight into prison.  The problem is that the yellow card doesn't effect your opponents, because what happens after the battle is irrelevant to them, and usually 2-3 enemies every battle have an ability that converts any severe violations into a yellow card, so they never get removed from battle.  In effect, the Law system is a restriction on you and no one else.  Also, if your main character ever gets a severe violation, it's game over for you.The further into the game you get, the more annoying it gets to be because they become more general and more numerous.  You'll end up in battles where Swords, Fight (the basic attack command), and color magic (white, black, red, etc) are all forbidden.  Great, so you've got about 1 character that can do anything worthwhile, meanwhile the other team is all suited up perfectly to not have to deal with those laws.  Sometimes in a long drawnout battle you'll forget what the laws are and accidentally break one.  It sucks to get gameover just because after a 45 minute battle (because 90% of your moves are handicapped it gets hard to win quickly) you accidentally break some obscure law like attacking the same opponent twice in a row.Which brings me to my next complaint.  Not all of the laws are clearly spelled out.  You'll remember what they are after the first time you break them, but knowing ahead of time is often not possible.  For instance: \"knightswords\" will be banned.  None of the offending weapons are labeled as such, so you don't get to know if you're going to break the law until you actually do.  Similarly: \"ganging up\" has something to do with multiple allies attacking the same enemy; hard not to do when it's the last enemy on the board.The Judge who enforces these laws (one in every battle) also is sort of annoying himself.  He stands in the battlefield and takes a turn (and a space) like everyone else.  He takes his turn extremely slow though...just sitting there for 20-30 seconds at a time most often, and then moving somewhere or rearranging KOed bodies for some reason.  It breaks the momentum of the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2006"}

Since these titles were such staples of the NES, it was only logical to port them to SNES with a graphical overhaul, options to save, and (for America anyway) the release of a long lost game called LOST LEVELS.  Also, depending on what version of this you get, in later releases they also packaged SUPER MARIO WORLD as well, making this a one stop shop for those looking for a Mario fix.  These are the games.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS: The single most popular game ever released, and also the most widely circulated.  Largerly responsible for saving the video game industry after the historic crash of 1984, it is now easy to forget (especially for younger gamers) how revolutionary this title was when it first came out.  8 expansive worlds, bright colourful graphics, and much more complex than the usual one-screen games that dominated in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  A real technological breakthrough and a historic landmark in gaming, even all these years later it holds up with pixel-perfect graphics and rock-solid game play.  Don't miss this one.THE LOST LEVELS: The original followup to SMB; released only in Japan.  Deemed to hard for the American markets, another game was given Mario sprites and released in America as SMB2.  This title, however, is notoriously difficult.  I always think of it as the second quest, like in the original Zelda.  If you go through all 8 levels without warping, you get to a secret world, 9, before going on to worlds A-D.  When ALLSTARS first came out, Nintendo Power had a promotion that if you got to world 9 they would send you a Mario badge.  Ah, the memories!  Still, if you really want to test your metal against incredibly difficult old-school Mario levels, this game isn't to be missed.  Lots of fun all around.  Some levels, however, make you think Shigeru Miyamoto has a sadistic streak in him.  Closet America ever got to the original 8-bit release was Super Mario Deluxe for the Game Boy Colour, though that was lacking the last five bonus levels and did not have all the same graphics as the original SMB2 did.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2: Also known as SUPER MARIO BROTHERS USA in Japan (released in 1992 there and 1988 stateside), this is the odd man out in the series.  The game play couldn't be more different than the original SMB if they tried.  The story is Nintendo didn't think they'd be able to sell SMB2 to the American markets, so they took a pre-existing game, DOKI DOKI PANIC, changed a few sprites around, and put the Nintendo seal of approval on it.  (For those of you who have access to the original game booklet that was released with SMB2, the picture of Phanto, the guardian of the keys, is the original sprite from DOKI DOKI, and looks different than what appeared in the Mario version.  When I was little I always wondered why the sprite looked different from the game).  DOKI DOKI's story is a family's pet monkey disppeared into a book and had to be rescued.  To see the ending, you had to complete the game four times, once with each major character.  The Internet has a wealth of info on the differences between the Mario version and the original version.  What I always remember about this game is how fast it sold when it came out in 1988.  As far as game play goes, there are four selectable characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Mario, naturally, is the most well-rounded, though my brother and I always used Luigi for his jumping skills.  The levels are very odd, contributing to the overall dream-like, bizarre quality that is so inhertant in this game.  A huge smash when it was released, but easily the strangest Mario game in the canon.  Little surprise when you find out it's rather dubious origins (I was in shock when I found out about in the late 1990s).  Ironically enough, Miyamoto purportedly had much more to deal with the development of this game than the Japanese SMB2.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently*, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear.  The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds.  This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD.  While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed.  Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremdously faithful to the original NES release.  That alone makes this essential playing.SUPER MARIO WORLD: The later versions of this compilation included SUPER MARIO WORLD as well.  Taking the foundation laid down in SMB3, Nintendo created this flagship title for their pristine new 16 bit console.  Very much of a piece wtih SMB3, although eliminating all the cool suits of its predecessor, Nintendo turned in a stellar, expertly designed platformer that once again set the standards for video games everywhere.  Just like SMB3, and the other titles less so, the game eases you into its mechanics with such ease and percision that, just like the Amazon editorial says, you'll be flying and tossing fireballs and riding around in no time.  Essential gaming.  Plus you get to ride the dinosaur Yoshi and make him eat enemies!  How cool is that?Overall, one of the best carts you can have for the SNES.  The only real drawback is the original versions of the NES games weren't included.  What would have been great is after you finished each game you unlocked the original 8-bit version.  But that (minor) complaint aside, if you want to know what made early gaming so great, or want to relive a bit of nostalgia from your childhood, you can't go wrong with this title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"Frustrating and unworthy","reviewText":"It unfortunately seems that this is the end for our friend Max Payne. Remedy knew that it was primarily an action game; you are Chuck Norris or Bruce Willis fighting hordes of bad guys. It gets tricky, but never downright crazy. This game does. I picked Medium, figuring that'd be challenging enough but still fun. Not the case. There are so many incredibly frustrating details that squander it. When you shootdodge, you tumble into walls, railings, the smallest obstacles, negating the whole purpose of the mechanic. The levels are designed to be either too small and cramped or too wide to make any good use of it. You are constantly surrounded. Always. And the bad guys didn't go to Stormtrooper Academy for weapons training, they will hit you time and time again. Painkillers are sparse, ammo is even sparser. You will run out of ammo over and over. There's a new \"Last man standing\" mechanic that makes you drop in slow-mo as you're very low on health, giving you the opportunity to take care of your enemy before he does you in, but when you have no ammo all you can do is sit and watch as you very slowly fall and die. The story is not a noir-thriller, it's more of a direct-to-DVD flick about Max babysitting some spoiled rich kids in Brazil. That means that roughly 70% of the dialogue is in Portugese, subtitles as well. It's also packed with flimmering video effects, which I have no idea what point they serve other than giving you a headache.There are a few good things about the game though, but overall they are not enough to save the experience. James McCaffrey returns to voice Max (luckily), and he's still a gruff, cynical, tough, mean spirited man. That much is true to heart. The environments, technically, are fairly well made and there are certainly a lot of different vistas for you to see, not just hallway after hallway. And finally, the graphics are quite decent. The characters lack the human touch, but they've got grit and texture to them, and the action part is very well choreographed and the motions are smooth and fluid. The enemies always feel like they're actually running and dodging, and when they come running or fall over, it's always in a convincing and glitch-free way. On the whole, that means that this game is probably more fun to look at than to actually play. Pick up the first two instead, not only was the action sharper, but the plots were actually well told and very well written.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-20-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

All in all i would rate this game right up there with the much loved Halo. The graphics arnt as good but the story and gameplay is and as a sci-fi fan i find this game very hard to put down.

You can check my other reviews to see what I thought of that one. I was hoping that three sequels later they would have fixed the glaring flaws in what would otherwise exemplify some of the prettiest graphics for the PS2 console. They fixed only one of the problems from the first game.First of all, my biggest complaint has got to be the play control, or the lack of it. Sure they fixed the \"Tank Controls\" so at least you don't have to rotate your character before making them walk forward. But it's still just a boring button masher. What fun is a game when you can practically close your eyes and just tap the X button repeatedly and win a great deal of the battles?During the battles where a little more finesse and variation is required, I found the controls to be sticky and delayed to an annoying degree.  Also considering that this is a game where the hero has a few different swords he can play with, I was really annoyed that there was not quick way to switch back and forth. You have to press start and go through a menu system to select a different sword. What a stupid way to interface weapon selection in a combat game! If it had been an RPG, menus wouldn't matter as much, but in a hack n' slash? Come on guys try a little! I also have a personal beef that they choose not to add platforming. Seriously now, this is a game where we see the hero or other ancillary characters display superhuman feats of speed, strength and agility, and you mean to tell me they can't hop a three-foot break between two rooftops or hop up just one friggin' foot to reach a step-ladder that had the bottom blown off? It's just lazy game design!So let's get to the story. It's based loosely on Japanese lore and myth about warring factions in feudal Japan, but enhanced with mysticism and armies of demons and zombies. It's also a highly convoluted story. It's also full of cheesy dialogue and campy voice-overs that you'd expect from most average anime features. I suppose that for many people, that might be reason enough to get the game, but it's not a preference for me. Take that for what it's worth, you very well might like it. There's also the token Onimusha trend of having people's diaries and random books of myth scattered about in the game to add detail to the world's setting and atmosphere. To me this is a cop-out to avoid cinematic storytelling. Then again, some of the journals really add nothing and only serve to further water down the game. I felt like I'd wasted time just picking them up and reading them.I'll be 100% honest with you and openly state that I did not play this game from start to finish. I played it for about 4 hours and then took the disc out to return to my brother whom I borrowed it from. Other than pretty graphics, this game offers me nothing worth investing hours of my time into. I rarely get flat out bored playing a game and this game managed to do it.Considering that my brother loves this game and he's an adult as well, I suppose that means that there are people out there that this game was made for. People who are probably not die-hard gamers and who like really simple gameplay, impressive graphics, and cheesy anime storylines. Well here's your game folks!

I love this freaking thing.  I had a ds lite and I basically played one game:  Mario kart.  That was it for the most part.  Even on that tiny screen, the graphics were pixelated.  Then I got a psp and the ds lite sat in a drawer for a year until I gave it to a friend's kid.  I felt that the original DS was a joke in all it's iterations.  This system is a HUGE improvement in every, way, shape, and form.SYSTEM:  It's portable, the hardware is a lot more solid than ds lite.  Sound is acutally pretty good but will pop if I accidentally slide the volume up to high.  3d toggle is a bit flimsy, the spotpass, streetpass, AR games, etc. are all nice icing on the cake but, nothing that really gets me excited.  The thumbstick is pretty awesome.3D: Let me start off by saying that I love the 3d technology and got hooked on it because of my EVO3d.  But, I hated trying to play games with onscreen gamepad.  I think that the 3d is better on the 3ds for games but, that just could be because of higher production value games being on the 3ds.  I have let's golf 2 for the phone and Let's golf 3d for 3ds.  The 3d is about equal for those games.  It's a really hard thing to decide which is 'better' as I have nothing to really judge.  I know that the EVO3d has much larger screen, much higher resolution, much better camera, and a MUCH higher overall price tag. The camera on the 3ds is very sick joke.  It's really bad in my eyes.  Great toy for kids I suppose.  The free 3d videos are nice too.  I don't think there is a way to save them though.VALUE: I bought the 3DS AFTER the price drop.  I feel that it's worth the current price tag.  I could care less about the non-3d games that don't take up the whole screen (The whole screen is small enough as it is) and I felt that $250 was way too much.  The fact that there are a few 3d games in the eshop for reasonable prices and more to come was ultimately what made me decide to buy the system.  $40 is a bit much for handheld titles in my book and $30 is too much for a remake.  Of my 6 games, 5 were $20 or less ( most from here on Amazon) and only one of those was used.  The fact that many people feel this way is good for owners of this system as developers will be forced to give us quality titles or lower the prices of the games.  I'd say overall that the 3ds is a good value.GAMES: Just OK.  There are only two titles that I'd even remotely consider paying the $40 for.  The both have Mario in the title and neither one is out.  Zelda, Ridge Racer, DOA, Lego games, etc.  Just a handful of games that I care for right now.  It will get better.  At least I hope.  For the eshop, what about  GBA or SNES titles at least?  I didn't buy a system with nice capabilities and 3d to play monoochrome screen games.Overall, I love it and have just a few complaints.  If the mario kart game lives up to the last one, It's almost worth it just for that game alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

It was $15 cheaper than buying it through Microsoft or any other store. I was sent a 100% new code card in the mail, code worked fine.About Xbox live:I have been a member of Xbox live for over 10 years now and love it. Xbox live is one of the best ways to interact with people. I have met some of my best friends on Xbox Live. There are some annoying jerks that talk trash from time to time, but you can't keep people from speaking their minds. For what you get, it is very much affordable. I found it funny when people gave Xbox live a bad rating because it caused them to to drop loads of money into it for their kids... That isn't really a justifiable excuse to give a 1 star rating. I wouldn't allow younger children to interact or talk as much online for what some people say or how they act. It can be regulated for younger children but in my opinion more for adults. It is well worth the money, especially with all of the applications and features that have been added over the years. You can even buy digital copies of games that often are cheaper than buying them at the store. Again, love Xbox live.Other complaints I would like to address:People complain about the fact that to have Xbox live, they require a credit card. They don't randomly charge your card, part of it is for account recovery, and it makes purchasing anything on Xbox live easier. There has not been problems with credit card theft on the 360's Xbox live.People also complain that you have to pay. That you can play the same games (not true - halo, gears of war, etc) for free on pc or ps3. The thing is, you are paying for security, better servers that don't have as much lag, and a tremendous amount of features that the others systems don't provide. The ps3 servers for example, were hacked, more than once. The servers are not nearly as efficient either. This is all from experience. No matter what, a PC will almost always be better than a console in any respect, so they shouldn't even be compared. Consoles are a much more affordable way to have good games run well. You can easily drop $1500-$5000 on a gaming pc, I built one myself last summer. If you are unsure if you want to pay for it, don't buy a whole year, buy a one or three month pass, try it out, and see if you like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0038TT8QM","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A step up and a step down","reviewText":"The fifth Civilization has arrived and it brings new features, good and bad.Civ V is greatly simplified from previous releases, which will be nice for genre newcomers but disappointing for fans of the older games. All the core gameplay is still there, but in general it has been streamlined for simpler, faster play. For instance, combat no longer allows unit stacking; battles are now quick wargame-style affairs. World customization is also a little more simplistic.The visuals of the game are totally overhauled and while they look absolutely amazing, owners of older 3D cards will find that while they may meet the specs, artifacting and glitches are the order of the day. The tradeoff is that you now feel like you are looking at a real world- tile improvements and terrain features look organic and realistic, and buildings spill out of cities into sweeping suburbs.Ultimately if there is anything damning to say about Civ V, it is that it fails to deliver on many of its most vaunted new qualities. Distinct leader personalities seem well realized at first, but the AI will always turn on you, and always makes the same value judgments- the only leaders who seem genuinely different are Montezuma, who will declare war on everyone and lose centuries before the other players, and Catherine the Great who is kind of a creepy middle-aged sex kitten. Unique civ qualities are imbalanced- why choose any civ other than Rome with its obscene building bonuses? Unique units are similarly uneven, but since no unique unit will be hanging around in modern times that matters a bit less.Ultimately the game's visual beauty, accessibility, and high replay value make it a good point of entry for the novice 4X player, but the hardcore civ fan will already own civ 4, and has no reason to give it up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2012"}

The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai&#x2014;and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth...   What truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance?

But it's been painfully clear that any Final Fantasy spin-offs based on those games will miss the mark.  Such is the case with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII.  If you're expecting the same engrossing gameplay and engagement you had playing the original Final Fantasy VII, you'll be sorely disappointed.The bad:-Horrible, and I do mean HORRIBLE play control.  You can seriously play through the battles blindfolded.  All you do is simply hit the X button.  The character moves on his own.  Square-Enix should've either given us traditional turn-based battles or fully controllable God of War-style battles, not this weak combination of both.-The actual game is very short, with only 10 chapters.  After two hours of play, I was already in chapter 4, and that's after taking a good chunk of time doing side-missions as well.-Side missions extend the game slightly, but they're also very short and not very engaging.-DMW, which is a slot-machine-type meter that spins throughout the battle.  The player has no control over it, and this is what determines if you or your attributes level up, or if you perform a limit break or use a summon.  Basically, your progress and level is determined entirely at random (A level up happens when the first and last symbol match AND this corresponds to a 777).  No skill is required.So why, you ask, did I give this game 4 stars?The good:Story - Plain and simple, the story is absolutely incredible.  The cutscenes are stunning, especially for the PSP.  The voice acting is the best I've ever heard...period.  The characters are convincing and engrossing.  The atmosphere throughout the game is classic FFVII, and this alone is why you won't be able to put the game down.A review from GameInformer said that it's well worth trudging through some of the worst gameplay ever just to see this story to the end, and I whole-heartedly agree.  I'm hooked on it, and I'll gladly waste hours on side missions in the hope that I'll randomly level up, just so I can be strong enough to beat the final boss and bridge this story with Final Fantasy VII.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2008"}

Though the goblins do scare him a little which I feel kind of bad about. But oh well maybe obvious first bad memory I would kind of suck.

I just wish I could have had video games like this when I was a kid and not 8-bit Nintendo entertainment system.But I do want to say that I think Knack is a lot more enjoyable than many of the reviewers reported when it first came out.

I don't think it would have gotten 8 or 9s but 7s would make a lot of sense.  The story is weak, but appropriate for its age level, and the gameplay is really fun, yet super challenging.I bought this game as a buy 1 get one free deal, and i can think of it as paying 30 dollars for it.  And it was totally worth it.  I have 3 PS4 games on disc and this one was the only one that I enjoyed for basically all of it.  That said i had to play Knack for about an hour at a time or I'd get bored.  But the game is like a little kid version of Dark Souls.  It brutally difficult at times, but when you learn the moves of the enemies it can be so completely rewarding to bash through a group of enemies without being hit once.  And to top it off nothing is as satisfying as once being tiny getting killed by a robot in one hit, then being huge and taking it down in one hit.Pros:* Rewarding combat yet very difficult until you learn the enemy moves.* looks like a pixar movie* Growing giant is so fun for any Dai-Kaiju fans (Big Monster fans) out there.* your health is you power, a fun resource to manage.* Co-op buddy can die as many times as they want and it wont restart the level.* Enemy variety is huge, even when you think it looks the same it's attack patterns are often different.Con:* Final boss is cheap, and annoying as hell.* Story is weak, mostly filled with weird morals that don't make any sense if you think about them in context.* In each level they force you to get small taking the satisfaction of getting bigger away.* Gameplay is incredible repetitive, would have been nice to have it changed around a little.I highly recommend grinding in the Buddy App for the iPhone and Android. It's a bejeweled style game a pretty easy to master.  Its a great way to get a ton of parts for the gadgets and relics. I was able to get almost every gadget by the end of my first play through because of it.  But my ONE big complaint is why isn't this app on the vita?  It would make perfect sense on the Vita.I recommend this game to people that like timing based combat games (Dark Souls), or platformers.  People looking for another sly cooper or racket an clank game, you'll be very disappointed.  The game on normal difficulty is unforgiving and you'll die in one to three hits.And finally I recommend this to any Dai-Kaiju fans (Big Monster fans).  this is the first game I've played that I actually feel like a giant monster smashing building in one punch, throwing a tank at an airplane, or just stepping on the enemies when they were once huge, and now ever so tiny.$60 is over priced, wait for a few months and it will come down and be totally worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}

It's not that many games based on movies that do well and this licence has been sitting almost 20 years with little to no activity.  However I am really surprised at how well it plays! Even when I read awhile back that this would be the definitive 3rd movie (actually now there is talk that a 'real celluloid' movie coming) I wondered how they would pull this off. I must say that using the writing as well as voice talents of the Ghostbusters cast makes this a great game to get into. Any company that wants to use a movie licence to make a game really should take notes on how to create an immersive story.Moving right along, I really love the fact that there is no HUD clogging up the screen with useless info, some really tight graphics and again great banter among the cast DURING the course of the game. Any of the reviews you probably read are already spot on. This game keeps you busy. You can upograde your proton pack, scan for ghosts to get nto your Spirit guide etc.My only complain of course is that in the game you can't control your favorite Ghostbuster unless you play it in MP mode which also handles pretty well.IN some places it feel repetitive because you are actually 'killing' some spirits as opposed to actually trapping them but part of the fun of course is some of the bigger bosses.The set peices are also impressive and help for the immersion experience.There are a few plotholes in the game which I won't give away which might spoil some people's fun but what I would recommend is watching the movies again and catch some stuff you may have missed or didn't get which will make this game all the more enjoyable!Pick this game up and happy Ghostbusting!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2009"}

There are so many things about the game that are good, most specifically those things surrounding the graphics. Wreckless contains a beautiful and detailed Hong Kong cityscape and is chock full of special effects. After a mission you can watch a replay that is stunningly realistic. The game is also easy to pick up and lots of fun to play.So what's the problem? Unfortunately, this is not a game that will grip you for hours. After the pretty graphics and the novelty of smashing everything in sight wear off, you find the gameplay has little substance. Drive around, smash stuff, drive around some more, etc. Don't get me wrong, the game can be great fun, but only as something you pick up every once in a while when you want a quick and fast-paced game. Don't hesitate to buy Wreckless up if you can get it at a discount. Otherwise, you might want to try a rental first.One last thing that should be mentioned. This game is based in Hong-Kong, so vehicles drive on the wrong (i.e., left) side of the road. This means that when you start, you will find that your natural inclinations meet you head on with a lot of traffic.

(no spoilers)","reviewText":"Synopsis:From the team that brought you Grand Theft Auto, you are now thrown head long into a wild west adventure. You control John Marston. This game is set in the desert in 1911 (same year as my favorite .45 was made). You are somewhere near the Mexico border. John was a criminal that ticked off many people in his past and now has to atone for what he did. People come out of the woodwork either as his friends or enemies.My play experience:On the PS3 the graphics are really sharp and crisp. The textures, the ambiance all bring the wild west to your home living room.In recent years there have been games that have tried to capture the essence of the western genre. For exampleCall of Juarez: Bound in Bloodwhich on the surface was a pretty good game, it however was not a very good story. In COJ the main characters are brothers that are ex-confederate soldiers. The story never really grabs hold and to be honest I never finished COJ. The story in Red Dead Redemption is done so well that it never feels pushed or contrived. Instead its done like an old western movie. Its gritty and a world that beckons you back time and time again.For now let me discuss the cool features:Horses: +I think they put a horse into a motion capture room and had him run around. InAssassins Creed IIthe horse was a good way to get from town to town and the motion was pretty real. In Red Dead Redemption its super smooth an you feel like your out exploring the desert on a horse with no name... Kick your horse too much to get him to chase down that coach, you could be looking at a wild ride as he tries to buck you off. The longer you keep 1 horse the more stamina and other abilities it gets.EDIT: I see they actually DID use a live horse to make the motion capture. It shows.You can also ride stage coaches and trains. Or rob them, its up to you. See gameplay below.Gunfighting: +You are a real gunslinger in this game. To get prepped to get it I watchedYoung Guns [Blu-ray] and a couple of other westerns. This game matches the combat of say GTA and COD. Where you shoot someone matters, and it can affect your character in different ways too. Some of my opponents are gonna have a limp for a while at least.Atmosphere: +There are critters running all over as you ride through the desert landscape. It feels dusty, makes me want to wear a bandanna as I play. When you get low on cash you can kill and skin critters for a few coin. There are actually many ways that you can earn money in this game besides being a hard criminal.World: +So far its just massive. I can only compare it to the run from Commonlands to Qeynos in EQ. It seems to be fully explorable and I have found very few places I couldn't go. It really is huge. I have seen that someone said it was the biggest world ever done in a Rockstar game. Which is impressive considering that those games can go on forever. The land is great in that it hardly ever repeats as you ride. Matter of fact I haven't seen any textures or vistas that look the same. Maybe there are but they are so far apart that you wont notice it. An example of this is the train ride into the mountains in Uncharted 2.Towns: +Unlike GTA you wont have a huge city to run around. Out west these were small settlements and usually had only a couple of hundred people in them. Think about all the old wild west movies you have seen where there is maybe 10 shops and a few houses in the town directly. The way they did the towns is very endearing, because it makes it an immersion type of game experience.Poker: +I love the side games. I have lost my fair share of my real money playing poker and now I can do this in game too.Gameplay options: +You can be the good guy or be a down right criminal. The game system supports either mode and varying degrees in between. This allows RDR to be more than just a shooter, but more like an RPG. Be careful who you pull your gun on. If you do it in town you can start something that will ultimately lower your honor.Controls: +/-The controls are a bit different here and do take some time to figure out. But any game can be that way. If you go from say a driving game to a shooter you might hit the wrong buttons once and a while. After playing this for nearly 2 days solid now and not switching to other games in between, I have totally become comfortable with the controlling scheme.Multiplayer: NAI do not enjoy multiplayer shooters. I am really no good at it so I tend to not play it much or at all. That being said I jumped in a couple of games and it was ok. If your a hard core multiplayer person please check other reviews for this. I would not do it justice because I tend to be jaded with regard to multiplayer games.Replayability:I am almost done and I can see where I would have like to do something different in the way I played this. That being said, I think that I could go back through and try it again maybe being a bit evil this time. For that I think that this is a game you could play over and over, adjust the story line, and enjoy it each time you did.Summary:This game is really appealing if:A. You enjoy GTA type of game play, open world and a morality system that challenges you.B. Fan of westerns and cowboy movies. If you hate them and think they are silly then you probably wouldnt enjoy this.If you are A+B then this game is a hands down favorite pick to have in your PS3 arsenal.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Some Tips: (no spoilers)I have almost 30 hours into this game and I am not done. I do goof around alot and like to go hunting and see what other mischief I can get into. Playing poker for 3 hours doesnt hurt either. That being said I want to drop some tips in to help those of you still waiting or are looking.Horses:1. Dont get to attached to your horse. Think of them like a car, reason being there are tons of ways they can die. From random mountain lions, to getting shot by the enemy to you shooting them in the back of the head on accident when wolves are attacking (sorry skippy :( )2. When going in to attack a gang leave your horse way back and run up. When you have hog tied your bad guy you can whistle ^ arrow and he will run back over to you.3. If you buy a horse the deed is in your bag, click it to call your horse back from the dead. (thanks S.L.V)Gambling:Like in real life its alot about luck so go in with the thought you'll do 1 buy in and when that money is gone leave, go kill some stuff and come back later. Your hands may improveTime:1. Pausing the game with the start button will show what time it is. Saving the game gives you 6 hours of rest. If you like shopping be sure you go to bed no later than 3am. Then when you get back up the stores will all be open, and you can go out and have a blast.Camp:Camp whenever you have a long ride ahead of you. As long as you have bought a map you can go to that place from your campground. Once in your campground you can select where to go without having to burn up the 6 hours of sleep. Then after it loads you will be at your destination. Good stuff.Thats it for now. If I figure out any more lil tidbits Ill share them here with you. Have fun, it really is a great game.Thanks for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001SH7YMG","description":"Red Dead Redemptionis an open-world, third-person, action-adventure game set at the tail end of the American West West era. Action takes place in the first few years of the twentieth century and revolves around the choices that the protagonist, former outlaw John Marston, is forced to make due to his blemished past. The game features a morality system assigning honor and fame points generated through the player's choices.

They all taunt me in their own various ways moments before succumbing to my weapon. A stray shot happens to hit a bone chandelier, which starts to swing, causing eerie shadows to creep across the room.No, Red Dead Redemption is no mere \"Grand Theft Horse\". You'll be intrigued and overjoyed with the open world, just riding around on a fast steed while the sun slowly sets around you is a fantastic experience. But there's more to it than that - challenges, outfits, minigames (play a hand of poker or throw some horseshoes), stranger missions, rare weapons, breakable horses, unique environmental encounters, and of course a sandbox multiplayer mode where you can join a posse of eight players to rid the gang hideouts from villany, or just go out hunting for animals and pick flowers if you choose to. There's also the regular Free For All Deathmatches, Capture The Flag (in this case Bag), and unique downloadable co-op missions. However, all this might overshadow what lies at the core of the game - an extremely well-produced, gripping, funny and touching storyline with the flair of old westerns and the heart of a good adventure. This is no mere gangster story, but about a man seeking to leave his old ways behind and start over - but in order to do that, he'll have to reunite with his family, whether shedding blood on the way or not. To accompany him on his journey is a beautiful soundtrack, with a mixture of Morricone-style instrumentals and artist contributions.Of course, no game is perfect though. There have been some server issues (players being \"incompatible\" and a \"double microphone\" effect which is easily fixed), and \"griefing\" is an annoying problem (online players can shoot anyone they like, thus running around like five year olds with toy guns). It can be tough to shoot people while you're indoors, trains block the path into certain towns, and some random encounters (which I call \"hung wife-encouters\") are nearly impossible to complete. These are just minor annoyances though, and they don't really take away from the overall enjoyment of a tremendously well-produced game, on a single disc so packed with experiences and events that you won't want to leave the world for months.

The controls are somewhat intuitive, but it's easy to get used to especially with onscreen instructions for new moves.

Considering modern technology has advanced to the point where I can record 2 hours of 640x480 video footage on a card that is one half the size of a DS cartridge, I'm surprised that the audio is so low-quality on this game. The cutscenes get very annoying because there's no easy way to scroll past them quickly. The biggest selling point of this game is the intuitive use of the stylus. As a result, I highly recommend you invest in a screen protector. After a few sessions of Ninja Gaiden, my screen protector was scuffed up.

Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"The original DS is still a viable gaming machine","reviewText":"Since it's creation, the Nintendo DS original model has stood pretty strong in the 4 years since it's initial release. Although the DS Lite improves in many ways upon this earlier model, the DS is still a good system to get. The primary reason? It's now much cheaper and more affordable than the DS Lite. I personally like the original version due to it's \"rounded\" design, and let's face it, folks...it doesn't have ANY smudging problems!I recently got the red version of this, and I'm most impressed. I used to own a silver version, but the red is just downright sexy. My only major gripe with the unit is: The power button being easily depressed when you don't mean to, and the brightness, which is non-adjustable. I prefer this unit over the light, however, because it feels much \"sturdier\" than the light version. It might be cumbersome for heavy gaming sessions, but I enjoy the solidity factor here.So, if you're in the market for a DS and don't quite have the money for it's little brother, try the original model and save some money. All the DS titles will play in this, even Guitar Hero with the adapter, so you won't be losing on any gaming goodness that Nintendo has to offer now, and down the road with future title releases. Still a worthy investment at half the cost.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EBRA","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"Very much took me by surprise!","reviewText":"I only got this game because I found it on sale for ten dollars. I had played the first in the series, and somewhat enjoyed it, but not enough to be interested in a sequel at full price. After the game arrived, I played it for 20 minutes and then shelved it for another 3 months. Well this month I finally went back to it, and it grew on me quite a lot to the point that I'd honestly recommend it if you even liked FFXIII a tiny little bit. If you thought there was anything redeeming in that game, you really have to get this at the prices it's going for now. It's an absolute steal. Here's why:1. The music - I am one of those people who grew up on Super Nintendo games, and usually don't think anything stands up to the classic music. I honestly haven't enjoyed game music this much for a couple decades. The music is really like something you'd find on a commercial album, a good commercial album. It sounds like stuff that great artists put on great albums, not like something a game composer churned out in 10 hours. There is a huge variety of styles, and almost all of them are well done and memorable. I can't get the music out of my head. Who would have thought that Final Fantasy 13 part 2 would be some of my favorite game music?2. Open ended - This game reverses course from the first installment and allows you to explore the game's universe in a much less linear fashion. There are something like 8 endings, too. It plays out more like Chrono Trigger than anything, in that regard.3. Refined battle system - The battle system from the first installment is back, and it has a lot of customization again, making fights very strategic. It's not the greatest battle system of all time, but it was a highlight of FFXIII, and it's even slightly better here. Your party's stat and skill development is your call 100%.4. Visuals - For a Xbox 360 game, it looks really nice.5. Length - The game has tons of stuff to do. You can easily spend as much time on this game as any normal FF installment. It's not just a thrown together sequel.Now for the negative, and the thing I take one star off for: the story. It's not that it's a horrible story. It's not horrible. A RPG with a horrible story can't be worth recommending to anyone, and I do recommend FFXIII-2, but the story is weird and a little convoluted in this series as a whole. You don't get quite enough interaction with the characters of the past game, and a lot of the story that unfolds isn't incredibly interesting in the grand scheme of things. It takes a long time before you actually know what's even going on. Basically, it's a time travel plot where you try to figure out why it's a time travel plot. Weird. Still, it's not annoying or awful or cheesy. It does let you make dialogue choices, too, and even rewards you for picking the worst possible answers if you want to make it funny.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Excellent, even without ultraviolence.","reviewText":"Despite being a T game that necessarily has to censor extreme blood and gore, this is an excellent fighter with a healthy roster of favorites from each side and a bunch of nice little touches that make it special. The stage-specific special moves are very well done, particularly the free-fall battles (note that your opponent can see your own button presses during these, so don't keep mashing the same one and risk getting the tables turned with you ultimately on the ground instead...people online don't seem to realize this, to my huge advantage). The fatalities (called Heroic Brutalities for good guys, who don't kill but instead just hurt you a lot) are pretty boring, but it is a T game, after all. They're not all bad, and maybe Catwoman's second is the most brutal. The button layout and responsiveness are both excellent, and pulling off moves isn't too difficult.Online lag can definitely get frustrating, unfortunately. While you can see the connection strength against any given opponent, it doesn't seem to be very accurate, and changes frequently. This means that, during the match, you'll see moves happening that should absolutely connect (or not connect), and yet still do. You'll see punches thrown from three yards away that somehow hit, and uppercuts that somehow miss despite being right up against an unblocking, standing opponent. Getting countered on something like this is really frustrating. Blocking suffers as well, so even if you see an attack coming, blocking might not trigger in time, or any other button. It's not so bad as to be game-breaking, but it can be frustrating and might mean the outcome of the match.One thing I want to complain about is balance. Let's just be honest here: There are a few S-tier characters here that are clearly better than all the others. Expect to face Scorpion more than half the time online, spamming his unpredictable inferno and charge-uppercut combo to infinity. If you're not against the ultra-newb-friendly Scorpion who can spam his dashing uppercut nonstop--which can't be countered, only broken, and is almost impossible to make a counter-hit on except with a projectile--then expect his brother or whatever, Sub-Zero, who will do nothing but throw ice at you and counter everything you do--which, unfortunately, includes *any* contact, including grabs. But neither of them are as bad as the shameless The Flash, who is mind-blowingly fast to the point where it is absolutely impossible to keep up with him. He's by far the fastest character in the game, and has stunningly high-damage attacks that are very difficult to block or predict. Worse, there's almost zero time to counter after he does one of his specials, meaning he can simply continue beating on you, even if he missed or you blocked it. You'll notice that the highest-ranked players are *all* Flash players. They'll brag nonstop about how great they are, but that's like Germany bragging to Poland about how much better their tanks are. It doesn't matter, you're The Flash, which has nothing to do with skill, just spamming special moves.If you want to be just as cheap as them and end up facing a Scorpion or Sub-Zero player who spams the same moves over and over, learn how to play Lex Luthor and punish them hardcore, probably for a flawless victory if you do it right. Luthor's deadly forward missile is massively powerful and obviously can't be countered by Sub-Zero, who will get nailed in the face for it. He's also good against Scorpion for the uppercut for the same reason, as he can either do his 26B or 24C immediately after dodging or blocking it for a beautiful punishment. He will obliterate either of them, but he'll unfortunately not fare quite as well against The Flash, who is far, far faster than him. The Flash, unfortunately, has no bad matchup, so you're SOL either way if your opponent picks him and has any idea what he's doing. Even Superman can't take The Flash *even if he's flying*, since you can get hit in the air by The Flash's best moves.Catwoman is likely the least-used character in the entire online scene. After fighting nearly 600 matches, I've come up against *one* Catwoman player, and I doubt she was this player's main, contrasting the four or five hundred Scorpion players. But Catwoman has an excellent advantage against some characters, particularly Sub-Zero, for a very simple reason: Sub-Zero can counter you any time you touch him, but Catwoman's whip doesn't count (unlike her normal grab or leap attack, which will get you killed). That means if he does the freeze counter and you can provoke them into thinking you're attacking (every Sub-Zero plays this way, it seems), you can counter with a whip grab, which will count as a projectile and will connect. She's also faster than him, and can double-cartwheel and whip-grab them into oblivion if they just try to charge you. I adore it when I go against a Sub-Zero player, since Catwoman completely annihilates him and makes his countering useless. She also *can* work against a lesser Flash player, since her cartwheel kick combo followed by a downward whip grab is fast damage to any less-experienced Flash players who leave themselves open sometimes. Still, I emphasize, Flash has no counter, and a good Flash player will kill you no matter which character you pick and no matter how good you are with them. He simply can't be beat in competent hands.One other thing worth noting about Catwoman is her very easy damage potential and priority over other attacks. Catwoman is almost never used online, but she's pretty much my main for very good reasons. One, she has the excellent double carthweel kick to start off any match, which is extremely fast and your opponent won't possibly see coming. This can be quickly followed up by a low whip grab, and this right away is huge damage. After that, use her leap attack to stop anyone who thinks they can keep you away with projectiles, or anyone who tries to charge you, as any charging characters will get slashed up by her. Also, her basic uppercut is special, because it's the only uppercut that can *always* be made into a combo, unlike any other character. After an uppercut, you can instantly and without fail use the low whip grab to pick them up off the ground and do a quick 15% extra damage. She's an excellent anti-melee fighter, or anyone who uses counters, since her whip is immune to counters. She only has difficulty against projectiles, because she herself has none. The best thing to do here is to just strafe the projectiles repeatedly until you have the opportunity to charge them. Done right, you can now corner them and do the same easy combos as before. Two cartwheels followed by a low whip grab is wonderful damage, and extremely simple to do. While she's considered bottom-tier, I find Catwoman to be an excellent fighter against almost anyone for her speed and stupidly overpowered whip grabs and priority-smashing leap slash.On the other extreme, you've got characters that are worthless. Baraka is probably the worst character in the game, having absolutely nothing going for him. His moves are weak, he's not very fast, and he can be massively punished if he misses any move. He's really only good for his charging kick, but if it misses or is blocked, has such a long recovery time that anyone can punish you for missing. His basic triangle combo is decent and hits crouching players, but you can't combo into it. Baraka's the kind of character you use to humiliate someone, since he's so much worse than everyone else. Sonya is a one-move joke, with one single half-decent move, but is essentially the same move the far-better Shang Tsung has, and also a similar move to Batman's, which is also better. And I really hate to say this, but The Joker just isn't very good, either. He's in-between bottom-tier and middle-tier. He's not incapable of winning a match, but there are definitely better choices available. He's not particularly fast, and none of his moves are very high-damage, and almost all of them leave him open as he recovers. He gets completely annihilated by someone like Lex Luthor, who can simply spam his missile repeatedly. At least he has one decent fatality.Everyone else has their perks. I main Lex Luthor, second Catwoman, third Superman, fourth Shang Tsung, and fifth Baraka (because by then I can win with even him if the matches go on long enough). I'm not into playing characters that are obviously superior to all the others, so I enjoy those four in particular. Also, because there's so much Scorpion to go around, both Lex and Catwoman can counter the hell out of him if they're used right. Most people don't expect those characters against Scorpion, so it often works out. Catwoman's second fatality is also great, and probably the most violent fatality in the entire game. It sure ends the hell out of the contest.One thing definitely worth mentioning is that there are people who use hacks online to bolster their wins. This almost invariably means having a Flash player automatically use a certain combo when you're open, which has near-infinite range, and will blow apart your life bar, and you'll be totally helpless to stop it, since it can't be sidestepped or countered, or even broken out of. On the bright side, cheaters are easy to spot: They'll have around ten thousand wins and *zero* losses, which should tip you off pretty quickly to ignore them. Some players are also hatefully referred to as \"pullers\" for doing nothing but using long-range attacks until their opponent is forced to assault them, to which they'll respond with a move the other person can't possibly dodge (The Flash does this very well). They will do this repeatedly until they win. \"Pullers\" are hated in the community, so don't be one, please. We all know it wins every time and there's nothing we can do about it, so there's no point. It's not like anyone actually cares about records when cheaters run amok everywhere.Really, you should already know what you're getting into here. It has a Mortal Kombat style, except it's rated T and has DC characters. It's got a story mode for each side that, while not exactly groundbreaking, is still entertaining, much more entertaining than other story modes in fighters. It actually has a plot, for starters, and has an excellent final sequence that is truly epic. Pick it up if you're interested. Just don't expect gory fatalities or mechanics that are all that complicated. But if all you care about is matching up Batman against Raiden or something like that, by all means, go for it. It's a competent fighter that does what it needs to do well. If the balance weren't so off, two stars would be added, but when online consists of three characters except for the ambitious, you know something's wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2011"}

Webb \"Trajedi\"","summary":"Overall a terrific choice for a PS2/PS3 wheel","reviewText":"The Logitech Driving Force Wheel for Gran Turismo offers a state of the art driving experience when coupled with the game it was designed for.  The force feedback is overall fairly realistic, occasionaly you will feel like you might be grinding the mechanisms inside the unit when you are fighting through a turn but the wheel is durable and made for this.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could also hook this wheel up to my PS2 and take the old GTs out for a spin.  I did much better with this wheel than the Dualshock of yore.  When using a control stick for driving games you really just move the stick left or right when you want to adjust rather than laying into it throughout the turns etc.. With a wheel like this you are involved with every tire on the ground, through every turn until the duration of the event.  While it is smooth sailing with GT this wheel can be a little cumbersome in other games, Rally style driving games seem to add too much rumble and control somewhat spastically (DIRT being the exception, it is terrific with this wheel) and other driving sims might take a little more tuning with the wheel to get it where you are comfortable,(I am looking at you GRID).  The mechanism that attaches this wheel to a table is very well designed overall and fits over almost any edge and thickness of surface.  The pedals are nice just acceleration and brake on this model however.  The gear shift functions as shifter (or ebrake in some games).  If you have a need for speed on you PS2/3 this wheel is the right choice.  The components feel well made and if you have enough driving titles you will find yourself using it more than you think.  Recommended especially for GT titles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2008"}

Now that the renowned racing franchise has headed to Wii, does it live up to its predecessors or does it depend entirely on the new Whiil controller to be any good?The gameplay in MK Wii is very similar to other Mario Kart games, but also feels quite different and new additions add a lot to it. First off, the Wii Wheel, which I simply call the Whiil. This new controller works very well and is very fun to use, but the advanced gamers will gravitate towards a GameCube controller right away. However, I later found that the remote/nunchuk control mode works very well, arguably better than the GC controller, so I recommend you give it a shot if you've been using a GC controller. You can choose between karts and bikes this time, the bikes actually being much better than the karts. With the bikes, you can only get a one-level boost on a mini turbo, but you can do a wheelie that significantly straightens your movement, but also highly boosts your speed on a straightaway. The karts now have nothing special to them, except that they can do tricks as well as the bikes and can get a bigger mini turbo. Tricks are a great addition to the game as well. When you go off a jump into the air, hit the trick button (or shake the remote/wheel) to do a trick. Some of these are pretty cool and they also give you a boost when you land, adding some sense of strategy to the game. Before each race, you can choose whether you want to be able to manually drift and be able to get mini turbos or automatically drift and not be able to get mini turbos, and this option makes the game a bit easier for beginners and makes using the Whiil better.The single player in MK Wii is pretty much the same as it's been before, only they removed the mission mode that had added a bit more to MKDS' single player. The Grand Prixs were actually not as enjoyable for me this time as I repeatedly get hit by blue shell after blue shell when I should be dominating a race. Otherwise, you have your time trial mode and VS mode, but really that's it for single player. Thankfully there's a whole lot more to the game than the single player.The multiplayer and online play in MK Wii are absolutely oustanding and easily make up the core of the game. The regular split screen multiplayer is just fine, but it can be hard to see where you're going sometimes because your screen is so small. The online play, however, is easily the highlight of the game. You can play with one or two players from one console, which is a great feature to have available. The only problem with this is that you can't actually be using two licenses (save files) at once, so only player 1 can get his VR up. Speaking of VR, the abbreviation stands for VS Rating. You gain or lose points depending on how you do in a race. It can get tough to raise at some point, though, and you have to constantly win races to continually get it up. The online play goes up to 12 players, a first for a Nintendo game. It is also easy to find people and never takes much time. They have also made it a whole lot easier to play with a friend, allowing you to join the game they are currently playing in, but you can also create a room for just you and your friends where you can chat with select phrases between four race series'. You are even repeatedly told that a friend is playing online. The use of the Mii is also very cool and gives each player an identity rather than just a name.I guess Nintendo decided that the online play in MK Wii was so good that it deserved its own channel. The Mario Kart Channel allows you to enter tourneys, race the top time trial ghosts in the world, and more. The channel actually appears seperately on the Wii menu, allowing you to access it to check stats and stuff even without a disk.Technically, Mario Kart Wii really isn't bad, but isn't anything too special either. The graphics are good and all, but I feel that they aren't all Nintendo is capable of, which is still ok with me because I think they're good enough. The visuals are very bright, which makes the gameplay feel pretty nice. The sound in the game is just fine, no problems there. The music is also good but again, nothing particularly special like Mario Galaxy or Brawl. The controls have some minor annoyances as far as the Classic and GameCube controllers go, but the Whiil and remote/nunchuk controls feel just fine. On a GameCube controller, you have to reach down to the D-Pad to do a trick, which is very annoying, especially since the Y button isn't even used for anything and was left wide open for convenience. The Classic controller is the same way, only you have to totally lift your finger off the control stick to hit the D-Pad, which is even worse.Little difficulties aside, Mario Kart Wii has achieved true excellence. The game is really fun and definitely earns the \"Fun for Everyone\" label (as long as you have multiple Whiils if you're playing multiplayer). Really, I recommend this game for any gamer or non-gamer, but as a more-than-casual gamer, you will need online play to fully enjoy this game. The online play in MK Wii is the best yet, and makes you seriously wonder why Smash Bros. couldn't have had online play like this. So overall, Mario Kart Wii has surpassed my expectations and delivered a game that is as worthwhile as just about any other.Gameplay: 9Graphics: 7.5Sound: 7.5Value: 10FINAL SCORE: 9.3/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}

Many saw this game as a rip-off from that success as they took many elements from San Andreas and applied them to this game. The gang aspect was the most prominent comparison between the two as, in Saints Row you play a mute gangster who joins a group called the 3rd street saints who are a gang located in, you guessed it 3rd Street in the rundown city of stillwater. The 3rd Street Saints are a group in constant conflict between 3 other gangs of stillwater as they battle for control of the city.The plot itself sees you, again an un named mute character witness a fight between these three gangs. You're unwittingly sucked into this battle and are thankfully saved by saints leader Julius and are brought in to prove yourself worthy of gang membership. Over the course of the game you engage in a number of missions that introduce you to the 3 seperate gangs. They are...Los Carnales: This gang is lead by Hector Lopez and are quite a ruthless gang of street thugs sporting red gang colours.Vice Kings: Are a group lead by a ruthless businessman and criminal by the name of Benjamin King. They are the highest profile gang and sport the colour yellowWestside Rollerz: They are a group of street racers, let by street racing pro Joseph Price and they sport the blue colours.Upon first glance, the gangs may not seem that intimidating or indeed that big in profile. However, when you get into the game you come to realise the power of each gang especially the Vice Kings lead by the intimidating Benjamin King played by Michael Clarke Duncan. Although it's a video game I found myself being genuinely intimidated by the presence of King and he was easily the best character within the game. Along with your enemy gang leaders, there's also the prominent characters within your own gang to become familiar with. Especially the quite frankly legendary Johnny Gat, who's a man not afraid of a good shoot 'em up. Along with taking over stillwater territory one disctrict of a time, you're also given a hell of a lot of other stuff to do.The customisation of the game is when this game starts to become unique. Upon the beginning of the game, you're given the opton to create your main character from scratch. This includes morphing all facial features, character size and general body features. Cars are also fully customisable with a plethora of different features for each individual vehicle. This includes colours, bumpers, windows, hoods etc. Which also includes the option to have Nitro for your vehicle to take full advantage of the street racing games. As part of the customisation, you can also purchase cribs at different levels of the game. Unfortunately, in this instalment you can't customise the cribs, but it's brought in in the second game.Along with customisation, there are a number of other different activities which you can take part in at your leisure. These games allow you to unlock other particular benefits and earn you some extra cash on the side. One of the more fun activities is the Insurance Fraud activity, which sees you throwing yourself in front of cars to get some extra cash. If you're not a fan of participating in the set side missions, you can also choose to hold up, or break into a store. To hold up a store you simply point your gun at the clerk and wait for them to open the safe. To break in, you wait 'till night time, smash your way into the back of a store, crack the safe and steal the goods inside.The police mechanics aren't great in this game as you find that to avoid the police, you simply have to avoid doing anything wrong for a short period of time and the police meter will run out on you. The interraction with the gang wars is great and easy to use, the shooting system takes away the typically annoying targetting and allows you to free aim, which presents a much better gun fighting experience. One of the biggest drawbacks of the entire game is that there is no flying available. This is mainly due to the relatively new streaming technology employed by the Volition team to put together this game, meaning that to have any ability of flight would slow the game down immensely.This is a really good game and although the free roam premise can be considered a GTA rip-off, there's no doubting that this is still a unique game in of its own. Just cool all over and something every XBOX360 owner should have in their game collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

In a strange twist, Crash grudgingly pairs with his archenemy, Dr. Cortex in order to save the world. Through this unorthodox partnership, Cortex is abused as Crashs favorite weapon when Crash and Cortex are controlled as one. Additionally, this dynamic paired gameplay will include never-before-seen mechanics which also include cooperative level designs in which Crash must protect Cortex and vice-versa, albeit reluctantly!","reviewerName":"Antoinette Johnson \"Pooky\"","summary":"Prepare to be severely frustrated.","reviewText":"First off, I absolutely love the Crash Bandicoot series. I own Warped, the first one, and Wrath of Cortex. Twinsanity is the newest addition to my collection and let me just warn fans of the series that if you buy this game prepare to get mad alot. Let me give a brief summary of the plot.I assume from the opening menu of the game that it takes place after Warped, with Cortex and Uka Uka trapped in ice. They get free and Cortex plans a revenge party against Crash that involves every enemy hes ever faced. Cortex fails, but later our true foes are introduced. Who are the main villians you might ask. Well two, twin, mutant, ultra-intellegent birds that used to be Cortex's pets, and are now seeking to kill Cortex. Yes. Thats the plot. Crash was never a really big story driven platform game, but this story is crazy even for this series. Oh well. Maybe thats why its called \"Twinsanity\". But enough about the story, lets get to main content of the Crash series: the music, graphics, levels, humor, replayability, challenge, and most importantly the controls which I have ALOT to say about.Music: The music is the strangest I have ever heard in a video game...EVER! its extremely different from the rest of the series. I have to confess though the music grew on me after awhile. I actually found myself humming to the strange gibberish music playing for the levels. The music will irritate you when you find yourself dying over and over. I'll explain that bit later.Graphics: The graphics looks great, but throughout my time playing the game I've come across many glitches and a few lighting issues. For example in the first cave level of the game I somehow fell through the floor, while on solid ground. Theres another glitch at the school level that...err I sort of exploited on purpose. You bodyslam a door and end up on the roof of the school. You can fall through the floor and end up breaking the game by getting stuck there too. I made sure to save my game before doing this. I also had a glitch at Cortex's Ice fortress. I opened the door to his base and died fighting a horde of monsters. I respawned back in front of the door, but it wouldn't let me back in! It wasn't till I left to explore a bit and came back did it open up again and let me in. Other than glitches, I think the game looks pretty good.Levels: Twinsanity introduces the series to a more open world type of gameplay. Instead of going through portals are a map to get to your next destination, you just travel to the next level by foot. You would think having an open world gameplay world be alot of fun and interesting, but besides collecting gems and fruit, theres really not much to do in the areas that aren't levels. Another problem is that due to the huge levels, it can be extremely difficult figuring out, where you're supposed to go. This is extremely evident in the snowboarding and ball levels where you can take multiple paths and have an increased risk of dying from bottomless pits, that more often than not you won't see coming. The thing that will really, and I mean REALLLY, p*** people off are the cutscenes. They sure did p*** me off. In areas with a checkpoint AND a cutscene,you will have to watch the cutscene every time you die and have to start where you left off. This wouldn't be a problem if you could just skip cutscene like...I don't know, the OTHER Crash games, but the developers of twinsanity figured players would want to watch an unskippable cutscene everytime he/she died. This severly takes away from the pace of the game and is EXTREMELY annoying, especially on boss levels. These unskippable cutscenes actually made me ragequit the game for awhile. They nearly ruined the game for me.Humor: This game is actually very funny. But once again the d*** unskippable cutscenes ruin it. A joke or scene stops being funny when you're forced to watch it over and over again after you die.Replayable: Just like the other Crash games you have to collect crystals and gems. The gems are scattered in hidden places throughout the levels and are actually easier to find than the other games. The crystals unlock concept art and really serve no other purpose than that and I believe a secret movie. It doesn't feel as satisfying to get them like the other games though.Challenge and Controls: These are the HUGE ones. This game is hard, VERY HARD, but some control issues make doing what would normally be simple platforming puzzles, hairpullingly frustrating. One of the things Crash is most noctorious is having simple, fun, and challenging gameplay, with simple, fun controls that mostly involve jumping and spin attacking, while running through levels. The first thing I noticed and knew would be a huge problem in Twinsanity is the controls. In the other games, when Crash jumps you can run and build momentum to easilly land on platforms. The games also made it easy to judge the distance of the platforms to determine how far to jump. In Twinsanty they screwed it all up. Crash's double jump barely feels like it goes far and moving Crash arounds feels more slippery than the previous games making simple jumps harder than they should be. This became extremely evident later in the game when you find yourself in narrower areas with low walls. More often than not, you will overshoot a jump, undershoot a jump, or accidently fall off an platform resulting in death after death. It took a long time for me to get used to this. Once again when you die in certain parts, you have to watch unskippable cutscenes (load screen included). Imagine after dying a billian times in a level, you get near the end with no lives left and die, causing you to start the level all the way from the beginning. I wanted to throw my controller at the tv so bad. The fact that there are chase levels like the boulder levels in Crash 1 doesn't help much either because these are worse. The spin attack is also pretty handicap because sometimes you will try to hit the enemy only for the spin attack to not do anything and you get hit.New features: I can't forget to mention you can play as Cortex and his niece Nina. Theres skiing levels and combat levels. The combat level where you throw around Cortex aren't too bad. Thier actually pretty fun. The skiing levels are frustrating and I absolutely hate playing as Cortex. Cortex only makes me wish they let you play only as Crash or even his sister Coco. As for Nina, let me just say, shes bada**. While she can't double jump, she can easilly take out enemies and uses a graple to travel across gaps. The grapple didn't always respond when I used it though, which became a problem during the bus chase portion of the level you play as her. That bus part was frustrating as heck, and I finally got through and made it to the boss. Problem is I got a game over on the boss and had to go through that crap again. AAAARRRGGH!!I give this game 3 stars. While many things about it frustrate the h*** out of me, there are still some things about this game I kind of liked and enjoyed. I found myself still playing with the purpose of beating the game and maybe going for 100% completion. I praise them for trying to give the series a more open world feel and believe if they fixed the problems I've mentioned, it could be as good as Wrath of Cortex are even up there with the first 3 games. In the state the game is currently though, its an either love it or hate it situation.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"A Disappointing Grand Theft of Fun","reviewText":"I played IV and didn't like it all that much so I wasn't all that excited for V, but after watching the trailers for this game and seeing the great reviews I thought, \"Hey, I might actually like this one\", so I got my hands on a copy. Because I am a bit busy it took me about a week or two to get a good amount of the way through the game, and around that first week I realized that I was actually getting kind of bored with it. The missions in the first half of the game are some of the most boring video game missions I've ever played. For example, driving 5 min. to the dock where you have a drive a container carrier truck and pick up containers and move them, once they're moved you get have a slight bit more fun and take a couple of pictures of a container ship, then drive 5 min. somewhere else... yawn, it doesn't get better though as just a a few missions later where the entire mission is moving joysticks around and pressing buttons to do yoga moves... yawn. Out of all the missions I played there was like what, a couple, as in 2-3 missions, where you actually finally get to shoot someone (but only one legitimate full mission where you get to take on a gang as Franklin), and the heist mission I played was pretty fun too. Though don't think I'm judging the rest of the missions based on what I played, I gave the game a chance for a bit but still wasn't having that much fun w/ it so I looked up a walkthrough of the future missions as well as watched gameplay of some of them to see if the game got more fun, but, it didn't, instead I saw that there were 69 missions in total (it's GTA so we absolutely need an overused sex joke, right?), it was just more of the same of forgettable boring missions. The few praises I do give this game though is for the amount of activities you can do, but just because there's lots to do doesn't mean it's fun as the activities just turns out to be a whole bunch of mini-game fluff that's fun for about a day until you get bored of them. The stock market was cool though, the market changes depending on what's happening in the story and your actions, so if something happens to company A, their competitor's stock will rise and if you invest in them you can make money. I didn't much like the cops and wanted level either (and no, not because they try to kill you), even if you went way out to a remote location and for example blew up a car or killed someone you'd still get a 2-3 wanted level even though no one saw you and when you went back on the road the cops would be all over you, it's like this weird invisible eye spying on you to give you a wanted level.The story was ok, I'm actually not even sure what the story even is but I think it's just telling the story of a period of time in the characters lives where they come together and fall apart. But I guess GTA is supposed to be more about doing activities outside of the story in the world so I guess the story doesn't have to be all that strong, but still, it's mainly a single player story driven game, so GTA V falls short in that category. The characters were really good though, each has his own personality and each varies in sanity which makes for interesting well done characters. The new stats feature that determines each characters skills in driving, flying etc, is pointless, even w/ a not too good driving, flying, etc. stat it doesn't really make a difference, so there's absolutely no reason to grind upgrading your stats unless you want 100% completion.Online:Like the story mode, I saw the trailers and I said, \"Oh man, the online actually looks pretty fun\", well like the story mode trailers I was mislead and disappointed. I started out and immediately had trouble finding missions, I robbed a store but was immediately bored with it as it'd the same thing over and over, from what I read though the missions do sound better than the single player missions, but nothing interesting enough to keep my playing and to come back. You can do heists in online but if you don't have a crew than you're stuck w/ mic-less sometimes trolling people which isn't as much fun. I didn't like the leveling system as well, the whole inventive that's supposed to keep you coming is back is just to unlock stuff like cars and planes which you then buy, but I I'm not interested in buying this stuff, partly because I can just get a free car anywhere on the street.Recently (as of writing this review) Rockstar decided to halve the mission payout earned from repeated missions, so no more farming of missions to get more money/RP, so it's pretty much become a grindfest. This is pretty obviously a move by Rockstar just to get people to buy more money packs w/ real money, if this is the way Rockstar is going to treat the online then it's not even worth getting into.Overall:A disappointing story mode that was pretty boring for the most part and not much fun activities on the outside w/ a disappointing online mode I do not recommend this game at all. Honestly, I'm not a CoD fan at all, but I'd say CoD is better than GTA V because at least CoD is successful at making a fun game. I do have other praises for this game though, such as the really big open world map with several different areas (deserts, forests, etc.), the really nice graphics, driving and flying though not realistic (which is good cause it's GTA) was nicely done as well as the crash physics, like getting your car dent after hitting something and then watching the hood fly off, all of the small things that add immersion that you may not see too often like gasoline lighting on fire. So don't worry if you don't get around to playing this game or decide not to as this is not all that great of a GTA game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2013"}

The graphics were so unreal that I felt obligated to buy this game. While everything in the game looked spectacular, in the beginning I truly minded the controls. They just felt odd and difficult. However, after I changed the default control setting to ALTERNATE CONTROL 2 and increasing X and Y axis movement sensitivity to 75%(controls similar to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare), I JUST LOVED THE GAME. Here are pros and cons about it.PROS.SPECTACULAR GRAPHICS: Graphics for this games are just mind-blowing. Attention to detail is to its finest. Just love how the game looks on my HDTV.WELL DESIGNED LEVELS: Really loved the variety of levels offered in the game. From plain battle field to top of the train. From your own headquarters to enemies fort. JUST LOVED THEM.UNIQUE FPS GAMEPLAY: This game forces you to duck and cover vs a lot of other games that encourage run and gun type of gameplay.VARIETY OF WEPONS: While in the beginning you may think this game will have only boring weapons, you will love the guns you will get towards the end. Really don't want to spoil the surprise.CHALLENGING BOSSES: One thing I find missing in the most FPS games these days are bosses. In this game there are plenty of bosses to fight. Each comes with their unique characteristic. THE FINAL BOSS IS THE BEST.GREAT VOICE-ACTING AND MIND STIMULATING STORY: Yup nothing to add here. I really liked the monologue you get to hear in the end.TANKS, MOUNTED GUNS and ???: Other than playing as a foot soldier, you also get to operate tank, mounted guns to destroy flying ship and more. Really don't want to spoil it for you.EPIC MULTIPLAYER: While I am not big on multiplayer, I have to say this game has pretty awesome multiplayer. Like other FPS shooter multiplayers these days you have battle different modes and character classes. Engineer class is the one that I found quite unique and interesting.GREAT RE-PLAYABILITY: The single player mode is diverse enough that you will be encouraged to play this game over again. If you are a trophy/achievement lover, you will certainly play this game over at least two more times. Plus, the multiplayer truly prolong the life of this game.CONS.DEFAULT CONTROLS: Default controls are simply horrible. As I mentioned in the opening, changing the controls to ALTERNATE 2 and increasing X and Y axis sensibility makes this game playable. Nevertheless, every time you go into close up view, there is a twitch which makes the aiming quite difficult.10 FEET TALL PROTAGONIST: This is a sarcasm. It is extremely irritating in the game that even after you take cover, it is possible to get shot. Makes it seem like you are a very tall person.RATHER SHORT SINGLE PLAYER: It still took me about 7-9 hrs to finish the game, but I wish the game was longer.CONCLUSION: Contrary to the cons I mention, THE GAME IS FUN AND VERY ENJOYABLE. The experience you will get is unique and it will want to make you come back for more. Now that the prices are lowered, IT IS A MUST OWN.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

And the sound in 7.1 is just amazing, you here each bullet and the people shooting from behind you. Now I dont play many online games besides Modern Warfare 2 and Gears of War but this game is sweet, its so realistic and it has what I believe to be the most clever maps I have seen there so huge but tight for great multiplayer of up to 32 people. The game gets really intense also, they have it set up where you can play multiple missions in one match, like assassination, protect, bring the radio, kill the most. The online is silky smooth, and looks just as good as single player, I would also suggest getting all 3 multiplayer packs on psn they are nice 6 maps for only 12 bucks. Thats what I like the game is so smooth with no lag you dont even think your playing online, I dont know what people have against the controls or the aim but it moves just right to me, and as the other reviewer said the updated the high precision aim in settings.Finally, everyone dont miss out on killzone3 in feb, with much more diverse environments and gameplay inspired by uncharted2 team, and in 3d, check out the video on psn,looks amazing i already pre-ordered.

First off, the controls are nearly perfect, and you really don't suffer from fatigue that easily.  Next, the graphics are spectacular from the effect of the fallen soldiers and guards in your way.  Furthermore, the storyline and the characters are actually very much believable. The only other FPS currently that falls into this category is Medal of Honor: Frontline.  For example, the main character attempts to hit on Eos, the female boss of the revolt, on the end,and he gets turned down.  Also, the cinematics in this game are actually fairly decent.  You aren't per se forced into the storyline like Half-Life, but you are persuaded to join the revolt because you are instantly being attacked by guards once the revolution begins.  Lastly, there have been very intense moments in this game, unlike Unreal, Quake, Half-Life or the other myriad of FPSs that I've played.  The only game coming close was Deus Ex where all hell broke loose in some levels.There are some faults in the game however.  First, the levels aren't sometimes entirely destructive, but that's neither here or there.  Next, the AI of your allies are absolutely stupid.  They run into gunfire, and you are better bumping them off early. Lastly, the multiplayer levels aren't as good as Quake's, but they are sufficient to play in.Red Faction 2 is supposed to be a much better improvement than the original.  Overall, this game is a really well-done FPS, and at this price, you should definitely consider buying it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00007JZB3","description":"TRON 2.0is an action-packed story-driven title inspired byTRON, the groundbreaking science-fiction motion picture. The game takes place in present day, approximately 20 years after the events of the film. Playing as Jet Bradley, son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley from the movie, gamers are digitized into cyberspace and will race on light cycles, battle corruption both inside and outside of the computer world, and explore locations including the Internet Hub, Firewall, Corrupted Server and Light Cycle Game Grid.","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"It's beautiful and it's hard","reviewText":"Pros:- Beautiful graphics. If you like the artwork in the Tron film, this game gives you the opportunity to visit the world. There is only 1 other game I have appreciated the abstract art in more than Tron, and that's the original MDK.- It's educational in the sense of how disorienting such a virtual world really is. I found myself having a hard time figuring out what a door-way/exit was because all the natural affordances in the real world are gone. Ie there is no obvious door knob anywhere. I personally like games that give me new insight on things I take for granted everyday.- Lightcycles- ok so the lightcycle game concept as a whole really isn't that much fun anyway so you can't blame the developers for this. All they did was write a very good implementation of the lightcycle simulation and let you drive in it. How many Tron fans have wanted to just be able to do that and were unsatisfied for the last 20years waiting for it? Now that it's finally been implemented in all its glory, we can all check it off in our checklist of geek lifetime to-dos.- Throwing disks- again every tron fan wants to be able to throw and deflect disks. Now you can. I particularly like being able to deflect disks back at an enemy to kill them. This is like being a Jedi with a lightsaber. I only wish the Jedi Knight games would let you do this manually to give you the same satisfaction. In Jedi Knight all lasers are deflected automatically. I think being able to consciously deflect a laser bolt was the most satisfying part of Jedi Powerbattles for the Playstation. In Tron it's pretty satisfying to be able to deflect a rapid-fire of disks in quick succession and wipe out a bunch of enemies.- The climactic moments are quite well done. I like the part where you are trying to escape a de-rezing beam.- The upgrading of your systems is kind of like Jedi Knight.You get points that you can direct towards health, energy, weapons efficiency, etc.. You also get subroutine upgrades that you have to install to use. Each level sets a memory budget below which you can use the routines, so you have to chose which ones you want online at any given level- you can of course swap-in and out subroutines as needed. This is like having all the force powers you can collect in Jedi Knight and then letting you chose a subset that you can use at any given time. I know some people hate this, but I think it makes the game more RPG-like.Cons:- I am playing it at the EASY level, and it is hard. I get killed alot. It doesn't help that the enemies have the ability right off to throw disks at an arc and home-in on you. You can arc the disk too but you're no way as good as the computer. Fortunately there are cheats you can turn on- like GOD.- I don't like jumping puzzles. There are lots of jumping puzzles. Fortunately there aren't too many that cause you to fall to your death- there are enough cliffs in the environment to do that for you anyway :)- The intro tutorial was a bit confusing with all the technobabble. But I was able to play the game without reading the manual.Final comments:I got this game on sale and so far it has been well worth the price I paid for it (the cost of 2.5 movie tickets.) So have I gotten at least 2.5 movies' worth (5 hours) of enjoyment from it? Yes.Some hints for people who plan to buy the game:1. Download the patches- not to fix bugs. I have found the game to be very stable. Download the patches to enable things that will make the game easier to play.2. After you killed an enemy, and after you have absorbed their energy, they will sometimes leave a &quot;permission&quot; artefact. Make sure to grab that too. They are not absolutely necessary but are useful to disable the rezzing stations that can generate more bad guys. I don't think this was covered in the opening tutorial- but I found later in the manual.END OF LINE","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I092MM","description":"Past Mario games have let the blue-suspendered hero roam around fully rendered 3D landscapes. Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"K. Groh","summary":"Mario is Back and Looking Good!","reviewText":"Ah, the long awaited 3D version of a classic Nintendo game. This is the perspective from a 40 plus year-old mom and her 12 year-old son.Super Mario 3D Land is fun and the 3D graphics add to the game play - most of the time. You can tell the influence of Super Mario Galaxy in the game play but it it nowhere as dimensional and complex as Galaxy. That doesn't mean that it isn't fun, especially for a handheld game (as compared to a console). The graphics are classic Mario, colorful, non-threatening, and perfectly rendered.The levels don't seem as complex or long as previous games. My son says they feel like, 'appetizers'. But this could be that if you are not a new player to the series, you are already looking for the hidden walls, pipes, and other secrets so there isn't as much going back to find missing things.The addition of 3D is good but it actually seems to get in the way for me sometimes since you have to hold the game at just the right angle. The 3D adds a lot to the character and scenery renderings. There are some neat optical illusions and I'm excited to see how far they will go with them as the game progresses. But, they are no fun if they are forced just to justify the 3D title.I came across the rare white Tanooki suit as early as World one. My son thinks it was because I kept 'killing' myself in lava trying to get past a perspective issue but I think it's because I'm special. :-) It was fun playing with it since it makes you invincible to just about everything. Actually, the white Tanooki suit is offered any time you get stuck on a level. The great part about that is if you are stuck on a level, you have a way out to get past it and not get stuck at the same spot in the game. It's fun to get through a level using it but it's even better going back and completing it without it. This is great for younger players (or older moms) that don't have the skills at times on certain levels.The bird's eye view perspectives can be a little disorienting at times. This is not a frontal view only game and the perspective changes a lot. But so does Galaxy.This is fun, perhaps a little easy as evident by another reviewer that finished the game in 7 hours. But the second play through with Luigi will surely challenge most. Is it worth the $40 price tag? It depends on how die-hard you are. If you must have it now, spend away. If you can wait a little, I'm sure with a seemingly short play time, it will be available used in no time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

You're on a mission to save Smurfette from a gang of bad Smurfs controlled by you-know-whom.  The gameplay mechanic is typical of side-scroll platformers, which is familiar to me but really gets old quick since neither the graphics nor the story saves the day.In short, like most games licensed from movies or TV, this game is only enjoyable to those who're totally into the background characters to begin with.

I play most anything, but tend to favor shooters and platformers. Rarely have I ever found much of any depth in this sort of children's game; especially when it's based on a movie. Those are usually a recipe for disaster. That being said, this game really did surprise me. I had a great time playing it. Even the 2-player was done right. It does a fantastic job of mixing things kids might enjoy (the toybox area is great for kids and completionists) with some really decent platforming that adults can get into (the actual campaign offers up a decent challenge). I loved the option of choosing which character I wanted to use in the toybox (buzz, woody, jessie, and eventually zurg). This really is among PS3's best games. And that is saying something. The only reason I am giving it a 4 is because I ran into a few glitches while attempting to get the platinum trophy. And I'm not talking about the kind of glitch that pushing reset fixes. I'm talking the kind that makes you play the toybox area over again from scratch (about 10 hours to platinum completion). But even though I found a glitch, the second playthrough fixed it and I still enjoyed playing it over a second time. This is a wonderful game. Buy now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Off to a Great Start","reviewText":"The XBox One is a sizeable step forward.  Like any technological gadget, there are some aspects where you can see the vision, but we're not there yet...however Microsoft has done very well this time around and I'm confident the console will continue to improve as time goes on.  As someone who rants a lot about horrible Live experiences, overheating power bricks, and the Red Ring of Death, that's saying a lot.HARDWARE AND CONTROLSFirst, the box isn't smaller than an XBox 360, but it is very quiet, even when it's been on for a while.  It still has a slab of a power brick and big clunky connectors for it.  The unit is smart enough to integrate with your home theater system, detecting your model of TV and/or Receiver and trying to communicate with it where possible (for me, it could turn the TV on and off but not the receiver).  The Kinect device that connects to the unit is a bigger chunk of hardware than the 360's Kinect, and I get the impression there's more under the hood that we'll be seeing from the new Kinect.  For now, its primary purpose is to let you log in by sitting down, knowing which person is playing (and setting up separate profiles) via face recognition, and listening for your voice commands.Voice commands are mostly there, but not perfect.  It's easy to issue orders like \"Xbox On\", or even \"XBox, I want to listen to Imagine Dragons\", but then sometimes commanding a button with a phrase like \"Accept this setting\" doesn't go well.  It helps to speak naturally and not try to enunciate words slowly, and I understand that over time it will learn your voice.The controller feels like a more compact version of the XBox 360 controller, which is a bit of a shame in that I really loved the larger 360's spread.  Still, the controller works great.  Apart from feeling my left thumb stretch a bit more to reach the stick, I'm satisfied.  The XBox logo button is at the top edge, reducing the possibility of accidentally bumping it when things get frantic, and Start and Select are tiny--which does mean in low light I have to look closely to find them...I imagine I'll get the hang of that over time though.APPS AND INTERFACESome of the Windows 8 features make their way to the One:  the interface looks similar, as if the XBox 360's menus were further condensed to look even more like Windows 8's Start Menu.  The apps and Store look the same (and probably are the same under the covers) and so we easily get Skype, Netflix, and Amazon Instant Video with a download.  A lot of the basic setup menus are made as simple as possible, and one of my favorite aspects is how the XBox One simplifies all those darn codes:  when you want to unlock something you no longer have to use a controller to type in that long string of letters and numbers--just wave the QR Code in front of the Kinect and it'll do the rest.That said, some of these apps really need some polish.  The Music application doesn't appear to let you do much beyond access the Microsoft-supplied content and my SkyDrive, and when I told it to stream Imagine Dragons (and similar sounds--it shuffles other artists in like Pandora does), it probably shouldn't have handed me Eminem's \"Mockingbird\" and a country-pop hit that I couldn't stand.  Trying to add a local source of music or manage any of my collection that wasn't in my SkyDrive turned out to be impossible, and it has no idea I have a home network, let alone that I have two Windows Home Servers (a 2003 and a 2011) or that just about everything in my home is DLNA-capable in one way or another.  The same is also true of Video--right now, unless I use content available in an app, nothing's available...and this is also limited.  My Music session counted down that I can listen to X many songs before I have to pay to have it.  US$99/year or more...no thank you.  There are a lot of TV-centric functions that work when you connect your cable box/DVR, but you'll have to have an HDMI out to do it--no older Component/optical options.GAMESSo now we're on to games, and with the unit being only a few days old, thus far I only have Forza Motorsport 5.  However, I can tell the XBox One's hardware is well-used:  not only are Forza's graphics gorgeous, but there are times when the physics engine is put to the test.  I'm thinking in particular of one Top Gear track where hundreds of random objects are getting crashed into and bounced around, flying all over the place in a realistic fashion but with not one stutter to the framerate.  There's a huge amount of controversy right now in that the games are rendered in 1080p by upscaling a 720p resolution on the fly.  I've got good eyes, but try as I might really cannot tell the difference.  Graphics are simply beautiful.  It's also nice that you can multi-task:  for example, spin up some music while playing a game (now if Music could just work a bit better!).  We are definitely looking at next-gen hardware, and I look forward to seeing more titles (Halo, anyone?) added to the console in the coming months.If you're considering the XBox One, it really is a great console.  It's rough around the edges in ways that I expect to be resolved over time.  It doesn't have a huge game library to offer out-of-the-gate, but thus far we do have a lot or greatness ahead of us.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

You need to kill the crime lords.  That's it.  There are no side quests.  There are some sandbox goodies, but even they are simply there to distract for a moment before engaging in the real task at hand.  Sure, I love extremely complex games that take a lot of mind power in order to unravel all of the mysteries contained within.  But I'm also a fan of some generic popcorn every once in a while, too.  And that's what this game is.  It's popcorn, but it's exciting popcorn.The game is extremely intuitive.  The world isn't that vast, but it's interesting nonetheless.  I feel that the smaller, but extremely detailed, world helped me to get to know the landmarks and neighborhoods much better.  I liked that.  And the play control is pretty smooth, too.  The missions, even though they are mostly the same, are pretty exciting.  In fact, I didn't have enough the first time through.  I had to increase the difficulty and play it again.But there are some flaws in this game.  For one thing, I wish that the Xbox controller would completely eliminate the ability to press in the toggle switches.  Nothing is more annoying than sneaking around an obstacle to get a good shot in the middle of an intense firefight only to accidentally jump high in the air as the opponent takes potshots at me.  This flaw is something that affected me numerous times while playing this game.  Being in a hurry to escape a situation that got out of control is completely ruined by accidental jumps because I can't avoid pushing in that stupid toggle when the action gets intense.  I also thought I'd add that there really is no reason to level up one's driving skill in this game.  The world is small enough so that exploring by foot isn't all that time consuming.  The vehicles are there for just a little eye candy, from the looks of it.Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.  It's not very often that I play a game where I want a sequel where they do nothing but change the plot and the map.  This is that game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2012"}

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

I play this game with my wife, 9yr old son, and 6 yr old daughter.  My 8 yr old nephew and 10 yr old niece also visit and play this game.What's great about this game is that there are only 5 buttons, the big red button and the 4 colored horizontal tab buttons, and no directional pad or stick, so it's easy for little kids to play the game.  The color coding of the buttons actually adds to the learning aspect of this game, since there are some stages where the screen shows a certain color, and you have to hit the corresponding colored button, so a very young kid can learn their primary colors this way (well, red, blue, green, yellow, and orange, anyway).  One nifty feature that isn't mentioned much is that the big red button lights up during some of the events, which is both useful and can add a bit excitement for the little kids.There's enough randomness to this game that luck can help the younger kids win some of the stages (and makes it easy for parents mask intentional mistakes to even out the score).Note that the 4 buzzers ARE connected via wire, and can get tangled up.  The upside to this is an integrated dummy cord for each buzzer, so you can't lose them!

She follows you around and doesn't do much but talk a lot and you have to throw her up to ledges or carry her across tough parts, but the team thing works well.  She goes one way around a door or obstacle and you have to find your own way across.  You should note: You can't fall.  Ever.  So really you just hit X a lot to jump from one ledge or hand-hold to the next.  But, this gives you the opportunity to look around at everything and it's all really cool.

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Not bad, but a bit of a letdown.","reviewText":"I finally got around to playing the first Bioshock just a few months ago, and it's quickly become one of my favorite games of this console generation. It had atmosphere, an interesting story, incredible art direction and character designs, and it was just plain fun to play. Even my daughter had fun watching me play it, and she fell in love with the Big Daddies and Little Sisters. So getting the sequel here was a given. The game started off just fine for me. While many have complained about the game taking place in Rapture again, I liked the environment enough to give it another go, especially as a different character. The first 3-4 hours were great, but I noticed that I wasn't having a whole lot of fun playing the game. Bioshock 2 has some of the things that I loved about the first one, and that's about it. The game's too easy and it's over before it goes anywhere great. Still, if you haven't played it yet, I recommend doing so. It's not a bad game...it just needed some more effort put into it.This time around, you get to play as Subject Delta, one of the first Big Daddies made. The opening of the game takes place just a little bit before the events of the first Bioshock. You're walking around with your Little Sister, Eleanor, who gets attacked by Splicers. Delta's able to take care of two of them without any effort, but the third throws a mind control Plasmid at him, stopping Delta in his tracks. A woman then steps into the picture. It's Sophia Lamb- Eleanor's mother. She orders Delta to take off his helmet and asks him -kindly- to kill himself. Delta wakes up 10 years later to find Rapture pretty much as we saw it in the first game, but a little worse. With Andrew Ryan dead, Sophia Lamb has taken over, and while she was hoping to take the city in a slightly different direction, it sure as heck didn't happen. Splicers have gotten stronger, new types have emerged, and Delta needs to find Eleanor. He has a bond with her, even after 10 years, and he'll do anything he can to get her back. Luckily he encounters a man named Sinclair who acts as Atlas did in the previous game. And something else that works in Delta's favor is that he isn't a regular person- he's a Big Daddy. Do you know what that means? You have a freakin' drill on your arm!I don't want to talk too much about what I liked and didn't like about the game's plot because I'd end up ruining a lot of it in the process. I'll just say that it's not a very strong one. Comparing it to the first game's would be a little unfair, and in rating it on its own, the plot is average. Sinclair is a great character to communicate with, but I never felt like he was there for more than guiding you. There are three points where you're given the option to spare a character that did you wrong a long time ago, or kill them, and regardless of what you do, it doesn't impact the game in any significant way. It's nice that they didn't do the usual forced good/evil thing here, but I would've liked more of a resolution. Subject Delta is a great character to play as though. Normally I never like a game's main character, especially when he's silent for the most part. I guess part of my connection to Delta is that I'm a parent, and I wanted him to get Eleanor back as soon as Sophia took her away. When you look at it, Bioshock 2 just may be the biggest, ugliest custody battle ever. Take that, Lifetime Original Movies.There's a lot I liked about Bioshock 2, as much as it sounds like I'm bashing the game. The first thing I loved that they did is being able to adopt Little Sisters. Instead of just saving or harvesting a Little Sister once you take care of her Big Daddy, you can adopt her. She can then guide you to \"angels\" and get more Adam for you. It's not that simple as walking up and letting her just go nuts with the syringe- choosing to gather Adam means that Splicers will be coming for you, and you'll have to protect the Little Sister and yourself until she's done. Fortunately, Delta has some really neat weaponry on his side. As with all the weapons in the last game, the new ones here have extra uses. Rosie's rivet gun has a handy trap bolt that lets you put up little proximity bolts. Shoot one into the floor, a wall or the ceiling, and a red laser will appear, showing its range. Once an enemy steps on the laser, the bolt goes off and takes them out. There's a ton of ammo for this to be found, and you can literally just set up dozens of trap bolts around the Little Sister, making her practically untouchable. Being able to use the drill is a blast too- it could be the most useful weapon in the game. It goes through fuel rather quickly, so using its regular melee attack to conserve fuel is a good alternative, and still reliable. Once I got the dash ability for the drill, all I'd do is use the dash attack because of how fun and effective it is. Splicers don't stand a chance against this sucker. Bioshock 2 also has a big new enemy with the Big Sisters. Sadly, some of the Little Sisters grew up to be corrupt thanks to Sophia, and you'll be killing them off now. These girls are agile and powerful, with fights against them lasting about as long as fights against Big Daddies in the first game. Audio diaries are back too, and a joy to listen to as usual, and the multiplayer was surprisingly fun when I wasn't being annihilated by people with maxed out characters. Seriously, let me play against other beginners! Oh, and the water pipe hacking 'mini-game' is completely gone. It was a time consuming 'mini-game', and has been replaced by a much faster process.Now for the cons. Where to start...hmm...well, how about how easy the game is? Supposedly, Splicers got stronger while Delta was out, which explains why he takes damage so easily, and why drill attacks aren't instant kills [like they SHOULD be]. However, ammo and first aid kits are so plentiful in Bioshock 2 that it's rare you'll die much. I don't know if it's just my experience with having played the first game recently, and going through it on the hardest difficulty setting while cleaning up trophies, but I couldn't have died more than 4 times while playing this game. It seemed like there was a First Aid Kit or health station every couple of steps. I know I just praised the trap bolts, but with how much ammo you can find and buy, it just plain makes combat unfair for the enemies! Delta can also get most of the same Plasmids that you got in the first game, though I think he should have been a little more limited. If not in how many he can get, maybe in how many he can carry at once. Fights against other Big Daddies are a pushover. Instead of that 'uh oh' feeling I used to get, now it was just 'oh, do I have to fight another one?' like it was just in my way or a chore. You even get a trophy for beating 3 Big Daddies without dying, as if it's a challenge. The new type, the Rumbler [who appears wayyyyy too much], will keep its distance while it launches missiles at you. Hey guess what! Telekinesis ensures you won't get a scratch during the fight. I almost want to say that all the powers and weapons you can get in the game give Bioshock 2 Fallout 3 syndrome. And by that I mean you'll be nearly invincible if you just upgrade a certain couple of abilities and weapons. Remember how in the first Bioshock you had a limited number of tonics that could be equipped? Well, wait 'til you see how many you can equip here. I laughed out loud as soon as I saw the tonic menu.My other big complaint is that Sophia Lamb never left an impression on me. Andrew Ryan was a presence. Frank Fontaine was a presence. Lamb? If it weren't for finding so many audio diaries, and her voice over the city's intercom now and then, I would have forgotten about her entirely. When I beat the game, I couldn't believe that was it. Even the events leading up to the ending were underwhelming. Finding out that I'd taken care of all the Little Sisters had me asking myself if this was really all there was to the game. It seemed like I only played for 8 or 10 hours! I also didn't care for the game's progression- how you can't go back to areas you'd been to previously. If you're a completist and want all the weapon upgrades, you better search every inch of the map before heading to the next area...not that you'll be needing them. The last thing that got me was how the graphics somehow don't look as good this time. I can't put my finger on it. If it's the textures, character models or maybe the animations, but there's something off in the visual department here.I still had fun playing the game, to an extent, and it was the story between Delta and Eleanor that kept me going. Bioshock 2 is worth your time, mainly because it can be completed so quickly, and there are worse games out there. I didn't go into it with high expectations, though it might seem like it with how much I liked the first installment. It just seems like a slightly rushed sequel that didn't have as much heart put into it. Hopefully Bioshock Infinite gets things back on track. I'll just miss burning an enemy and having a Little Sister say, \"Mmm! Marshmallows!\".","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2012"}

I don't even play a lot of dance games although some of my friends are really into them and so I've kind of been sucked into it because of that, but anyway, Just Create is great because the dance gamer folks finally get the chance to be LEADERS instead of FOLLOWERS and I think that's just great.

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Gangsters, zombies, and Burt Reynolds. Why not?","reviewText":"This was my first experience with the Saints Row series and, I have to say, the game makes an amazing first impression. You start off by taking part in an extravagant/hilarious bank heist that doesn't go according to plan, all the while signing autographs and wearing over-sized masks and voice modulators. When it's all over, you're kicked into a character creator that rivalsSKYRIMin terms of sheer depth. Choose your gender, race, appearance, and one of seven voices (three male, three female and \"zombie,\" regardless of gender) and you're sent flying headfirst, literally, into the city of Steelport.Once the story settles down, allowing you to start exploring and get your bearings, you find yourself in charge of one of the most popular and influential gangs in the world: The Third Street Saints. But in a new city, unestablished, with rival gangs swooping in to fill the power vacuum that you've briefly left open, you've gotta work your way up and fast. Also, you've gotta avenge a friend and fellow Saint. Also, the city is beginning to crack down on gang violence. Right out of the gate, you'll have a lot of things to sort out - which is half the fun.On the outside, the core of the game appears to heavily resemble the GTA series: pick up missions, steal cars, and just, in general, try to become public enemy number one in a sandbox-style city. But what I found remarkable was how quickly SAINTS ROW: THE THIRD shows that its playing to a different tune. Whereas the GTA series gradually minimized its over-the-topness in favor of a more realistic feel, SAINTS ROW gives you a jetbike, zombies, and a giant sex toy to add to your arsenal. In stark contrast to GTA, SR: THE THIRD is probably more comparable to JUST CAUSE 2, in that it's not afraid to sacrifice realism or, ah... decency in the name of fun.Going back to the character creator, which actually plays a big role in the game, I was initially overwhelmed by just how much the game allows you to tweak your character. To say nothing of how much you can alter your appearance (again, I can only compare it to SKYRIM), there are several different shops throughout the city that provide their own unique sets of outfits and accessories - in addition to the outfits you're rewarded throughout the game. You're encouraged by way of \"experience points\" to constantly change up your style and try new things. Not only that, but you're allowed to completely remake your character (voice, gender and all) pretty much whenever you feel like it. So the character that you start out with may have changed several times over by the time you make it to the end.And progressing through the game is actually just plain fun when you get right down to it. I don't think I've played a game this side of the FABLE series that has maintained such an extraordinary sense of humor. I was laughing constantly throughout the game at just how much the writers were willing the push the envelope, the voice actors' amazing timing and execution, and how self-aware the whole thing is. And I could go on about the voice actors, but to keep things brief: everyone does a tremendous job. Some of the best I've heard.When you're not playing through the main story and (hopefully) laughing yourself to death, there are a bunch of things to do on the side. Most are entertaining mini-games, such as one where you have to throw yourself into traffic as much as you can, but there are also some collectables as well as a property management system. To say its deep would be an exaggeration, but it gets the job done. Throughout the world, you'll find various businesses for sale, and purchasing them will add to your overall hourly income. You'll also come into possession of several hideouts that can be upgraded into skyscrapers, which will also add to your hourly income in addition to other little perks.While property management is a really nice touch and a welcome addition in a game like this, I really hate to say that it's been done better in other games. As soon as you buy your first few businesses, it becomes easy to mindlessly walk down the road and buy up whatever you see. And after a business is yours, you get a small discount and then everything's hands-off from there. I'd like for this system to get a little deeper in the next game, but it's a nice distraction as is.Other little things on the downside: While the city of Steelport definitely has a lot of character, it doesn't have much in the way of variety. It's really hard to tell two different parts of the city apart from each other, and has only a handful of places that are visually unique outside of the hideouts. Also, Steelport, in terms of size, seems on the smaller side. This may have been intentional, to ensure there wouldn't be an excess of empty space, but just seemed unusually easy to travel from one end of the city to the other. The way the city's set up just begs to draw comparisons to Liberty City, but, unfortunately, Liberty City it is not.It's also disappointing to hear that the customization options have been toned down since the last game. I'm eager to find out for myself, but the game did have a \"save it for the DLC\" feel to it. Even from the get-go, you're required to enter an \"Online Pass\" to allow you most of the multiplayer options, co-op included, which is just a terrible trend to follow, and a terrible thing to do to this game. So, if you're thinking about buying the game used or renting it, know that you'll either have to buy the game new or purchase the Online Pass separately if you want to play with friends.But these things don't overshadow the base game, though a shadow's definitely there.Essentially, the downside to the game isn't one big thing; it's mostly a collection of little things. SR: THE THIRD, in getting so much right, manages to completely overlook some smaller things. Being able to replay missions was one for me. Tutorial windows that pop up randomly throughout the game that can't be turned off. Some faulty collision detection meant the bottom of my character's coat always stuck out through the bottom of the cars I drove. The AI, while perfectly acceptable for most of the game, randomly took a nosedive in the IQ department, resulting in my companions getting me killed several times; it's hard to revive my homies before the timer runs out when they've just walked themselves right off a skyscraper.Basically, when Saint's Row tries to be Saint's Row, it pulls it off spectacularly. When it tries to be GTA, it's hard not to draw unfavorable comparisons.So where does that leave the game? Well, I still haven't finished GTA IV, since I would always get distracted trying to do things that SR: THE THIRD allows for and encourages. The story is very enjoyable, with characters throughout that are well-written and unusually hilarious. You will, in all likelihood, adopt the mantra, \"How the heck did I get myself into this?\" as you play through the game. Such as when you go to bring down a drug deal with a Reaper drone, or when you download your consciousness into a Tron-like cyberscape and do battle as a toilet.Yep.Everything this game does, it does in the name of fun. And this game is most definitely fun. If it has a flaw, it's that it got so close to perfection and came up only a few hairs short. With a little more polish, more customization, and less of this Online Pass crap, this really would've been a perfect package in my eyes. But as it stands, I can confidently say it was one of the best games to be released last year. I'll definitely be signing up for the fourth game, hoping they adopt a \"more of everything\" policy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

FF1 here is actually more fun to play because of the new features as well as the new side-quests. Buying and using magic and armor are also smoothed out, so what was frustrating about the FF1 game is lacking from here.In my opinion, FF2 was the worst game in the series due to its leveling up and stats, as well as some confusion about where to go next. It's not perfect in the GBA version, but it is a bit better. If you liked FF2, definitely try it. If not, you might still like the new/improved FF2. I know I did after playing it, it was much better.I also LOVE the bestiary available in both games and the stats that come with them. It was a great idea to add this feature!

This game revisits the same city as in GTA 3, so it's best to consider it an expansion pack.  A little late in the game, but still great.  Now I haven't touched GTA 3 in about 4 years, but I still remember the streets, the layouts, the tunnels and so forth.I personally found the last two games in the series extremely flawed.  Vice City was plagued by bad AI, claustrophobic streets, slow cars, and closed end missions.  San Andreas was extremely gimmicky, extremely unbalanced, and overall too large and unwieldy.  It's good to return back to the best GTA of the series.This is the easiest of all 4 PS2 GTA games.  It's also the most balanced one of them all.  The missions are smaller, with an increased reliance on driving and open endedness.  For example, there's a mission where you need to chase two vans after destroying a warehouse.  You could ride a motorcycle to and shoot the vans, try to ram them with a large car, or after some thought, destroy the vans before destroying the warehouse.This game lacks some of the useless bells and whistles of the previous games.  You won't get the flavor of the week actor voicing a clich&eacute;d grade B movie clip, nor will you get washed up 80s one hit wonders on your radio.  That's not a problem for me.This game is all about gameplay.  Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking.  Just fun.  Plain and simple.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros.

There is also the brand-new Adventure Mode, where you go through Mario-like mini-levels. During the courses in Adventure Mode, you occasionally reach an area where you have to fight someone. It's pretty cool. There are also some new items. Check out the 100-man Melee for a challenge!

I was drawn in by the sharp writing, engaging characters, and intriguing plot, so I tried to endure the game's poorly conceived mechanics, uninspired design, and numerous glitches, waiting until the plot started getting good, but I finally just ran out of patience.The game's mechanics are plain and lacking: I can't quite single out one thing but there's a general lack of polish overall (and I don't mean just graphics).  The level design is also inflexible: the mission areas are linear, and often there is only one \"right\" way to accomplish an objective (i.e. I chose to be a stealthy agent only to discover the game often forces me to take a run-and-gun approach).  Then there are the odd design choices that make gameplay more cumbersome than necessary - for example, there is no \"shooting from the hip\" like in other shooting games (i.e. Red Dead Redemption, Borderlands, Fallout 3, etc.); you have to press and hold an \"aim\" button to bring up a targeting reticule.  I didn't realize how much I had come to rely on that reticule always being onscreen until it was taken away from me.  Also, AP has something that no gamer in the world likes: escort/protect missions.  And it doesn't help that my ally frequently stands out in the open, letting enemies get free shots.As far as the glitches go, most of them occur when I'm in cover.  I once got \"stuck\" to the wall I was covering behind and I could not leave the wall no matter what I tried; I had to reload the most recent checkpoint, which was a long while ago, making me replay a large chunk of the level.  Another bug hides the targeting reticule - yes, even when I hold down the aim button.  I'd be in cover, use up a whole clip, reload, then hold the aim button to bring up the reticule only to have nothing happen.  To fix this, I have to leave cover and then return.  During a tense firefight, this glitch totally ruins my immersion in the game, not to mention the momentary interruption is just long enough for enemies to flank me.  And speaking of reloading weapons: sometimes I can't reload my gun while I'm in cover - yes, another bug - and when this happens, I have to leave cover and expose myself to enemy fire, quickly reload, then re-enter cover.  Oh yes, let's not forget that sometimes enemies can see me through walls.  And no, they were NOT wearing infrared goggles.It's clear that Obsidian has some great writers because they consistently produce great scripts and characters, but their games always seem to be filled with glitches.  While Alpha Protocol certainly delivers in the storyline department, I was hoping for more in gameplay - much, much more.*****Edit, April 2011:  So it's been a loooong time, and something in me convinced me to re-rent this game through GameFly, this time for the Xbox 360 (my initial experience with this game was on the PS3).  Alpha Protocol seems to have been developed with the 360 in mind because almost all of the bugs I described above are refreshingly lacking in the 360 version.  This time, I was able to finish the game, allowing me to fully explore the story to its conclusion.  Damn good writing, damn good characters.  I give the 360 version of this game 4 stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2010"}

Wii U players will be able to enjoy the hunt with Nintendo 3DS players via a local wireless connection. Gamers that own both a Wii U and Nintendo 3DS can take advantage of the inter compatibility of save data between the two consoles, taking the hunt from the living room wherever they go.","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Is Monster Hunter the game for you?","reviewText":"Monster Hunter 3 ultimate... I could honestly go on for hours about this game and how much I Enjoy it. So I'm going to try to keep it...shortish. This is also not my best review ever.Where to begin... I am going to write this review for new players because If you like Monster Hunter at all chances are you already own this title or plan to get it anyway.For New Players:What is Monster Hunter: Simple answer, long explanation... Monster Hunter is a game where you play the role of a hunter who... wait for it... Hunts Monsters! That is the basic premise of the game anyway. So like I said simple answer but there is more to it. The game is actually more about how you hunt them. Let me say this is not a hack and slash dance all over the place quickly destroying everything in sight game. This is more of a game of patience, timing, and preparing. You don't just go into a fight and attack hoping to kill it quickly, some monsters take upwards of thirty minutes to kill while others only take 5 minutes, it all depends on what monster you are hunting. You also don't want to go into a fight without healing items and food or you will run out of stamina and be unable to dodge.Weapons: There are 12 different weapon types to choose from and each has VERY different controls. From the fast but weaker Sword and shield to the slow but powerful Greatsword, to the middle of the road switch axe. Each weapon has its own strategies, weaknesses and strengths. For Instance while the Great Sword is slow, it deals heavy damage on each hit, and has the advantage of being able to block while the switch axe is capable of strong, quicker hits. It cannot block and leaves you open for attack on occasion. There are also ranged weapons such as the bowgun or bow that hunters can use. You are also not limited to one type you can use them all, however you can only equip one on a given hunt you can't switch out mid hunt.Hunting: Almost all of the quests revolve around hunting a big monster; from the Great Jaggi (think a big Raptor) to a Rathalos (Dragon) to the Gigginox (Weird creepy leach poison thingy). The monsters all have a life of their own and behave very differently. The idea of the game is to while fighting a monster, you study it's moves, learn it's attack patterns and animations, learn where the safe place is and when to attack it's weak spot. All monsters have an enrage mode, where they become faster and more dangerous this is denoted by them usually breathing steam or other effects on the monster. You can risk attacking, but you will also be open to more damage during that time. The real skill of the game is remembering how a monster acts, and when to attack and when to run like hell. There are something like 50 big monsters to hunt, which means 50+ Suits of armor (explained below), combine this with 3 different levels of difficulty makes about 150 different suits of armor.Powering up: The game doesn't have levels, it doesn't have stat's like Str, Dex, Int, etc... it doesn't have anything along those lines. Your power is derived from three things.1. Weapons - As you start to kill monsters you carve them and gain monster items. For instance killing a Great Jaggi gives you Great Jaggi Hides, Scales, and Claws. You use those pieces of the monsters to craft weapons and armor. You will also need ore and minerals you can get from mining and gathering.2. Armor - Same with weapons you will need monster pieces to make a set of armor. Every monster in the game (And I mean every) has an armor set. There are HUNDREDS of pieces of armor to collect and they all look like the monster you killed it's amazing how much detail and time they put in the armor. Each piece of armor has a defense value, as well as certain abilities. The Jaggi armor for instance increases attack and negates some stun effects, while make you more susceptible to fire attacks. Another Armor set gives much better defense, but lowers attack. They are all different and you will have to fight the same monster over and over again to get the pieces needed, sometimes a dozen times, and that can be a bit of a drawback for anyone who doesn't like a bit of grind. In fact it can be downright annoying trying to get that ONE item you need to create that final piece of armor. But to some, that's the fun of the game3. Skill - It's rare that power comes from skill, but the more times you fight a monster the more you will learn and memorize its abilities. The faster you will be able to kill it and get loot. When I started it used to take me 15-20 minutes to kill a rathian... with the same weapons and armor it now takes me 10.Story: if you're playing the game for story, I have a simple solution. Don't. The story is barely existent, it is not the point of the game, and it's not even told very well. The story is there just to have a reason for you to fight certain monsters, other than that you can ignore it.Online: the game is playable online, and many argue it's the only way to play. You can join up with up to three other hunters on the Wii U or the 3DS (they are cross compatible) and hunt monsters together with friends or strangers. The community is often nice though there are some elitists that can ruin your day, just shrug them off and find a better group of folks to play with there are plenty of rooms where experienced hunters will help newer ones. After all we WANT more people to play the game... so Capcom will give us more of them.  Personally I don't play online in the beginning, I like to get my bearings first in the single player so I'm more prepared for online, but not everyone does that and you don't really have to. I would suggest at least learning the basics though. Once you can fight and kill a Barroth on your own you are about ready for online.Controls: You can use the Gamepad, the Classic Controller Pro (from the Wii) or the Classic Controller U. Personally I prefer the gamepad, it allows you to use the touchscreen for item usage, as well as display the map and various other things and you can customize it to your liking. If you don't like that the Classic Controller Pro is also a good option as it offers a normal controller feel, it is worth noting that even when using the CCP or CCU, you can have the gamepad be your side with the touch screen part still enabled.Everything Else: The game has Hunting, Gathering, Combining of items, really amazing looking creatures, awesome armor and weapons from gathering monster materials, and beautiful scenery (some will dispute that). It's REALLY hard to tell if you will like the game because it's not a game that has a middle of the road feeling. You either love it or hate it and it's not like many other games out there. It is difficult, but not impossible.I am a monster Hunter fan, and have been since I played Tri. To me this game is perfect in almost every way, but I know for a fact it is not for everyone. If you have doubts give the demo a try it gives you a feel for the combat of every weapon. But keep in mind the demo is only  of the game.Things it has:Awesome monstersCool armor and weaponsInteresting GameplayBeautiful ScenerySilly CharactersThings it doesn't have:This is not a free exploration sandbox world. These are set maps.Not an easy hack n slash game, you need to be patient and learn your weapons as well as the monsters your fightingA good story... not that it needs it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2013"}

Granted, the game borrows a few elements from it's predessor, but what really sets it apart is it's Hollywood-style writing and great voice acting. On it's surface, the story is no different from any other mob movie.  Vito Scaletti has just returned from his service in WWII after being wounded.  He comes back to a life of debt and low-paying job prospects when his childhood friend, Joe recruits him into a life of crime.  Along the way, loyalties are tested, allegiances are formed and broken, and tragedy strikes.  Despite the occasional cliche, I was fully engrossed in Mafia 2's story.  The writing here is top notch.  The voice acting rivals any Hollywood movie and really brings the characters to life.  I can't praise the writer and actors enough.  So much so that I was able to overlook some fundamental flaws in the game.The driving missions can be tedious and wonky.  The 40's and 50's era cars are as manueverable as a yacht in a pond.  A middle section of the game set in a prison was a wasted opportunity.  Instead, the player is treated into these fight club missions that had the character fight one goon after another in hand to hand combat.  Gun fights can be frustrating since enemies can be bullet sponges.  Cover shooting is inconsistent as you can still be killed even if firing behind a stone pillar.Regardless, I was fully engrossed in the tale of Vito Scaletti.  There wasn't a moment when I was playing the game, that I didn't have a burning desire to know what happens next.  Yes, the game is linear, but the true star of Mafia 2 is it's story.  You can definately tell the care and detail put into it from it's cinematic cut scenes and excellent character designs.  I can't recommend this game enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2010"}

Didn't like that control scheme so I changed it to the side (but forgot to remove the nunchuck). Needless to say that for a while I had a tough time that way because it's not supposed to be played like that and pressing left will have you going nowhere while up and down will have you do the movement. It wasn't until I played it sideways without the nunchuck that I really started to like this game. *face palm* Anyway, I got it with my red Wii this Christmas along with Wii sports and now I am deciding I won't sell it.

The power ups are some of the best that Mario has had (I haven't finished Galaxy nor played Galaxy 2), the graphics are pretty nice, the sound is pretty good (especially the third world) and this game is all-around fun. More fun than the DS version which was fun in itself.The worlds themselves don't present too much challenge so far though and the bosses are pretty much a joke like in the DS version. I miss those days of the more fun, creative boss battles like in Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World. Hell, even Super Mario 64 had funner bosses. But they are OK here. Just too easy.I find that this game is fun enough to finish at least one play through though and I've changed my mind about wanting to sell it. Besides, I have yet to play the fun multiplayer so I'm sticking to this game.+Colorful+Easy controls without nunchuck+Pleasant graphics+Decent soundtrack which is improved over the DS version's minimalist music+Fun+Up to 4-player game option+You can be a Toad if you play 3rd or 4th player!+Presents a decent challenge if you want to collect every star coin and unlock everything+Koopa Kids make their return!+Doomships are back!+Penguin suit is introduced FTW!

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"michael jordan \"sucks\"","summary":"It's the best and the worst!","reviewText":"This is the best system ever created with the worst games ever created. It is appalling to me that all nintendo wants to do is cater to children. I mean seriously this system has the most potential of any system ever and all they can do is pump more and more mediocre titles on the market. Everything people are saying about the system having to many of the same games and games rehashed from past systems are true statements and will ultimately be the downfall of Nintendo Wii. I'm not even into graphics that much so really I can understand why they did not follow in line with PS3 and Xbox in that category, however, at least the other two companies are trying to create news game franchises. No more heroes is for the wii and I have to admit it is probably in my top 5 favorite games of all time. It is unique in almost every conceivable way, but is this system going to be a one hit wonder in mature games as well as unique and original titles, because it certainly seems that way as of right now! Thats not to say that they can't recover but the system has been out for going on two years now and I've only seen small improvements. Basically if they keep falling behind in the good games race this will essentially be another sega dreamcast. OMG, I really just said that, but I swear to the video game gods it is true. Please Nintendo do something, because I really do not want Xbox to take over the gaming community because we all know that xbox is out for the money and only the money. They do not care about their customers, however I do feel that nintendo cares and would replace anything that tears up within a reasonable amount of time. So, overall the system is the best as far durability and originality, but with increasingly bad games being put on the market I just don't know if it will have a legacy like the nes or even the nintendo 64. Because of the aforementioned I can not recommend this system as of right now, but maybe in the future after you can see what games are available.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000IMWK2G","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Very Good Contoller","reviewText":"The Wii Controller is a very fun, very interesting and smart new controller for our generation. The consept behind it is that tha controller is supposed to be an extension of your body, so where ever you move the controller the game your playing will react to those movements(depending on the games your playing like Wii Sports and Legend of Zelda). While it is fun there are some things that Nintendo could have done better. For Example - The Wii controller is a little too sensative sometimes(when you play Tennis on Wii sports, sometimes I try not to move or else I will hit the ball too soon or too late). The Wii Controller runs on Batteries just like The Xbox 360 controller, and could've been like the PS3 controller with a recharchable controller. The fact that most games have to use the detachable Nunchuck attachment, it is really f***in retarted that they would sell it seperatley, and the price of both the Wii controller and the Nunchuck is about the price of a Next-Gen game ($60.00 plus tax) which is not that bad but it is a hassel especially that the Wii is meant to have 4 controllers so that would cost about as much as $200.00. The sound that is built into the controller is cool, but I can't lower the volume on it which is annoying especially if its night time and trying not to wake the people around me that are trying to sleep(if you can someone tell me) and it sounds like a cheap toy. And the last thing is that when you have to turn the controller to its side to play some games it is a lil uncomfortable, it doesn't feel right. Still I like the new concept over the casual game controllers But they could've done a lil better on it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2007"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"A couple of shortfalls.","reviewText":"I purchased this primarily for the blu-ray player.  For me the game functionality was secondary.  That being said, there are a couple of shortfalls with this system.First of all there are no IR inputs, so my Logitech Harmony won't work with blu-ray or standard DVD playback.  That is a huge shortcoming for me since 80% of the use of this system will be with movies rather than games.  The only way I can have this system work with my Harmony remote is if I purchase a $30 third party remote.  Since a small factor in my decision to finally purchase this system is that things like wireless connectivity and online play are standard, this is a disappointment.  Anyone who is a 360 owner can tell you how old it gets being nickel and dimed by Microsoft for everything that isn't included in the standard system.Second of all, what is with the huge load times?  I purchased Gran Turismo 5 with the system and before I could even start playing a game I had to load an update to the system itself and then an update to the game.  I'm aware of the fact that the 360 sometimes requires updates, but they hardly seem as long as the ones I had to endure before I could play GT5:P.Third, why doesn't this come standard with the dual shock controller?  There shouldn't be a need to elaborate on that point.Overall this system is great and performs as expected, but there are a couple shortfalls that the fanboys fail to mention while they're talking up Sony.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

This is simply the best game I've played in 30 years of gaming! It's the most interesting, addicting, open, game out there! I loved AC1, and this game improves on that immensely. It's taken me about 40 hours or so to get every little thing in the game- all missions, side missions, treasures, etc. You definitely get your money's worth, and then some. I love that it's single player only. All the other games feel they have to have a multiplayer component, but for die hard old school gamers, a great single player game is fantastic! This goes right up there, and surpasses, my all-time favorite games- Bioshock, GTA series, and Prototype. It mixes the best of many gaming types, and it's not as lame as the RPG games. The attention to detail in this game is amazing. Just the citizens having conversations among themselves, guards chasing you up ladders- and using the same other means of movement you do. That is really unique in this game. Now it's still relatively easy to win every battle with guards, etc., but the puzzles in the tombs, stealth missions, etc. are quite challenging. I also like that you don't have to do everything in a single order. The game develops as you choose where to go and what to do for the most part.

Catherine is simple and unique.Gameplay:  5/5Prior to buying this game I read that it was very difficult.  After completion of the game I found myself disappointed in the challenge.  Sure I got frustrated and died often, but over all I had a stead pace through the game and rarely felt challenged.  Otherwise this game was quite a lot of fun.  The game does a good job of not being repetitive with the puzzles by spicing things up in the story in between the puzzle levels.Controls:  4/5At first the controls were a bit hard to get my head around but after awhile they become second nature.  In the beginning you may find yourself dying a few times because of inexperience with the controls.Graphics:  5/5I've got no complaints here.  The graphics are a good step up from the Persona 3 & 4 games.Sound:  4/5No complaints here either.  The composer for this game is quite talented and always tends to amaze.Story:  4/5I've had better.  The story has some twist and some surprises but the story is pretty far from epic.  I have to give lots of credit to the length of the story mode though (about ten hours).  Normally I would say 10 hours is short for a game, but 10 hours is perfect for Catherine.  Puzzles games tend to get repetitive after awhile.  10 hours is a perfect amount of time as to where I was just starting to get burnt out as the game ended.Price:  3/5The makers of this game put tons of work into it.  You can tell they cared about the quality of the game.  Unfortunately I put a lot of work into getting my money.  If I could go back I'd still pay retail price, but be warned I doubt the average gamer would agree.  The game has a lot of extras but there is only so much you can do with the block climbing puzzle.

{"product_name":"B000WINB56","description":"","reviewerName":"Bruce Aguilar","summary":"Endless Possibilities","reviewText":"Throughout gaming history most every game has focused on some form of the following, getting the high score, collecting the most items or finishing the story of the game.  ENDLESS OCEAN is a game that bucks that trend and instead asks you to play for no other reason than to have fun.  That alone will cause many gamers to run for the hills screaming that the game is boring, but it isn't as long as you accept the game for what it is and not wish it to be like everything else.At the beginning of the game you can choose to be a male or female diver and you play the game diving into the ocean looking for new and exotic life as well as exploring caves and such.  There are no time limits or goals, though you can choose to do the menial tasks your ships owner asks of you there is no reward or penalty for doing so.  You are also encouraged to gather information on the different forms of life you encounter and take pictures of them.  But the main point is to explore just for the fun of it and that's what I see as the genius of this game.With such an esoteric reason for playing there's got to be something to keep the more traditional gamer entertained and that's where the graphics come into play.  Playing this game it's very easy to get lost in the world created because everything is so life-like and beautiful.  From enormous whales and tiny schools of fish to seaweed swaying in the water, the graphics really impress.  This is a game to show off how cool games can look on Wii.  That is as long as you stay in the water.  Things get more blocky and movements are noticeably jerky whenever you board your ship to save your game, receive instruction and talk to your ship mate.As is typical for Wii, controls are easy to learn and intuitive.  Want to swim left?  Simply point the controller to the left hand side of the screen.  What could be easier than that?  The simple controls and laid back game play make this a game that is perfect for every member of the family.Though it won't appeal to every gamer, this is a game that anyone with a sense of adventure and love of discovery will be completely enthralled by.  Those looking for new kinds of games to play need look no further than ENDLESS OCEAN.

{"product_name":"B002I0GKA4","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Too Expensive For What It Is","reviewText":"The Good:+It Can Be Fun to Play+It has impressive visualsThe Bad:-It is simply too expensive for what is basically an expanded mini-game-Though pretty, there are slight technical issues with the graphics-Far too short-The maps are tiny-There is only one slot to save your data and it can't be resetEveryone remembers the Mercenaries Mini-Game from Resident Evil 4 and 5.  The mini game was surprisingly addictive and fun. This experience has now been scaled down to the 3DS.  And while the mini-game in and of itself is fun and all... it is hard to justify a 40 dollar price tag.  You're paying an unusual amount of money for what basically amounts to an expanded mini-game, and CAPCOM lets you know it.  Not only are you paying a lot for a mini-game expansion, but CAPCOM didn't feel the need to really add anything to it.  It's arcade style all the way.  Basically they took the mini-game, made it longer and that's about it.There is no story to speak of in Resident Evil: The Mercenaries.  I'm pretty sure no one will get up in arms over this, however, as the mini-game included in the two Resident Evil game's it's based off of didn't feature a story either.  It was mostly laying on the lam for as long as you could, scoring as many points as you could until the time ran out... while also being able to get bonuses to expand your time, racking up combos to increase your score and taking on some serious enemies.  The experience here is more or less the same as what you got on the mini-game included with Resident Evil 4 and 5.  Case in point, it's very difficult to tell anyone to buy it for the list price.Things get no better when you realize that the first few missions are mostly just tutorial missions.  The first mission, for example, is literally just you running from one marker to the next until you get to the end.  Clearly this is for those who are new, but perhaps a training mode would've better served for something like this.  Once you get beyond this it is more or less the same experience you had with Resident Evil 4 and 5.  The environments are ripped straight from those games.  They're also just as small.  Considering how I'm supposed to view this as a full fledged game and not just a mini game, perhaps some of the maps could've been bigger or expanded upon.There are about eight characters to play as in The Mercenaries.  Chris and Jill show up.  But so does Claire, Hunk, Jack Krauser, Wesker, and Barry.  Strangely missing from the roster is Leon S. Kennedy.  To make a mercenaries game and stick locations from Resident Evil 4 into it and not include Leon seems strange.  Especially because he was one of the first characters you could play as in the Mercenaries mode.  At least you get characters such as Claire and Barry who haven't been featured in Resident Evil for quite some time (Barry in particular hasn't seen much of any screen time since the series beginning), but it's a shame one of most popular characters was left out entirely.There isn't much of a reason to actually spend so much money on this game.  It doesn't add enough to the gameplay.  There are tons of missions presented in the chapter like fashion as Resident Evil 4 and 5 (Chapter 1-1, 1-2, etc.) but the experience is apt to be rather quick.  The idea, of course, is that you're supposed to replay through the same levels trying to get get better scores and rankings.  There are also some gameplay mechanics that have been added.  For example, you can assign certain abilities to characters to increase the amount of damage they do to enemies or increase your resistance to attacks.  The game isn't long and unless you're certain you're going to go back and beat your score countless times then there's not much of a need to really plop down money for it when the Mercenaries extra on the console version is just as likely to satisfy.The graphics are quite impressive.  The game looks absolutely amazing.  Definitely something that shows us what the 3DS can do.  It looks very similar to it's older brothers on the consoles.  There are a couple of technical issues though. There are frame rate dips from time to time and moments where enemies might disappear and reappear... some also just look plain ugly in the distance, and yet quite pretty up close.  It doesn't destroy the game, but it's kind of sad that the developers couldn't do something about it.  So it's a pretty game, but there are a couple of hiccups.  If more 3DS games could muster the same gusto but keep the technical issues down you're definitely seeing some potential here.CAPCOM made the unfortunate decision of only giving you one save slot and making sure that the save data could not be reset.  This means that for those who buy the game used they can't reset the data to try and unlock everything on their own.  I can understand CAPCOM not wanting to lose profits due to used sales... but it's not exactly the fault of the consumer that it happens.  The consumer isn't keeping revenue from CAPCOM, the used Game Vendors are by not splitting their profits.  Regardless of how you feel about that issue one thing holds true: Punishing the consumer is a bad idea--it often doesn't work.  Especially those who have remained loyal to CAPCOM and have invested in several of their projects by buying their games brand new in order to help further future products.Perhaps some of you are not particularly going to care about CAPCOM doing this, but consider that if this becomes standard practice and more companies begin doing this in the industry, it could eventually be a problem.  Imagine if you couldn't start a new game to experience the story of one of your favorite RPGs?  Or if you borrowed a game from a friend and couldn't start a game of your own?  In the long run it's a bad idea.  It's even worse when you consider that video games typically stop being manufactured at some point.  Which means that buying them used eventually becomes the easiest (sometimes only) way to get a hold of older games.  It doesn't seem like a big deal now, but consider that even The Mercenaries will go out of print and someone will have to settle for a used copy just to play it.CAPCOM has since denied that it was actually to keep from selling to used Vendors, but was actually designed to keep the Arcade tone of the game in tact.  Whether or not that's true, the damage is already done.  Some used vendors are already either refusing to take the game, or offering far less for it because of the save data issue.  Regardless of CAPCOM's intentions, many used Vendors already see it as something that devalues the game.But putting that aside, even if the save data issue didn't persist, Resident Evil Mercenaries 3D is not too particularly worthwhile as it is.  It can be fun, but it's hard to get beyond the fact that you'd get this same experience from the Mercenaries mini-game in Resident Evil 4 and 5 (both of which come at a cheaper price).  The biggest issue isn't necessarily the save data; it's the enormous price for the expansion of a mini-game in conjunction to that.  If they'd added more it might be worth more consideration.  But as it stands, there isn't enough bang for your buck.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"Ka-Blam Baby!","reviewText":"I love this game.  There, had to be said.  Love it.  Love it. Love it.  I am completley blown away at the huge effort and accomplishment that Square has put into this game.  The techno-wizards have surpassed themselves once again.  I think that whenever the industry sets a new standard, Square is the one company that they turn to.  They certainly &quot;toe&quot; the line on this one.I have read other reviews that take off points for no world map, no manual camera control, the sphere grid and the large amount of CG sequences.  I think that these things only add to the story and the level of enjoyment that one can get from this game.  I am pleased with the final product and am happy with the gameplay and story and graphics.Square manages to innovate and change with the times, while still maintaining a level of sameness and consistency.  While the new systems seem to be confusing at first, they are easily mastered and well executed.  I havent had to read the instruction book one time while playing this game.I am in awe of the story and the movie elements that are employed in the making of this product.  I am glad that square has made an &quot;interactive movie&quot; as some are prone to calling it.  I play games for the story and fun factor.  This game has a great story and an awesome level of fun.Some have criticized Square for not making this game a &quot;fantasy&quot; game with dragons and goblins and wizards.  Big deal.  FF7 and FF8 were futuristic and technological in their settings.  FF9 went back to the more traditional roots of fantasy and sorcery and dungon-esqe environments.  FF10 has taken another turn.  Each of these games is fun, and each is a true marvel in and of itself.  Who cares if the title says &quot;Fantasy&quot; or not.  This series is the best selling game series of all time.  There must be a reason for this.The true ability of a game to captivate and enthrall an audience does not lie in its graphics or setting or voice-acting.  It lies in the story and gameplay...this game has both at an awesome 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Get this game...spent many hours if enjoyment unlocking its secrets and hidden quests.  You won't be dissapointed...I wasn't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2002"}

Originally released in Japan the series, and DDR Max in particular, were smash hits. they were destined to arrive in the U.S. The game did just that. Released by Konami, the makers of the awesome Metal Gear Solid 2, DDR(Dance Dance Revolution) found its way to greatness, simply because it revolutionized gaming and the way games were played. The way all of the games work is you pick up a dance mat from a retailer, hook in the game, and start dancing to arrows flashing across the screen. All of this may sound boring. Think again. The greatest feature of DDR Max is that it never gets boring in any way. Song after song you can dance to, and no matter how good you are, you can never really &quot;master&quot; the game and become a superb dancer. With DDR Max, there are great songs from artists such as Darude and Aurora, and hip, new, colorful graphics. These features draw you in and make you want to play more and more and never stop. With this game, forget about sitting on the couch and hitting a few buttons. You are actually forced to really participate in this game title! The game was so popular, it is now a street sport in the neon-lit streets of Tokyo, Japan. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game with two dance mats from Mad Catz and start playing. Dance, dance, dance. It's DDR! My Rating-8.9!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2003"}

Skeptical at first due to my dissapointment with NFL 2K2, i had purchased the last two Maddens because of that. For $20, and all the hype this game was getting I couldn't pass it up.The game presentation is outstanding. Boomer does a terrific job in pregame, halftime, and postgame shows. The announcing during the game was impressive. I'll have to say that I don't think I'll be muting the announcing in this game, as I have with previous Madden games due to them being so predictable and boring.Franchise mode gets incrediably deep. You can hold team meetings, schedule workouts, plan diets, study film, etc. You name it you can do it to prepare for the next game. This, however, when this option is turned on can get tedious, long and drawn out at times. However, it really shows you the aspect of what goes on during off field time. Trading, signing gets incrediably detailed with your contracts being very detailed. The only thing I found lacking in the franchise area other than the drawn out weekly preparations, was that I could not be named head coach. I liked in Madden where you could be the coach of your football team, but apparently it is not possible in 2K5 when not in coach mode (I haven't played the game in coach mode yet, so maybe you can there, but I don't know).Play control is rock solid, as you have much control over your player and players. A neet feature I have enjoyed is being able to not only change the DB coverages, but I can individually change one DB in tight, and another to be off a little bit. Player movement is a little questionable as I find the players in Madden to move a little more realistically in that aspect. It was also very easy to simply pick up and play, and the learning curve is very low. If you do want a challenge, I highly suggest setting the difficultly levels to All Pro and tweeking with the AI a bit. It can be a bit too easy at times to run the ball. I know it has been said that issue has been fixed, but I've been able to get 100 yards plus per game with Curtis Martin from the NY Jets on All Pro ... easy. You do the math. This can be tweeked, however, along with many other AI aspects of the game. Defense never fails to please compared to Madden. Close, low scoring games are very common in 2K5 as apposed to 40+ point games I'd have in Madden 2004 consistantly.I've never been too concerned about a game's graphics as I suppose it's because I grew up in the age of Intellivision, Atari, and early Nintendo, but I can say I was very impressed with the amount of detail that went into this game. Instead of random players on the sidelines, you have actual players off of your roster cheering or getting frustrated on the sidelines, as apposed to something that always aggrivated me about Madden football, which was the random no name players that were placed on the sidelines. Players make great realistic facial expressions, jerseys get dirty later into the game, the field gets mighty torn up into the forth quarter, and weather effects are outstanding.The Crib is just stupid. Sorry, but that's all I have to say about that.Anyway, there is so much to this game it really is insane as to what the price is. However, if ESPN Videogames really wanted to off Madden as the superior football franchise this definately could be the way to do it if nothing else impresses you about this game. All in all, for $20 and the amount of stuff that's jam packed into this game makes it a great buy. Is 2K5 better than Madden? As apposed to Madden 2004 I think so. We'll just have to wait and see about Madden 2005.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2004"}

I think that's led to a lot of disappointment with the game. The game certainly isn't as good asSuper MetroidorMetroid Prime- not even close. With that said,Metroid: Other Mis a pretty fun game on its own right.First the good. The play controls are surprisingly smooth - even the much-maligned switch to first-person mode. The graphics are beautiful - some of the most beautiful I've seen for any Nintendo game. The cutscenes look like Pixar animation. I'll agree with the comments that this isn't as much of a \"puzzle\" game as the other Metroid games and doesn't really lend itself to exploration, but it has its moments. And the game gets better as you play through, with special treats for Metroid fans (no spoilers, but let's just say a few old friends return). Replaying the game on Hard Mode is a challenge but even more fun than the initial run-through.Now, for the bad. I personally don't think much of using the Wii remote only. Sakamoto, the game's designer, thought this would make the game more accessible and precise, but I don't think it particularly helps. In fact, I much prefer using the nunchuck as inThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princessto move your character around in a 3-D space.My biggest disappointment however is the music. It's not bad, but it's generally just absent. In many parts of the game, all you can hear is silence. This is a travesty for the Metroid series, which is known for having some of the best music of any video game. Music in the other games really set the ambience for different environments. ForMetroid: Other M, it's barely noticeable.Overall, I think this game deserves at least 4.5 stars. I suspect that if this had been any other series, more reviewers would have given it higher scores and taken the game as is. It might be a disappointment relative to the rest of the Metroid franchise, but I think on its own it stands well enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2010"}

Sturgeon","summary":"Rent it. Too controversial to buy.","reviewText":"I'm kind of in a weird position here. I really love this game, but when I talk about it to most people, I find that I'm talking a lot about the negatives. That's really because in spite of how much I love it, there are a few things that kind of stick in my craw.1. Samus's reaction to Ridley. Yeah, I know, in the manga she's shown to suffer from PTSD. But considering that I'd never even heard of this manga until the debates started raging over this game...you know what? For that matter, show of hands, how many people who live in the United States even knew there was a manga? Of those, who knows of an easy way for the average US consumer to get this manga that establishes Samus' PTSD? Given the rarity of this, you can see why it was odd for Americans (I don't know about other countries exposure to this manga) to see Samus completely break down at the sight of Ridley, especially when she's beaten him 5 times before.2. Not being authorised to use the Varia suit until already having gone halfway through a really hot place that saps her strength just by being there. Big eye roll moment there.3. The switch to 3rd person, and having to stand still in 3rd person, is an awkward mechanic that I didn't really get used to until really late in the game. It also hurts during boss battles when things are already frantic and you're taking hits because you have to stand still while doing things in 3rd person.But you know what, other than those three points, I love this game. I really love it.1. The graphics are the best I've personally seen on the Wii, bar none.2. We're finally back to 3rd person platforming. As much as I love the Prime games, I am so glad to be back to 3rd person.3. Voice acting. Now, I wouldn't want to hear voice acting in Zelda. Link's just too well known for never talking. But in Metroid, it really fits. I'm glad they're fitting it in now. As far as people saying it's bad voice acting? I've heard faaaar worse in games and cartoons that no one seems to complain about.4. Story content. Even though the whole thing with Samus having PTSD threw me, and while I didn't like her continuously seeking Adam's approval like a whipped little whelp of a pup, there were some moments in this game that were actually pretty good. Adam's heroic sacrifice is one moment where I saw Samus' emotions as completely justified. The guy was a father figure to her. I can see her reeeeeally not wanting him to die.5. Theatre to rewatch game scenes. Sure it's only unlocked after you beat the game. I can deal with that. But once you can access it, it's truly like watching Other M the movie.I could continue gushing about this game. Sure I have some gripes about it. But over all, I'm really happy with it.Final note. This game is short. I beat it within a week. This coupled with the obvious \"love it or hate it\" controversy that seems to surround this game, I really have to advise a rental before buying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

The controls are intuitive and easy to pick up, and they are greatly used in the dogfights and the boss fights.  The boss fights are exceptionally creative, and they both require strategy, pure firepower, and air prowess.  The first three boss fights are mechanized bosses, but they do have weak points that can be exploited and must be destroyed quickly.  The last boss, however, is reminiscent of Ace Combat 4's final boss, but unlike Ace Combat's, this boss is moving and has varied exposed centres that must be destroyed within a few minutes (five minutes or so between major targets).  Lastly, the graphics is commendable, exceeding Ace Combat's in its interactivity and simulated realism (e.g., water effects as you skim the ocean water).  The exploding derigibles are also pretty cool, especially the mechanised tessla derigibles.  The only con is perhaps the tunnel mission for the Lost City.  More than half the time I was lost since there was no map or even some type of assistance.  The multiplayer is exceptional, but I do like it on Live.  Overall, this game is one of the best first party XBox games to date (luckily, no more Katujo Chojin and other miserable titles of the past).

I mean, \"game\"  : P","reviewText":"Yeah, \"lame\" is definitely the word I would use to describe the overall \"game\" disc in WiiPlay. The cow racing game is easily the best of the bunch, IMHO. There are other games with some potential, but the whole initial introduction to the set of games on this disc is full-on tutorial style, so Nintendo somewhat shot themselves in the foot with that if they wanted the mini games on this disc to be perceived as anything BUT a tutorial. That's how you're introduced to them, so that's how they remained in my mind. Oh, and, FYI, the games ARE either one or two player, so you're not required to drag anyone else along with you on the torturous journey that is slogging through the initial disc setup/game unlocking stage.Considering that I've logged plenty of hours on my Wii in gameplay prior to getting this, utilizing most if not all of the usage methods presented in \"Wiiplay\", nothing on this disc was any help to me, and the \"fun\" factor is definitely lacking in the majority of these games.If you need an additional Wiimote, and you're thinking of buying this simply because it comes with a game and is only a few dollars more, go ahead, especially if you have a few extremely young Wii players that hang out in your space on a regular basis, for whom you need something SUPER simple all around. If, however, you're likely to be bitter about being gypped out of a few extra bucks with very little to show for it, just go for the straight Wiimote, and bypass this entirely. \"Wii Play\"'s only real redeeming quality is the extra Wiimote itself, and perhaps a game or two on here out of the nine.

Just like others have mentioned, the game is based off of Guitar Hero.  But instead of plastic buttons, you're playing real notes and chords on a real guitar.  And just like GH, the difficulty can change as you become more proficient.Unfortunately, the game fails in a few areas that make it necessary for you to seek outside advice.  (Is this really a failing, or just a consequence of being a video-based teaching system in which you can't ask questions or get critiqued?)  The biggest gripe I have with the game is how it changes difficulty while you're playing a song.  I don't like this because as I'm going through a song,  I'll all of a sudden come across chords that I've never seen before.  Nothing will get you more frustrated than having to stop playing because you just don't know how to do what they're asking.  I think that if the game were set up differently, like maybe coaching you through and practicing what is to come next, it would be much more enjoyable.  The game also glosses over or completely ignores some basics that would be helpful to know.  For example, it does not mention alternate picking.  So you're left thinking \"How am I supposed to play these notes this fast?\"Overall, I'd say that this is a very good accessory to learning the guitar.  Notice I said accessory.  I don't use this as my sole learning platform, and I don't suggest that you do either.  But this game can help because it's more fun than practicing fingering exercises like a teacher would have you do, and hence, it keeps your attention and motivation high.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2012"}
