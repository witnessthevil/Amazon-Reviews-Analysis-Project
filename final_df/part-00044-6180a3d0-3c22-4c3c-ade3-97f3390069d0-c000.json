Yes it does get a little TOO HARD SOMETIMES, but its a fun game that is definitely worth buying because it takes more than the 5 blockbuster days to beat it and it is fun to play again after you beat it every now-and-then. Some people say its not as good as MAX PAYNE but it is. Not only do you walk around shooting people, you get to play mini-games like disarming bombs, playing as a stripper, shooting from a helicopter, picking locks, hotwiring vehicles, etc. And when you do walk around shooting people you can take them HOSTAGES and excute them when you are done. If you have the money to rent this game for 1 month then maybe you should do it, but in my book this game is a MUST BUY!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.  PadillaPros:Excellent puzzle designAesthetically and stylistically brilliantAppropriately understated soundCons:Most players will finish it in fewer than 10 hoursBattles are too easy","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The very definition of an underrated game","reviewText":"Well, I shouldn't really say underrated since the game received absolutely glowing reviews in websites/magazines(except for those nerds who nitpick) and it's quite loved among PS2 fans. So why underrated? Well, not a lot of people have actually heard of the thing, much less find it. It was one of those sleeper hits that had people loving it but not a lot of people buying it. Which is a complete shame since this is probably one of the best PS2 games period.Story: It's a fairly simplistic story: a boy named Ico who has horns(not devil, more bull-like) is not well-liked in a village and is often blamed for everything. At a young age, the villagers \"sacrifice\" him to save their village. A chance of fate lets Ico escape and he meets a mysterious girl named Yorda who not only has these weird shadows after her but can open Idol doors. Why did they lock up Ico? His connection with Yorda? What's with the shadows?Graphics: Lush, beautiful, almost ethereal. It sounds like a bit much for graphics but it's quite true. This is a game that just screams art direction, as every place is perfectly detailed and a great lighting scheme. Sure it may not like as sharp as most top-tier PS2 games but who cares with graphics like these?Sound/Music: It's a nice soundtrack, what little you hear of it. It's one of those kind of soundtracks that's more about establishing a mood without you realizing it as the music blends in with the environment without drawing attention to itself but still, pick up the soundtrack. The voice acting is like follow-up Shadow of the Colossus where it's in an odd language but as subtitles. Regrettably, the option to replay the game with the subtitles translated was nixed so we have no idea to this day what's being said.Gameplay: It's perfect really as it gets the job done without going overboard with control schemes(such as maybe Grand Theft Auto). The R1 button acts as your basic button for dealing with Yorda. Yorda won't move anywhere on her own so you have to take her by the hand and guide her. If she's far away, pressing it will call her to you; if you're on a ledge you can pull her up and in a true test of faith, Yorda can jump gaps(not too big) and have Ico save her in the nick of time. It's nothing much but you sure feel relieved you caught her. If it sounds like I'm going odd with caring for a game character, you'd probably be right but when I started running with her and tugging her arm, I literally felt bad and started to slow down. Don't ask why.Fans of Resident Evil 4 and other games will know it's a pain when you have \"escort missions\" where you must protect your partner from harm. Well unlike Ashley, you'll find yourself saving Yorda at all costs and even find it offensive that enemies will try and take her, you literally get that attached. It's also great because she has great AI as she won't just stumble off high cliffs or make a jump only to miss, she'll even not jump if she thinks you're nuts. Leave her too long and she'll play with birds. It's a wonder how quickly you get attached to her.Is their faults? Kind of. The game's fairly short but it's also the right length: let's you play the game without feeling like \"when's this thing gonna end?\" Also, the shadows(your only enemies that come in different sizes) can get seriously annoying. Ico doesn't have a health bar or inventory but one punch and he's down and he takes relatively too long to get up. There's really no combos but your weapon gets upgraded from a stick to a sword to even some secret weapons that makes your job easier.Ico and Shadow of the Colossus are in those rare breed of games where it seems to go beyond just a simple fun experience. It's touching, heartwarming and when enemies start to mess with your girl, you better believe you'll want to kick them around as fast as you can. You don't have to write an essay on it but if you find yourself getting attached to Yorda, you'll find this isn't your typical game and it isn't, it's better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2006"}

Using the wiimote to slice and dice the zombie masses.  How cool!  Too bad something was lost in the translation.Yes. I know it is a port from a more powerful system. The main selling point of the first Dead Rising was wading into hundreds of on-screen zombies with a make-shift weapon designed to send dozens of zombie body parts flying in a number of funny ways.  And when you cut the density of the undead horde down to about 1/8 of the original horde due to the Wii's hardware limitations, the humorous effect of using those various weapons loses its appeal.  For example, there are flamable canisters designed to be shot, explode and make a dozen or so zombies blow up.  At least, on the 360 version.  In the Wii version, I was hard pressed to take two or three at once.  More often than not, I took out a solitary zombie.The controls are sluggish.  I would think a guy armed with a katana or a baseball bat would attempt to slice away at the zombie horde with a fevered pace.  Your character in the game seems to want to think about it before each swing.  All together, you get gameplay that is simply just okay.But, they added zombie parrots and poodles, you say?Sorry, these additions only serve to frustrate and distract from the fact that there are not enough zombies to make the main premise of the game work as well as it did on the 360.On the positive side, the graphics are good for a Wii game.  And the cost of the game is reasonable for a \"re-tread\" game.  Also the changes to the save game system and event triggers are wonderful.  The 360 version had one save slot and all the events in the game happened in real time with or without your character being present.  The Wii version has up to 20 save slots.  In-game events are more forgiving.  You can be in the general area at the approximate right time and not miss them.  Being able to change the difficulty level to make the game accessable to gamers of varying skill levels was nice of Capcom to include. I also noticed that your journalist character is no longer interested in taking pictures of the zombie uprising.  For me this is a good thing, since it frees you up to focus on taking out zombies.If you really like killing zombies and only own a Wii, then rent this game.  I will be waiting for the true sequel to come out on PS3 or 360.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYZ2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"Great follow-up to Kinect Sports","reviewText":"I'll preface this review by saying that I was a huge fan of Kinect Sports.  Kinect Sports should be a part of every Kinect gamer's library.While Kinect Sports was fairly global in its sports, Kinect Sports is leans more heavily toward American sports.  You get football, baseball, golf, tennis, darts, and skiing as your main events.  You also have a number of game activities based on the aforementioned sports.  It's a solid package and is one of the few Kinect titles that offer online play.In addition to the game itself, there is a free download (DLC aka downloadable content) for Kinect Sports Season 2 called the Kinect Sports: Season Two - Challenge Pack #1.  This DLC adds more game modes and as well as challenges to send to friends. Each sport receives a new experience: Crazy Kicker (Football), Frantic Fielder (Baseball), Cool Ringings (Skiing), Champion Chip (Golf), Rapid Returner (Tennis) and Smart Shot (Darts).The main football event allows single player, multiplayer, and Xbox Live match play.  Single player is you against the computer.  Multiplayer is a 2-player game.  You can either play against each other (VS) or with each other (CO-OP).  Xbox Live match play is where can play against people through the Internet.  Xbox Live online play requires an Xbox Live Gold account as the Xbox Live Free account does not allow online multiplayer.The scope of the football game is fairly limited.  There are 3 difficulty levels (rookie, pro, champion).  You can return kickoffs and play as the quarterback and wide receiver.  There is no defensive play which is a disappointment.  As soon as you receive the kickoff, you are to sprint down the field.  Your character will handle the juking while you provide the locomotion.  The higher you lift your knees, the faster your character will sprint.  Once you have been tackled and have become the quarterback, you have 2 options.  You can either let the computer pick a play for you to run (called Coach's pick) or you can select playbook and manually choose a play.  If you chose to manually choose a play, you have a small selection of plays.  You only have 4 downs to go the entire field but don't worry.  All the plays can net you a lot of yards.  20-40 yard plays are very commonplace.  On fourth down, you can choose to kick the field goal.You can either play by going through the motions or using voice commands.  Both work well but it felt more like football to go through the motions.  For example, you crouch to get under the center, and then when you want to hike, you stand up.  Or with voice, you would say \"ready, hike\".  As the quarterback, once you hike the ball, your receivers will sprint down the field.  When the wide receiver is open, the icon above their head will turn green.  So it's a matter of recognizing who is open.  You can throw to a receiver when their icon is not green but your chance of completion drops.  To throw to the receiver, you just pivot your body and throw.  The harder you throw, the more chance you have to have the receiver catch the ball in stride instead of stopping for the ball and then running.  Catching the ball in stride increases your chance of running the distance to the end zone.  Once you have thrown the ball as the quarterback, you instantly switch to being the receiver.  Once you catch the ball, you simply sprint for the end zone, with the computer handling the juking and dodging of defensive players.  In case you haven't realized it yet, there is a lot of sprinting in this game!!!  Once you score a touchdown, kick the field goal, or turn the ball over on downs, the computer's offense will take over.  You then watch whether the computer can score.  You do not get to play defense.  After that, the ball comes back to you and you keep going back and forth until the time runs out.Football is a lot of fun.  It is very tiring because you have to sprint every few seconds.  If you hated the track and field in Kinect Sports 1, you may hate the constant sprinting in football.  While the game play is great and fun, it's very limiting.  You only 6 plays to choose from and they're all passing plays (though since you have to go the entire field with only 4 downs, you wouldn't want to do running plays).  Also, the inability to play defense is disappointing.  The football may also be better with single player than multiplayer because in single player, you are playing both the QB and the wide receiver.  If you are playing co-op with a friend, you either get to be the QB or get to be the receiver.  The QB only has to turn and throw the ball.  The wide receiver has to do all the running.  However, if you are playing against your friend, both of you have to be QB and receiver.  You can use either your voice or your body, and you'll find out you'll like a combination of both.  For example, when selecting plays, I just say the play.No minigames for football come on the disc.  You must download the free Kinect Sports: Season Two - Challenge Pack #1 in order to get the Crazy Kicker minigame.  Crazy Kicker is great fun and is a football minigame.  If you've played the soccer minigames of Kinect Sports 1, you'll feel right at home.  In this case, with Crazy Kicker, you are the field goal kicker.  The football is placed at different locations around the football field and you have to kick the field goal.  So you'll be moving your body to the left or right side of the room to orient your character for the kick.  Then you kick the ball.  It's a timed even so the faster you kick, the more points you can score.  You definitely can't dawdle if you expect to get a good score.  In addition to distance and position, there are other factors such as the wind.  You are given a number of footballs to begin with.  Miss a kick and you lose a football.  Lose all your footballs and your game is over.  This was a lot of fun.  I actually felt like a field goal kicker, keeping in mind angle and the wind speed.  I may actually like this minigame than the actual football game.Baseball is decent.  Not bad.  Not spectacular.  Though I must preface that I was never a baseball fan.  You also have single player, multiplayer, and Xbox Live online multiplayer.  You have either the fastball or the curve ball.  You can change the speed of the ball depending on whether you step forward on your pitch.  It's very simplistic baseball.  Pitching against the computer is not much fun.  It's much more interesting against a human opponent.  If you play against the computer, they will give you a scouting report on what pitches your particular opponent is known to have a weakness.  For example, they'll say the player is weak on slow curve balls.  Now, this just tells the tendency of the player.  It does not guarantee that they won't smash your slow curve ball out of the park.  It's set up like football in that you are first the batter.  Then once you hit the ball, you have to sprint to first base.  If your hit is multiple bases or a home run, you do not have to sprint.  But if it's a grounder, you have to sprint to beat out the ball.  Again, keep your knees high for maximum speed.  Batting is definitely more fun than pitching in this game.  They don't let you play a full 9 innings though.The baseball minigame that comes on the disc is Home Run Hero.  In this, you take multiple swings of the bat just like a home run derby.  It tallies the distance on all the balls rather than just counting home runs.  So you are aiming for the great total distance of all your hits.  With Kinect Sports: Season Two - Challenge Pack #1, you get the Frantic Fielder minigame.  This is very similar to the minigame in beach volleyball of Kinect Sports 1.  You have to reach out to catch the baseballs coming at you.  Sometimes the ball will bounce out of your mitt so you have a second opportunity to catch any misses.  Once you missed a number of baseballs, the game is over.  This one is not as fun as the minigame in volleyball of Kinect Sports.Darts is a surprisingly good time. There is only 1 darts game available called 501.  You are competing against either a computer player or a human and you get 3 throws per turn.  Both of you start at 501 and you have to count down to exactly 0.  So if on the first dart, you hit a triple 20, second dart you have a single 20, and third dart, you hit a 17, then that round, you scored 97 so 97 will be taken off your score.  You must end the game on a double in order to win which increases the difficulty.  So for example, if you need 20 to win, you cannot simply hit 20 to win.  You would do something like hit a 10 and then a double 5.  Or 16 and then a double 2.  The game is quite accurate and fun.  You'll be honing your breathing technique to just hit that triple 20.  And when you hit, it feels like you earned it.  When you miss, you'll feel like you did pull the dart at the end of your throw.  But because the only darts game is 501, you end up not having to aim for the bulleye because a triple 20 is worth more than the bulleye.  So you'll be staring at triple 20 an awful lot.  Sure you can go for 50 in the bulleye and if you miss, you'll get 25.  But go for the triple 20 and if you miss, you'll get 20.  Higher risk but higher reward.The minigame included on the disc is Pop Darts.  This is like your carnival game.  You have a spinning board with balloons that you have to pop.  There is a person attached to the board which you are not supposed to him.  It's basically a speed game where you have to be accurate.  The other minigame is called Smart Darts and this is a lot of fun (but then again, I'm a geek).  Smart Shots is an awesome darts game.  If you've played Brain Age or Body and Brain, you'll feel right at home.  They'll show a simple math equation that you have to solve, e.g., 2 + 3 = ?.  So after you solve the equation, you have to find and then hit that number on the dartboard.  So if they say 40 / 2, you have to hit 20 on the board.  It's a timed event so you have to work fast.  This is a great challenge game and is fun because it requires quick thought, quick identification of the number on the board, and then accuracy in hitting the target.The game of golf is a lot of fun.  The only negative is you cannot play a full 18 holes.  Then again, the 9 holes game does take awhile to finish.  Your options are the front 9 holes, a 3 hole match, or a single hole match.  You can change clubs, view the hole, change the direction of your shot, etc.  It's a lot of fun.  The computer will pick the club it feels is most appropriate for the shot but you can change it any any time.  The voice commands work great for this.  You can raise your hand to your eyebrows which will let you see a bird's eye swooping view of the hole, just like on TV.  While in your golf swing stance, you can walk forward or backward (not actually toward or away but rather on a horizontal line from the TV) to change the direction of your swing.  You can even crouch like a golfer to see the terrain better but it's more cute than useful.  When they kick in the wind, the graphics make it look like a hurricane which is funny.  The drives feel good.  The putts feel good.  Just a solid game if you like golf.  You will definitely want to play more aggressively than the computer's suggested shot, especially on the dog legs.The minigames include Ocean Driver and Champion Chip.  Ocean Driver comes on the disc.  You have to drive the ball to a bulleye on an island and the closer you get, the more points you get.  This one is not as interesting as Champion Chip.  Champion Chip is obtained via the Kinect Sports: Season Two - Challenge Pack #1 download.  Champion Chip is a golf minigame and is akin to hitting a bulleye target.  Surrounding the putting hole is concentric circles.  The closer you get to the hole, the more points you score.  When you exhaust your supply of golf balls, the game is over.  If you get a hole in one, they'll give you bonus balls.  This was a lot of fun.  Makes for great challenges as well.Skiing is actually one of my favorites.  It's very fast and intense.  To have a fast start, you strike your arms down as if planting your poles to push off.  If you ski in the crouched position, you'll ski faster so this event almost becomes a constant squat exercise.  To steer, you lean to the appropriate site.  At first I was fighting the controls but when I realized how it works, it became very accurate.  The trick is to follow the terrain and not have big leans.  When I figured out when you need big leans and when you need little leans, racing became easier.  Most of the curves are banked.  So if the curve is sloping rightward, don't lean right heavily or you will careen to the right because the slope is already pushing you rightward.  If the curve is heading to the right but you want to head leftward, you will have to lean more heavily because you are working against momentum and gravity.  To jump, you jump when you are in the green zone of the ramp.  This is an awesome multiplayer game.Cool Ringings is a skiing minigame where you ski down the slope but there are cow bells at various positions on the course.  You have to reach out your hand to ring the bell.  The more bells you ring, the more points you get.  So you'll be reaching left, right, and up to hit bells.  It's a timed event so you have to run the course fast but you have to hit bells to score points.  This was so good fun.  If anyone played the roller coasters in Carnival Games: Monkey See, Monkey Do, it feels like that, but I would rate this higher because it's easier to control and you feel like you're more in control of the event.For tennis, at first I didn't like it.  I thought it was a copy of table tennis in Kinect Sports 1.  But the more I played it, the more I enjoyed it.  I don't know if I like it more than table tennis.  But it is some good fun.  Note that if you are used to playing table tennis in KS1, you will have to adapt as the play is different.  I still don't know how to do fast serves in tennis whereas it was very easy for me to slam serves in table tennis.Rapid Returner is a tennis minigame, and it is like the rapid event in Table Tennis for Kinect Sports 1.  It's okay, but I preferred the frantic nature of the table tennis event in KS1.  It's not a bad event by any means but it pales compared to the aforementioned activity.Now, Kinect Sports Season 2 has a feature that no other Kinect game has.  In addition to the online multiplayer, it has a feature called challenges.  This is where you select a minigame or event and you challenge someone over it.  For example, if I challenge my friend in Smart Darts and I score 56 seconds, my friend has to beat that time to win or else I win.  This doesn't have to happen in real time which is a boon.  Let's say you and your friend cannot schedule time to play against each other online (family commitments, work, etc.).  Now you can play against each other at different times of the day.  It's like the leaderboards but it's more interactive and specific.Now that the events and minigames have been discussed, I'd like to wrap up with my thoughts on the game.  Once you figure out how to use the voice commands, they become a nice perk to the game, especially in golf and football.  You'll end up using voice for some things, hands for other things.  The graphics are beautiful.  The resolution seems higher.  Colors just pop.  You'll see beautiful courses in golf.  The sensation of speed in skiing is awesome.The big question is:  is it better than Kinect Sports 1?  No.  If you had to only own 1 Kinect Sports title, it should be Kinect Sports.  That aside, is Kinect Sports Season 2 worth owning?  I give an emphatic YES.  This is a great game on its own.  It's just that KS1 is amazing.  And if you like any of the events in KS2, you have to have this game.  Golf alone will be a decider for people that like golf.  I love the darts game, and now I no longer have to have holes in my real wall from my errant dart shots.  The challenges let you play against your friends without the worry of whether you can coordinate and schedule times to play against each other.  Without the Kinect Sports: Season Two - Challenge Pack #1, I would've been disappointed in this title because the title appeared to be lacking in content.  But with the DLC, it became a bigger game and thus worthy of our attention.They are still intent on releasing new DLC (downloadable content) to keep the game fresh and judging by Rare's past history, they will support Kinect Sports Season 2 until the end.  The next DLC will give you 9 new holes in golf.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000XJS00K","description":"","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Starts out great, becomes worse the longer you play it","reviewText":"At first, I thought this game was cool. And it is, for a little bit. But the slow-motion Kill-Bill-inspired shoot 'em up kills wear off pretty quickly and by the game's end, you're just glad it's over.There are two issues I take with this game. The controls, for one, are not very good, at all! Rubi Malone can do so many acrobatic stunts and obstacles, but the controls are not very tight and you'll  OFTEN find yourself doing one thing instead of what you meant to do because every tiny little detail or change in an action or motion makes up an entirely different move or stunt. Often, you'll find yourself running across walls instead of up them or leaping off walls instead of grabbing onto them because every action is so specific. Some aren't even control specific and totally rely on the game, such as the shoddy and terrible auto targeting. You see, Rubi dual wields weapons and the left hand automatically aims at a target. But as is the problem with many automatic actions, it'll often aim at something you don't want or miss something right in front of your face. This isn't so bad in the easy campaign modes, but it makes the ANNOYING and frustrating obstacle courses that much more difficult because you have to depend on an undependable left hand to auto aim. I'll get those obstacle courses shortly.Another annoying \"auto function\" involves some stunts, such as leaping onto high platforms or poles. You can't just leap onto them because Rubi doesn't jump high enough. You have to leap at some random invisible spot so that the game \"leaps\" for you, higher than usual and right onto the platform ledge or pole. As you can imagine, this will lead to OFTEN deaths or leaps onto previous parts on the stage because you didn't leap at the invisible, randomally assigned \"hot spot\" where the game will let you jump higher than usual. Stuff like this kills the game on harder modes and the obstacle courses. Not to mention COUNTLESS invisible walls, un-crawlable low spaces, and other parts of the set that were made due to poor level design and bad collision detection physics. Basically, you'll think you can slide under some spots that you CAN'T or run across some platforms that have an invisible brick wall or something in front of them which is really just a single brick or something on the ground, blocking you entirely. Stuff like this make the obstacle courses beyond frustrating and annoying (when trying to pass them on Silver or Gold, at least.)And that's the other problem I have with this game. The Obstacle Course challenges. Four of them are mandatory IN-GAME! The rest are \"fun, bonus\" challenges that are anything but fun. Basically, you race to the finish, shooting targets in various acrobatic ways to decrease your time by two seconds per hit target. There are Bronze, Silver, and Gold you must complete the challenges in.  Completing all 20 or so with all Silver or Gold gets you two big achievements. Unfortunately, the above mentioned problems of the unreliable left hand auto-aim (which you must rely on to trigger the targets to pop up in the courses) and the poor physics of the level design will have you messing up constantly due to problems that most of the time, aren't your fault. The challenges while difficult, actually can be learned quite dilligently. In fact, one challenge in itself can usually be mastered from no experience of doing it in under half an hour. But the problems of the game will cause you to mess up a lot. And since this is a race, literally every half second counts. In some challenges, getting Gold rank requires a precise, flawless, absolutely perfect run and one mistake of the darn auto-aim not working in time or Rubi running across a wall instead of up it or vice versa or not leaping in the invisible \"hot spot\" to trigger the auto-grab of the pole will ruin it.This is why the game isn't all that fun, in my opinion. The more you get into it, the less you like it. An dthat's the opposite of how games should work.Overall, I'd say it's worth a rental if you enjoy any of Tarantino's films and always wanted a Kill Bill style game with guns. But it's only worth a playthrough about once or twice, and there are a TON of achievements to get in this game, if you're into those. Play it, but don't get suckered in and try to start \"enjoying\" it like I did. You'll soon grow to hate the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2011"}

The game is obviously quite a bit different now and would get a higher score from me certainly.Morrowind, the 3rd installment of the Daggerfall series from Bethesda Software promised to be the first open-ended single player RPG game in a fully immersive 3D environment with cutting edge graphics, length and depth.Well, they got the cutting edge graphics part right apparently.The character development system is excellent, plenty of options to choose from in the areas of magic, melee and ranged combat, and classes/races.  This promising, involved character creation system is intuitive, deep and fun to play around with by itself.Once you've landed in the first town and are introduced to the reason you've been chosen by the Emperor and are allowed to enter the outside world, it can be a bit over-whelming and confusing - the game is very open-ended.You can pretty much do anything you want, buy some stuff, kill someone or something, sneak, steal, barter, join a guild, accept a quest from an NPC who gives you one etc.., or you can just run around the world at your leisure.The frustrating and ultimately disappointing aspect of the game is how incredibly tedious and boring the game becomes after you've gotten more than halfway through the main quest, where the game reveals just how shallow it really is.The vendors never carry much money, so finding expensive items means absolutely nothing at all.There are only 3-5 suits of armor or types of clothing any character in the game can wear, along with one or two special suits you can only find in certain areas and after completing certain quests.  This simply adds to the tedium, wearing the same stuff for over 4-5 levels or more at a time.It can take up to 15 minutes or more to travel from one area to another.  And the landscape is barren, boring, and repetitive, despite the hand-placed items. Everything looks the same.On top of that there are only 3-4 monsters you will do battle with 90% of the time in the game, and you get really, really tired of combating the same monsters over and over and over for 100 hours (which is what it takes to finish the game and really complete most of the quests).  If I see or hear another Cliff Racer I'm going to puke, seriously.  The difficulty level of these enemies never changes, they are always the same. And certain areas don't offer harder challenges than others unless you \"want\" to wander into a ruin, and those are of all the same difficulty level as well, no matter where you are in the game.Around level 22, as a Nord Warrior specializing in long blades, I could kill everything and everyone in the game with little problem at all, and I hadn't even finished the main quest yet - still had at least 10 or more hours to go, at least, to finish. This was horribly designed, there were no challenges left, just errand running and talking to the same people over and over.Magic and Thief characters add some depth and much-needed complexity to the game, but they get old fast and their lack of combat ability can be frustrating, ecspecially early on.  You can collect and steal tons of different little odds and ends, but it gets so boring and useless that it's easy to give up after doing it for hours on end.Despite these major problems (similar to my complaints of MMORPG's) the game is very entertaining and fun because of it's explorative nature at first, at least the first 40-50 hours, making it worthwhile at least.But once you've tried and done everything for the most part, there's simply nothing more there, it gets old quick and I really can't see myself playing it again any time soon.Finally the system requirements are incredibly high and it didn't run all that well even on my 1GHZ/Geforce3 rig, but at high detail it ran more than adequately.  The load times are annoying and constant also.Simply another hyped RPG that is just a single player version of Asheron's Call, EverQuest or Anarchy Online.  And like most RPG's of late, boring and tedious despite the intrictate story line and world politics that push you along.If you are a hardcore PC game lover, I'd recommend it, but if you are not, take a pass, ecspecially if your PC is less than ideal for these high end games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000O5FUKQ","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"JO MOMMA \"COOKIE-MONSTER\"","summary":"I loved it","reviewText":"I loved this game but the N64 version was better.

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"C. Helm \"THROW?\"","summary":"Good game, but too many problems with it","reviewText":"1) Go EA for making a game that is not complete w/o purchasing add-ons. You can't even get all the achievemnts w/o purchasing add-ons. I personally don't know how MS allowed that, but. . .2) Graphics are ok, but I am also a person that would rather have gameplay over graphics, so they didn't bother me. I still thought they were good.3) Way, way, way too many audio glitches on my end.4) Sure, dialog is great, but there needs to be a limit. As a preface, I am a neurotic completionist, hence my achievement complaint, so I am not your average lets just get this over with thumb twitcher looking for my next adrenaline fix as another reviewer wrote. Here is where I will pre-defend myself against the RPG freaks. It seems like too many \"hardcore\" RPG'rs get off on saying I spend X number of hours playing this game. Another is, sure it may not be great, but think about dollars per game time, and it is worth it. I do not count tons of 10 min conversations as game time. Also, I do love character delevolpment and background story, but this game takes it way too far. Also, when you push a button to get to the next sentence, sometimes it takes you to the next sentence, and sometimes the entire story ends. See point 8) for more on the dialog complaint.5) Tactics. The tactics are fine for people that don't want to micro-manage and a good idea, BUT I all too often found the basic AI running the characters to be way too flawed. Too often, my guys would just run off the screen into big fights, so throttle them back right. Then they will just stand there and let people hit them. Seriously, no matter what the setting, if one guy comes in between your 3 non-active characters and starts hitting them, they should hit them back. They would also just watch their buddies get beat on while they are in melee range. I found ranged to be the best usually and default to be about worthless, as well as \"agressive\" I think it was.5b) I did have this same complaint with mass effect about the AI being generally stupid. I enjoyed it much more though. Although the expansion was a total rip off.6) Moving around. This was atrocious! On games like this, I should be able to \"warp\" or whatever to any place that I have been at anytime that I am not fighting. But no, there are many times that you have to walk and walk and walk, only to wait for a map load, so you can walk and walk and walk to the far end of the new map to the point where you can finally \"fast move.\" Again, here is a great example where the diehards like it b/c \"It took me X hours to beat.\" Keep in mind, once you get to a destination, it may take you another walking across a map, loading a new map and walking across another before you get where you want. I remember one time it took me about 15 minutes just to get to a place that I had already been to talk to a person that I had already talked to just to do a side quest.7) Active quest. If I set a quest as active, it should always tell me where to go if my character knows the location. I may not remember where jonas was, but it will only tell me where he is if I am in the same \"suburb\" of a town that he is in. Again, if I (my character) knows that he is in place X, then give me an arrow leading me to place X. I don't actually want to memorize 20 hours of dialog just to complete a side quest.8) Replayability. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. I already know the general storyline, so most of it I may not want to listen too, but it may still take me a minute just to skip through the story. It took me about 14 hours on the replay, and I bet at least 10 of that was story. I am serious about that too.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2009"}

Throughout your investigation you will encounter paranormal activity and begin to learn of a little girl named Alma. I won't spoil anything here but the story definitely borrows plot elements from Silent Hill and The Ring.F.E.A.R. sort of sits between lukewarm and good. The combat is pretty solid, the sounds are very well done and the story is interesting enough - even if it has been done before. Unfortunately this game misses the mark on a few aspects which hinder this game a bit.The biggest issue with this game is how repetitive it really is. The environments are repetitive as well as the pacing. You spend almost the whole time inside of an office building running through a huge maze of very redundant offices. Actually it's not really a maze but the layout allows you to approach the next area a couple different ways. Nothing drastic but for instance you can either crawl through a vent or you can walk down a hallway and then through a door. At times this game can feel maze-like because it's quite easy to get turned around and accidentally end up where you started. Most of this game looks exactly the same throughout - there are a few different environments such a construction zones or the rooftops but these are usually only short breaks from the offices.The pacing of this game is repetitive. You will walk through a significant portion of a level without any combat - you are pretty much trying to figure out how to get to the next area (without getting turned around) and after awhile you will approach a larger room of some sorts where you will battle a bunch security guys. You will continue fighting small groups of security guys until you reach the next area where you don't fight for a long period of time. This game is so repetitive in this nature that you will soon know exactly when you will be fighting and when you will be on another long combat-free stretch. Sprinkle in some paranormal events (odd visions, voices, things moving on their own...etc) and you pretty much have F.E.A.R.in a nutshell.The game play has flaws as well. You have the ability to go into slow mo (ala Max Payne) which is pretty well done. You can see the bullets zinging through the air, glass shattering, flailing baddies and all sorts of cool stuff but again this all becomes repetitive. My biggest complaint with the game play is the slight lag when moving/aiming. To me there seems to be a very slight (maybe just a hundred milliseconds) lag between when you move the thumb stick and when the movement is actually registered on screen. It's only a few milliseconds but it's enough to make aiming a bit frustrating, especially while you are fighting in real-time. You are equipped with an annoying flashlight. Your battery in your flashlight dies about every minute - maybe 2 minutes. You have to turn your flashlight off for about 10-15 seconds for it to recharge which doesn't sound too bad but this game is VERY dark and you constantly need your flashlight. It starts to become really annoying to walk around for a minute or two then sit for 15 seconds while it recharges again.I found by around the 7th Interval (out of 11 plus 1 short bonus interval) I was pretty bored with this game. One reviewer posted that this game is like playing the demo over and over for 10+ hours and that reviewer really wasn't too far from the truth. This game starts out engaging but fizzles out about halfway in.Instead of hitting every aspect of this game in this review, I'll do a good ol' fashion pro/con list.Pros- Guns feel powerful, decent variety of them too- AI is above average- Large combat sequences can be quite fun- Sounds are good. Voice acting is average but atmospheric sounds are very well done- Has some genuine creepy moments- Story although cliched, is still interesting enough- Slow-mo is done pretty wellCons- You will become sick of running through offices- Just about everything becomes repetitive (game-play, visuals, pacing)- Flashlight becomes very annoying - almost like mini speed-bumps in the games pacing- Easy to get turned around because everything looks exactly the same- Slight lag between issuing movement command and movement taking place on-screen- Frequent frame-rate drops","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2009"}

It was still in prime shape (and let me remind, it withstood FIVE YEARS of NONSTOP ACTION) but I was getting worried that someday I would not be able to buy a G5 anymore. I made the decision to try the G500 despite being very skeptical about it's 3 crowded and small looking side buttons and strange shape and if I really didn't like it I would buy a G5 while I still could and save it for later. So I bought the G500 and tried it out.Right when I put my hand on it I knew I was completely wrong. It felt like bliss in a mouse. The side buttons that I was so scared of being too small were easy to press and pressing two or three of them on accident was not a concern due to the superb design. The sensitivity buttons are now placed so that you index finger merely needs to move to the side instead of curling up for much easier access. The drivers are fantastic, easily letting you customize you buttons to do just about everything you could imagine. The onboard memory is very convenient for going to LAN cafes. Everything that I wanted from the G5 was there, with fantastic improvements.That being said however, the mouse isn't perfect. The fantastic ergonomic design is a little TOO comfortable, and what I mean by this is that it's more difficult to pick up the mouse because of the lacking ridge on the right side. I have to move my ring finger over to the side to pick it up easier but then it's very crowded and harder to move. The mouse wheel feel very loose compared to the G5 and does not protrude as much. I'm guessing it's loose because of the option for smooth scrolling which I never use and can't imagine is too popular. It would be nice if the onboard memory could hold more than one profile. I just can't imagine having a bigger onboard memory would be too expensive, but I might be wrong. A mouse with this many buttons is very nice to have with many profiles. Lastly, the mice feet that come standard with this mouse are horrible. They should consider using the same feet as Hyperglide or Razer products. I use Hyperglide and it is DEFINITELY worth the purchase!The last thing I want to leave off with is that there are a lot of gamers who look at the new mice in the market today with scorn due to the laser tracking. I want to mention that as long as you are using a proper mousepad (black), there should be NO problem with tracking and those absurd ESReality mouse \"benchmarks\" measure at speeds far too unrealistic to be of any use. I have tried out a lot of different mice (mainly Razer, Logitech and Microsoft) but of all of them, my G5 laser has been the most reliable.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Scott Sloan","summary":"May the Force be with you, budding Jedi.","reviewText":"Amazing, simply amazing. That describes this new xbox game. I am not a gamer by heart, and give most games a brisk 10 mins to prove themselves worthy of joing my video cabinet. Within the few minutes it took to navigate the start up screen, and get a handle on the controls. I was completely hooked!!I have logged about 15 hours on the game, and HAVE BARELY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE!!! The story is amazingly deep for a video game, and as others have said the score is very cool. I cannot stop playing. I must know what secrets lie just beyond the next door. I have never been so completely hooked on a video game as I have been with KOTOR. You must buy this game! For the die hard RPG'er, or if you are like me, and are just sticking your big toe in the water to see what it's like.The controls are easy to master, the graphics are very nice, but as EGM said in their latest issue, they could use one more coat of polish, but i will not let that deter me from an otherwise flawless game. The story is just amazing, and seems to be well written with the player's future at the center. The other characters interact with your chosen character flawlessly, and realistically. I cannot say enough good things about this game, and hope that it becomes the next \"Must Own\" game for the Xbox.Enjoy it, and May the Force Be With You!!!Well 53 hours later, and I have beaten the game.  WOW!!!! A true Star Wars ending. I must see what the downloadable content is going to look like that Biogames, and Lucasarts have promised.  In my opinion with the sweet soundtrack, great visuals, and truly immersive stoeyline.  KOTOR is a Must Buy for the Xbox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2003"}

This game is completely addictive - at least it is for me. Shooting zombies is just so much fun, especially when it's made possible by such a well-crafted game. The premise is very simple: you and three fellow survivors have to make your way from one safe house to another until you are finally rescued. Along the way you have to fight off hordes of slavering zombies. In single player mode the AI is pretty good, although your teammates don't always behave as you might wish them to during the incredibly hectic campaign finales. There are 4 campaigns with 5 maps to each one. Replay value is good due to the fact that the AI changes the zombie attacks and spawn points with each play, so you never know where the horde is going to come flooding from or where the bosses are lurking. When you get bored with the maps supplied there are loads of 3rd party maps and campaigns available on the web. On top of all this you can even play as one the various types of zombies (on a random basis). Personally I find this less satisfying, but it is worth a go just to get the other perspective. This is a simple but truly great game. L4D2 here I come!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Evan Eberhardt","summary":"How not to do Halo","reviewText":"I loved Halo 3. It's probably my favorite Xbox 360 game in fact.  I then assumed I would also love Halo3: ODST.  But that just didn't happen.  The problem for me is with the absence of Master Chief, and his replacement being an entire unit of ODSTs.  I failed to make a connection with the rookie or any of the other troops, and the story thus wasn't very compelling (its not bad, but not great).  The other problems were that the different action levels were way too short and the wandering about the city with the rookie too boring with too little action.  Halo 3 was a start to finish tour de force action game, with fairly lengthy and challenging chapters (on Legendary).  Perfect.  Halo3: ODST goes against this formula and for me it was a mistake.  The game felt choppy and too short.  The screen turning red when an ODST is in danger is also very annoying, and an odd addition (yeah, lets DECREASE visibility right when you are in the most danger...probably got the idea from Modern Warfare).  And they also brought back health packs, which was easily the most annoying thing in Halo 1.  Why bring it back?  I am also unsure about the night vision feature.  Its intriguing, but after a while I get tired of the bright outlines on everything.  I rarely play mulitplayer online, so I can't rate that in a fair fashion.  The stand alone game left a lot to be desired though.  I have to ding Bungie on this one.  Too bad.  I hope future games are better and my advice to Bungie would be \"If it ain't broken, don't fix it!\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Sun Jian \"Tiger of Jiang Dong\"","summary":"Not a true sucessor to DA:O","reviewText":"I got this game as a gift, my wife knew I was addicted to Dragon Age: Origins and pre-ordered this from Best Buy. It was an enjoyable game for the most part, but as the game goes on past the 15 hour mark I started to get bored. Anyone who loved Dragon Age: Origins will want to check this title out, but be prepared to be disappointed.As many reviewers have pointed out before, the roleplaying part of the game has been significantly reduced in favor of am adventure style of gameplay. And even though I will admit that many of Dragon Age: Origin's UI issues, crafting and script execution have been improved, the things that were taken away consequently rob the game of it's heritage.DA:O had amazing characters and getting to know them all was thoroughly enjoyable. I can't say the same for DA2, all of the characters are one dimensional and grating. For instance, Merril is naive and childish throughout the game, Aveline is always strict and fiercely loyal, Varric is always the smooth talker and comedy relief character. DA:O characters actually grew, they had storylines that helped shape their personalities and each of them added to the comedy routine and the drama. What is even worse about Dragon Age 2 is that you have to make some really annoying choices when it comes to companions so you will probably want to stick to a the few that fit your main character's intentions. It doesn't help that aside from Hawke, the characters are pretty much set in their ways for their roles because of their \"unique\" talent trees. Aveline will always be your \"tank\", unless you want to play one yourself as Hawke, she doesn't even have the option of using a two hander, and her unique talents are all for damage mitigation. It's completely ridiculous because if you really want to try the game on the harder difficulties then you are basically stuck with three set characters who need to fill important roles. Sure you can go ahead and try and tank with a 2-handed specialized warrior, but the tough fights will kick your ass if you try. The last thing I'll say about characters is that the romances in DA2 are utterly unrewarding and ultimately useless, again unlike DA:O.So what about the story? Dragon Age II's story is ultimately about...well, nothing really. Right up till the end, where the game sort of explodes with tension and then leaves you hanging at the end. I won't give out too many spoilers but Hawke is basically a refugee from Lothering who flees the darkspawn and heads to Kirkwall. There he has to make a name for himself and....well, do things. Really, that's the story. Your goal for the first two acts (there are three total) is to become rich and famous. You do any number of quests, mostly involving killing something, confronting someone, then making a decision. The side quests are so unmemorable that I actually forgot about half the characters. I would stumble onto some mad guy in act 3, swearing revenge for something I did to him, only to be left scratching my head about what it was I did. DA:O had the blight, the murder of a King, grey wardens, arch demons, the witch of the wastes and all that good stuff that made you crave for story advancement. In Dragon Age II I found myself just rushing through pointless fetch and kill quests just to get to the story, only to find that there really isn't any to begin with. Act III, the final stage, gives no closure for Hawke, and I honestly felt empty when the credits rolled by. The choices you make ultimately don't change a damned thing, and the game seems to stop when the story finally seems to gain some momentum. I can't even recall the last time a supposed RPG left me feeling this disappointed.All of this, combined with a terrible inventory and item system, the inability to even USE armor for your companions, the outdated graphics, the lack of new exciting music, grating voice acting, the terrible Mass Effect 2 dialogue wheel make for a very, very disappointing sequel. I don't even feel like this game is a sequel, it's a spin off, a badly cast spin off that caters to teenagers who aren't looking for depth, but want to swoon over large breasts, fancy moves and broody emo elves.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}

It is a third person, open world, action game that follows a vigilante/hacker, Aiden Pearce, as he battles the crime and corruption in Chicago by using the CtOS system (the city's surveillance system) to his advantage. Don't get me wrong this is not a just a hacking game, Aiden uses an arsenal of automatic weapons and explosives along with his various hacking devices to achieve his goals.My main complaint is with a pretty awful glitch in the Xbox One version of the game, even after I downloaded the most recent updates. The voice sound, when in mission and during phone calls, in nonexistent. I checked the settings, deleted the install and reinstalled the game all for nothing. I have seen a number of complaints and that it is not uncommon. I have contacted the Watch Dogs team about the issue, multiple times, and I was ignored. The reason this makes the game so difficult is because you can be in the middle of a car chase or gun fight and be totally lost because you can't read the subtitles, which do work.This is extremely disappointing because Ubisoft is usually great about getting back to you and patching up glitches.

Moore \"RvngoftheNERD\"","summary":"Good game with TONS of potential.","reviewText":"Waiting for Brink had me very excited. The concept of it was very fresh and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Now that I have it... I'm not dissapointed but I just expected a little bit more.The graphics are good in this game. Not fantastic, think sort of Bordelands/ Team Fortress 2. I would say this game is a lot more detailed than the two though. The customization allows you to do so much with the character. Scars, tatoos, facepaint and more. There are about 12 different items to choose from in each catagory, so it'll be hard to find someone exactly the same. The maps are bright and very straight to the point. Most maps are just paths to the objectives which makes sense. You have objective 1,2,3 and they are all laid perfectly on the map. Some people may not like this though as it may get old.Gameplay is innovative but I think it may take a patch or two to get it perfect. I say this because it seems a bit unfinished. Yet with a little bit of fine tuning, this can be great! Not to say I don't like the gameplay because I like the new approach on things but it can be just a bit smoother. Such as sometimes I'll want to pull up my iron sites and it'll shoot first from the hip before pulling up. Small things though that shouldnt mess up the experience. The Parkour system works fine but will take a bit of getting used to. That is what makes this shooter unique and gives it a lot of potential. The gunplay is ok. Such as what I mentioned above, sometimes things just just don't happen as instant as you want. Could be just lag though, which I have experienced as well while playing the campaign online. So I wouldn't take any points away for this. The only full complaint I have is that the AI is HORRIBLE! If you play single player, Your teamates simply stand in a spot and shoot the other team. No movement or anything. At times they may help with the objective but I wouldn't count on it.Sound- Sound is amazing. Every weapon sounds like it's supposed too and weapon attatchments have great sounds as well.Replay Value- As far as this goes, If you want to earn every weapon attachment or even just gain more rank. You could play this game for a good 2 months before getting completely tired of it. There are about 8 maps and missions for each map. You also can play for each side (Resistance and Security Forces) campaign. Which can also add some replay value even though each mission is the exact opposite of the other factions. (ex- Security- gaurd this door, Resistance- Breach this door). With some DLC and maybe some weapon add-ons, this game will add a lot of extra time and fun, which I am looking forward to this.Conclusion- This is a great game with potential. I only hope that this game doesn't go un-noticed. For people who love team based shooters, this is definetely the game for you. If you plan on playing solo, I would probably steer away from this game. It is team base and the AI isn't good enough at the moment to buy simply for single player gameplay. This shooter is VERY team based. Medics are so essential and everyone must play together and communicate. So if you plan on getting this be ready to do those things. I would rate this game a 8/10 but can see this getting a much higher score if they fix some things.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2011"}

(wasn't even 3 dollars with shipping included)Prior to getting this game, I heard mixed opinions about this game and didn't know what to make of it. Now that I have it. I'll review it.Here's my review-Graphics-You'd think with the Virtual Texture Technology advertised for this game it would at least be a good looking game. Sadly, Brink is either too dark or it's textures are popping in constantly. At times, I'd take a look at the ground and it has no texture whatsoever. Even after installing this game to my hard drive, I was unable to see any improvement other than a slight difference in load times.Brink does have a consistent frame rate which maintains a smooth 60fps, only slightly dropping at times; but nothing noticeable.The color scheme in this game is slightly on the cartoonish side featuring pastel-esque palettes rather than the more conventional gritty tone.The maps are pretty big but the level design in this game doesn't bring anything new to the table. In fact, I was looking forward to some parkour when I noticed, I rarely even thought of using any other than perhaps getting the drop on an enemy from above.The characters look pretty good; but are cartoonish. Characters were reminiscent of RAGE (Xbox 360, PS3, Bethesda) with their cartoonish appearance. Big heads, oddly shaped body types and oversized feet are the norm, however, it's not that apparent being that you once you play Brink, the game's pace is fast and you'll often be trying to spot enemy AI which are uninspired. (red suits or clones)Nothing impressive here and really this may be the worst looking Bethesda game to date.Score- 6/10Sound-The sound is actually good in Brink. When you shoot a shotgun or a rifle or perhaps a handgun, it actually sounds like the weapon. (Especially the handgun and shotgun) The dialogue is interesting as well featuring a slew of different accents. (my favorite being the Carribean/Jamaican)In this department, I actually haven't one complaint being that the sound is satisfying.Score- 10/10Gameplay-This is where Brink has it's problems. But before I get into the Campaign, let me start off by saying you'll get the most fun out of multiplayer. Multiplayer can be played online against Humans and Bots or Offline against Bots. In either form of multiplayer, you're given options to tweak gameplay such as choosing objective based gameplay or all out TDM style gameplay. But in any event, Brink is teamwork oriented meaning that you're not going to get far trying to be John Rambo unless the difficulty is turned way down. The Bots have good aim and are good enough to play against if you can't get online. Also, against bots you'll earn rewards such as new weapons, skins, clothing, gear and perks.All in all and again, this is where you'll get the most enjoyment.Then you have the campaign...which is just endless spawning and objective based combat. In fact, the story's fairly weak and it plays nearly identical to multiplayer (and you're also granted rewards, the only difference is that the campaign is where you'll earn most of the achievements. (even though offline multiplayer or online mp earns them as well, just not the same achievements)The game's control is something that bugs me a little. Afterall, mapping \"run\" to one of the bumper buttons instead of the left analog stick when pressed in is weird. There's even two different runs in the game. If you press in the left analog stick and move, you'll move a little faster, but it seems more like a jog than a run and finally, when you press one of the bumper buttons for run, you move much faster like a real run.Aiming is a bit on the weird side also. Anyone whose played Section 8 for Xbox 360 can relate to aiming at an enemy and killing them much faster rather than hip fire. In Brink, hip fire does nearly any damage unless you're super close and even then you can still take a dirt nap courtesy of AI/online well placed shots from a shotgun or rifle.In any event, I also have a slight quirk with aiming in this game being that it feels strange. Even with sensitivity tuned, Brink gives me too much of a Killzone feeling. (not quite as bad but close) Aiming is a little on the sluggish side.Brink also brings some decent ideas to the plate that could've been better if these concepts were worked on. For example, in the beginning of Brink, you're given the freedom to create a character only to realize that there's tons of stuff to unlock, but nothing will stop your characters from looking odd. Also, and although this is a minor gripe to me, Brink doesn't give you the ability to create a female. (one of the standards in Bethesda games)However, what Brink does get right is how balanced the weapons and class system is.You can choose Soldier, Medic, Engineer etc and each class has it's pros and cons. For example, an engineer is able to place turrets throughout a level or repair bots, an engineer can even give boosts to it's infantry in the form of weapon perks. The Medic can revive infantry as well as himself when downed and the Soldier is similar to the Engineer but much better at close quarters combat.In addition to all the great shooting action Brink offers, you're given the weakest looking melee attack ever. Seriously, with games like MOH Warfighter, Battlefield 3 and 4, Killzone and such in existence, you'd think for once that a FPS game would have brutal looking melee kills; but sadly, this is not the case at all.If I actually paid 60 dollars for Brink, I'd be pissed due to it's lack of story and underwhelming gameplay mechanics (underutilized parkour), however, being that I paid not even 3 dollars for it, I'd call it a steal. It offers online and offline multiplayer which is a huge plus being that so many games force one option to work with. The sound design is nothing short of fantastic and although it's graphics are a bit underwhelming with texture pop-in or muddy textures, Brink still is an enjoyable experience. It's just unfortunate that with all the hype that surrounded this game when it initially launched, Brink did not live up to it.One of the best aspects I love about this game is that there's no lone-wolfing missions. Combat is realistic in a sense that playing 1 against 300 isn't even possible. The AI can be quite challenging and despite what other reviewers say about friendly AI, I purposely did not choose engineer in a few multiplayer and campaign missions and got past the mission just fine.Score- 8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

Hope you like crap!","reviewText":"Man back in the day duke 3d was an original ground breaking video game that set the bar for first person shooters. Not just because he was a foul mouthed alien killer that got tons of hotties but because duke nukem 3d took us to the next step in shooters out of the Doom age. It was fast paced and flashy and had combat nobody experienced in a shooter in those days.  Sadly,ever since then every duke nukem game has flopped.Why is this? The answer is simple. Duke nukem games since its mega hit in the early 90s only focus on 3 things. Toilet humor, boobies, and as much violence you can shake a stick at. Sure all that sounds fun. Especially for trashy kids that wouldn't know a good game if a WWE star shoved one down their throat. But for an actual gamer looking for substance to boobs, toilet humor and violence duke nukem forever has none.My wife bought this donkey turd for my bday one year because I was actually excited about it. Over 10 years in the making it should be awesome right? Well, it's pure badger poop.I've been playing games since I can remember learning to ride a bike and I've never seen a game this hyped fail this bad, that I've been so entertained at its failure. Playing this game is like watching  a 2 year old eat spaghetti. Sure it's kind of amusing at first, then you just start getting grossed out and you just want to eat in another room.Everything about this game is unoriginal. The gameplay, the weapons, the lame \"valve\" puzzles, the boring enemy AI, the plot that's just a reboot of the original duke 3d. It's just so boring and stupid. Duke nukem has made my poo list. Right next to halo, fable and madden series. Just another game company that lives off the name of there big games and give nothing new to the game industry. Shame on you duke and 3d realms, dig a grave and put you AND duke in it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B003Q55YCU","description":"","reviewerName":"P. Taegel","summary":"Wanted to love this game","reviewText":"OVERVIEW:Who doesn't want to play Red Dawn as a video game?  Superb idea.  Bafflingly uninspired execution.  I find it impossible to believe John Milius did anything more than contribute the premise.STORY:The US has been invaded, and the player is a pilot recruited by the Resistance.  But the specific objectives of the resistance are not clear.  To \"resist?\"  It's too vague an objective.  Although each mission has objectives, as a player I felt micro-managed because it was never clear what the overall objective was.  Think about every Alistair Maclean novel.  He doesn't just write about men on a mission to \"fight Nazis.\"  Rather, it's to \"destroy some cannons,\" \"rescue a general,\" etc.  And we get that the achievement of this goal will strike a terrible blow to the evil empire.  Homefront doesn't have a device like that to hook us into why we're slogging from location to location blowing stuff up and killing a bunch of idiots. Modern Warfare 2 is such a great game, because there's this guy Makarov we've got to stop and expose for his treachery.  Hence all the missions have a super objective to contextualize the immediate goals of the mission.CHARACTERS:The characters who accompany the player are passable.  However, the real disappointment is that you the player are a \"mute protagonist.\"  This idiotic convention that some games still cling to hamstrings the narrative's ability to tell a strong, character-driven story.  Think about how awesome Uncharted 2 is largely because of how fun it is to be Nathan Drake.  In Homefront, I know nothing of the character I control aside from the fact that he's a pilot.  Snoresville.  (And incidentally, the levels where you finally get to pilot a helicopter are tedious).  No relationships develop.GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is somewhat straightforward, although if it were any more linear it would be on rails.  The AI knows you're present automatically, so forget about trying to be stealthy.  There is one stealth-ish level, but your moves are so choreographed (a guy tells you whom to shoot and when) that it saps the exhilaration of being able to take in a board and figure out who to take out and how.  The cover system functions, although a thin piece of particle board protects against bullets as well as a stone pillar.  This is true with shooting as well.  You can't shoot enemies through anything opaque.  If it weren't for the high-res graphics, the gameplay would be closer to Ps2 than anything else.  It just wasn't very robust or interesting.IN CONCLUSIONThis game is worth a play-through if you find yourself having exhausted every other shooter out there and find it on sale for under $15.  If you want a good action/shooter and  haven't played through Uncharted, Uncharted 2, Killzone 2, Killzone 3, Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare, Bioshock, Dead Space, Dead Space 2, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2, Metal Gear Solid 4, Red Dead Redemption, Singularity, Medal of Honor or Vanquish, (to name a few) -- pick any one of those and go to town.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX3KG","description":"","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"A refreshing experience","reviewText":"Games like Rayman Origins are uncommon in the PS3/360 space, so this was a very refreshing experience. This game is all about obliterating enemies, careful platforming, and, above all, collecting things. This is also a game that's best enjoyed with others. Here's my review:Setting/Graphics: 4.5/5This is quite the colorful game. It has a unique visual aesthetic that's very cartoony, but incredibly detailed. Many things have eyes, making the world feel very much alive. This game will put you in high spirits. You'll play through jungle, desert, icy, underwater, and mountain levels. What I didn't like, though, is that although there are 10 Hub worlds, from which you enter levels, 4 of them share the same themes as worlds you've already visited. So you'll see, for example, 2 jungle Hub worlds. It's a shame because I wanted to see even more diverse level themes.Gameplay: 5/5----Typical navigation----Combat consists of slapping your enemies and causing them to inflate and pop. While you'll do your fair share of popping, the highlight of this game is platforming. You can sprint, wall-jump, slide, swing on ropes-there's a bunch of thrilling things you can do. Nymphs will grant you special abilities when you rescue them, adding moves to your platforming reservoir. These moves are implemented naturally in gameplay, such as wall-running and changing size.----Big moments----Frequently, the game mixes up the action by putting you in high-tension moments. During these times, you might run from a behemoth-sized creature, jump between pieces of a collapsing structure, fly a mosquito that shoots pellets and can suck in enemies, or face off against giant bosses. You won't be feeling monotony any time soon.Objectives: 4.5/5This game is big on collecting. In each level, you earn Electoons for finding hidden cages, collecting a certain number of Lums, and completing the time trial. There are 246 Electoons total in the game, so you can imagine how much content there is. Aside from the Electoons, there are special accomplishments; you earn Ribbons for collecting 350 Lums, and Speed Trophies for completing time trials in even faster times. Finally, there are 10 frantic platforming levels that have you chasing Skull Tooth that, when collected fully, will unlock a new, hardcore level. Obviously, Electoons are the star of the show. They're used to unlock \"new\" characters, but these are recolorings of the only 3 characters you're able to play as. Why should I care then?Co-op gameplay: 4.5/5The game truly is better with others. Normally, you die and go back to a checkpoint when you're hit. But with others, you become a moving bubble when hit and will respawn when your partner(s) hit you, so no-one's ever left out of the action for too long. Having others also makes Lum-collection and difficult platforming sections much easier, as you'll essentially have extra attempts all at once. And I'm glad that players have infinite lives, because you'll find that this will be quite a blessing at some points. The co-op isn't perfect, however. It may be funny to hit around other players, but when you're dealing with tense situations like time trials, being able to hit each other, even when you don't mean to, is highly irritating. It slows you down and can lead to your deaths quite frequently. Ubisoft should have given us the option to disable player contact when we want to.Overall: 4.5/5Rayman Origins is a nice break from all of the M-rated shooter games we face nowadays. It's a game packed full of humor and colorful aesthetics. The platforming is well-done, and there's tons of collecting to do. Co-op is largely a fun time, especially during those big moments where cooperation comes in handy. My complaints lie with recycled themes, pointless unlockable characters, and a lack of the option to disable hitting partners in co-op. But at the end of the day, this is a worthwhile experience that's sure to take you away to a well-realized fantasy world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use.

Being middle-aged it is hard for me to get excited about new game systems, but two years ago I was impressed by the Wii and now even more so by the Xbox 360 Arcade. We selected this system because we wanted a game system for our living room that had more popular games (Halo, Assassin's Creed, etc) and wanted it to be able to download Netflix videos (which it does with a Xbox Live Gold subscription and a Netflix unlimited plan).Setup of the basic system was very easy and we installed theXbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter A/B/G Networks Onlyright away so came up on-line right away. After entering the basic setup information, the system took a network pushed code update (about a half hour) and we were ready to play.The graphics are so impressive on our 46\" HDTV. There is an HDMI port on the chassis, so it was just a standard HDMI cable (not included) connection into our TV.The game controllers are a joy to use, with the buttons intuitively placed and having great ergonomics. The system came with only one controller, but we bought 3 others so the whole family could play.The on-line capabilities are almost overwhelming, from the Netflix capabilities to the multiplayer gaming, there is so much to do.

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Naughty Dog does it again","reviewText":"I'm really not sure what I can add to what has already been said about this game.  Uncharted 3 continues the series' tradition of excellence with the biggest and boldest entry yet.  Perhaps the worst thing I can say about the game is that it isn't as huge of a leap forward from its predecessor as Uncharted 2 was over the original Uncharted.  But overall, I found Uncharted 3 to be the best game in the series by a narrow margin.Much of the enjoyment in this game came from the improved melee system.  I found myself taking out probably half of the game's enemies in this method.  Not only are the fisticuffs improved, but Drake will now use objects in the environment to take out his foes, such as walls, beer bottles, and even raw fish being sold in a Middle Eastern market (I'm not kidding).  The excellent stealth mechanic introduced in Uncharted 2 is still here and still as enjoyable as ever.  The gunplay in this game feels a bit different from the previous two entries and may take a bit of getting used to due to Drake's more natural body movement, but it works just fine once you get a hang of it.  Fans of the typically excellent platforming this series offers will be in heaven here, as platforming has a stronger focus in the core gameplay than it did previously.  Also, amazingly, this game fuses the cinematic with the gameplay in an even more seamless way than it's predecessors.  And all of it is accentuated with a story that is much more emotionally poignant and revealing than in the previous games.  You will come out of this game with a stronger attachment to, and a greater appreciation for, the characters...Drake and Sully in particular.Uncharted 2 was the best looking game on the PS3 until now.  I didn't think it was possible, but Naughty Dog has outdone themselves here in once again pushing the PS3 to its limits.  This game is absolutely gorgeous, and contains some of the most stunning visuals ever produced in a console video game.  Not only that, but they have also taken more risks with the level design and created some truly incredible set pieces that, at their best, outshine even what they accomplished in Uncharted 2.  This has, however, led to a game that is slightly more inconsistent than Uncharted 2, but still shines brighter overall due to the very high points the game reaches.  With this game, Naughty Dog has solidified the Uncharted series as the definitive action/adventure series of it's generation.This game's multiplayer mode is much more fully formed and much deeper than it was in Uncharted 2, and has provided me with many hours of enjoyment so far, and will no doubt continue to do so.  In addition, there are also co-op modes where you can undertake missions with friends, or team up and compete against other players on PSN.  Despite the fact that most players will be purchasing this game for the single player campaign, it is good to know that there is a lot of content here which adds quality value to the entire package.As expected, Uncharted 3 is a great game, an absolute must-play for anyone with a PS3.  It's as well-produced, as thrilling, and as fun as video games get.  Naughty Dog is to be commended for the excellent work they've done with the Uncharted series for the PS3, and I can't wait to see what they have in store for Nathan Drake and co. in the future.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2011"}

And the fighting/shooting parts are excellent.  But I'm an older gamer with some patience problems, so a trillion cut scenes are a few too many for me. Also, my least favorite part of the game was used for the climactic ending (spoiler alert).I find that some PS3 games \"use\" the flaws inherent in their character movement engine as factors in difficulty, especially the inability to truly see and move your character from/around all angles. All the Uncharted games have this, and so many of the \"difficult\" bits come from NOT being able to see where you're headed or making you run in what feels like the wrong direction relative to the usual controller movement (i.e. pulling the stick towards yourself to move the hero). Then the Uncharted games add to this flaw-difficulty gambit WITH some boogeyman thing like water or fire, or in the case of this game (SPOILER coming) Spiders...Again, it's not what a \"real\" character would experience: they'd be able to see what's ahead of them and what they are grabbing, etc.So the end of the game is a massive spider-chase (yawn) compounded by our hero having to be moved in all sorts of unnatural directions that the user can't really see or anticipate, to get away from said arachnids.

The Art was simplistic.  There was a serious lack of cutscenes.  All of the campaigns were identical and short.  The weapon selection was extremely limited...  Left 4 Dead 2 improves upon Left 4 Dead in almost every way, but is it enough for this game to be considered a true sequel?Concept:  10/10Four new Strangers must band together to fight off thousands of crazed zombies and survive the zombie apocalypse.  This time, the survivors can use melee weapons ranging from a frying pan to a chainsaw. A variety of multiplayer modes and mission objectives extend the gameplay.Gameplay: 9/10The gameplay is similar to the original:  Shoot undead and aim for the head.  The 4 survivors must fend off hordes of bloodthirsty, brain-hungry zombies and the AI Director randomly spawns power ups, weapons, and enemies.  Among the hordes of undead are special infected that can incapacitate a survivor; so teamwork is necessary.  All of the old creeps are back:  The bile puking Boomer, the strangling Smoker, the pouncing Hunter, the Tank, and the PMS Witch.  L4D2 has added three new villains.  The Jockey, a short fast undead that jumps on your back and steers you into fire, acid, or other bad places.  The Spitter, a trailer park princess who spits pools of acid that damage survivors over time.  The Charger, a fast tackling monster with the defensive rating of Ray Lewis.In order to combat these monstrosities, the survivors have more than twice as many guns in this game (14) including a Grenade Launcher and an AK-47.  The survivors can also find laser sites to improve accuracy, explosive rounds that knock back enemies, and incendiary rounds that cause undead to burst into flame.  Molotov cocktails, pipe bombs, and bile jars (which cause zombies to attack each other) can also be thrown to neutralize a zombie rush.The Survivor AI is pretty good most of the time, especially if you make an effort to slow down just a bit and stay with the group.  If you run off on your own, you're asking for trouble.  Once in a long while, the AI doesn't save you when you are incapacitated, causing you to die.  It feels more like a random bug, than bad design.  98% of the time, the AI is pretty good.Campaign:  8/10L4D had 4 campaigns that all had identical structure.  L4D2 has 5 campaigns composed of 4 or 5 levels with different mission objectives.  Collect objects and bring them somewhere, defend an area, or battle through an area.  In some levels, the AI director also causes rainstorms (Hard Rain) or changes the level layout just a bit (The Parish) to throw you off.  The variety of mission objectives really make each campaign feel unique.  Also, the storyline continues through all 5 Campaigns, making this feel more like a game, than a bunch of random maps.Multiplayer:  9/10L4D2 offers 2 Player Split Screen Coop Action, and 4 Player XBox Live Action for all of the Campaigns.  There's also a Versus mode, where 4 Survivors battle through a Campaign and 4 other players Spawn every 30 seconds and control Special Infected to try and exterminate the survivors.  This is GREAT FUN!  The Survival Mode is also back where Survivors hold out as long as they can against waves of undead.  There's a NEW Scavenger mode where survivors must collect Gas Cans and bring them to a designated area.  A NEW \"Realism\" difficulty mode makes the game even harder.  In this mode, friendly characters and objects are not highlighted and are much harder to see... also, the only way to bring a character to life is with a defibrillator.  So, good luck with that!Graphics: 7/10Like Nicole Kidman, the Source engine may have been super hot a while back, but it's starting to show its age just a bit.  This is especially true if you're one of the millions who have played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, which is the Megan Fox of graphics engines right now.Sound: 9/10The music is eerie and fun at the same time.  The growls and shrieks of the undead are unsettling, and the gunfire and explosions punctuate the action.  The characters' voice overs also have much more personality and add humor to break the tension.Maturity:  Swearing, Horror, Violence, and Gore...  You should probably be in High School or live in a tough neighborhood in order to play this game.Overall:  8/10Left 4 Dead 2 is a very fun game, with a great deal of improvements over the original.  For me, the original Left 4 Dead felt like 75% of a game.  It was a great idea, but the lack of production values and options really hindered the experience.  Left 4 Dead 2 feels like it should have been released as the original title because there's enough enjoyment in it to last a month... or more.  The new zombies, special infected, campaigns, weapons, modes make this a good standalone game, especially at a $40 price point that you can find pretty easily.  So, it's a good game for the price of an expansion... what's not to like?Buy it if you love killing zombies and you never tried the Original Left 4 Dead.Buy it if you will play online with your friends in the Campaigns, Versus, Scavenger, or Survival Modes.Rent it if you want to kill zombies for a week and aren't into multiplayer games.Rent it if you had your fill of zombie killing in Left 4 Dead 1.  There might not be enough here to warrant a full purchase.Avoid it if you didn't care for the first game.  It's not unique enough to stand alone.Avoid it if you are a graphics snob.If you enjoyed Left 4 Dead 2, don't buy Left 4 Dead 1 unless you're an obsessive collector.  Left 4 Dead 1 is a pretty big step backwards from 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2009"}

With Left 4 Dead and Dead Rising being the staples, Dead Island puts itself on the map as the true zombie simulator. It holds true to that statement with realistic combat, atmosphere, and a terrifying story (albeit it doesn't get really interesting until towards the end). You can pick one of four characters who each specialize in a certain weapon (sharp objects, blunt, throwing objects, and guns). You follow the four heroes through the story of the resort island Banoi that has been struck with some sort of biological weapon or disease. No one really knows. You must help the survivors get off the island, but things don't go according to plan.I would like to say that Dead Island feels like Fallout meets Left 4 Dead with a little bit of Dead Rising thrown in. The combat is superb if a tad unwieldy because it features an analog type combat system. The game is in first person so the last melee game in first person you probably played was Oblivion. You can move the weapon around via the right analog stick and pulling back and pushing forward brings out a full swing. It feels awesome because each weapon feels different and the game has a great dismemberment engine so when you aim for that part it will most likely come off. Even the shooting in the game is solid and that's a one-two punch that most games can't get right.There are RPG elements thrown in so when you complete missions or kill zombies you're earning experience. You get one point per level to use in one of three categories: Fury, Combat, and Health. Fury is a mode that you can activate to do ultra damage to enemies and earn 10x the amount of experience when doing so. There are a lot of way to upgrade and you won't get them all in one play through. Thankfully the game levels up with you so you won't run into areas that require level grinding to get past. A lot of the quests are mixed from escort missions, fetch quests, and zombie killing quests. There are undead people to kill as well, but most of them have guns so watch out.The atmosphere of the game is amazing and just really creepy. There are zombies everyone all shapes and sizes. The two most common are Walkers and Infected. Infected can not be avoided since they run at you faster than you can even run. There are Floaters, Thugs (these guys are almost impossible to take down when you first start), Suiciders (they explode), and the rare Butchers. Each zombie is freaking creepy and there is a huge variety of them since they change with each area you change from. The game is non-linear with huge open areas to explore at your leisure. Like Fallout you can collect stuff from pretty much anything and use it to make mods which there are dozens of. Some of these are awesome like attaching a saw blade to a bat, turning swords into shock weapons, making guns shoot fiery bullets etc. These are mostly found from completing missions so try to get all the side missions you can.You can drive in the game which feels just fine and is a blast to run over zombies, this is required in some missions and is best to travel long distances across the island. Also the areas vary from the beach, jungle, the city of Moresby, and the prison. There a huge variety in everything from weapons, zombies, and environments so you never really get bored with the game. While that's the core of the game you just always want to wander off and find people in distress (hey you are immune to zombie bites!) and just try every weapon out there as well as upgrade them at the work benches. Of course weapons break and need to be repaired which costs money and you can sell stuff, trade, and even pick money up out in the zombie wilderness.The game is also very hard most of the time since this game was designed for four player co-op. There is drop in-out co-op online which is a blast and there's plenty of people playing. A lot of the times missions are just so hard because you get too many zombies thrown at you for just one person. If you die you just wait 7 seconds and respawn, but you lose a lot of money as a penalty. The more money you have the more you will lose. This is a great idea, but healing is a problem since medkits are rare and food only heals you so much and you can't store it.The only problems with the game is that people with high-end PCs are jipped unless they go edit the config file themselves to push the graphics further. There are a lot of glitches, and the combat is awesome, but controlling it is a bit off and finicky. I mentioned that the difficulty is all over the place so expect some frustrating sections where you will die over a dozen times. While the story is good the characters are boring and not likeable and just feel pretty generic overall so this took a big hit for me more than anything. Overall Dead Island is my favorite zombie game so far and fans shouldn't miss it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000J9J9","description":"One of the best things about the Game Boy Color is that it's  basically an original Nintendo Entertainment System that can fit in  your pocket. What this means for gamers is that many of the great games  for the classic system are being ported to the Game Boy Color, giving  us a chance to re-play (or in some cases discover) the best game titles  from the '80s.Nintendo's ownSuper Mario Bros. Deluxeis among the first of  these conversions, and it certainly remains one of the best. Actually,  calling this game a conversion really doesn't do it justice. This  version actually contains more levels than the original game, including  the entire Japanese version and a slew of extras (such as a two-player  mode).The controls in this game are easy to grasp--even for novice gamers.  All Mario can do is jump (and shoot fireballs with the right power- ups), but it is amazing to see how much gameplay can be squeezed from  these simple actions when the controls work in direct harmony with a  player's thoughts. The only element of this game that could have been  better is that the Game Boy Color's screen isn't quite large enough to  show the entire layout of the original game screen, so players may  occasionally need to press up and down on the control pad to see some  offscreen action. While this can be distracting, it ultimately has  minimal impact on gameplay. If you are looking for the quintessential  side-scrolling platform game, you can't do much better thanSuper  Mario Bros.

{"product_name":"B0050SYZS0","description":"","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A collector's edition unboxing & game review","reviewText":"While the current price gouging on the collector's edition is a little over the top ($120? not worth it), if you can get this for around $80 (the original list price) this is a pretty good deal. Here is a review on what came in the box, as well as a quick, as-spoiler-free-as-I-can-make-it review of the game. Note that I got the Xbox 360 version; the other versions may be slightly different.The box comes with two DVD-sized cases in it. The first is a metal tin with the male Shepard on one side and the female on the other. Inside are the two game discs (which are a little hard to get out as the spindle to hold them in place is a *tad* too big and rigid), the standard Xbox LIVE page you would see in any manual, and four DLC codes. The first is for a two-day trial of Xbox LIVE Gold for those who don't already have it. The second if for a Normandy prop for your avatar. The third is for the \"From Ashes\" DLC, which is available to download for $10 to those who don't buy this edition. Finally, there is a code that activates the Online Pass (needed to access any online features of ME3) and downloads the collector's edition exclusive content, which include a suite of N7 weapons, a robotic dog that wanders around the Normandy between missions, an alternate appearance pack, and an in-game hoodie Shepard can wear on the Normandy. The weapons and appearance pack are nice, the other two are just fluff. Once this pass is activated, the user can download the soundtrack from Bioware's website.The other box contains the bonus physical content. There is a high-quality, velcro-backed N7 patch. The \"exclusive lithograph\" is more of a postcard of the Normandy in its new blue and white color scheme. The comic is actually a part one of the four-part Mass effect: Invasion series, which takes place between ME2 & ME3 and explains why Aria T'Loak is on the Citadel instead of Omega when you start ME3. Finally, there is a 70-ish page concept art book that I don't recommend looking at until you finish the game, as it contains spoilers both big and small.Note that there is no paper manual at all, not even the token controller layout. Everything is accessed in-game.As for the game itself, it gives you enough that you could dive in to ME3 without ever having touched the first two, though your experience will be far better if you import an ME2 save (preferably one that has ME1 data on it) because it will carry over all sorts of major and minor decisions you made, from who lived and died to random people you helped coming back to return the favor. Apparently there is a current glitch that does not let some people import saves, but the only hiccup I encountered was the game not realizing I had played the ME2 Overlord DLC when I ran into a character from there.ME3 plays more like ME2 than ME1 by default, but there are a host of gameplay options. Besides the standard difficulty options, you can also choose how decisions play out (i.e. whether you choose and make the story or let the game construct the story for you. Powers have also been tweaked, in that their more useful this game (unlike ME2 where you had to whittle down an opponent's protection, use a power, and then wait for a long time before you could use it again) and that instead of a four-tier upgrade path with one choice, you get a six-tier path with three choices, allowing for greater  customization. For example, both Kaiden and Garrus have Overload, but I tweaked Garrus so his Overload is devastating against one heavily-armored foe while Kaiden's does less damage but works over an area and is also effective against organic foes.A lot has been made over the Kinect voice-command functionality. While a neat trick, I found myself quickly going back to the standard shoulder-button controls in combat situations. I found the Kinect commands to have about a 1-2 second delay from when I finished the command to when it happened, and while it picked up on what I said 90-95% of the time, there was still enough unreliability to it that I stopped using it except in non-combat situations. The Kinect was also picking up the game audio at times, or interpreting non-game-related phrases as commands (How \"No, I already ate\" caused Shepard to throw a grenade still amuses me).Almost everything you do contributes to the Galactic strength and readiness ratings, which is basically your strength to take on the Reapers in a final assault. Note that it *is* possible to max out your effective military strength  bar only in single player, but to get the best ending (and a certain achievement) you actually need to get a boost above and beyond that, either by bonuses from importing, DLC or multiplayer. For perspective, I imported a ME1/ME2 save where only the minimum amount of people died (before you ask, *minor spoiler from the previous games* only my choice at the end of the Virmire mission in ME1) with a maxed-out level, I completed every ME3 mission and scanned every system to 100%, and I've downloaded and completed every piece of ME DLC out there, and I still didn't have enough, so I either have to play some multiplayer to get the readiness rating up (single player never budges it from 50%, and your effective military strength is your total strength times your readiness rating) or hope future DLC bumps me above some magic threshold.Speaking of multiplayer, it's basically a Mass Effect version of Firefight mode from Halo or Gears of War's Horde mode. In the single player campaign, there are seven N7 missions that take you to areas tangentially related to the main plot. When you beat the mission Admiral Hackett says something to the effect of \"We're sending in a team to secure it.\" That's the basis of multiplayer: you and up to three others are that team, and you fight off ten waves of Geth, Cerberus or Reaper forces before a final get-to-and-hold-the-extraction-point-until-dustoff wave. My completed matches average between 17 and 25 minutes apiece.While the seven maps are varied, and the six classes all play differently, I have a few gripes. The mission structure gets repetitive; some waves have you defend a terminal, hack a series of terminals, or take out four \"high-value\" targets, but they don't play much different as you still have to wipe the map clean. There is a noticable, disorienting lag when using shotguns or regular melee attacks in close range; I've had foes take shotgun blasts at point-blank range and suffer no damage, and foes register melee damage a full second after I hit them (registering the shot my teammate hit them with *after* I punched them first). The current level cap is 20, which has the double-whammy of not being sufficient to max out your abilities and being WAY too easy to obtain; I maxed out the Adept class in a single afternoon of playing. I'm just shy of 70 matches in the books, and my six classes are at 20, 19, 10, 7, 6 and 4 - even if I slow down, I'll max out everything within a month. Finally, the persistent unlockables, like new weapons, mods, and half the characters you can play as don't unlock at the same rate as the levels do. I've got 66 out of 100 levels, but only about 15 out of over 550 persistent unlockables (every one of the roughly 30 mods and roughly 25 weapons can be levelled up 10 times), and that's counting me actually buying three packs with real-live MS points (they can also be bought with in-game currency; the contents of the pack are randomly determined). I can easily see players maxing out the class levels and quitting, as the mods come so slowly players won't see them as worth the grind.Your single-player squad selection is also pretty small compared to ME2, but is comparable to ME1. Four are a given, two (Garrus and Tali)  are available if they survived ME2, and one is obtained via the \"From Ashes\" DLC. However, I found it was hard to find more than one combination that works for most situations. For example, with my soldier-class character, only the Shepard/Liara/Kaiden team had the combination of abilities to tackle any foe. If your class has biotic or tech powers you'll find more options. I also felt cheated out of my previous squad. You're teased with the likes of Miranda, Kasumi and Thane throughout the game, but you only see them for a bit and then they're gone.For me, the story was great up until the last ten minutes. The last mission contains the single hardest battle in all three ME3 games, but then ends with an encounter similar to the one at the end of ME1, but without the awesome boss fight. And whereas the rest of the decisions you make in the story are either moral (Paragon) or practical (Renegade), the three-option decision you are confronted with in the endgame really has no satisfying conclusion, and one of them is downright implausible for a series that has been so grounded in reality (or at least the realistic sci-fi equivalent; let's just say option three crosses over into the \"fantasy\" category too much). I would have been far happier with a simpler conclusion than anything I was given the option to select. In the gravest sin of a game based on player choice, I felt like the 200+ hours of decisions I made leading up to the point meant nothing.In summary, gripes about the ending and squad selection aside, the game stays true to its ME2 roots while improving on the core single-player experience. For big fans of the series, the Collector's Edition has some nice perks that justify the additional cost. Those who are only casual fans would be better served buying the regular edition and then downloading \"From Ashes\" by itself to save a few bucks; this particular DLC is pretty integral to the whole Mass Effect mythos, and I'm surprised and more than a little disappointed it was not included in the standard game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2012"}

Unfortunately, it has a handful of really bad sequences, and the most annoying loading times of any PC game.Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault, when it's on, when you're actually playing the darn thing, can be tense, exciting, and thrilling. But, often, you are looking at a progress bar instead. Hoooooooo, boy does this game suffer from loading times. I would have to say that this game has the worst ratio of \"loading screen to gameplay time\" that I have ever experienced. The bad loading times amplify the incredibly annoying quick save/reload fests that you get into near the end of the game, which leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth about this game.To some degree, Pacific Assault follows other World War 2 games like Allied Assault and Call of Duty. The game is mostly linear, and it contains a lot of mayhem mixed in with scripted events. However, this is definitely not just another World War 2 game. It is different in some good ways.For starters, Pacific Assault's on-foot action is less scripted than other WWII games have been. The jungle firefights remind me a lot of last year's \"Vietcong\" than Allied Assault. You creep slowly through the jungle and encounter small groups of Japanese troops, and then engage them in short but sweet firefights. The firefights are mostly unscripted, relying instead upon this game's underrated AI. Both your squad mates and your enemies are pretty smart about staying alive and using cover. It's very satisfying to relieve your pinned down squad by finding a way to flank your enemies, and then blast them from their rear. Sometimes, the hardest part of a firefight is just finding where the enemy is hiding. Using cover is paramount to surviving, and so is popping out from behind cover to deliver quick blasts with your weapon. Enemies will attempt to do the same to you. However, sometimes, when you are winning a battle, the last couple of guys in a Japanese squad will rush at you screaming in a mad, desperate Banzai frenzy. This leads to some truly memorable moments.The medic is a great mechanic that seems to borrow from games like Halo and Vietcong. The idea is that instead of picking up frequent health packs and armor, you can be healed if you find some safe cover for a while. This adds a tactical level to the game that most first person shooters don't have.The jungle scenes are the best part of this game in every way. It's too bad that you have to play the game for an hour and a half before you experience them. That's how long it takes you to get through the tutorial level and the disappointing Pearl Harbor level. The game mixes up the action quite a bit. Specifically, there are rail-shooter and turret-shooter sequences sprinkled here and there, where you shoot at enemies while riding in the back of a truck or operate an anti-aircraft gun and shoot down Japanese Zeroes. There is even a flying mission. None of these other missions are particularly memorable, and some of them are quite bad. There is one ridiculous \"shoot down Zeroes with an AA gun\" scene that is literally impossible until you learn that there is a lame trick that makes it easy to complete in about 60 seconds. It takes dozens of trial-and-error quick save and reload sequences to learn this (or, you can look on the internet for it), and this totally ruins that part of the game.The visuals aren't as nice as Half-Life 2 or Far Cry, but they are still very good. The water, fire, and smoke, all look very nice. Best of all is the most beautiful and realistic looking sky that I have ever seen. The jungle is also very convincing. The music is sort of generic, but it's high quality stuff. Best of all, the game feels very authentic. It maintains the high drama of the other World War 2 games, while giving it a different feel too.The campaign ends after about 10 hours, which isn't very long, considering that at least 2 or 3 of them are spent looking at the loading screen. The way that the loading screens disrupt this game's flow cannot be understated. The ending is also horribly unsatisfying. I absolutely hated the ending level of this game with a passion. It is a maddeningly and impossibly difficult, unforgving quick save fest where you are constantly getting cut down by two or three machine gun nests at a time, all of which can reduce you from full health to zero in about two seconds. The entire last two hours of the game is filled with trial-and-error and trying to scamper from cover to cover in increments of about three feet, reloading your game constantly as you get cut down in seconds. The last level is filled with barbed wire (which you cannot climb over) and invisible walls, which funnel you into these death trap trenches that have machine gun nests awaiting you at the end, and absolutely no alternate path. The game gives you no flamethrower or bazooka, and no ability to call in naval strikes. The design for this level is abysmal, and it's a shame that the awesome jungle levels are overshadowed by this frustrating turd in the punch bowl.The verdict?  I guess it's worth a look.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Game Changer?","reviewText":"A few hours since delivery... I'm impressed. Just about everything about the PSV: display, controls, features, the games - top of the line. This is a gaming machine that shouts \"quality\" and, after the first few hours of playing Uncharted and a couple of small games off the PSN, I can say that I've had the best portable gaming experience ever - we currently have a PSP and a DSi in the house plus a couple of tablets and smart phones.Briefly - and I will update my review as I experience more of the PSV - these are my findings so far.HARDWARE AND FEATURESI'm not going to get into details because Amazon's page has it all. Yes, it's quad-core this, and super-high-rez display that but what counts is that it translates into a super-smooth gaming experience with a bunch of non-gaming capabilities on top. I'm surprised how immersive playing a game on such a small screen with such tiny speakers can be. And it is so for a couple of reasons.- the sharpest, best looking display I've seen on a portable- the dual analog sticks make all the difference - Sony learned from past mistakes- the back touch panel are something that it's better to experience because it's the one clear innovation on this machine and it won't give you headaches (sorry Nintendo :) )- games can be either downloaded or purchased and shared on physical media - like I said, Sony is learning from past mistakes (sorry PSP Go)- seamless integration with the PS3 and the Playstation Network- a bunch of great multimedia apps including Netflix - I'll have more to say about these after I stop playing Uncharted :)- cameras - more later but I heard that some games allow you to build characters that look just like youTHE GAMING EXPERIENCEAnyone who has a PS3 or a PSP should feel very familiar with the PSV. All the PS3 controls are there although some of the buttons are smaller. Add to that the 'touch' capabilities on both front and back with support for gestures and the gaming possibilities are almost endless. Because of its high resolution, there can be a lot happening at the same time on the PSV's screen and, don't forget, you can also feel the action while playing.I don't feel like doing comparisons at this time but anyone who claims that the PSV is no big deal because we can play games on our phones should experience the PSV and then consider revising their statements. Vita can easily play any one-dollar game that a phone can play and I'm sure we'll get a couple of those and Vita can do just about everything a smart phone or tablet can do and most of the time do it better, but no phone or tablet can play Uncharted and no 'next generation' phone or tablet is likely to be able to play Uncharted or Little Big Planet. And, let's not forget that the Vita costs a less than most smart phones.EVERYTHING ELSEI haven't had time to explore all of Vita's features yet but, they're all in there. Multimedia, wireless connectivity, music playback... it's all in there. Add to that one of the best laid out, intuitive and responsive user interfaces and even non gamers should be happy to have a Vita around.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKEA couple of things. The most annoying is, of course, the hyper-overpriced memory card. You can't play 'big games' without one and Sony decided to make lots of money on this proprietary 'must have' add-on which is anything but optional. Then there's of course Sony not making the Passport program available in the US. We have a PSP and lots of games on UMDs. Not being able to play them on the Vita is very frustrating.Other than that... perhaps I should have titled my review 'gamer changer' because the Vita is likely to change me into a more active portable player. I used to prefer the PS3 over the PSP but I'm not sure this will always be the case in the future. I know that I won't put the Vita down until I'm done with Uncharted and once I complete that there are at least half a dozen games available on lunch date that I'd like to play.Oh and... I don't really like sharing our Vita with the kids at this time but I have to :)____________________________________________NOTES OF CAUTIONBefore deciding whether you want to buy a Vita and as you are budgeting for one, keep the following in mind:* SINGLE-USER SYSTEM - or so it is meant to be at this time. Like the PSP, the Vita will recognize only ONE account. Unlike the PS3, you can't have other members of your family or friends log with a sub-account. If you are planning to share the PSV, Sony suggests that individual users keep their game saves on separate memory cards but you will still be logged on the Vita as the one user who 'owns' it.* TROPHIES - A Sony representative confirmed to me that only the 'owner' will get credit for the trophies, no matter who may be earning them during gameplay because the PSV only recognized one user.* DOWNLOADS - If you buy a 'download' you will have to download that game on each of your family members memory cards who wish to play that game individually.* MEMORY CARDS SIZE - see above for the multiple users scenario. In addition, get the biggest memory card you can possibly afford. The size of downloaded games tends to be enormous. Uncharted alone is 3.2 GB which is just about all that a 4 GB card can hold. Most games I care about seem to be 2 GB or larger.* DON'T PLAN ON BUYING MANY DOWNLOADABLE GAMES - see above. Half a dozen downloaded games would fill up your 16 GB memory card with little room for anything else. I would buy games on physical media whenever possible.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}

The only thing that's relatively \"new\" to the classic Mario side scrolling formula here is that the graphics have been revamped using 3-D models, and it looks glorious.  The gameplay is the simple yet addictive kind of fun that those of us who grew up with the original 8-bit Nintendo know and love, as you can play as Mario and Luigi and travel through 8 worlds to save the Princess from Bowser.  There's some new power ups here worth mentioning, including a turtle shell which gives you some extra strength, and the giant mushroom which makes you so big you take up the whole screen as you trample through the level stomping everything in your path.  The game makes decent use of the touch screen, particularly in the mini-games featured here, all of which help make New Super Mario Bros. the best action game for the DS right now.

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S. BubPros:Compelling, well-told storyGood action and combatFantastic sound and graphicsCons:Plot is familiar to fans of kung fu action filmsTask-and-exploration gameplay might seem slow to action gamers","reviewerName":"steven","summary":"Good game, very unique but overpraised","reviewText":"Shenmue is a very strange and unique game. It was the most expensive game ever made at the time and is praised by many as a 10 out of 10 game and the best Dreamcast game. I enjoyed playing Shenmue a lot but I just don't think it's as good as its fan's say.The game is about Ryu who is on a hunt for the man who killed his father. Its an RPG, the combat is like an arcade style fighting game and it has investigation part similar to an old school L.A. Noire. In the game you have to go around and find clues, usually by talking to the right people at the right time, then as you make progress at certain times you get in fights with people, either thought quick time events or by arcade style fighting. This gives Shunmue alot of variety in game play. The open world was very impressive at the time. Shenmue Is completely unpredictable one minute you're fighting a group of thugs, the next minute you're driving a fork lift moving crates. Shenmue has a lot of attention to detail, the town completely changes depending on the time of day, weather or time of year. It has the best graphics I've seen on the Dreamcast. There are a lot of extras too, you can go play an arcade game, collect sonic toys, or practice your moves.This all sounds great but Shenmue has its fair share of problems that its fans sometime ignore being:The game's story is extremely generic, some fans say that it makes up for this by being well told but I disagree. It could have been well told if it actually made you care about the characters. The problem is that the game just drops you in Ryu shoes without any back-story and most of the characters don't talk about themselves that often and if they do it's not anything important. How can I care about the characters if I don't know them? Also parts of the game are too slow. There's a time system but there is no way to skip time. So at some parts someone might tell you to meet them somewhere tomorrow and often there's nothing fun to do till then.These other complaints may sound like nitpicking but they add up: the voice acting is terrible, quick time events are overused, the fork life segments where funny the first day but where extremely boring all the other days.To summarize I like Shenmue, it's fun, unique and unpredictable but the generic story, all the long boring segment's and the lack of any reason to care about the characters prevent Shenmue from being the 10 out of 10 its fan's say it is. I give it 8.5 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2013"}

It's been over half a year since I last played this game... Maybe, just maybe... Blizzard fixed the stupid Skirmish A.I. and the game might be fun now...\" Boy was I wrong, as I cannot even play the game anymore because of blizzard treating its paying customers as if they were criminals. They might as well ask for a fingerprint and D.N.A. sample before being able to play. Maybe I need to take a test of some sort before they deem me worthy to play a game I PHYSICALLY OWN! Hell the C.I.A. and F.B.I. websites have less log-in requirements than this freaking game.I have to REMOVE ALL STARS because this game is no longer playable due to the sheer amount of loops needed to jump through just to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!!! There is nothing wrong with my FIOS fiber-optic connection! There is nothing wrong with my firewall! There is no reason to have to activate a game (for the sixth time!!) I LEGALLY OWN AND HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY OF IN THE DRIVE! It tells me I need to link my game to the battle.net account but doesn't give me a link or any decent information as to HOW TO DO THIS! I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AT ALL IN ANY MODE!! I cannot even log onto the game as a GUEST on my own computer! I DON'T EVEN PLAY MULTI-PLAYER!! Why the bleep do I need to log onto 3 different places to play OFFLINE SINGLE-PLAYER!?!? This is beyond ridiculous!If this is their idea to try and stop piracy, then they failed, because this kind of treatment of PAYING CUSTOMERS just drives PC piracy through the roof.If there is any class action lawsuit against blizzard, or way to return the game, please let me know because I want my $60+ dollars back!!!!!EDIT #3!!I just got the retail release... Been waiting 10 years for this... I have to say it is more hype than it delivers on. Yes the controls are still nice and simple, I enjoy that a lot... But it just seems to be Starcraft 1 minus the brood war expansion, with a bit better graphics thrown in. Forgive me for being blunt and critical with this but THEY HAVE HAD OVER 10 YEARS TO MAKE THIS GAME!!!First off the price was outrageous, but like an idiot fanboy I shelled out $60 bucks for 1/3rd of a game... Considering that this is only the Terran campaign and that the Protoss and Zerg campaigns will not come out for over a year from now, and they will cost an additional $60 each, as far as I know at the moment! Though there are rumors they may be expansion priced at $20 a pop (in all honesty they should be FREE Down-Loadable-Content since it should have been in the game from the beginning!). So Blizzard is becoming even more greedy than EA. Sure when EA releases a game it's too soon, half-a$$ and buggy as all hell, but at least it is mostly there. Blizzard, on the other hand releases a game, a million years after the first game, fully polished and de-bugged, but missing 2/3rds of the gameplay and no big improvements over the original!The game runs fine on ultra settings for me with vista ultimate x64, 8gigs of ram, and an Nvidia 9800gtx+ card, but I am a bit disappointed considering there has been over 10 YEARS of 3D RTS advancement from the original Starcraft... What I mean is: You CANNOT rotate the camera, only zoom in and out a little bit so sometimes trying to click on one unit in a group of many is a nightmare. You CANNOT rotate the placement of buildings so everything is always facing only one direction, not that bad but units still come out of the sides or backs of buildings through walls instead of the front door... The is NO anti-aliasing support, not that bad, but my computer is a gaming rig. So compared to the older Command & Conquer Generals, or the newer Command and Conquer 3, or Supreme Commander and many other RTS games out there already; this game is actually BEHIND the times in graphics and 3D battlefield control.One of the worst things is the online requirement... But fortunately it is only checked occasionally so this can still be played offline with a laptop, but in that case you have to log on as a \"GUEST\" for a game YOU OWN on a computer YOU OWN! But BEWARE, when you register the game they ask you VERY PERSONAL THINGS, like: name, age, sex, location, telephone number, and even your street address! And you HAVE to fill it out or else you cannot play the game!Now for the gameplay... It is just as awesome as the first Starcraft! I am having a blast with it... But that is because this is JUST LIKE the first Starcraft, some of the levels feel like they just took them from the first game and threw in more eye-candy. If you LOVED BASE BUILDING then keep playing the original Starcraft, because this game seems to have been made for the A.D.H.D. And A.D.D. generation, too many levels are small and set with a TIME LIMIT... Come-on Blizzard! You can do better than tiny little 10 minute levels... Though there are still some large maps and unlimited time levels for us base builders. But I miss the huge levels from Broodwar and the original Starcraft where you would have to send out search patrols all over the map to find that last enemy building or objective. I think they spent more time on the cut scenes and in-between game down time than the level design and map sizes, some of the levels feel downright cramped claustrophobic. There are some new, and quite AWESOME units in this game, but there are also lots of missing favorites from the Broodwar expansion. Though one of the new elements I find interesting is the downtime between missions where you can purchase unit upgrades, talk with crew members \"Point and click\" style, and choose the next missions a bit less linear than the first Starcraft, so it has a bit of RPG elements thrown in. They have also jumped onto the whole \"Achievements\" bandwagon so you get these annoying popups now and then that apparently give you bragging rights online or something like that. When you get these achievements, they don't actually do anything that I am aware of in the game other than unlocking portrait pictures for the forums online community.This game gets 5 STARS for fun because it is just as fun as the first Starcraft, but... It only gets 2 STARS overall for the fact that in over 10 years they could only give us 26 missions in ONE PLAYABLE CAMPAIGN, and slightly updated game-play graphics (one of my friends couldn't tell the difference between the original Starcraft and this one), while taking away LAN play, taking away some favorite units, and jumping on the \"ALWAYS ONLINE\" and pointless achievements intrusive bandwagon.I loved the original Starcraft to death, so I honestly thought this one would be a bit more updated compared to the original. It is still a very fun game, but I would say... Wait a few more years for a game of the year edition, or a reduced price box-set with everything included, unless Blizzard nickel and dimes its fans to death first.*edit #2*Player vs. A.I. is completely messed up, the A.I. does not even make base defenses until 30 minutes into a match and even then it makes only 3 and in a weird place. A.I. also attacks the entry to your base that is nearest to the A.I. base and completely ignores undefended points of your base if they are farther than your main entry point. A.I. also just creates a large mass of units and sends them all at once making the A.I. very easy to defeat with even bad units. Multi-player and VS. A.I. has a lack of unit types, basically half of what you got in the campaign. Every day I play this, it feels more like a still in development beta release.I will continue to update this review as things get worse or better over time.---BOTTOM LINE---Just play the original Starcraft and Broodwar expansion because this is 1/3rd of a game with a slight 3D graphical update, sparkly cut-scenes, and the most draconian and annoying start-up and log-in procedure of any game I have ever played.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}

Usually launch titles aren't the greatest games a system has to offer, but are all in all a fun experience.  The gameplay of this game is pretty much the same as any other first person shooter with new features that implement a great gaming time.  In this game, you can dual wield like weapons (ala Halo 2) and you can lean against walls and peak around corners.  This adds a whole new element to this game and makes it a lot of fun.  The single player campaign (although short) is a lot of fun and worth playing at least 2 times through; one time by yourself and once co-op over Xbox Live.  While playing through this game I noticed how good the graphics were and such an improvement between the xbox and the 360.  Some people say that the graphics are too shiny, but I think that it looks amazing and for a launch title it's definitely up to par.  Things like lighting and wall textures really took me by surprise with how good they looked.  The story of the game is, on the other hand, a bit strange, confusing, and just plain wacky.  I didn't really mind this as much as I though because it was the gameplay itself that kept me playing and not the confusing storyline.  Overall, the single player game gets a solid 8/10.The multiplayer game didn't live up to all the hype that it had gotten.  I was expecting my next \"Halo 2\" to keep me hooked to my 360 all night.  This was not the case.  Its not that the graphics turned me off, or that it was a whole new changed experience, the game just didn't play as well over xbox live as I would have hoped.  The aiming felt off and it seemed like such luck whenever I got a kill.  Overall, the multiplayer experience is pretty much up to personal opinion.  I know a lot of people who love it, others, like myself, who find it strange and unbalanced.  It's definitely a rent for those wanting to play through a fun single player campaign, and for those who like what its multiplayer has to offer then they will probably buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}

I believe there is something like 10 of them in the game. While they are excellently balanced, more would have been nice.All in all, Halo is still a must buy. It is fun, and if you have a bunch of friends over, is a blast. The repetive environments are the only bad thing in the game.

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Carolyn \"Dedicated Yaoi Fan.\"","summary":"My mom loves it, but I'm more experienced with games...","reviewText":"One of the reasons I purchased this game is because it stars Luigi. It is his first game where he stars alone, but not completely as the plot has a lot to do with Mario: to save him!As you would have guessed this game is about Luigi's Mansion, which he won in a competition he didn't even enter, he invited his brother Mario to visit it with him. But when Luigi got there, Mario was gone and the Mansion was overrun with ghosts. When Luigi meets Prof. E. Gadd his goal becomes clear: get rid of the ghosts, find out the source of why this is happening and save his brother Mario ~ and it may all have something to do with the Boo's and Bowser. And what's worse is that Luigi accidentally let the Boo's run riot around the Mansion again, all 50 of them.The gameplay plays like a platformer with 3D environments, along with Nintendo addition of a few Mario traits (like in the music room, playing the Mario Bros theme).Luigi is in full control of a vacuum cleaner that sucks up ghosts and multiple other things in the environment to search for keys for the next door. Sadly that's where the difficulty sets in and reputation lies. You must find so many keys, fight a boss and then it's onto the next level to do the same thing. Along with annoying startled-jumps from Luigi when ghosts appear.Catching ghosts other then `Portrait Ghosts' seems pointless except in some rooms where you will earn a key for defeating them. You don't get coins or points from normal ghosts only on rare occasions of hearts to replenish health.One thing that got to me, was Luigi can't actually jump, punch or pound like Mario is known for, instead is one and only weapon is the vacuum cleaner. Along with this Gameboy Horror to search things.Also the camera angles in boss battles are annoying.A cute addition is the mushroom that causes Luigi to get small, and the pressing of the Nintendo A button, which has his call out \"Mario!\" but beware, collecting coins is one of your main goals and you will lose them when you get hit by ghosts. The main purpose of the coins is not to buy items or weapons, instead it is more of your score at the end of the game to purchase your own mansion, which you cannot enter and instead is a picture in the gallery of Prof. E. Gadd.The replay value is minimal, as in, the only new thing you unlock is the `Secret Mansion' which is the original Mansion mirrored.I know this review may seem a little negative but it was a really fun game. But short and not a lot of things to do but walk around, many scenes aren't skippable so it makes pressing the A button routine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2006"}

The Blu-Ray is nice but you might want to see how the battle shapes up in Blu-Ray VS. HD-DVD battle before you commit to the Blu-Ray format.  This could be the Betamax vs VHS all over again and I would hate to think that in a couple of years time the Blu-Ray is dead and there fewer movies released in the Blu-Ray than HD-DVD.  But by that time the price will have dropped and will be great gaming system even if Blu-Ray loses to HD-DVD.If you do not plan to connect online with the system then I would recommend the 20GB system and you can purchase memory cards if needed. The abilty to use memory cards is still nice and many people with the 60GB system will be using them to.  Very convenient to take a game save, on a memory card, over to a friends house.  The 60GB is a must if you plan to connect online because there are plans for downloadable content, including games and additions to released games and the 20GB would fill up to fast, probably with one download.  But to be honest the 60GB system is not going to be enough if you plan to download content frequently. I suspect you may even see a larger hard drive PS3 down the road, like a 200GB version, especially if the dowloadable content offered by Sony is a big success.There is no reason to pay more than retail anymore.  Considering there were about a fifth of the PS3s available compared to the WII, the PS3 secondary market prices are virtually the same and the WII retails for half of the PS3! PS3s are getting returned in record numbers.  If you go to any of the mainstream retailers there is a good chance you will find a system or two waiting for you.  Just stand around the service/returns counter and there is a very good chance you will see one returned right in front of you and many times they are still sealed because they are being returned by resellers.  If you can I would wait a few months to buy one even if you find it at retail because there just is not enough to do with it right now(unless you've fallen hook line and sinker for Blu-Ray movies because the price is similar to a Blu-Ray player by itself).  By this summer the games lineup should double and there will probably be a couple that make the purchase worth while.The PS3 is still a recommended purchase but don't pay more than retail.  Buy it as a Blu-Ray player now and second as a game console.  Eventually the PS3 will be worth the purchase as a game console no matter how the Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD battle turns out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2007"}

First off it only took 1 1/2 days to beat this game(about 17 hours on and off of playing)At first starting off you would probably say wow nice graphics and this could be a good story. Well 30 mins later you're like wtf because they take you to the past and it's hard to tell when you are in the past or what so the story will be kind of bumpy and it's simple. Kill 3 chicks and that's pretty much all you're doing. Sad that Zues or Hades didn't get into the mix. But that's pretty much it lol, oh yeah PUZZLES are so stupid on here. most of the time you will ask yourself what to do in the middle of a puzzle. Then you look up a youtube video and see how it only takes 30 seconds to solve the puzzle when reallya they leave you in the middle of no where to start the puzzle off. So yeah Puzzles on this game are just stupid and not fun. I notice the enemies on this game are a lil bit quicker than other games, so if you think you can get them in a pile and bust em up nope because they are usually scattered out and throwing something at you to mess your combo up so that sucks.Overall I think out of the 4 consoles god of wars this one comes in at 4 at sucking the most. It's just none of the enemies are badass. Kratos does learn new stuff this time around but Kratos from GOW1,2,3 would demolish this guy if they had to fight. So like everyone else said this was probably just a quick game sony made in under a year to get some quick cash but it looks like no one is interested. I'm sure they where like wow it's been almost 4 years it's time for a GOW game on the consoles. So buy this game if you are a fan of the series but if you're just a gamer in general looking for hack n slash I would try dragon age 2 or skyrim or devil may cry DMC or metal gear rising before this.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

I played it after reading about all the great reviews it got.  And it didn't disappoint.  It remains probably my favorite game of all time.  The second game in the Prime series, Echoes, didn't live up to the first in my opinion.  It's sitting on a shelf unbeaten.  So I was kinda hesitant to get Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.  But I gave in and finally got it.  The developers main focus was to make the player feel like they actually are the bounty hunter Samus Aran.  Using the Wii's motion sensing controller to aim and shoot at the various baddies and bosses across several planets is a huge success, and is deeply gratifying.  There's nothing like shooting a Space Pirate in the face just before it slashes you.  The sound, the art style, the graphics, and most of all the gameplay are all fantastic.  It takes some time to get used to the controls, but when you do the game gets amazingly fun.  I started on normal difficulty, but after getting used to the controls I had to switch to veteran difficulty because it became too easy.  Hyper mode is a great feature, and really makes you feel invincible.  But a lot of enemies have it too, and when you see them glow with power it brings a slow trickle of fear as all you can do is hide and take shots at them from behind cover.  Not many games have immersed me as much as Prime 3, and only one other game has actually made me feel frightened and elated at the same time.  That other game is the first Prime.  So basically, if you haven't been able to get your hands on a Wii yet, buy Prime 1 for 20 bucks in the bargain bin.  If you do have a Wii and an extra fifty dollars sitting around, go buy this game.  Give it a couple hours to learn the controls, and then enjoy the conclusion to one of the better trilogies in gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2007"}

The screen gets redder the dead-er you get, but ducking for a while lets you get your wind back.  And the checkpoints are frequent, so you restart not TOO far back from where you die (both features similar to CoD).

Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is on par with Sucker Punch's Sly Cooper and even surpasses it in some ways.Most of Thieves in Time focuses on Sly and his ancestors, who all play similarly to Sly with their own little mechanics that differentiate them. Some of the time is spent with Bentley and Murray, though they're certainly not the main focus here. Bentley is a lot of fun, offering good platforming mechanics and solid old school shoot 'em up mini-games for hacking. Murray, though, is certainly the weakest aspect of Thieves in Time, offering brawler, beat 'em up levels that don't really add much to the game. But honestly, Murray's bits are a very small part of the overall game, which, I might add, is an excellent platforming game that any Vita owner should play.The graphics are obviously cartoony with a comic book aesthetic, but the whole thing is very detailed with great lighting, art direction, animations, etc. It's a visual package that's entirely cohesive and charming throughout. This is one of the best looking Vita games.Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time is a win for the Vita, as it's a great portable version of the home console game. Sanzaru has shown that they're clearly very skilled at making games, and all of their hard work and dedication is shown in this great game. I hope Sony lets Sanzaru work on more of their games in the future.I picked up the Vita game card since the version that comes with the PS3 version is a download that takes up over 3GBs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}

It's a bit overwhelming in spots, but it eventually comes together in the end with great twists. One of the best parts about the story is how it's written out in the game. Alan will narrate as you're playing in a first person perspective and these are also in the form of hints. You can pick up manuscript pages to find out what's going to happen next, but this is more a clue than a spoiler. The characters are well written into the story with amazing voice acting and superb dialog. While the story is the meat of the story the action is the best part.The game isn't just an adventure, but a third person shooter as well. The shooting mechanics are very clever, and not just your typical \"shoot every guy you see\" type of game play. You have a flashlight and when you hold LT to boost the flashlights light so it can tear apart the darkness on enemies. The way you can tell is very clever. The halo on the enemy will shrink the longer you have the light on them. Once it's gone you can blast away with one of your guns. The developers made the action pretty cinematic due to the slow motion cut aways the game does when an enemy is coming. Yes, the enemies are human somewhat, but you also have to be scared of your environment. The Darkness can possess anything from crates to barrels to trucks and even tractor trailers. When the Taken are gone you still have to watch out for possessed objects even the floor can be possessed and make you fall from deadly heights.You can get bigger flashlights that have more juice, and your weapons can also be passive. Use a flare to keep the Taken away from you to get some breathing room. Use flashbangs to take a group out, you can also use a flare (the most powerful gun in the game surprisingly) which has a cool bullet chase camera. The normal guns are just a revolver, shotgun (auto and pump), and a hunting rifle. Sure it's not a lot, but you don't need rocket launchers and machine guns in this game. It's that clever.Of course navigating the game is also really fun thanks to the simple puzzles and driving sections (which you boost your headlights to take out Taken). The game is almost perfect and everything is perfectly balanced. Even places where you have to use floodlights to take out dozens of Taken or even when you don't have  flashlight and just have to run it's never the same thing twice. The game is fairly long with about 6 chapters, and you'll want more when it ends. The game is broken up into chapters and is played like a TV series with a \"Previously on Alan Wake\" at the beginning of each chapter which is a small recap. There's just so much detail in this game with the radio shows, TV shows, and all the little tid bits that get left out of most games are in here, and it makes you want to savor the game.The game is also gorgeous. This is one of the best looking games available, and it's really something to behold. All the lighting is wonderful, physics are excellent, and the game is technically sound. Was this game worth the 5 year wait? By boogity it was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

This is okay for me because I'm a casual Vita player but it may be an issue for the more hard-core. On the other hand, the hard-core players may not need/want to use this at all. I noticed that our kid who's been using a PSP for the past couple of years appears to be quite comfortable with the Vita 'as is' - his reaction was 'oh... neat' but after using the grip a couple of times he didn't bother snapping it back in after he had to separate it from the Vita when changing a game.To conclude, this is a five-star item for me.

{"product_name":"B00AMA4L4E","description":"The most controversial game in recent years returns in this special director's cut. Unofficially the best game of the year (2010) according to fans and critics alike, Deadly Premonition split the gaming community right down the middle and earned itself cult status for its memorable cast and story.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Odd but rewarding","reviewText":"I picked this game up relatively late, and was aware of some mixed reviews of it, but I was interested by the promise of a good story, and I am pleased with what I found.That's not to say there aren't problems with Deadly Premonition, but the overall result is good. It's a full blown, open world exploration and survival horror game, quite similar to Silent Hill, but MUCH more similar to the TV series \"Twin Peaks\" in it's story, humour and presentation. The plot features an eccentric FBI agent who arrives in the odd little town of Greenvale to try and solve a murder mystery. The town is not hostile, but it is very closed up and a lot of the inhabitants are very strange. Nobody goes outside when it rains, everyone has secrets, and worst of all, it seems like the murderer is still on the loose!So gameplay feels like this. Agent York (that's you) arrives in Greenvale, drives around town, and meets up with various suspects, or drives to locations as advised by the local law enforcement or his hunches, and makes investigations. Now, one of the biggest factors in Deadly Premonition is time. Nearly all of the while, there is a visible clock on screen telling you what time of day it it. Time (in the game) actually passes while you play, and the gimmick is that things happen in the story based on this. So if you go to a bar to check out a suspect, but leave it until too late, the person is not there because they have gone home. Day changes into night and vice versa. Some places have set opening times. Some events do or don't happen when it is raining - which seemed to be random but I am not sure about that - and some hidden quests remain hidden if you don't go somewhere or see someone at the right time of day or weather conditions. So you can see, there is a HUGE element of this game that relates to time.Amazingly, this does not become a dreadful chore or a lead weight that you have to put up with. I actually found that I enjoyed the parts of the game when I had a free day or afternoon in the town (is that sad?), because I need to go off somewhere I had passed earlier that seemed interesting, and have a proper look around, or I wanted to play darts or do a quick street race. I guess in most games you can spend as long as you want doing whatever you want, but here it seemed almost refreshing to have to check the clock and say - uh-oh, it's time I stopped this now, as I am expected at the sherriff's office for lunch. The first time this hit me properly was on the first day when I was given a 5pm time limit to get to the sherriffs office to examine some evidence. I arrived at 4.50pm and thought, no problem. I've done as I was told, but I'd only been in the office for a few minutes and then the clock hit 5pm while I was mid conversation - and the other game characters said: \"Sorry we are all going home now, if you had got here earlier we would have had enough time do do this properly\". And I had to stop what I was doing and come back the next day! That told me! So I enjoyed that aspect. And if time is going too slow you can make it pass by taking naps or smoking.Now all this police business is only part of the game play. The game changes tack when you arrive at a crime scene or suspicious location and start to explore. For no apparent reason, the game suddenly pitches you into the \"Otherworld\", and the location you are in changes from ordinary to twisted, dark versions, inhabited by monsters and puzzles that need solving.  Now this really is Silent Hill cloned. But luckily I loved Silent Hill, so it was ok by me. The enemies are weird zombie like people, who utter very strange slowed-down dialogue as they attack you. These parts of the game are not that difficult, in fact nearly all of the combat is extremely EASY. Plus it's almost impossible for you to miss anything that would enable you to solve a puzzle as everythng is clearly signposted, but they are still fun. Once the main puzzle of the \"otherworld level\" is solved, things change back to normal again.The nightmare stages and the town exploration are both easy, so it's important that the game keeps you hooked by other means , and this is where the story comes in. The case you are investigating is actually quite horrible, and it's no spoiler to say that the murder you arrive to investigate is very unpleasant, and there is worse to come. The plot thickens and there are surprises in store, so the story definitely drives the game. The graphics, on the other hand do not. Deadly Premonition looks like a PS2 game. Although character models are good (Emily looks really lovely), the town and the environments looks ghastly. It's hard to pinpoint why exactly, but everything seems to be spread out way too thinly, in a similar way that the Dreamcast horror game \"Illbleed\" was  - chances are not too many people will know what I am talking about there!).  I guess this is to allow you to drive around easily (everything is about driving cars in this game), and explore very large and time-consuming rooms, spaces and corridors. It's the same inside and out. The town looks really...FLAT. Everything is about 200 meters from every other thing. But that's the game...you get used to it. Another thing that reminded me of \"Illbleed\" was that there is a lot of surreal and outrageous gore on show here, and some of the set pieces and boss fights are truly outlandish (you'll only see what I mean here if you reach the very end of the game). It all gets very trippy in the last couple of chapters!Eventually, when things come to a close, you will have hopefully worked out what it all meant, but there are plenty of very cryptic elements that take an awful lot of brainpower to understand. This is more like Silent Hill, which left you with a host of unanswered questions. In some ways , if you play the game of Deadly Premonition very very thoroughly and uncover every side quest, I think you might stand a chance, but I missed a few (I tried my best!), and therefore I was a little confused at the end.  But now it's over, I feel glad I visited Greenvale. if you accept the game world and the game logic, there is plenty here to keep you busy for a good few weeks, and as well as all the sightseeing and monster killing,  there is also an intriguing and bizarre case to solve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2013"}

I had originally played Assassin's Creed 2 and was loving it, so I stopped playing it in order to pick up Assassin's Creed and get back history going in to the second one.  I regret having done this, now, as the first AC is nothing like the 2nd.Okay, here is a typical day in the life of AC.  You take an impossibly long horse ride through the country where every single guard is chasing you.  Then you get to the city and you have to visit the bureau.  From there you have to do at least 2 of 6 investigations (3 of 6 later).  One is a pickpocket where you creep up on a guy and try sneak behind him without noticing, pickpocket him before he randomly turns around.  Then you find another person and you \"interrogate\" him, meaning beat him up till he talks and then kill him.  Or you can eavesdrop.  Once you've done this you go back to the bureau to obtain your target.  Proceed to target and find yourself in various situations to assassinate him.  Some are easy, others are extremely hard and long, such as the rich district in Jerusalem where you are first surrounded by 5 guys, then you have to go on a long chase only to be surrounded by like 12 more guards.  Assassinate, then return to bureau.  Oh yeah, the high alert is on the whole time as you now must sprint away from the assassination to get away, only to find you are constantly running up walls, running in to  people, jumping crates, and every other thing that can get in the way while a gang load of guards are chasing you.  Now repeat this eight more times, the exact same thing with all the same frustrations.You get extremely annoyed as you randomly run up walls or run in to people who just happen to swerve in to you, only to find your target getting away.  You go to attack and your sword gets put away, or you run up a wall while guards are swinging at you.  I couldn't help but yell and vow to stop playing this game.  I now know why this game got such poor ratings, especially compared to the second one which is so much more fun.  In the second one you have fun exploring and climbing, in the first you just want to get it over with and the exploring and climbing, although a major attraction to the game, becomes a hindrance.  A major plus, though, is the lifelike feel of the climbing and running.  It feels very fluid and consistent.  As well the graphics are just amazing.  I couldn't help at times as I stopped on a roof and just looked around the city, although this could never be long because there is always a guard challenging you and chasing you if you don't move fast enough (something else that is annoying).All in all I would say skip this one.  It isn't worth it for adding anything to the story, and AC2 is certainly way more fun and beautiful so why not skip the first one and start with AC2.  If it weren't for the fluid climbing and running and the beautiful graphics this would have been a 1 star.  As is I rate a 2 star because of that and the innovative new way to create a world.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one and go straight to the AC2.2 stars.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2010"}

The cutscenes may be too much for some people, but I happen to enjoy games featuring those things.I give AC 3 stars mostly due to the fact that there is no trophy support at all, the game is extremely repetitive which could get boring after a while (same types of missions and basic linearity), and the controls are a bit clunky (particularly with the camera angles when running/climbing walls...Altair would jump in a direction you didn't intend him to jump in).  Without the trophy support, there was really no reason at all for me to complete every single mission, view point, etc.  Just completing the minimum 3 investigations required to gain access to the assassination memories is good enough.  I'm hoping that Sony will release trophy support as a free DLC in the future, but I'm not betting on it since they haven't done so already after 3 years.I will definitely purchase AC 2 sometime in the future, since all reviews are saying that it beats the original game by a long shot.  I'd still highly suggest that you play this game through first just because it's the first title in a supposed trilogy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

The track listing is even better than the previous game and the game makers have made some nice tweaks to the appearance and gameplay.First I noticed was the hammer-on notes are made slightly smaller and therefore more noticeable.  There are also now dual-note hammer-ons where you will transition to two notes at once without strumming, neato!Character creation has seen relatively few tweaks, I liked it then, and I like it now.  The \"solo\" mode from the last game is basically gone.  And instead you have a band with only one member and the rest are computer generated 'mates.  I like this, since I wound up playing a lot in solo mode and missed playing in \"band tour\" mode.  Now this is resolved in RB2.  The only downside to the mutliple venue/city layout is that as you play gigs, you wind up playing the same songs over and over.  This is strange because there are a ton of songs included and chances are you'll download at least a few more favorites.  But I feel like even on \"random\" (aka, mystery setlists) I've played \"Pinball Wizard\" a suspiciously high number of times.Speaking of songs, you can transfer you old RB1 songs into RB2 with the download of a transfer credit from Xbox Live (400 MS points, easy).  After a month of playing RB2, i missed \"Green Grass and High Tides\" among other songs.

Everything is set inside its beautiful, believable, world.Witcher 2 is a gamer's game.  It is very, very deep but done in a way that never feels overwhelming.  The in-game journal and map are methodically updated to reflect everything you need to know about that point in time.  Choices you make drastically affect the worlds, characters, and endings.A game like this is very rare.  How many times have you played through a 45 hour RPG and wanted to immediately open a new file?  There's so much to do in this game and so many different ways to do it that you can play twice and have a completely different experience.  The controls are streamlined perfectly for xbox360 owners and it's a must buy.  Do not hesitate for a second.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2012"}

I  had such a difficult time with GOW 2 that I waited until I heard reviews on GOW 3 before buying it. In a nutshell I really liked this game more than it's predecessors. That is just based on puzzle difficulty. Some of the puzzles are tough but not as hard as GOW 2. I love a challenge but hate spending an hour on the same puzzle or getting to the point of just quitting and not playing the game again.

Sound is excellent, although there were a few sounds - such as barely touched boxes - that seemed unrealistically loud as if they are thrown across the room.  The slow-motion feature is well implemented.  The battle sequences are entertaining and suspenseful.  The horror aspects are somewhat frightening.The Bad: The single player campaign is short.  The environments are often sterile and repetitive. It appears that every office and hallway has a wrench and hammer laying around.  Too many maze-like offices and hallways.  Many of the environments appear the same except for some slight texture changes.The most disappointing element in F.E.A.R. was the story and characterization.  Deus Ex or Half-Life this is not.  The characters are very generic and sterile.  The story is not well implemented.  There are many occasions when files are uploaded and buttons pressed to activate certain machinery without any idea why.  Even when the game is finished, there is not a full understanding of what the story was about.Overall, F.E.A.R. is an enjoyable first-person shooter; however, it lacks environment variety and the story and characterization that would have made it excellent.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2005"}

Haven't done one of these in while but after finishing this game(the only time when you really should do a review) I felt it was worth the time to give some pros and cons of this game. I had an absolute blast with this game--for the most part. I really recommend playing this game on Easy the first time through for one reason only---the loading times. They are atrocious. There will be some side scrolling and 3D platforming that you WILL die the first time unless you watch a walkthrough video(something I did on the third and every side scrolling part thereafter.) When you die, you get to watch two stupid monsters fighting for about 40 seconds or so. It will drive you batty and that is why I recommend the easy difficulty. Overall, this game is an excellent value if you like hack and slash with lots of gore. Don't give up!! The game actually gets easier as you go along. By the 9th or 10th \"phase\" you will be so good with your moves and powers that you will mow through the monsters like nothing! Lots of trophies to earn too(I got about 50% of them in the first playthrough) which brings us to the next point. Replayability. If you want to stay on the same difficulty, you can jump to any level with ALL of your Blood upgrades intact and play them over just to get more blood(the currency of the game) and work on levelling everything up. Alternately, you can start a new game at a harder difficulty(which is what I did) and keep your upgrades too!! It is great fun to be slaughtering the monsters at the higher difficulty where you get more blood to use to upgrade everything! Plus you get a multiplier when you play at a harder difficulty so you earn even more blood. This game is a great value(at the current price) for hack and slash lovers like me. If you like God of War, I am sure you will like this game. Just have some patience....","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

I usually dont do reviews so quickly, not having the knowledge yet of beating the game but this game very much excites me and gets my heart pumping a bit faster. I had never played the 1st F.E.A.R. game and was only half way through the 2nd when the 3rd came out. So many games such little time! I do know the story as my friends have played them and filled me in. Nonetheless, its a great FPS and it comes with some challenging moments. I wouldnt say this game is jump-out-of-your-seat scary, but it is pretty eerie and creepy and at times has the hair on the back of my neck standing straight up. The games that get me sucked in are the ones that i just cant wait to see what happens next, where i get so into the story i forget to blink while playing. I am a pretty picky gamer and can get bored very easily, i have no problems putting a game on the shelf and moving onto something else, in saying that, i can allready tell this will be in my PS3 for quit a while. As far as the graphics, sound, controlls etc., no complaints, very smooth and top notch. The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i havent beaten it yet, but the way it seems to be going ill have to update that when i finish it.

I should of read all the reader reviews through Amazon before I went out and purchased Crysis Warhead.  Even the sales clerk at the retail store where I bought the game from last Friday tried to warned me to not buy the game.  I should of listened.I bought the first game Crysis last year and I installed that game on my computer and it installed fine.  I love playing that game. I thought since I bought the first Crysis game I would go out and buy the follow up game, Crysis Warhead. I just had to have this game.  So I went out last Friday and bought Crysis Warhead and went home and tried to install the game onto my PC computer.Big mistake. The game started to download onto my computer and all of sudden it stopped and it said \"Error Message\".  The error message said first of all I needed to be connected to the internet to install the game.  So I thought okay I would go ahead and do that.  So I tried to download the game again with the internet connected to my computer.  Okay so the game started to download and I got the same error message again.  Only this time it said I need to register my game.  I'm like wait a minute.  I put in the registration code at the beginning of the game and now it's asking me for a registration code?  So I had to take out the game and try to register it again.  The game started to download and then I got another error message telling me that SecuROM does not recognize my registration code and will not let me finish downloading the game.  Do you know after all that hassle I took the game out of my computer and it screwed up my computer.  That SecuROM is like putting a virus into your computer.  I am not kidding you.I try to get back into the original Crysis game on my PC after all this and it screw up my computer so I can't get into the Crysis game.  I ended up taking Crysis out of computer and now the computer won't let me reinstall Crysis back into my computer.  Then on top of all this it, SecuROM screwed up my drives so that I can't watch any DVD movies on my PC.  SecuROM get into your operating system in your computer and screws up everything and you can't take it out.I contacted EA Games Customer Service Department and they told me just to keep reinstalling Crysis Warhead until it finally works.  What kind of answer is that?  I told them my PC is all screw up because of Crysis Warhead and the stupid SecuROM that came with it.  They said I need to see things from a business point of view.  They're trying to make money and keep people from stealing the game by putting in SecuROM.  I told them in twenty years of playing PC games I have never had so much trouble installing a game except when it comes to any PC games through EA Games.  That includes Spore which is a joke.I will never buy another PC game made through EA Games.  It just isn't worth all the time and trouble.  Especially when it ends up messing up your PC and then you spend weeks trying to fix it.  Don't pay any attention to Gaming Sites or Gaming Magazines who give these games good reviews.  Game Publishers give a lot of money to these people to make sure they give good reviews on the games without mentioning all the other crap that is in the games.  I remember earlier this year when a long time Game Reviewer for Gamespot got fired for giving a bad review to a game because the Game Publisher didn't like the low review the Game Reviewer had given one of their games. I personally don't work for in the gaming industry.  I'm just an average guy who trying to help people so they don't get ripped off.That SecuROM should only go to Third World Countries because that is really the only place where piracy takes place.  This is not right to treat honest paying customers this way by EA Games.  Thank you Amazon for giving us freedom of speech and letting us tell people the truth about these inferior PC games. I buy most of my games for Xbox 360 since I don't have any problems with installation or running their games.  Buying PC games really sucks now.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000E0VMVM","reviewerName":"Quercus Alba","summary":"Very fun and better than I expected","reviewText":"I love the Shadow Hearts series.  I have now played and beaten all 4 SH games (Koudelka, SH, SH-Covenant, and SH-FTNW).  I loved the middle two so much, with Shadow Hearts having the best dark theme and SH-Covenant the best combat.I had read the mixed reviews on this game, Shadow Hearts From the New World.  I'm glad I bought the game and gave it a full chance.This game had the best combat system of the Shadow Hearts series, in my opinion, improving even on SH-Covenant.  I really enjoyed the increased ring complexity and the stellar charts.  The locations were more enjoyable than I expected going in.  The dungeons were fun, with good fights, puzzles, and enough to challenge you for an hour or two each.  This game seemed the easiest for me to play a couple of hours a night and come back to the next night wanting more and enjoying it all.One issue that other reviewers mention that I found to be true is that this game has some wacky elements and is the least dark-themed of the SH series.  Before I played it, I thought that would be a deal-breaker.  But it turns out that I loved some of the characters and truly enjoyed the combat and leveling system enough that this game overcomes the lighter theme and stands on its own as a great game for me.  The game also has many significant side quests which are optional, but which are some of the best parts of the game.  It had a great mix of complexity, challenge, and satisfying action.By wacky, I mean the giant drunken cat character, who I hated.  I didn't play him except for the one dungeon I had to.  So, he was not a big part of the game and was not missed by me. This game is very playable with whatever majority of the characters you like, so you can ignore one or two and still be fine.Frank the crazy ninja was a wacky character too, but I ended up liking him.  The humor worked on that one.  Frank wears sandals with socks and is nerdy, but he's a great fighter and quirky in a good way.A few of the characters I just loved.  Ricardo absolutely rocked (he uses a guitar for attacks and special abilities, and it is so cool).  Slim Hilda (the vampire girl) and Shania (the fusion girl) were both excellent.  Natan (Indian fighter) was very good.  Johnny (the teen) was okay, but not nearly as good a lead character as Yuri from the prior two SH games.Overall, it was a polished, fun game that I ended up loving depite one character I hated and some quirks and wackiness.  I spent over 60 hours on it and it was a great game, 4.5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2012"}

One of these franchises is the metal gear series and even since the days of Nintendo I have not understood this game. I am a guy that loves to shoot stuff up and in these games it was more about stealth than actually shooting people. I wanted a metal gear game that was heavily based on action and less on the stealthy elements. It seems that the people over at Konami heard me as they are coming out with Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance but is this going to be a worthy metal gear game or should you just try to slip on past this game?The game puts you in control of the cyborg ninja Raiden as you are trying to raise money to help out your family. You are working for a private military company (or PMC) as you are working to guard some VIP in South Africa you come under attack by Desperado Enterprises as their cyborgs wipe out your target and destroy your cyborg body leaving you for dead. You are rescued and given a new set of black armor but this armor needs to be constantly recharged. How do you recharge the armor? By killing things of course! You can use your blades to slice and dice thru the levels of the game or use other weapons at your disposal as well. There are several blades you can choose from ranging from the armor breaker (slices thru armor) and the stun blade (stuns your opponents) and there is even a machete that slices thru foes with the greatest of ease.Gone is the slow paced stealth aspect of the game as you will be running and slicing your way thru levels. The game is very gory as you can hack people to pieces with your blades and run thru environments slicing up people as you go. But if you do want to take a stealthy approach to the game you can do that as well via Raiden's AR view. This view allows you to see which enemies are on the battlefield and sneak up on them as well. But the game doesn't punish you for not being stealthy and that's what I love to see!If you are a fan of the metal gear games or have wanted to try one but have been hesitant then this is game for you. With more action than you can shake a stick at, various blades to dish out mayhem and a great story it is clear to see that metal gear rising revengeance is going to be a game to watch out for.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

Who really cares that Duke still plays like he did back in the 90's or that the game looks somewhat dated(as opposed to modern FPS you find these days)or that he's still as vulgar, offensive, and unadulterated as ever? Since when could you ever really take a Duke Nukem game all that seriously? Duke's always been testosterone-driven, smartalecky, and an action-star parody..and he's no different in this game.I think people are critical about the game for the fact that the game had been in development for some 15 years. No game is going to be THAT groundbreaking with that many years in development.Personally, I think the developer of Duke Nukem Forever took what made Duke Nukem so great in the first place and made it better while still making it like the original. Duke is larger than life in everything he does in this game.My only gripe with this game deals with the loading times for each level...they were downright awful. Having to wait ten to twenty seconds or more to play a level kinda kills that excitement, you know? That was a problem for most games way back when but not so much these days which is why it is so dadblamed annoying.Overall---Duke Nukem Forever is a pretty amazing game despite how it is percieved.

{"product_name":"B0014WJ78E","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"The Most Advanced Gaming Console with one Revolutionary Game","reviewText":"For all of you considering the PS3 this is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to home entertainment. Gaming and multimedia are taken to the next level.First getting my hands on the PS3 made me realize that this is the largest Playstation conosle by volume and weight they have ever come out with. I quickly realized how sturdy and well made this product is. The plastic that is used is solid and heavy duty. I also realized how easy dust and fingerprints attract to the shiny finish which is both plastic and fake chrome. Connecting the PS3 was the easy part. Unlike the Wii and 360 Sony has left the power station inside the console. Which means you only need one heavy duty plug to connect. From the back of the console you have many choices for video and audio outputs. The standard AV outlet is there which allows you to play with the cables it comes with or to buy component cables for high definition viewing. You also have a optical digital output for full digital sound. New to any video game console is HDMI output. This allows you to have the PS3 in full high definiton video and audio. HDMI is capable of a full digital signal allowing 1080p true high definition picture. It is also capable of unleashing 7.1 high definition sound. So audiophiles should be happy about what this console offers. On the front end you get three memory card slots which are hidden behing a plastic door...so as to not diminish the appearance of the PS3. Also they included four USB outlets. This allows you to connect various devices like a photo camera, internet camera, mouse, or even a printer. The Sony PS3 has a feature that allows it to be on standby at all times. Which is similar to the other consoles. I will talk more about this feature on the PS3 further in the review. Also for those of you that need space the PS3 can accomodate larger hard drives.  I have added a 160 gig hard drive to accomodate future game media.I would like to cover all the interface options the PS3 accompanies seperately so consumers can become aware of all the advantages this console carries. For those of you familiar with the Playstation Portable this interface is almost exactly the same.You are able to create seperate logins for anyone who uses the PS3. This allows for each person to go online with their information. Although it doesn't really have many more advantages than that right now it is rather insignificant.Next is the system settings. This allows the user to adapt the PS3 to their television and sound system. You can adjust the high defention settings to fit the maximum resolution of your t.v. You also have setting for your blue tooth devices and internet connections. The PS3 comes with built in wi-fi which seems to have a strong connection that gives you almost seamless online use. For those of you that have taken the step up the PS3 does support Dolby HD sound making for an amazing experience.The PS3 also has a photo viewer. You can download photos by three different means. One is by using your camera and connecting it via USB. I haven't checked to see how viable this option is. Next you can download the pictures with a memory card or memory stick. This operation is rather simple and downloads are quick. Generally you get your standard slide shows although they have a fun feature. It allows you to view your pictures on a blank canvas as they fall onto the blank canvas. Slide shows are best when you set them to your music.Next is the music player. You can dowload songs by several different means. You can use a memory card, usb memory stick, CD's, or even IPod's. Songs download much quicker via memory card than CD. SONY has talked about having a song download service in the future. When watching photos you can add music.  The visual player is really beautiful with an Earth visualizer.I want to talk about one of the most notorious features of the PS3. The Blu-ray player. Most of you now know what a Blu-ray player is and does. I have viewed numerous movies on it. I have also viewed these movies on two different hdtv's. One a 1080p and a 1080i. I really did not notice much of a picture difference. One thing I have noticed about hd movies is that the ones more than a couple years older have a slightly grainy appearance since they were remastered for high definition. Newly made movies appear crystal clear with vivid colors and tremoundous definition. The PS3 does allow you to view regular DVD's which can make the transition that much easier. The regular DVD movies are upscaled on your HDTV allowing an excellent picture. Many new DVD movies look great when they are upscaled into HD.Now would be the gameplay part of the interface. This keeps track of the game disc you may have in the player or also games or demos that you have downloaded. This interface is rather simple and easy to negotiate. For any PS2 owner it also carries your virtual memory card with all your game data. With this PS3 model you can play all PSone games and many PS2 games.  As far as the PS3 games go I have played numerous games plus several demos. There are a few games which look better on the 360.  Although that is becoming less and less as developers learn the PS3. The game speed is smooth and polished. The visuals on exclusive PS3 games like Heavenly Sword, Ratchet and Clank, Uncharted, and Motorstorm is quite impressive. The PS3 seems to create a living vivid environment with the ability to create many textures and surfaces. Amazing graphics and sound quality will become apparent in many of the games this year and beyond. I have also enjoyed several games that are downloadable. The games have enhanced hd graphics and are affordable at only $7.99-$9.99.  Some games like Gran Turismo 5 Prologue and Warhawk are $39.99. What I have enjoyed is online gaming. With the PS3 you don't have to pay any added fees. The gameplay was seamless and quick and allows you to use a blue tooth headset when playing. You can also use a PS2 headset via USB. The online gaming is virtually the same as the 360. The PS Eye is an amazing device which shows some interactive capibilities.  There are several games on the PSN which take advantage of the features.  By using the camera it can sense body movement and put it into a game.Lastly I will cover the online features of the PS3. On the interface online is a big part. From the browser to having friends and checking your mail. Of course the largest feature is the Playstation store. The Playstation store has upgraded it's look and is now very easy to navigate.  The 360 has XBox Live which could be considered the pedigree for consoles. The Wii is limited to just classic video games. The Playstation store is decent right now with very numerous items to download. You have games, demos, and movie trailers, themes and wallpaper that you can use to customize your PS3. The store will continue to grow and has a nice feature that allows you to dowload PSone games for the Playstation Portable (PSP). After dowloading it to your PS3 then you transfer it via USB to your PSP. Also a very intriguing feature that I think is really amazing is called remote play. When your PSP is integrated into your PS3 you have the ability to view and listen to stuff on your PS3 anywhere in the world with your PSP. All you need is a wifi connection. I have tried this feature out and it's really enjoyable. I was able to view movie trailers and listen to my music on my PSP. The feature is nice although it is supposed to work when the PS3 is on standby. The PS3 has a few games available that you can actually play on your PSP in the remote play mode.There are also two features that are becoming more apparent for owners. Folding at Home is a beneficial program that works with Stanford University. The program runs when your PS3 is idle. What it does is run computations that help scientists work for many cures to diseases. A beneficial plus to the PS3. I can vouch for having my PS3 on nonstop 24 hours a day 7 days a week for many months without any problems. Secondly I want to talk about HOME. No not your real home but the PS3 program that will be available late 2008. This program will be a virtual online social interface allowing you to meet numerous other PS3 players. I have been allowed to participate on the Beta version and I must say this has extreme potential.The dual shock controller is a very nice added feature to this PS3.  The dual shock is just like the previous PS3 controller with one big bonus.  Now you get rumble in games.  Many games already support this feature and I am here to tell you this controller is superb.  The charge lasts for about 20 hours and charging it is as easy as connecting a USB cord to your PS3.2008 is becoming an exciting year for PS3 owners.  Many excellent games have already been released like Gran Turismo 5 Prologue, Hot Shots Golf, Grand Theft Auto 4, and Singstar. The experience is already excellent with over a dozen very good games. The PS3 will have over a half dozen exclusive games releasing in the next year. Games like Gran Turismo 5, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Resistance 2, Motorstorm 2, and  Final Fantasy are just the beginning. If any of these games suit you it would be an excellent reason to own a PS3.In closing I will say without a doubt the PS3 has been quite an experience. I feel the $500 is well worth it for the features you get. Wifi, Bluray, free online gaming, HDMI, and of course the game playing.I believe many of you are on the fence and trying to justify a large scale purchase like this. The games are here and the experience is superb. If you want a wonderful living room centerpiece that will provide numerous hours of use the PS3 is the way to go.What makes this PS3 special is the game that it comes bundled with:  Metal Gear Solid 4.  A game that is receiving superb reviews and being titled as a revolutionary game.  Some have called it the best game in many years. For fans of the series and people who have never given Metal Gear Solid a try this game should be a must have.Updated***I have taken the time to play Metal Gear Solid 4 and can say the reviews are right.  This game is superb.  It is the best game on the PS3 and probably the best game on any console this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2008"}

Call of Duty, in it's entirety, expansion pack included, is incredible. The graphics are top notch with thousands of soldiers in some battles and breath taking explosions. The sound is spot on as well. Each character has a distiquishable voice and what is war of course with out the booms and the bangs. The guns firing and ejected brass laying on the ground is cool. And unlike Medal of Honor, the bodies stay on the ground throughout the whole level. It can be pretty insane when mowing down enemies in the same spot because at the end, there will be a big pile of dead guys. Blood is heavy in this game, which adds to the game's realism. When playing through this game I felt like I was in either Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The action is soooooo intense. Bullets hiting everywhere and when a tank fires it blows chunks of buildings out. You can't always run up to nazi's and fight face to face like in other shooters. You must stay with your squad or entire company and fight as a team. The enemies are extremely smart and very violent. They don't stand right in front of you and hit you with their gun every two seconds. They hit violently and will fire their guns like real soldiers, not taking short burst and waiting until your three feet infront of them. The levels are massive, 37 in all. Burning buildings, forests, dams, and bridges. You even play inside of a B-17 flying over Holland. Most of the levels are very original but many we have seen in movies such as Band of Brothers, The Longest Day, and Enemy at the Gate. You play as six different characters, two from each the American, British, and Russian armies. From training camp in the states to the airborne drop over Normandy, from a POW rescue in Austria to the battle for Stalingrad, you will be blown away! Fight through the battle of the bulge at Foy and Noville, assuault a train bridge in Holland, and throw everything you have at the nazis for the liberation of Russia at Kursk and Kharkov. The weapony is aweaome. You will use the thompson, mp44, ppsh, silenced sten, bazooka, springfield, M1, MG42, 30 cal., colt 45, bren, pazerfuast, browning, mp40, kar, panzershrek, ghewer, and so much more. You wil drive tanks, ride shotgun in the side car of a motorcycle, shoot from cars and jeeps. You will play in France, Holland, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Poland, Austria, Italy and America. Multiplayer is just as great if not better, with tons of modes to play. Buy both Call of Duty and United Offensive for the complete WWII simulation.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2004"}

It took many many hours of playing to get through the three Half-Life games, all of which are excellent. They are shooters with intriguing stories and more thinking involved than most  shooters. You have to solve puzzles and employ a lot of strategy. The air boat is a blast to drive and there are great weapons such as the anti-gravity weapon which you will use a lot. You can't beat throwing a giant saw blade to cut zombies is half . The scenery and graphics are great and there are some genuinally creepy moments.

You control a masked character in a top down view, and move him from room to room across various environments, brutally killing everyone you come across in order to reach an objective. Once you have what you are looking for, you walk back through the bloodbath you created to your car, stop by a convenience store for some quick groceries or a video store to rent a VHS tape, and then back home to sleep. You'll wake up the next morning, check your answering machine, get a mysterious message giving you orders, and then head out to the car to repeat it all again.Hotline Miami takes this premise and makes something that is utterly compelling, strangely beautiful, intriguing, and 100% enjoyable. Brilliantly capturing the pastel, neon landscapes of 1980's in a way we haven't seen since Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, Hotline Miami is a pure adrenaline rush. It's 16-bit visuals perfectly compliment the masterful soundtrack in enabling the player to set out on a mysterious murder rampage in a way that almost seems poetic. The solid, responsive gameplay is simple to learn, and despite the large number of times you will die, you will continue to try and try again, getting smarter and faster as you master your environments. You'll relish in the wonderful sense of freedom the game gives you in accomplishing your goals, and the pulsating soundtrack will pump your blood in a way that few soundtracks canAs you begin to unravel the esoteric story, which involves strange phone calls, animal masks, hallucinations, and the slow decent into what is clearly something beyond reality, Hotline Miami keeps you keeps you under its spell. It repeatedly has you committing these acts of violence, even though you're not really quite sure why. As the game goes on, expect the unexpected. Hotline Miami goes places that mainstream games just don't go, and demonstrates why the indie movement has been so wonderful. It is a complex, mature game that isn't for everyone, but for older gamers who want to see how a small development team can use the essence of pure gameplay and mood to create something wholly original. When it comes to this, you really can't do any better than Hotline Miami. This is a game that will be talked about and referred back to for a very, very long time, and it is more than deserving of that status.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2013"}

The Sonic games are excellent platformers - to me they're just a notch below the classic Mario games in quality.  Maybe that's not fair, but I grew up with Mario so I have that admitted bias.  That's not a knock on the Sonic games, though, as I said, they're excellent.I just wanted to post this review mainly to say that the Dual Shock controller works great for all of these games.  In fact I like it better than an old Genesis controller because of the analog stick vs. the old gamepad.Anyway, you have great platformers, an excellent puzzle game in Mean Bean Machine, and a great action-pinball game in Sonic Spinball, plus more.

Also the Xbox 360 is VERY LOUD and prone to overheating, I got the dreaded red light a couple times on my 360 while playing this game, thankfully it didn't mean it was dead and after playing this game a single time through I sold it and the 360 and got most of my money back, PC is so much better in terms of game price and the graphics performance per dollar with a nice mid-range graphics card, I have an XFX 8800GT with a computer you use for other things anyways.A note about the activation stuff, the publishers don't care about PC gamers being mad about it, they get most of their profits from the consoles anyways since they are obviously more pirate proof and the games are ten bucks less anyways. I wouldn't be surprised if this port was pretty buggy/unplayable like Gears of War was since all this is an afterthought for them so expect minimal to no support on this like many other console to PC ports. Securom is a virus but they do not care, I would be very wary of being an early buyer/adopter for this or any console port and a year old game is not worth full retail pc prices. This is a two DVD game that takes up 13GB of space so make sure you have that.First of all it is a lot like the recent Far Cry 2, go here kill this and then on to the next mission, the side missions are not fun or innovative like bowling or pool and you constantly get called on the phone for social time which is a real pain if you are not into the sims approach with pretty much no convenient way to turn off the constantly ringing beast.The car handling will be a trial for you and the motorcycle handling is appalling, too much of a simulation is tried without the benefit of an optional adjustment like in many race simulators for PC. This is very frustrating when you are forced to do missions on the motorcycle. Very loose and difficult in comparison to San Andreas and the earlier versions.No customization of cars or clothes or owning properties with built in side missions like in the previous versions of GTA. I was never into this a whole lot anyways but if you liked that about the other ones you'll get very little to none of that with this one, making it of less value overall for the price. No planes, skydiving, although there are helicopters. There are very few stores you can buy anything, no specialty cars to buy with all the money you will have after a few missions, although you can go on the net and get used cars. I want an iphone device where I can browse the net, instead you have to go to an internet cafe and pay to use the net, annoying. Also I wanted to have very cool special equipment, cars and helicopters to buy but there is none of that.The graphics are very nice with great details in the city and weather effects. But this feels like a very pretty package with subpar product inside to me. Another annoyance is the save system, you have to go inside a property and go to sleep to save, it would be nice to save wherever you want via the cell phone when not on a mission of course.Another thing is you are getting less real estate, just NYC, I liked the huge and varied environment in SA as the city gets pretty monotonous after a while.All that said it is a fun game worth a play through, but for me after the main story there was just not that much to do. Exploration is fun but with the smaller but more detailed environment you can do that in much less time than in SA.  This one is just not that innovative with no major leaps forward other than the graphics. I'd rather have less realistic graphics but more things to do and funner gameplay any day, I still occasionally play San Andreas to this day.Avoid this at the full price and check the boards to see if it is playable and if the publishers are bothering to put patches up in a timely manner otherwise you could have not only the securom virus but a frustrating crash prone game for fifty of your hard earned bucks.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best.

First off, one of the glitches that did not get corrected is that of computer hacking.  You can still log off the terminal and log back in with the same number of tries per log, just like in Fallout 3.The game experience is obviously that of Fallout 3 with the VATS system, but nothing really new in that department.  The weapons have been changed and some offer some great sights.So far I've only been watching a friend of mine play it and have not played it myself, but it does feel like more great stuff of the same.I love Fallout 3.  It's a revolutionary game in content and gameplay, or so I feel.  This one offers playing more great adventures for those of us who love to travel and scavange the wasteland.Nov 5th, 2010 --3 STARSSo, I finally played Fallout New Vegas.  All I can say is, \"Stick to your guns no matter what.\"  Fallout 3 was an almost unprededented game in content and in gameplay.  Traveling the wasteland was a true experience which kept me hooked 171 hours of my life (with all DLCs played).  The fact that they made Fallout 3 New Vegas a western really betrays the look and feel of an apocalyptic nuclear holocaust aftermath.  Just because a few other video games have sucha theme and were successful, does not make fallout new vegas a success.To start off, the game is incredibly easy even in hard core difficulty.  I just pray I'll see an enemy in the wasteland, so I can engage in battle with it.Then we have the music.  Fallout 3 had 3 radio stations; yes, they'd get repetitive, but this one has the same songs over and over again even in alternate frequencies.The weaponry is more extensive in this game than in Fallout 3 but nothing to get too excited about with so few and easy enemies to battle.And finally, let's not forget all the glitches of the game.  I've had the game freeze up on me a couple of times in less than a week I've had it.I had given the game 4 stars peviously.  I had to lower the score to 3 stars.  All I can say is this title really strays from the spirit of fallout and its main theme a post nuclear world reflecting the crudeness of humanity's most primal instincts.Nov 11, 2010 FINAL REVIEW --5 STARSFinally, I've gotten a very good feel for the game, and I must say Bethesda outdid itself again.  The game does start on the slow side, but it gets very interesting and it gets very very long.  It has so many missions and also enemies to fight.  Several level up perks are new, as well as an extensive array of guns.The reason my final grade is a 5 star rating is because the game is so designed as to make you think and reflect that in any situation the game presents there is always an angle for attack or escape no matter what your level of experience or expertise for the weapons is.  Furthermore, the array of things you can manufacture makes you more careful and selective on picking up junk in the wasteland, sort of like more cautious to detail where things you would just pick up and just sell for fractions of caps in Fallout 3, in Fallout New Vegas you actually can build several items with them.The nature of the game is naturally slow, thus, it's an adult's game, but it's well worth playing and enjoying the several missions the game presents with elaborate plots of the crudeness of the wasteleand we all know and love of the series.Almost forgot, the game does get incredibly difficult in hard core mode and well worth playing the challenging scenarios, so I take back what I said before that it's scarce on difficulty and on enemies; I couldn't have been more wrong.  It's the length of the game that caught me off guard.I guess I'm aging for sure and probably maturing; I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that last one, so one naturally starts to detach from many things, but in any case, thanks Bethesda for another great title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"New Vegas--Van Buren, Take 2","reviewText":"Update: 09 Nov 2010, 84 hours played, patch 1.1.1 just installed...Twelve years after their masterpiece sequel, and seven years after the third should have been released, Black Isle veterans finally present another post-apocalyptic role-playing game.Fallout Tacticswas an intriguing addition, but developed by another studio, and ultimately rushed out the door under the same Interplay idiocy that shuttered Black Isle in the first place. Bethesda Softworks came to the rescue with their own version ofFallout 3, a franchise expansion even more radical than *Tactics*. Meanwhile, former Interplay and BI employees established Obsidian Entertainment, bringing usNeverwinter Nights 2and it's \"Fallout-y\" sense of story.A fan of the series since 1997, I resent that the original Fallout 3 didn't make it. Codenamed \"Van Buren\", its publication would have made the wait for the Capital Wasteland shorter, and the series richer. But there's no sense crying over spilled Brahmin milk, pardner. `Cause the sun is finally shining on the Mojave for all you Pip-Boys `n' Gals.Hoover Dam, Caesar's Legion, and other elements of \"Van Buren\" have finally been brought to life. The story isn't the same, but from the first town of Goodspring, the game gives a gambling-themed mystery that only thickens as player plunges deeper into the desert. This is another Obsidian trademark, and with the added advantage of a sandbox world, is shaping up to top both *NWN2* and all previous *Fallout* games with plots within plots, or at least quests within quests.The game has some 163 quests to occupy the player, more than any previous *Fallout* title, and many of them entwined with each other. In fact, it is a little too easy to fail or to break one quest while completing another. Add the hardcore option, take away the skill-boosting bobbleheads, and parcel out perks every other level, all make the game a more immersive and yet perilous experience that cannot be played like *Fallout 3*The Capital Wasteland prepared the player within a Vault. Wasteland enemies seldom attacked in packs, and the PC could soon find overpowered weapons and armor. Your permanent safe-house is easily unlocked within the first hour of play, companions are quickly found with the right Karma, and it was possible to shortcut large portions of the plot.*New Vegas* kicks the player around a wild desert loop, pursuing a checkered-suit killer. I find the experience reminiscent of Roland chasing Walter in *The Gunslinger*. Safe-house? There's a hotel along the way, after you've battled through miles of death. The Desert is the very antithesis of safe: with roaming packs of escaped convicts, slavers, and armored radscorpians. That doesn't even count the treacherous \"shortcut\" to Vegas, full of Deathclaws and mutant bighorns. Nor the optional \"Hardcore\" mode that requires eating, drinking, and sleeping. Good weapons and armor are even harder to find, making the pre-order packs important for the early stages. Even then, replacing Damage Resistance with Damage Threshold makes the new repair kits and armor-piercing ammo a necessity. A companion can be had early with the right skills or parts; otherwise the player is a lone gunslinger, true to King's novel, until well into the main plot.Other aspects are easier. Ammunition is more abundant, in part because of the ability to reload spent casings, and in part due to the spread of lower-quality cartridges like \"Surplus 5.56mm\". The map design combines warning signs, NPC marker reveals, and obstacles to give you a clearer idea about which areas to avoid, and which to explore. The Town Reputation mechanic has returned and revamped-- it's now possible to get on the good side of traditional enemies like gangers and raiders.Speaking of good sides, the trademark humor is back. Tune into a super mutant radio station insisting that the Nightkin are benevolent overlords who are *not* crazy! Visit the Vicky and Vance Casino-- Bonnie and Clyde had nothing on this infamous crime couple and their rampage of shoplifting and bad checks. The game also includes a \"wildcard\" trait that unlocks wackier elements of the wastelands.Some wacky bugs are also evident. Like the early versions of *Fallout 3*, critters and objects clip through the level geometry, often out of reach of the player. I also notice glinting geometry seams and texture flashing. After about 40 hours of play, I have finally suffered some framerate drops and a couple of crashes. A number of quests remain broken, even after the latest patches; this includes the Camp Searchlight unmarked quests. This is comparable to my *Fallout 3* campaigns. I still haven't encountered any of those \"rubber ragdoll\" corruptions that caused dead bodies in *F3* to stretch like Gumby and flail eternally in mid-air. And here you thought Munch and Bacon scribbled some creepy figures.More troubling to me are some of the immersion shortcuts. The Courier is a rather anonymous character compared to the Chosen One, and I would have prefered a more personal story like that of *NWN2* or *FO3*. I was also disgusted to find that large areas of the map are blocked by player clips (invisible walls); I'm particularly annoyed that there aren't Legion towns on the east side of the Colorado River for me to raid; may these areas be filled by DLC! Obsidian also makes inconsistent use of the Radiant A.I. that made *Oblivion* so rich, and they don't have much in the way of scripted conversations between NPCs. To OE's credit, characters do comment on Player Character appearance, companions, and exploits; whereas The Lone Wanderer in *Fallout 3* could knock over Paradise Falls or Evergreen Mills and nobody noticed. I also admitGrand Theft Auto IVspoiled me with it's \"Natural Motion\" technology, so the character animations here, while improved from *F3*, still look dated. The face models still don't have a decent smile or laughing animation.I am also bothered to find the game will no longer read MP3 files that are added to the music folders. Ironically, this is part of the immersion. The maps now use custom playlists for every location. The specific tune depends on the distance to the location, the factional reputional of the player, and the time of day. In some cases, this means a map cell will endlessly loop \"Underground Trouble\", just like the good-ol' days in the mole rat tunnels of Redding.Performance-wise, the game flies on cranked-up settings. The textures are more colorful and the skies brighter and deeper. Architecture shows off a wider model and texture pallette as well, getting away from the monotone structures of *Oblivion* and previous *Fallouts*. More ambient and radio music can fill your speakers; as hinted above, Mark Morgan's original soundtracks have been reintroduced to both loved and annoying effect. Environmental effects like dust devils and sand-blasted flats look good, as do flags and rocking signs. Though it is odd to see tumbleweeds rolling against the wind.When I heard the windfall of Obsidian and *New Vegas*, I figured they could finally deliver Van Buren. Bethesda is also to be commended for their ability to buy the rights, protect them, and put them to use. Let's look forward to a future for *Fallout 4*!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"D. R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Blown Potential - Wait for DJ Hero 2","reviewText":"DJ Hero is the latest in Activision's rhythm game offerings.  What started out with players strumming on guitars morphed into singers singing, drummers drumming, and now this.  But unfortunately, what should have been a revitalization of the genre and a new entry in the party game hall of fame falls short in several ways.THE GAMEBuilding off of the Guitar Hero model, you play along with a club mash-up track, trying to keep up with the on-screen instructions as they roll past.  The group with whom I played were equal part intrigued and intimidated by the turntable controller - everyone wanted to try, but quickly got frustrated at how unnatural it felt.  Face it - most of us have had momentary fits of air guitaring or drumming, but not so many have had that for DJing.Players combine crossfading tracks, dropping sound effects, and scratching to play the songs.  Most players were mainly interested in the scratching, but it was disappointing for two reasons:  first, it's difficult because of the controller's size/design (more on that later), and second, it's also very basic at the same time.  The scratch motion is just back and forth with no regard for speed, distance, or anything else that makes each scratch unique.  Ultimately, it's no more interesting than hitting a button on-time and it didn't take long for players to realize it.  I found crossfading to be the most rewarding and interesting part of the gameplay, but most others found it to be too difficult.Another issue is the mixes themselves.  Each one is a mash-up of two tracks and you're supposed to creatively reassemble together.  Interesting yes, but that means that the target tracks are necessarily unfamiliar to everybody.  Think about it this way - when you play Guitar Hero, what's more fun?  Playing some song you've never heard before, or a longtime favorite?  Exactly.  At one point someone commented that you can barely even tell if you're doing well or not because your ears don't know what the end result is supposed to sound like.If the unfamiliarity of the source material was a given, then why not allow more freedom for the player?  Unlike Guitar Hero and Rock Band games, where players are given opportunities to solo freestyle for stretches, there are no such creative opportunities here.  Why not let players decide how to mash these tracks together or even post their own track combinations, similar to how players can upload their own musical compositions via Guitar Hero 5?  This is a big miss that ultimately dooms the game to being more of a chore than party.There is multiplayer built in via DJ + Guitar mode, where one person works the turntable while another plays the familiar guitar hero role.  This seemed like a last-minute add-on, and possibly even a concession that there will probably be more people who want to play the familiar and fun guitar instead of the turntable at your party.THE CONTROLLERThe DJ Hero controller uses one free-spinning turntable and a crossfade bar along with a few extra buttons for Euphoria (like Star Power in GH games) and sound effect/sample drops.  The turntable itself is small, closer to a 7\" single than a full-size record.  This unfortunately makes it difficult to scratch, especially when using the right-hand source - that button is so close the spindle that it's difficult to move the turntable back and forth from that position.  A larger turntable would have solved this issue.Also, I don't see why the turntable is free-spinning to begin with.  Since there are no speed-based elements programmed into the game (i.e. it reads a slow scratching motion identically to a fast one), there's no reason for that range of movement.  It would actually have been easier to control if it sprung back to a center position like the strum bar on a Guitar Hero controller does.  More than a few times, our test group lost the buttons when they spun away after a scratch.Finally, unlike Guitar Hero, there is no option to flip the controls and/or the screen for left-handers.  Even some of the right-handers who tried it found that the controller was too cramped with one hand on the crossfader and the other on the left side of the turntable where it forces you to play.  It would have been nice for all to have an option that flips the on-screen track lines so that you could control the turntable on the right side.The controller is average quality, the turntable being the highlight.  I'll be interested to see how well the crossfade bar holds up during rigorous play - it felt a little flimsy right out of the box.CONCLUSIONI'm not sure who this game will appeal to.  On the one hand, players will no DJing experience will likely find the game and controller too frustrating to bother with, while those who've used the real thing will find the dissimilarities with the turntable controller a turn-off.  Plus based on the opinions of several players, the game itself lacks the immediate \"I can't wait to play that again\" fun factor that the Guitar Hero series has.  Much like how the Guitar Hero series has evolved, maybe the next release of DJ Hero will fix the problems by upgrading the controller and allowing players more creativity in the way that they play with it.  Until then, just pass this one up.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Frickin' awesome!

Overall, a much different RE game. Different in a good way! Also, beat the game to play Mercanaries and Assignment Ada.GRAPHICS: Really impressive. Realistic faces, creepy enviromesnts add to the terror.Sound: The voices are good. And the sound is nice.STORY: It's pretty different. It takes place in 2004, 6 years after the other RE games. Umbrella has been destroyed by the government, so no more T-Virus! Anyway, Leon Kennedy [From RE 2] is now a US agent. His mission is to rescue the President's hot daughter, Ashley, who was last seen in Europe. In Europe, Leon encounters a strange village, and the terror begins.Overall a great story which ending sets the stage for the next one. Plus, an RE 2 character who you thought was dead returns!CONCLUSION: Overall [damn, I say that word too much] a great bloodbath. Great for RE fans, or action fans!UPDATE: 8/12/05: RE5 is going to be released for PS3 and XBox360. Those systems will be painfully expensive!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Matthew K. Peavey","summary":"Super Mario Wildforce Sunshine","reviewText":"Super Mario SunshineAfter Super Mario 64 set the bar for one of Mario&#8217;s greatest game in order to keep up with Sony&#8217;s Playstation Sega&#8217;s Sega Dreamcast a sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel Super Mario 64 2 was said to be developed on the Nintendo 64DD, but ended up being canceled. For those who don&#8217;t know The Nintendo 64DD was a disk system attachment for the N64 like the Sega CD for the Sega Genesis. The first games to be released for the new system would be SimCity 64, Mario Artist, Pok&eacute;mon(Pocket Monsters) and Mother 3. There were only very limited quantities of the 64DD were made available through stores. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only ten games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either cancelled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 games as cartridge-based storage sizes had increased, or eventually ported to the next-generation Nintendo GameCube console.Super Mario Sunshine has some good things but with all that said let&#8217;s begin this reviewStory/Plot: Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollution, sun-shaped objects called &#34;Shine Sprites&#34;, the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named &#34;Shadow Mario&#34;. To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds FLUDD, a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario is promptly arrested after the player defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant at the airstrip which makes the hole in the runway disappear and recovers a Shine Sprite, falsely accused of vandalizing the island. He is put on trial, however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites. Until then, he is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino. After defeating another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rising a disappeared statue out of the ground, they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time who jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down and he creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rises a disappeared cliff, some trees, and a section of a wall out of the ground and recovers another Shine Sprite. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach, and has escaped on a Bowser-designed boat to Pinna Park, an amusement park located just off the coast of Isle Delfino's &#34;tail&#34;. There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario which is called Mecha Bowser by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don&#8217;t even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn&#8217;t get 120 shine spritesIncomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino.Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words &#34;Have a relaxing vacation&#34; is displayed instead.So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2014"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Amazing gameplay and graphics","reviewText":"While Soul Caliber II is great on all platforms, the special character and controller layout really make the XBox version the best of the bunch.\"Soul Caliber II\", for the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2, is a weapon-based fighting game. It is the sequel to Soul Caliber for the Sega Dreamcast. It has beautiful graphics, a comprehensive storyline, and some great moves.The basic story of the game is that there is this evil sword, called Soul Edge. Many want the sword for its great power. It is said to be, in fact, the most powerful sword in the world. However, most people don't know that it is evil, and so many pursue it. The current wielder of it is a mysterious black-armored knight named Nightmare. He was once a bandit, leader of a group called Der Schwarzwind (The Black Wind). He found Soul Edge, but gradually it took over his body. In the last game, Soul Edge was shattered by its opposite, the spirit sword Soul Caliber. However, the broken fragments of the sword have shown up in many places. Some seek to destroy the pieces to prevent the sword from regaining its evil power. Some want it to use to destroy their enemies. Some want it for the power it brings. However, everybody wants it, and most have no quarrel with destroying everyone in their way to get it.There is a huge selection of characters, with six secret characters adding to the lineup. They vary from a Japanese swordsman to a village mystic to a female ninja demon hunter to a diabolical golem to an undead tomb guardian. There are also a great variety of stages, including a windmill in a mountainous village, an abandoned yet well-preserved Japanese castle, and a lakeside garden. Most of these places have at least one place where a fighter can be knocked out of the ring (except for the cage matches), so knocking someone out or tossing them out is a vital strategy for winning.The modes of play that you can do include arcade mode, in which you fight several random enemies and one character-based enemy in order to accomplish your character's goal, Weapon Master Mode, in which you can earn gold to buy extra weapons, costumes, and artwork, to various time attack modes and \"see how long you can survive\" modes. Besides the normal modes, you can also get \"Extra\" modes, which allow you to use the weapons you buy in Weapon Master mode. The weapons can give that little boost needed for victory. Most weapons have a pro and a con, like a staff that has good offense and recovers health, but has poor defense. The higher the cost of the weapon, the better it is. Some weapons have no flaws, like the katana Masamune, which has good offense and defense, with no downside.The in-combat gameplay is good. There are a number of actions, like Guard Impacts (which reverse or trip an enemy's attack), to prevent button mashing. This game is responsible for the most fulfilling fighting round in any fighting game I've ever played. My character was Mitsurugi, the Japanese swordsman, and my opponent was Raphael, the fencer. In most games, the victor would basically be whoever bashed most first. However, in this game, I actually had to think about it. There was thrusting, parrying, slashing, and basically everything that makes a game seem realistic and not just a \"bash, mash, smash\" game. The other moves that can be done range from ninja teleportation to awesome throws.The main reason to buy certain console versions of this game is the \"guest character\" on each one: Link for the Gamecube, Spawn for the Xbox, and Tekken's Heihachi (who uses, well, gloves as his weapon). Also in the game is a character not seen in the video arcade games: Necrid, a special character designed by Spawn's owner, Todd McFarlane (which is why Spawn is the Xbox's guest character and why McFarlane toys manufactures the action figures).As for being \"kid-friendly\", there is no blood, as hits make strange glowing/electrical red spots (but not cuts or slashes). There is some minor swearing (from characters that don't take losing well) and there is some \"female character bounciness\" and skimpy costumes, though each character has at least two costumes, and the alternate costumes on the skimpy characters are usually less bouncy and revealing.This is a very good, fun, and attention-holding fighting game, with only a few clipping errors (objects accidentally going through other objects). It gets a 10/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2003"}

With Subsistence, you've pretty much maxed out your PS2!You don't have to have played the previous Metal Gear entries to enjoy this game. It's a stealth shooter much like Splinter Cell. You have a vast array of weapons, are sneaking through jungle scenery and taking out your enemies as stealthily as you can.The graphics are really quite impressive for the PS2 - perhaps the best they could be. The sun dapples down across the jungle floor. Beams of light shine down through gaps in the trees. Waterfalls splash, leaves wave as you sneak through the canopy.The character movements are of equal quality. When your character runs, crawls, presses against walls and performs other movements, it really is uncannily like there's an actual person following your directions.The sound is very immersive. There aren't blaring rock music soundtracks in the background. When you creep through the jungle, listening intently to figure out where the sniper is hiding, you haer your footsteps, the stream gurgling near you, the birds occasionally singing overhead. The smallest sounds can really help you track down your enemy.It's cool how the game tries to keep things \"real\". When you find forest animals, you can kill them for their meat. If you get injured, you have to patch it up properly - use serum if there's a poison, dig out any darts, bandage the wound, and so on.That being said, I do find it really funny that your enemies sit around and patiently wait for you to do these things. I realize why they have to do that for gameplay reasons. Still, when you're facing an arch enemy who is about to pounce on you, it's vastly amusing for you to sit down for 5 minutes and do intricate surgery on yourself - and then use your radio to call in to your friends and chat about strategy options. When you're done, there your enemy is, being a gentleman and letting you get prepared before the assault.There is a SUPER funny sequence in here when you are talking to a scientist, and he explains the concept of a \"metal gear\". It is completely nonsensical, which of course makes it so funny. It's one of those classic dialogue sequences that you record to your computer and forward around on the web.The game really shines in many ways. You have a lot of cool technology at your disposal so you have numerous ways to achieve each goal. You can use your heat sensors ... or motion sensors ... or just watch very carefully with your naked eyes. You can experiment with a variety of camo and paint options to see what helps you best blend into your environment. You can go for a frontal assault or sneak around the back way. You always know what your objective is - but how you choose to achieve it is completely up to you.As if this wasn't all great enough, there are a TON of extras in this set. There are hilarious extra videos. There are a bunch of online games as well as additional mini-games and older games included for free in the set.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

It's nice to see Daniel Craig willing to do a game based on the James Bond character he did in two movies but sadly it still doesn't really bring anymore well of anything really to the game.  Other then maybe the fascination of being able to play James Bond you'd probably get the same if not more enjoyment in playing a game like L.A. Noire.  The story line plays out like the standard 007 movie and while the voice cast are very good the animation is surprisingly lacking with the exception of the background scenery the character animation looked like it belonged to the early years of the PS2 then it did on the PS3 which is again surprising considering this was from the Activision corner but then again it does depend on the game developers and programers making the game and if their lacking in the animated or effects area it does affect the look and feel to the game as well.  So while the game is enjoyable enough as an action/spy/fighting game I wouldn't go past $20.00 dollars in buying it anymore and you might feel you've been overcharged but if you're a big time James Bond fan this game was definitely made for you....","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Fred \"From http://fredsite.blogspot.com/\"","summary":"Something strange about this game.","reviewText":"Fred's Review:8/10 starsWhat turns out from just saving your village turns out to be saving the World(I won't say that much). Miasma a poisonous gas that surrounds the world, so how do survive it? Every village/town/other things have a crystal that protects them from the miasma, but the crystal needs offerings of myrrh to insure the safety for another year. You get to choose from 4 player classes and choose male or female and choose your design.

This game is great for multiplayer but i find it very hard compared to the one player because if you need to put another item in your command slot you're open to attack and you could die. Other than that the game is pretty straight forward. The bad part is you don't gain levels to increase your stats, instead you get artifacts from boss fights and other things that increase your stats. But there are only a limited number of artifacts and you can only get once of each. I still have to beat a part of the final boss.

That should cancel out exactly one dipstick.On to the game!Beautiful game.  COMES WITH A FREE $(*@)(%! MOVIE!!  Holy 'effing mother of Gargonzola the game takes thirty friggen minutes to get going.  I know it's supposed to be an epic tale of survival and exploration but I MADE A SANDWICH in the time it took for the game to start.  Sure, people joke and say, \"...man, I could have gotten up and made a sandwich in that length of time.\"  Yeah, well, not only did I MAKE the sandwich, I ate the damn thing too.  Beautiful movie...but when it came time to move my guy around I looked at the controller with slight distrust.  \"Hmmm...\"  Lo and behold the damn game was ready for me to play it!

I don't know who stuck a N0S bottle up the main character's butt to make him zip forward like that but it's slightly retarded.  At least make the damn sprint last longer.  I have to keep having my guy make grunting noises like he's plowing the remnants of Thanksgiving dinner through his colon.  *sigh*Combat is very nifty.  Again, nothing groundbreaking but this is an RPG for frick's sake, what did you expect?  There's a little battle bonus board that you can add to by meeting special conditions in battle.  A bonus battle feature where you can sneak around behind the enemy...the name of which escapes me at the moment.  DIFFICULTY SETTINGS!!!  Very very cool.  It's one thing to have a difficult RPG...it's another to have to get your guys to level 27 before you can fight the first boss.  The Japanese are all sadistic, I think.  You get used to whacking all this little stuff and THEN comes captain octopus that absolutely spanks your monkey until bananas come out of your ears.  So frustrating...and this game avoids those frustrations with an easy button.The voices...ugh.  The obligatory cute asian-looking girl with perky...er...attitudes and tight pants is entertaining for the first five minutes.  Then you want to go and grab that stick with a hand on it from the concorde grape-jelly character who runs the item making machine and strangle her with it.  The main character dude says the same...damn...thing...every...friggen...battle.  You can switch them over to the Japanese voices and laugh at them for awhile...but then it starts to feel like you're in an airport and you've gotta switch back.Menu can be changed from modern to classic.  Modern being what I have heard was available on the 360 and classic being a bright anime/cartooney style.  I prefer the anime style personally.In the end, if you didn't try this on the 360 then I say give it a go.  I LOVE RPGs and this one has already provided me with hours of pleasure.

Raillard","summary":"Beautiful, fun... and a bit disappointing","reviewText":"Bioshock is a beautiful game, a well-polished game, with the production values of a Hollywood blockbuster.  I had a lot of fun playing and beating this game, yet when I was done, I uninstalled it and moved on.  Why?  Bioshock is ultimately undermined by the very thing that makes it good in the first place: its carefully crafted storyline and well-planned first player campaign.The GOOD: Terrific graphics, especially the water and fire effects.  This game is not lacking for eye candy, IF you have the hardware.  The sound is similarly stunning, and used very, very well by the developers.  The art direction (the whole art deco concept) is masterfully executed.  The concept--alone in an abandoned underwater utopia gone wrong--is also creative, fun, and used to the full extent.  There are some genuinely scary moments, though F.E.A.R is still scarier than this game.  The plasmid powers are the equivalent of magic in Role-Playing games, and the Tonics function like experience points.  The U-Invent machines are a nice touch, though the whole vending machine bit was overdone.  Overall, there are some genuinely fun moments in this game.The BAD: The story is ultimately pretty weak and trite as well as very, very linear.  At the end I didn't care what was going on, I just wanted to finish the game--that's never a good sign.  There is zero replay value.  I don't care about the lack of multiplayer, but having been spoiled by wide-open, living universes such as Oblivion, the linear, level-to-level design of Bioshock felt limiting and dated.  You don't ever explore Rapture as much as you are guided through it by game designers.  I also feel as if the half RPG/half shooter aspect of the game hurts it.  The plasmid powers are scaled so that you are never really more powerful than your enemies.  That's right, one of the most fun aspects of RPG--leveling up and beating up on baddies--is negated by the scaled difficulty.  The Big Daddy fights are also repetitive as anything, and nowhere near as fluid and inventive as advertised.  The alarms and alarm bots are as annoying as the cliff racers from Morrowind, and a regrettable inclusion on the part of the developers.BOTTOM LINE:  This is a beautiful game that was very, very well executed.  Yet, as always, the innovation and novelty was exaggerated by the media, and at the end of the day, this is essentially a linear, scripted shooter with a predictable story and some half-baked RPG elements thrown in.  I loved System Shock 2 (the ancestor to Bioshock), and I kept waiting for Bioshock to wow me as much as that game did...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00006GEX2","description":"From the makers ofAge of Empirescomes a strategy game where the line between history and mythology has been blurred. InAge of Mythologyheroes do battle with monsters of legend, and the gods intervene in the affairs of mortal men.Age of Mythologyplayers wage war as leaders of a Greek, Norse, or Egyptian civilization with a customized pantheon. Players use human armies and diplomacy, progress through development ages, enhance military and economic performance with improvements, and manage economics through resource gathering and trade. Mythology enters the mix when players call upon the gods to act on their behalf or reinforce their armies with more than 20 mythological creatures such as jackal-headed Egyptian warriors or mighty minotaurs.Age of Mythology's revolutionary 3-D engine provides the game with gorgeous environments featuring lifelike rolling terrain, beautiful waves and water, realistic sunlight, and lush forests. The units roaming these environments are incredibly detailed, move naturally over the terrain, and come to life through hundreds of fluid animations. Amazing special effects change the look of this beautiful world when the gods get involved: all grows dark as an eclipse takes effect, funnel clouds twist and grow as a tornado sends buildings spinning toward the heavens, and meteors streak in from the heavens to send people and armies flying.An entertaining tutorial, an intuitive interface, and logical game rules allow anyone to quickly and easily learn to play. Once started, there is a lot to explore: an epic 36 scenario single player campaign, easy-to-use multiplayer gaming online, single player games against the challengingAge of MythologyAI opponents, more than 15 different random map types that help make the game infinitely replayable, nine highly differentiated civilizations, multiple difficulty levels to allow players of any skill level to have an enjoyable game, and a fully functional scenario editor.Age of Mythologyoffers something for everyone: a fun game for any playing style or skill level.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Stellar Game","reviewText":"Age of Empires 1 and 2 were incredible games with great graphics and gameplay. Age of Mythology takes that engine, beefs up the graphics again and adds in populus-like god power!First, I have to admit that I am a huge Age of Empires fan. I asked everybody around me to play with me, and played it solo just about every chance I could get. I thought the graphics and gameplay and customization were just great.I'm also a populus player from way back, and have eagerly played each release of Populus and Black & White. I enjoy the god-games very much.So Age of Mythology was just about the perfect game that I could ask for! How did it meet my expectations?First, gameplay is just like in Age of Empires. These guys have made a number of games in the Age of Empires series and have received feedback on each set of changes they made. At this point the interface and training are WELL honed and very easy to use. The tutorial helps guide you quickly and easily through learning the system.The graphics are simply amazing. The gorgeous intro video is classic. The in-game graphics are great - just watch those waves lap up on the beach! It's a true pleasure to play.The sounds are well matched to each culture you play, with the characters speaking in the appropriate language for 'background chatter' and ambient noises coming in. It's not intended to be fully immersive like Myst 3 - this is a strategy game, not a RPG. But they do a good job with the sounds.The cultures you choose from are Egyptian, Greek, and Norse. In each culture you have appropriate buildings and troops, plus the gods to choose from. At each stage in development you choose a new additional god to pray to which gives you access to new powers. Some of the powers are pretty amazing!Multiplayer, as always, shines in this game. You can create maps with all the terrain types, devise your own battle situations, play on line against thousands of other Age of Empire enthusiasts. The gameplay that comes with the game is just the start - on line multiplay is where you really test out your strategic thinking.My complaint with the game is that it's too limited in the cultures and gods you get. They have an incredible engine that has been developed over the years, and it shines - but you only get 3 cultures. And those three cultures have very few gods. The 'cheat sheets' that come with the game make it seem like you have a lot of gods and a lot of combinations, but look more closely - it's just the same gods listed in three columns.Undoubtedly their plan is to get people hooked on Age of Mythology, and then slowly dole out new cultures and new gods over time, making us pay for each additional one. If they'd at least started us with five or six cultures that might not have been as bad, but three is sort of flimsy.Still, I'll be playing this for months, and when those expansions come out, I'll be there to buy them!We purchased Age of Mythology with our own funds from a gaming store.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47YE","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Not as good as the first, but is really fun","reviewText":"The Good: Gorgeous visuals, great cinematic moments, lots of weapons to shoot, streamlined suit powers, fun multiplayerThe Bad: Low enemy variety, upgrading suit powers is a little underwhelming, story isn't very good and is confusing, you need a monster/top of line rig to get the best visual experienceBeing a regular human in a shooter has been done hundreds of times, but being a true one man army with technology built into your nano-suit is something that hasn't really been done before. Meet Alcatraz. The poor dying soldier/nobody who Prophet chose to stick his suit on and kill himself. Now you are thrown into the war that you wanted nothing to do with and are the key to helping stop the invasion on Manhattan.A lot that you remember from the first game is different now thanks to the game being streamlined for consoles. You no longer have a power wheel and two of them have been taken away and put into the other two. You get to switch between armor mode and stealth mode. You can use your super power moves in armor mode such as powerful kicks and punches as well as absorbing long falls. Stealth mode allows you to cloak and sneak up on enemies or just go right on past without being detected. Both of these are key to staying alive and you will be switching constantly.Another thing that has changed was that lush jungle you got to roam around in freely. You are now stuck in a concrete world and the game is more linear this time around. That's not all bad because you still get to choose your approach to firefights and some areas are massive. Using your tactical visor the game will give you options to approach the battle such as certain weapons, high perches for sniping, or complete paths to totally avoid all enemies. This still gives you the sense of battle control like in the first game without making it feel like a Halo/Call of Duty hallway clone.You have two enemies in the game: Ceph aliens and the CELL army trying to capture and use your technology for their own good. The story isn't exactly the most cohesive thing we've seen as wasn't the first game either. The story is kind of confusing and you never really know what's going on between all the characters, and it doesn't get really good until the last couple of missions. The middle of the game is a lot of back and forth between Hargreave and Gould who are two scientists with completely different views. The CELL enemies are just like regular humans, but later on the game throws countless Ceph at you and they have different types of Ceph that come after you from grunts to huge walking tanks. Of course this makes the game feel very repetitious due to the low enemy type and the game doesn't really look different from area to area except different levels of destruction.There is a little more to it than just shooting everything in sight. You can upgrade your powers this time around by collecting nano catalysts from dead Ceph, and the stronger the Ceph the more you will get. Press the upgrade button and Alcatraz's hand will be displayed with five different areas of upgrades on his fingers. A few examples are bullet tracers, longer stealth mode, and the ability to see cloaked enemies. While it does change the game play a bit it doesn't do a lot to truly enhance the experience. Not to mention the fact that you have to watch your energy meter when using power because it runs out in a matter of seconds. Using your night vision plus stealth while running will run it down in less than 10 seconds so you never truly feel powerful or get the ability to upgrade your energy meter.Of course you can still customize your weapons with different sights, silencers, and other attachments, but I wish we could use every attachment for every gun instead of each gun getting its special options. There are some new guns however and there are plenty, but they are fun to shoot so don't think that the weapon selection is weak  at all. There are some other things thrown in like a few turret sections, and some quick time events thrown into the cinematic parts of the game which are thrilling and very fun, but they are too short and to far apart from each other. The linearity of the game allows this type of cinematic control and its welcomed, but I would have liked to see more of it.Your probably wondering about the graphics. Since this is streamlined for consoles do we get DirectX 11? Do we get higher resolution textures and extra graphic options? When the game launched it was no. We got exactly what the consoles got, but a few months later the DirectX 11 patch was released as well as a high-resolution texture pack. With this the game looks phenomenal and probably the best looking shooter to date. Of course you need a monster rig to the run the game with these settings enabled. Even my rig dropped in the single digits during certain scenes, but man is it gorgeous to look at. The game also supports 3D so if you have the GPU then enable it because it does enhance the experience a lot.Overall there are a few bugs that can some times hinder the game, and it also is very long for an FPS running about 10-12 hours. The multiplayer is also very addictive and fun for a while with perks upgrades and there is a good variety of maps available. I had a lot of fun since using the suit powers kind of makes playing an FPS different online. However, it still doesn't have that addictive quality of Call of Duty or Halo to keep you playing for months or years after release. So, with an underwhelming story, and low enemy variety just stomach the repetition for a while and you'll be treated to one gorgeous and fun shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Johnson","summary":"Very good game; better than WC2 but not SC","reviewText":"Graphics:The graphics in Warcraft 3 are the best I have seen in any RTS game I have seen.  The game utilizes a useless, but very cool zoom feature that allows you to actually rotate the camera to a point where you are actually facing the troops, and you see exactly what they see from the same angle that they are at.  The surrounding environments also are very realistic.  For example, in swamp levels, you actually see lily pads floating on top of the water.  In addition to the stationary objects in WC3, there is also a lot more critters in this one, (i.e., wolves, deer, birds, and of course sheep).  The critters are done very well too.Audio:While the background music and soundtrack in this game are not up to the par of the breathtaking soundtracks of Warcraft 2 and especially Starcraft, it is adequate.  In other words, good but nothing special.  The battle sounds seem strikingly similar to that of WC2 and again while it is nothing special it is far from terrible.  Blizzard did add a few more sound effects like, the sound of trees crashing down when your peasant units harvest lumber.  Also you bigger units make thundering sounds with every step they take, it is not very loud, but you may be able to hear the thundering faintly with a decent audio card.Presentation:The game features 4 distinct races as opposed to the three from SC and 2 from WC2.  These races are, Humans, Orcs, Night Elves and Undead.A neat thing about WC3 that was not present in its predecessors are \"Creeps\" (Not the same \"Creep\" from SC).  Creeps are basically units that neither team controls.  Creeps will attack ANY unit that comes in their area, some Creeps are very week while others are very strong.  Creeps usually guard gold mines and other places that would be useful to you.  This prevents you or your opponent from just going to every gold mine with one peasant to expand.  It now requires you to fight for your expansions.Gameplay:As you expect the game play is very similar to that of SC and WC3, basically you have a peasant unit and harvest resources to build new structures and more units.  There are a couple of major differences though.  First, you are in control of a \"hero\" unit.  A hero unit is a unit that has advanced strength, hit points which is much more powerful than your regular units.  Heroes have the capability of taking on a small force of enemies single handedly and winning.  Also in addition, heroes can gain experience points.  These experience points can be used to make your hero even stronger and also give them more powerful spells.  Finally Heroes have their own \"hot keys\" assigned to them, (F1 - F3 keys) making them easily accessible in battle.Another feature about the game play that is different is that you now only have a 90-food limit, this kind of restricts your game play in that you can't really build huge armies as you could in WC2 and SC.  This can be a good thing or bad thing depending on how you look at it.  It basically forces you to attack rather than just sitting back and watching your army grow.  Finally while WC2 had air, land and sea units, WC3 only has air and land, and also there seems to be fewer units as compared to WC2 and SC.  That does not bother me, since I prefer the limited number and it seems to make the game simpler in a sense.  I find the unit choices sufficient for me.One bad thing I have to mention about the gameplay is your unit commands, the move command no longer moves your injured troops out of danger, if one or you troops is about to die, and you order him to move back, he will move, but as soon as your group is attacked again, that same troop will move back into battle, then ultimately dying.  This gets very frustrating especially if you're trying to save as many troops as possible.  The only way to keep them from attacking again is to force them to hold position.  This takes away precious seconds from you and could even cost you a battle if playing a very good opponent.One good thing I must mention is that some units have an \"auto casting\" feature, which allows you to automatically cast spells without having to click an individual unit.  Shamans for example, can auto cast \"bloodlust\" on your orc units while you are fighting.  This saves time and can be turned off if desired....Overall:Overall this is a very good game; better than WC2, but not SC.  The main gripe I have on the game is battle net.  Another thing you may want to consider before buying this game is that you will need a fairly powerful system with fairly power hardware to run it effectively.  I had a two year old 32MB card that served me fine up until WC3.  But it simply would not work on WC3.  When I upgraded to a 64MB it ran with no problem.

It's incredibly addicting and engrossing. It's another spectacular game from Bethesda Software redeeming themselves from their not so good Star Trek game some time ago which was also for the 360. Fallout 3 presents a shattered world, a wasteland after a nuclear apocalypse. And you basically have the main quest where you search for your father \"follow in his footsteps\" or you have a seemingly endless variety of side quests and different story archs to explore. It's a long in depth game that's not entirely suited to the casual gamer. My biggest thing is that this game is a satisfying adventure from beginning to end. It's not ridiculously easy or ridiculously hard (unless you encounter a Super Mutant Giant and you only have ammno for your puny laser pistol left) and there is actual freedom and sandbox play unlike Fable 2 that promised it but didn't deliver. Peter Molyneux ought to take some lessons from the folks at Bethesda Soft on how to make a truly enduring and rich game experience. It's not simply graphics and some elementary crap about growing up and making one dimensional moral choices. Perhaps comparing this to Fable 2 isn't entirely fair but in my game chest Fable 2 was beaten in one days time and on the shelf indefinitely, I may trade it in towards a purchase of Dead Space or something. I intend to play Fallout 3 for a very very long time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

{"product_name":"B004J6I0YO","description":"","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Elevator Battle Kills It","reviewText":"Whatever you do, do NOT buy this game!  The elevator battle towards the end of the Sands of Time is the most poorly designed video game aspect in recent memory.  After more than 20 tries, I just couldn't beat it.  Whenever that happens, you know that a game is fatally flawed.Let's break it down, shall we?  You encounter this elevator battle about 80% into the game, and you're stuck in it with Farah trying to slay hordes of monsters.  You not only have to stay alive yourself, but you also have to make sure that Farah doesn't die (an impossible feat).  If you don't die, she does; and if she doesn't die, you eventually do.  It's a lose-lose situation, especially within the confines of such small a space.There are fountains on either side of the raised area within the elevator, but do you think you can use them to restore your life during the battle?  NO!  That's flaw number one.  Number two:  the camera angles are AWFUL.  Every single time at some point(s) in the battle, the camera would move behind a curtain, thereby obstructing your view and leaving you open to needless attack.  Three:  this game has HORRIBLE jumping mechanics.  Where you want the prince to jump, he jumps the other way.  Performing precise wall-run attacks during this battle is near impossible to execute on point each time.  Then, vaulting over enemies doesn't work all the time either.  Four:  you can't change the difficulty level in game.  I was playing on normal, and I was hoping to switch to easy to make this battle less difficult, but you can't do that unless you start a whole new game on that difficulty level.  HORRIBLE.  Because of these facts, this game is poorly designed and fatally flawed.It's a shame how this happened in the first title I played on this trilogy because I have absolutely no interest in playing the other 2 games.  Sands of Time completely soured my opinion of the entire Prince of Persia franchise, and I am proudly going to trade this in to Amazon this week.DO NOT BUY!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2013"}

Since this is a game that is based on the movie, the game follows it, and let me just say, the movie Revenge of the Sith will be awesome! Now on to the game.The game play for this game truly is top notch. The moves in the game connect so well and so natural, it's as if you are literally in the movie. The controls are easy to learn and they teach you the different moves as you progress through the game. The difficulty on this game is challenging, but not impossible.This game is mainly action/adventure but adds a little RPG into the mix by letting you upgrade the force powers. All of the force powers start off at level one, but as you earn experience, you can spend the experience to upgrade your power all the way to level three. If you do very well, you will up grade your character. You earn experience by killing enemies, the more impressive the finishing move on your enemies are, the more points you get. As I have mentioned, your character will be upgraded if enough enemies are killed. Obi-Wan and Anakin both start off at Jedi, but as you progress, they can eventually become Jedi Knight and finally Jedi Master.In the game, there are also hidden health and force upgrades that allow your health and force energy bars longer and gives you more health and force capacity which is very helpful. Besides light saber battles, you also mount cannons to fire at certain object to complete certain goals, there is variety.Multi-player can be done with a friend or a computer partner in the dual. The dual is characters that are unlocked battling each other like a fighting game, and it is treated as such.The look is equally amazing. You can tell how much detail that was put into the game, very beautiful watch as you play. The characters are very detailed and the background is equally astonishing. As you fight, different things are happening in the back ground i.e. ships exploding and fighting as you fight Count Dooku. A lot of time was put into this and it really does show.The story is told by actual movie scenes. When the movie scene ends, you begin to play and vice verse, as you play in the game it will cut to movie scenes. Both are very well done and work very well to help make the ultimate movie experience.The music adds to this game. To the beautiful peaceful music, to the Star Wars theme, to the Darth Vader theme as Anakin begins to change, it really does set the mood.As always, this game has extras, although be it not many. The only extras that can be unlocked in the Special Features menu are lots and lots of concept arts for the game. In the Special Features, you can also view the movies of the levels you have completed and you can also view the end credits.The game really shines by having bonus missions that are unlocked as you beat certain levels. These bonus missions add game play to this game after the main game is finished. You play as certain different individuals and completing certain tasks, usually you have to beat a certain amount of enemies or survive. After the 17th mission is complete, an extra 5th bonus mission featuring the mechanical Darth Vader of Episode IV can be unlocked.Besides lack of real extras, there is only one negative thing that can be said about this game and that it's not long enough. Sadly, this game doesn't go scene for scene in the movie and skips quite a lot of story. It mainly focuses on the action parts of the film, which is understandable; Lucas didn't want the entire movie spoiled before it was in theaters. There is nothing in this game about Anakin and Padme, but they do focus on the friendship between him and Obi-Wan. With that being said, this game is about six to eight hours long, depending on how long it takes you personally to beat the game. If everything in the movie was added, this would have been longer.Finally, overall, despite the lack of extras, this game is a must have for all Star Wars fans. I haven't had this much fun in a Star Wars game since Knights of the Old Republic. Since it follows the movie, this game does contain A LOT of spoilers, so if you don't want the movie spoiled, don't buy until after you see the film. Luckily, it has a high replay value. So it is worth your money, especially if you want to get an early look at the film, or have something to remember the film by until you have the DVD movie. I recommend this to all!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2005"}

Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem.

It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends.

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience.

A little bit after Sons of Liberty was released, a version called Substance was released with more extras.GAMEPLAY: (Like my Dark Cloud 2 review, the gameplay will be divided into sections.)THE MAIN GAME:  Just like the original, you have to be stealthy and sneaky. This time, there is more ways to be that way. Like hiding in lockers, setting off fire extinguishers, hanging, or disguising yourself.There is more enemy activity, too. If they see you, they have to use their walkie-talkie to alert people. So, if you defeat the soldier before he calls them, you are OK, but they will conduct a search if you interrupt the call.You can also hold up a soldier. Sneak behind them, pull out your gun, and Snake/Raiden should say, \"Freeze!\" and you can collect the soldier's dog tag this way.The weapons are more advanced. Now you can shoot your gun in first person and you even have a tranquilizer.You play as two characters throughout the game. Snake, who you play as briefly, and then Raiden (pronounced RIE-din) who I think is pretty underrated.VR MISSIONS: You can practice your skills with a bunch (and I mean a BUNCH!) of VR missions with many different characters. One of my favorites is Variety mode, where one of the levels involves sneaking past Godzilla-sized enemies!SNAKE TAILS: Play through 5 different missions involving Snake. Has nothing to do with the main plot.SKATEBOARDING: A fun little skateboarding game.SPECIAL: Everything else. Some of the stuff in Special you unlock. Like Boss Survival, which has you battling all the bosses!GRAPHICS: The graphics look great.

In this latest expansion, something is afoot in the cold, harsh northlands. The Lich King Arthas has set in motion events that could lead to the extinction of all life on Azeroth. The necromantic power of the plague and legions of undead armies threaten to sweep across the land. Only the mightiest heroes can oppose the Lich King and end his reign of terror..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman, inhabit the icy Borean Tundra.View larger.Half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land.View larger.You'll enjoy exploring Northrend and all its environments and dungeons.View larger.Explore Northrend and battle the Lich King with World of Warcraft's first hero class character -- The Death Knight.View larger.One of many new environments, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.View larger.Many strange and terrifying creatures inhabit this frozen continent.View larger.Enter the Death KnightThis expansion adds a host of content to the already massive existing game world. Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

If you already own Burning Crusade then you have a good idea of what to expect - a higher level cap (80), a new profession, and instead of a new race, a new class, the death knight.  Blizzard has always been a company which has focused on releasing polished products and incrementally improving products they've already released, and this expansion continues that tradition.The quest content in this expansion is substantially improved from the previous expansion, which in turn was much better than quests in the original WoW.  A lot of the tedium in quests has been eliminated, while a new, flexible vehicle mechanic allows Blizzard to introduce more interesting and varied quests.  There is much more story coherence in the quests, with each zone having several lengthy chains of quests each with a unified plot.  Blizzard also knows that people don't want to spend as much time re-leveling, so they have quickened the leveling curve from 60 to 70.One of the biggest draws of the expansion is the new death knight class.  This class, which is only available if you already have another character above level 55, starts at level 55 and uses a new \"rune\" and \"runic power\" mechanic, which is kind of like a mix of energy and rage.  At this point, death knights are probably slightly overpowered (they are dramatically overpowered at low levels, but converge towards other classes as they approach 80) but that makes them a lot of fun to play.  They can tank as well as dps, with considerable self-healing abilities that often trivialize group quests.The 5-man content in this expansion is also well done.  The 5-man instances are all interesting, not too lengthy, and well balanced for a variety of groups.  With regards to raids, Blizzard has decided that every raid dungeon will have a 10 man and an entirely separate 25 man component.  The physical dungeon environment and mobs are the same in each, and many (but not all!) mob abilities are shared between the two dungeon sizes, but of course each dungeon is balanced to the appropriate number of people.  Right now, there is only one full raid zone (Naxxramas) and three smaller raids (Malygos, Sartharion, and Archavon), but the new Ulduar zone will be patched into the game in 3.1, which is probably going to be released within two months.  Unfortunately, as many other reviewers have noted, the existing content is not particularly challenging.  While this makes raid content more accessible, it also makes better raid groups bored of existing content.  It remains to be seen if Blizzard intends on ever making raids as difficult as Sunwell Plateau or the original Naxxramas at level 60.Player vs. player does not seem particularly balanced at this point in the game, although it never was completely balanced anyway.  There is a new battleground, Strand of the Ancients, as well as a world pvp zone, Wintergrasp.  If you ever plan on playing in Wintergrasp, make sure your computer is decently powerful, becuase the sheer number of people in the zone during server wide battles can drastically slow down older computers.  The main city of Dalaran also suffers from this problem at times, because it is much more condensed than Shattrath and thus forces your computer to load many more models at once than ever before.If you intend on playing World of Warcraft you probably need to get this expansion.  Almost everyone who plays owns this expansion so you won't find many people to interact with if you don't own Wrath.  The existing content is polished, for the most part, and enjoyable to play, but the end raid game can become boring since it's so easy.  Hopefully future patches will introduce challenging raids that will keep better groups busy for a while.UPDATE (May 28 2009):  The new Ulduar instance was released in the last major patch for the game, in mid-April.  This instance basically addresses my critique of the end-game raids in the initial release of Wrath of the Lich King.  Ulduar is quite large (14 bosses total), well-designed, and makes extensive use of \"hard mode\" raid encounters, where the base encounter is fairly easy to do (though not trivial), while the hard mode for bosses, which are activated in various ways, will present a challenge for even hardcore guilds.  If you're looking for a combat-oriented MMO, you should probably get World of Warcraft and buy this expansion now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2009"}

The art direction for this game is so far above earlier titles that even comparing them to this game is utterly pointless. Its literally in a class by itself and this is evident everywhere you look. The most obvious and impressive improvement has to be the design of the clothing, armor and weapons. The intricate designs are truly breathtaking. Even the cheap equipment you first start off with is stunning. For example, one of the first shields your introduced to in the game is the Hide Shield and its absolutely beautiful. Large metal rivets circle the outer diameter and intricate designs adorn the leather. It even has the dents and nicks one would expect to see from a shield that has seen its fair share of battle. This attention to detail is seen everywhere and it goes right down to the bindings of the books and the crackle glazed dishes and pottery found adorning most tables and halls. When you add this to the significant improvement in graphics....well, what you get is a level of realism that simply blows earlier titles out of the water. This is hands down the best art direction I have ever seen from a video game and ultimately it gives this world a level of realism that we simply haven't seen before.The world itself is absolutely beautiful. One of the first open scenes I came across was a large flowing river that had huge rocks jetting up creating white water/rapids. Large mountains were in the background with wisps of clouds running all up and down the side of the mountain. It was absolutely stunning. I had to just stop and stare for a few moments. The draw distance has been significantly increased and the detail, as I wrote up above, is amazing. The landscape itself is just one big work of art. Traveling around and discovering the land for yourself has always been one of the big enjoyments for fans of this series. Well, Skyrim doesn't disappoint in this regard. In fact, this is easily the best title yet in regards to this aspect of the game. No other game series can compete with the size and scope of the worlds that Bethesda creates for this series and no other game in the Elder Scrolls series even comes close to matching what Bethesda has achieved this time around with Skyrim. They have significantly leapfrogged anything and everything they have done in the past.An issue I feel compelled to discuss is the huge improvement with the 3rd person perspective in this game. As I am sure people are aware, 3rd person perspective in Oblivion was pretty bad. Actually, it was awful. You could switch over for short periods but the game was pretty much unplayable from that perspective. Well, the improvement Bethesda has made in this aspect of the game is nothing short of amazing. Your character no longer looks like he is walking on air and your easily able to interact with your environment. Basically this game is now wholly playable from this perspective. I prefer playing in 3rd person perspective when I am just traveling around and its just really nice to see Bethesda finally take the proper steps to fix this aspect of this series. If your going to include it than at least make it playable and Bethesda has done just that.You can immediately tell that this is an Elder Scrolls game but dont let that fool you. There are a lot of changes behind Skrim. One of the most obvious changes is with the skill system. The skills themselves are pretty much the same. You have Alchemy, Illusion, Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Alteration, Enchanting, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Block, One Handed, Two Handed, Archery, Sneak, Lockpicking, Pickpocket, Speech and a new one Smithing. The big difference lies in the fact that you now have specialty skills for each skill category and there are multiple branching paths one can take. For example, the Stealth skill has two different branches that one can take, one that focuses on stealth (Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Silent Roll, ect.) and one that focuses on blade skills (Backstab, Deadly aim, and Assassins blade). This ultimately adds a significant amount of depth to character progression and it also adds to the games re-playability factor as there are now so many different avenues one can take. On top of this there are no longer character classes. You still have the different races of character to choose from but choosing a class is history. What kind of character you become (Spellcaster, Fighter etc.) is solely dependent on the skills you choose to upgrade or in other words its dependent on how you play your character. Personally I love this new system as it doesn't lock you into a specific mold for your character and it leaves everything open for you to explore. Its just a far more organic system and ultimately I think its a significant step forward for this series in regards to character development.Another big change is with the menu system and this is easily one of the best changes made in this game. The new menu system is just far more intuitive. Basically the menu system has been broken down into 4 distinct categories. There is Skills, Items, Map, and Magic. You have to press the menu button to access the menu but once you do that, you no longer need to press buttons. Simply press the left stick in the direction of the menu you want and it automatically changes. Once you have done this, a new subsystem of selections will come up and pressing the left stick to the right will take you to the next menu and so on. No button pressing needed. Basically the left thumb stick controls all of your movements within the menu system, with no button pressing needed. I may not have described it very well but its hands down one of the best menu systems I have ever used. Again, its just a far more intuitive system and it just has a great feel to it. You never leave the main screen when accessing menu's. It just blurs out a bit and acts as a background to the menus themselves. This basically does two things, it helps to keep the menus from detracting from the game itself and it ultimately makes the menu system far more attractive. They have also updated the item menu with 3 dimensional representations of the in game items. You can now spin items around a 360 degree axis, both vertical and horizontal. Its a small detail but a very cool one, especially for the weapons and armor.I also have to mention the skill menu as the way they have graphically laid this system out is...well, its nothing short of stunning. Each individual skill is represented by a constellation in the sky and beautiful gaseous nebula act as a background to the constellations. The visual effect is gorgeous. You can cycle left or right through the skills/constellations and when you access the branching skill set associated with each skill, you suddenly zoom into the constellation itself and the different branching skills are suddenly represented by the individual stars in that particular constellation. Its kind of difficult to properly explain but trust me, the effect is not only stunning, its also nothing short of ingenious. Its EASILY one of the best, if not the best, molds of form and function I have seen yet in videogames. Words simply cant do this games art direction justice. It really has to be seen firsthand to be fully appreciated.Combat has also been overhauled and what we wind up with is a system that is far more fluid, and ultimately a lot more fun, than previous releases. Characters are now able to duel wield both weapons and spells and can even mix up the two. In other words, you can assign a sword to one hand and a spell to another hand or you can go with a staff in one hand and a spell in the other. You can mix it up anyway you want. This new system fits perfectly with the new character system (that being one with no character classes). By adding so many options in regards to how to approach combat, they have essentially added strategy to the mix, something that was entirely lacking in Oblivion. Well, short of actually picking what character class you were actually going to play in oblivion. Basically the combat is just far superior to what we had with Oblivion. Unfortunately you can no longer assign weapons and spells to the D-pad and this is really one of my only complaints with the game. I dont understand why Bethesda decided to get rid of this. They could have even split the D-pad field in two, to accommodate the dual wielding nature of the game. In other words, they could have made the 4 slots on the left for the left hand and the 4 right slots on the right for the right hand. That would still have given you 4 quick slots for each hand.There are lots of other aspects to this game that have been updated but I will leave the rest of them for the player to discover and while there are lots of new additions to Skyrim, fortunately there is also a lot that hasn't changed. Traveling is still done the same way. Once you have actually discovered a location you have the option to fast travel to that location. There are still lots of different factions that one can join, all of which have additional quests associated with them. You can still go about playing the game as you want. You still collect herbs and ingredients for potions. There are still hundreds of different books that one can read. I could go on and on and on and on. This is an Elder Scrolls game after all and Bethesda has kept the heart of the game intact and that is a very good thing indeed. I wont go into the story aspect of this game as I hate spoilers. I will just say that the main story line is fantatstic and is really the icing on the cake.Bottom line - I am a huge Elder Scrolls fan and I have been watching this game since it was first announced. To say my expectations were extremely high would be a massive understatement. With that being said, Skyrim is everything that I hoped for and then some. It hasn't just raised the bar, its launched it into the stratosphere. If your an Elder Scrolls fan then buying this should be a no brainer. This is the kind of game people buy consoles for and this is easily Bethesda's best work yet in regards to this series. They have just taken this franchise to a whole new level. Thankfully, I have lots of time in the coming months to discover all that this game has to offer and make no mistake about it, what this game has to offer....well, its limited only by the amount of time you spend with it.Outstanding, simply outstanding!5 Stars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ0SY","description":"","reviewerName":"Xyooj","summary":"Not much has changed between sequels","reviewText":"Crysis 3 plays identical to Crysis 2.  I don't think anything, in terms of gameplay has changed.  Suit powers and weapons remain the same.  The graphics does look better than its predecessor, so it has that going for it.  So if you played the second game, this will be deja vu; which is either a good or bad thing.For me, a good story-line within a video game is what keeps me intrigued and engaged.  But this game lacks coherency, with many plot holes and the likes.  Questions that I kept asking are what happened to the US government/military, why am I a rebel and this story/plot makes no sense.  None of the characters are memorable.As for game performance, it runs smoothly on my PC on MAX settings at 2560x1440 with SLI 670s.  I haven't noticed any considerable drops in frame.  Also of note, I did have issue running the game while my video cards were overclocked.  They lagged and crashed constantly, so I reset to the default clocks and the game ran fine afterwards.Overall, Crysis 3 is definitely better than Aliens CM, so if you had to chose. I would recommend this game but I suggest waiting for a price drop, there's nothing noteworthy or a must play in my eyes.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2013"}

This game is perfect if you have no girlfriend/boyfriend, job, social life, or basically any form of physical or social activity that differs you from that of a rusted lawn chair. This game does nothing but steal time away from you. If you have time to waste good, you'll be spending hours here. If you plan to leave the World of Warcraft to shower,eat,sleep,use the bathroom etc,you obviously don't belong there. This game does nothing but replace real life goals and accomplishments met through realife hardwork with digital goals that are met with the same amount of time applied. The difference being the accomplishments you wasted your time on in the game mean absolutely and I mean absolutely nothing! They have no value whatsover accept to other people like yourself trapped in the game.I got so tired of people talking about what they do in this game like it's an actual accomplishment. You played since it's release? who cares? You have Tier whatever gear who cares? You have some magic mount no one else in the game has who cares? You have tons of fake game gold who cares? None of this stuff matters to people that live in the real world. Do you think anyone cares that I killed King Bowser back in 1989? Or that I upgraded my standard blaster to a missle blaster in Metroid in 1988? Or how about the time I found the secret ring in Sonic the Hedge Hog when I got my first Sega? NO ONE CARES A BOUT WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED IN A GAME! IT'S MEANINGLESS! IT HAS NO REAL WORLD VALUE!Every inch of this game is festered with morons that simply can't understand that. At first I thought it was mostly just ignorant kids...but these are adults! Yes, grown adults! Acting like they are children. Some I even know of to have neglected their own children just to play the game. I brought The WoW the first game because it was new and I enjoyed it...but it was short lived with all the drama. I brought the Burning Crusade because my guild annoyed me until I did (I was the guild master). I had to always have the best armor and weapons to keep up with and lead these morons. It was a real pain in the behind. The game felt so much like a job.All the expansion does is add more hours for you to waste getting better armor and more dungeons to drag yourself through for 10 exciting levels of doing the same quest over and over again. If you like living your life on par with that of a coat hanger... or maybe a lawnmower in the dead of winter. Than this game is perfect for you. However if you enjoy games that are fun and challenging and really exciting look away from this and never come back.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2009"}

Yes you can select difficulty levels and if you're unsure you can play on the casual level as I first did, and the casual levels is actually extremely easy to beat as long as you play the game correctly.

I came across Blur and decided to give it a shot, and was pleasantly surprised at how fun it is. Someone compared this to Mario Kart, and this is a very good description of the game. I would consider it Mario Kart for adults perhaps?The racing mechanics are very solid, each car having its own handling characteristics. Weaponry is very well done and generally balanced. For the single-player career mode, the only minor complaint I have is that to progress through the career, you must accumulate certain number of points by accomplishing certain goals, and some of the goals are plain unachievable. Because of this, some of the level 'bosses' will never be opened up unless you are committed to replaying the same races 20 or 30 times. Also, you will definitely need to replay some of the races several times in order to earn enough points to progress.On the multiplayer front, there are some customization for your car which is a nice touch. However, note that many players have been playing for several months (if not years) since this is not a new game, so you will encounter many Level 50 players and you will not have a chance to beat them. Fortunately, win or lose, you will earn experience (\"fan points\") that will help you unlock things along the way, so you still get some rewards albeit limited when racing against top players.All in all, this is a great racing game which I highly recommend to all racing fans!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CMQTVUA","description":"","reviewerName":"DeadPlacebo","summary":"Better Than Hoped","reviewText":"I will start this off by saying that yes, I am a little biased  I won this console (and Forza 5) for free through the Microsoft email randomness.  (google it, it's real).  It arrived on my doorstep 4pm on release day with the email code for Forza arriving 2 hours later.  Immediately with the Xbox One, I was worried because Sony's PS4 did so well that I didn't think Microsoft would live up to the expectations.  I was wrong.  After setting up the console, signing in and hooking up the Kinect settings...you're still not done.  Even if you have a disc copy of a game, you still need to install it.  This can certainly take some time.  I did the 10 dollar digital upgrade to COD Ghosts and that took almost 4 hours to completely download.  Aside from download times, this is almost perfect.  The only things it's really missing (and are going to be added late this year or early next year) are Twitch capabilities (you can use the app but just watch other feeds you cannot broadcast your own) and an easier way to use Skydrive.  The Skydrive is the way to share videos through Facebook and Twitter but the only way to make that work is to go on Internet Explorer, go to Skydrive website and do it from there on the One (or computer).The kinect is pretty awesome.  The voice commands you can do for it make navigating the system a lot easier than before as you can micromanage everything and save a few steps.  The only time it gets annoying is when I was watching a movie, it kept trying to recognize what my hands were doing when I was playing with my phone.There are rooms for improvements and small updates to patch this and that, but nothing major says &#34;this sucks&#34;.  I know it's not the &#34;popular&#34; thing to like Microsoft, but even Sony trolls can't deny that the Xbox One is pretty awesome.  On top of Ghosts and Forza on demand, I got Killer Instinct (you have to buy one character to get achievements so I got Glacius) and then disc games got Fifa 14, Ryse and Dead Rising 3.  I'm so impressed with everything, so far.  If you can get your hands on this, I highly recommend it.  The graphics, sound, controller, everything is outstanding.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00002CF9M","description":"InDiablo II, players return to a world of dark fantasy. As one of five distinct character types, players explore the world ofDiablo II, journey across distant lands, fight new villains, discover new treasures, and uncover ancient mysteries. Since the beginning of time, the forces of order and chaos have been engaged in an eternal struggle to decide the fate of all creation. That struggle has now come to the mortal realm, and neither man, demon, nor angel will be left unscathed. Diablo, lord of terror and youngest of the three prime evils, awakes from his long sleep beneath the dark earth. Setting in motion a grand scheme to free his exiled brothers, Mephisto and Baal, Diablo takes control of the small western kingdom of Khanduras. Working from deep within the ancient catacombs beneath the town of Tristram, Diablo grips the entire populace in a blanket of fear and paranoia. Ultimately, as even Khanduras's good King Leoric falls under Diablo's wicked power, a lone hero arises to challenge the darkness that engulfs the land. After plumbing the hellish depths of the labyrinth under Tristram, the nameless hero finally confronts the lord of terror himself. Knowing full well that Diablo's spirit can never be truly destroyed, the hero makes the noblest sacrifice of all--casting his soul and his very sanity aside, he takes the spirit of Diablo into himself, hoping that his own strength of will can contain the demon within. The hero doesn't realize that his selfless act will not only ensure Diablo's victory, but will also irrevocably damn his soul for all time.","reviewerName":"Monkdude","summary":"Better than I thought it would be!","reviewText":"I read some of the reviews and most people said this game was okay, but  not as good as the original.

Mario is kidnapped and his friends and its up to peach to save mario so in this game as you can see you play as peach. Let me tell you a lil bit of this game. First off peach has interesting powers unlike mario has. Her powers rely on her emotions so the 4 emotions u can choose are: angry, sad, joy, and calm. Angry is when peach bursts up in fire with rage and u can use to burn down bridges or icy stuff like snowmen. Crying is when peach is sad and can make things grow with her tears. Joy is when peach flys up in the hair and can make a tornato. Calm is when peach can heal herself up slowely use this when peach is low on hp. Also when u use her emotions u use your stylus on the touch screen and click on one of her emotions. When u run out of the points u can recharge by either using peachs umbrella to pick up a creature and crouching down to absorbe it to get the points or by finding one of those blue chrystal type of things which will recharge it as well. There are things you can find in the game like puzzle peices and minigames that you can unlock. There is a shop that you can buy stuff like a better umbrella which is quite helpful to buy in the game and can be stronger in battle for peach. Each chapter in the game at the end u fight the boss. each time u go to the next lvl u hav to find 3 toads so dont forget to find them as well.

Whats cool about the game is that they shoot actual live footage for that's in the game only, you wont see thisstuff in The Matrix Reloaded.  So it has it's own story line that adds on to The Matrix Reloaded and whats cool about it is that you wont know the story unless you play the game (Wonder what the other charters besides NEO were doing?  Wonder no more).  This is by far the best game thats based off a movie.  One other cool thing, when you beat the game you get to see a trailer to the Matric Revolutions.Okay now about the game play, well basically you are fast as hell and you can't beat everyone down that is normal.  There's a button that lets you slow things down and do all that cool slow motion action. You only get to play as two characters Niaomi and Ghost, I didn't mind much, I mean if you got to play as NEO you would either already no the story from watching the Movie or you would spoil the movie. The basics of the game is to beat everyone down, there isn't really a strategy.Bad Points- Sometimes your characters stays locked on to NPC that are already dead and you get your ass kicked by the baddies and it is only sometimes, not all the time.- Load time is horrible and the levels are pretty short, oh when you die, you have to load all over again and start from the begining.  (Ya it sucks)- There's a part in the game where the voices start echoing, it gets very annoying.Good Points (End with positives)- You get to fight Trinity- You get cool moves with the touch of a button- Awesome weaponsThat's all I can think of at the moment, now the big question 'Should you I buy it?'  Well I don't know, if you a big Matrix fan you probably already have it and if you don't you should buy it.  If you're not, well... you will have to decide on your own.

Indeed, I saw some reviews for Unreal Tournament III (UT3) that were pretty darn good. I even chatted with some friends about UT3, and we got psyched for the game.But the hype was short-lived after a week of trying to actually play UT3.UT3 was hyped as an awesome *online* shooter. So after some serious online training over the past few months withResistance: Fall Of ManandCall of Duty 4I was sure that I had what it took to jump right into the UT3 online fray. Man, was I wrong.I've only been gaming for a year now, so I'm still pretty weak compared to FPS vets in the department of \"get the crosshairs focused on the enemy quickly\". In UT3, it's all about running through corridors/hallways and hoping you're the first to focus your crosshairs on an enemy before the enemy focuses on you. Like an old fashioned duel...you know...10 paces then who's quickest, turn and shoot.Comparatively, CoD4 and Resistance have open environments (some wide open), environments with an abundance of hiding places and structures (with rooms). For example, how cool is it to sneak up to a room within a building in CoD4 with like 3 enemies hiding there, present them with a flash or stun grenade, and take 'em all out? In UT3 you run through narrow halls and tight common areas and blast away before you're blasted away. I stink at that all 'run and gun' stuff.So perhaps UT3 is just not for me. If you like fast moving, run and shoot games, UT3 is right up your alley and shouldn't be missed.I'd speak to the story/campaign mode of the game if I could, but I can't. It's not what sold me on the game. UT3 is billed as an online shooter, and that's why I bought it. A story mode is included in the game, but I haven't played it and I probably won't. This alone probably has taken away some of the fascination with the game; playing the story modes of CoD4 and Resistance were crucial to setting the 'right' tone for online play in those games. But if a game is built for online play like UT3, some of the allure of playing the story mode is lost.CoD4 and Resistance also offer players the opportunity to get together on the multiplayer maps in an offline mode using split screens on the same console, but I didn't see that anywhere on UT3. This is another drawback to trying to learn the maps and hone the skills specific to UT3 before venturing online.So all in all, I'm not a very happy camp...um...I mean...shooter. One had better have sharpened his run and gun skills in order to succeed in this fast paced, close-quartered FPS designed mainly for online play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"The best of the New Super Mario series!","reviewText":"I've recently become a proud owner of the Nintendo Wii U, and I'm having an absolute BLAST with it! :DI've actually started out with a good amount of games, too - this, New Super Luigi, Mario 3D World, Sonic, Donkey Kong, and the Lego Movie game. As you might expect, most of my playtime since the purchase has been mainly just with the Wii U!Huh? Oh, yeah. New Super Mario Bros. U.I was actually kinda worried about how this game would shape up ever since I witnessed the disappointment that was New Super Mario Bros. 2. The 3DS installment did not add anything new, other than the incredible dumbing down of difficulty via coins and what I like to dub the \"You Suck\" leaf power-up carried over from Super Mario 3D Land, a game that still kept at least some challenge.Fortunately, NSMBU did what New Super Mario Wii did and added enough elements and miscellaneous content to make it a fresh enough experience as a sequel, and also included a pretty good challenge. There are levels that I've actually died more than once on!Speaking of levels, New Super Mario Bros. U shines brightly in the level design department. The design of each and every level is easily the best I've ever experienced in a NSMB game, and a number of them feature level-specific gimmicks and/or distinct art styles that helped make them stand out from each other more.The classic 2D Mario run 'n jump gameplay is as strong as it's ever been, and with this new set of levels that previous NSMB installments wish they had, you're bound to have a lot of fun.The 4-Player co-op multiplayer is also as chaotic as it's been in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. This time around though, the bubbles players appear in after dying move much faster, so there's less trouble getting back to the action. Plus, a 5th player can use the Wii U Gamepad to plop up to 4 blocks all over the screen. He/she will either help the players reach new areas with the blocks, or screw them over by placing one atop of a player over a lava pit (I bet you that will happen).The more interesting feature in the game, however, is being able to take on groups of challenge missions that test your skill. You'll have to try dodging a Fire Bro's fireballs, fly through a Bullet Bill-filled level, finish levels quickly, etc. There's even a separate list of challenges which makes use of the Gamepad's ability to plaster blocks!I for one welcome all of these challenges. They help add to the game's replayability, which is especially cool considering that there's the usual unexplored content in the main game that you can go experience after beating it.In the end, New Super Mario Bros. U still isn't really the super-creative Mario title that the 3D games and pre-2000s 2D games have been, but the game still excels in everything else. Next 2D game I see, though, I expect something up to par with the creativity said Mario games have brought before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2014"}

Not only that, but I like the excruciatingly long RPG/adventures that can take a year to complete if you're serious about them.  For that reason (and the fact I have the reflexes of a snail) I have pathologically avoided platform games.  Not only did I not 'get' them, but I did horribly even when I did.Some recent experiences convinced me that maybe, just maybe, I should reconsider.  Since Prince of Persia is 1) a name I actually recognize, and 2) getting rave reviews from everywhere, I picked it out for the great experiment.  Frankly, I was blown away.First of all, this is a beautiful game.  The detailing of the oriental palace through which the Prince is racing to collect and return the sands of time is beautifully done.  The characters are animated to the point of appearing almost natural.  Dimensionality and background animation are perfect.  And everything works together like a charm.  This is the platform genre's equivalent of Final Fantasy X, and the effect is totally engaging.In a sense, this is a puzzle game.  In each setting you must examine the architecture and features to look for the right way to get from where you are to where you need to be.  Because the game allows the player to rewind and retry a sequence of moves until they work with almost balletic synchronicity, you are never plagued with the 'Darn! I have to start over at the beginning' syndrome that has always been a bugaboo for me.I could rave for a long time.  There is something exhilarating about running along a narrow beam 300 feet in the air while slashing at sand bats.  And done forget trading sarcastic remarks with a Princess while you are at it.

{"product_name":"B0074LJ3CE","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Killing me (not so) softly","reviewText":"BACKGROUNDThis review was written after the first 5 weeks of almost daily Mortal Kombats experiences - ahh... the humanity.The case for the game was solid and there were no problems there. The online instructions explained everything from the controls for combat to the features like mini games and story mode really well, but left out a few things like changing a character's costume in the character select by pressing start or stating that you do not need to unlock a character's fatality combo to use it.There are 32 characters to chose from. Each character's moves, stance, combos, really everything is unique to that character. The DLC characters, Rain, Scarlet, Kenshi, Freedy Krueger and Kratos are included standard in this game. There are also tag fights where 2 characters fight on the same team, and switch in and out. The 3 boss characters Shao Kahn, Goro, and Kintaro are not playable except for the few challenge tower missions they are in. Besides that, you only challenge them in the story, ladder matches, and in the challenge towers.COMBATWhen fighting, the options are the basic front and back punch and front and back kicks assigned to the buttons, use the left stick or d-pad to move in the 6 directions, left shoulder button, right to block, and right stick is used in tag battles. The basic attacks are changed by moving in a direction at the same time. These controls are fully customizable through options. Regular combos of special fighting moves can be seen by pressing start in a fight. There are also special combos which are like superpowers are also seen in the same menu by pressing `x'. There are also tag combos, but if you just want to switch to the second character you simpy move the right stick around.In a fight, there is also a super meter which is charged by taking and giving damage. It is split into 3 even chambers. One chamber is used up when you use an enhanced special move, which is a stronger version of a special move. If at least 2 chambers are filled, you can hold down block to interrupt the opponent's chain of attacks. When three bars are filled, you can do an x-ray attack. It the attack connects, a quick climactic video will lunch where your character does a brutal combo and an x-ray will show vital organs or bones being damaged. This attack will generally do the most damage out of all available moves and combos.  This move is activated by pressing the left and right shoulder buttons at the same time, or by touching the `x' icon on the screen. If you win, you will have the option to perform a fatality. Be warned, these were probably the main reason this game is banned in Australia.When the fight is over you will have a small amount of time to move to a distance specified on the combo list for that fatality, perform the combo correctly, and watch. For the Vita you only need to move to the proper distance and swipe your finger in the proper directions. No button pressing necessary. If you get the combo close, but not quite right, you may get a second chance by beating you opponent one more time, but they will start with little health.MINIGAMESThis game features a ladder and tag ladder. In these, you fight your way up arcade style. For 7 rounds you fight regular characters or teams of regular characters. The next 2 rounds are always single minor, but powered up bosses, and finally, an overpowered Shao Kahn.- Test Your Might - a button spammer- Test Your Strike - another button spammer- Test Your Luck - 1-on-1 match where a slot machine decides who you fight and what the conditions are- Test Your Sight - heads have an eyeball under and are shuffled around, and you have to pick which one has the eyeball- Test Your Balance - tilt the Vita to balance a character while things are being thrown- Test Your Slice - like Fruit Ninja with severed body parts, use your finger to slice the body parts thrown on screen and avoid bombsSTORY MODEIt's a run through of mortal Kombats 1 through 3, and you cycle through all the hero characters' stories individually through chapters. There are about 2 hours of cut scenes and 3 to 5 fights per chapter. The previous Mortal Kombat story from 1 to 3 is changed and I believe it is to set up the next game.There are 2 challenge towers on the Vita version. The regular challenge tower is the same from the console version. The missions generally have handicaps or conditions that need to be fulfilled to complete the mission. These can sometimes be comedic like having to fight with no arms. The bonus challenge tower is the same idea, but the DLC characters are included and the Vita's special features are sometimes used like taping to stop rockets, or tilting to tilt the entire field and change gravity. In both there are missions to get alternate costumes, and more levels for the \"Test Your ...\" mini games.OTHER FEATURESThere is an in game tutorial, practice options for both regular and tag fights where you can practice combos and you can make the computer fight in any way you want. There is also a place where you can just practice fatalities with help.The online matches are 1-on-1, or tag matches. They can be local or Wi-Fi connected through the world. There are private matches, regular, friendly matches which are just for fun and ranked matches where you fight to move up the leader boards. The online is fun, but some may use repetitive, unsportmanlike moves and ruined the fun, so watch out for that.You can earn koins form the ladder, story, and towers to spend in the Kript to get game art, costumes, and fatality combos. You can see these in the Nekropolis. In the Nekropolis, you also can see charter bios, costumes, and stats for all characters.MY RATINGI enjoy this game. So far, I haven't gotten bored of playing it. It is a good package of action, gore, and comedy. I never owned a Mortal Kombat before this one but played most of them, and I liked this Vita version the most. For anyone who doesn't mind extreme graphic violence it could be a Vita `must have'.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2012"}

During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters.

Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses.

Playing as Jet Bradley, son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley from the movie, gamers are digitized into cyberspace and will race on light cycles, battle corruption both inside and outside of the computer world, and explore locations including the Internet Hub, Firewall, Corrupted Server and Light Cycle Game Grid.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Pretty good--if you liked the movie","reviewText":"This is one of those rare games that takes a movie franchise and turns it into a good gaming experience.  I saw the original Tron movie back in the 1980s and really liked it.  This game captures the spirit and look of the film. However, because it sticks pretty closely to the conventions of the first-person shooter (FTS) genre (i.e., run-and-gun fighting, silly jumping tricks, unending searches for health packs, etc.), the gameplay itself does not distinguish it from the crowd of FPS games out there. Only the movie tie-in makes it worth playing in my opinion.  Thus, gamers who never saw (or liked) the movie may not appreciate how faithful this game is to the film, or care.Gameplay: As stated above, the typical FPS game.  Controls (AWSD, mouse, etc.) are fairly standard and easy to learn.  Both the discs and light cycles are fun for a while, and the game has a leveling system like in role-playing games that allows your character (Jet) to get better over time.  The game includes a bit too many key hunts and jumping mini-games for my taste, but overall delivers a good 20-hours of solid gameplay.Graphics: The game looks better than the movie, which should be no surprise 20 years after the movie was released.  You do get the sense that you are inside of a massive computer that is self-aware and in crisis.  The use of lighting and colors is about the most creative you'll see in any game. Character models and animations are pretty good, as are special effects.Sounds: Appropriate for a game based on a computer theme.  Beeps, synthesizers, and so forth.  The music is mostly from or inspired by the movie.  Voice acting is pretty decent but not very memorable.Technical issues: The game ran very smoothly for me.  I had two crashes to desktop, but no big deal since you can save the game at any point and in multiple slots.  The manual is good and the first part of the game is a tutorial.Replayability/Value: Not much replayability for the single-player mode.  There is the campaign and light-cycle \"skirmishes,\" but nothing else.  In multiplayer, you can go online and have duels with discs, but I don't know if there is much of an online community for this game nowadays.Bottom line, if you liked the movie, you'll like this game.  You really can't go wrong at the current price ($10).  However, if you never saw the movie or didn't like it, this is simply a pretty decent FPS game, nothing more.Overall rating : 3.75 stars (out of 5)Pros:+faithful translation of the movie+excellent visuals+light cycles are fun+good manualCons:-a typical FPS game-limited replayability for solo gamers","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2007"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Same old story, with a hint of nostalgia","reviewText":"Punch-Out!! for the Wii is probably one of the best re-makes of a Nintendo classic I've ever come across in years.  The graphics are literally gorgeous when you compare them to other Punch-Outs for the NES and SNES, and the movesets are all very creative.  However, this game earned 4 stars instead of 5 for a few minor setbacks.*There is only ONE new boxer (Disco Kid), not including the hidden Donkey Kong character in Last Stand Mode.  It's nice how Nintendo decided to coalesce the fighters from their previous Punch-Out games and put a slight spin on them, but seriously, if they're going to make a sequel to this, there should be completely brand-new fighters.  The fact that the fighters have different moves after you beat the game in Career Mode doesn't make up for it.  With the current game, there are 13 total fighers (14 with D.K.), but there should have been AT LEAST 6 new fighters.  They could have gotten rid of Glass Joe, Piston HondO (why the name change, I don't know), Don Flamenco, etc.  Super Macho Man and the rest of the \"hardest\" fighters should be permanent.  Otherwise, out with the old and in with the new.*It's great how you can use the controller in the classic NES style.  God forbid if you use the Nunchuk and the Wiimote.  Don't even try it!  It's awful.  If you want the best boxing experience, use the Wiimote like the classic NES controller.*About the controls themselves:  Occasionally, you won't get a response from them during the match.  When facing Mr. Sandman, for example, the character does one thing when you intended him to do something else (i.e. dodging his delayed overhand smash and winding up not hitting him in time when you pressed the correct button).*The sound bites and music are amazing.  Great tunes and awesome voices.  However, this can be totally taken in a racist direction.  You have Bald Bull screaming, \"Achmed!!  Allah!!\" (Muslim terrorist); Great Tiger with his Taliban-esque vocabulary; Piston Hondo with his Jap stuff; etc.*There were also some technical errors I discovered.  During the Mr. Sandman match (you can see how much I love this guy), Doc Louis says in between rounds, \"Wake Mr. Sandman up!! The fans wants a new champ!!\"  That's grammatically incorrect, and the designers should've noticed this error.  Also, the ages given for the boxers DO NOT correlate with their physical appearance.  Super Macho Man is 27 years old????  He's got white hair and looks like he's in his 50s.  Come on, now.Overall, the game was a very entertaining experience.

Game's like: Grand Theft Auto, God of War, Mario, and Halo. which are mostly about fun gameplay. Then there's game like: Heavy Rain, Silent Hill 2 and Rule of Rose which are more about story or to make you feel like you're playing a movie, less about the actual gameplay. Both types of games are fun but I usually prefer the later. Bioshock Infinite on the other hand manages to be both. The only other game I know of that does this is the original Bioshock but Infinite improves the experience. The gameplay is fun and unique. Because of the huge arsenal of weapons, Vigors(plasmids) skyline, and the NPC Elizabeth can help a lot. The story is one of the best I've ever seen in a game. It has a \"I didn't see that coming\" ending. After I beat the game I had to rewatch the ending on youtube, but once I realized what happened I was blow away! I also loved that it was still political like the original. Really the only problem I had with Infinite is that you can only hold two weapons at a time, which is nitpicking really.

I'm familiar with Ubisofts series Prince Of Persia and after all the hype on it's sister series decided to give it a go. Two hours in I unfortunately encountered a game break in the story. I've played through Skyrim 8 times over without a single one of these. I even installed AC3 and there's quiet a bit of glitching here and there. Other complaints is the climbing is way too easy *Hold R1 and AC does it all for you, where as games like Shadow Of The Colossus and Prince Of Persia require thought and planned jumps or it's curtains. It's cool that Ubisoft has gone Open World with there games, but like other companies who first start off open world it's glitchy. The graphics though are over the top and voice acting is great. I didn't make it far enough to comment on story, but like I said this game provided me with my first game break so I was too turned off to even start a New Game. One more thing I wasn't too impressed about was the lack of immersion. Not being able to interact with any NPC you want to or enter any house/store. Where as in any elder scroll game it's go where you want, talk to whoever you want. It's a great way to gather info, side quests, etc...... That's the best way I can describe Immersion in gameplay. In an open world environment if there isn't immersion it becomes linear in a sense. Just my thoughts, but I don't hate AC.

But what else do you expect from a Tony Hawk game?","reviewText":"This is a fun game! I am not sure there is much higher praise that you could give a game nowadays. That's what really matters when we are playing, is if we are having fun and enjoying ourselves. Sure the graphics matter too, and they are quite impressive in this game. When I first started I was pleasantly impressed by the sharpness and how good it really looked. But my last experience with a Tony Hawk game was briefly playing THPS2 on the PS1. I did get to see THPS2 on the Dreamcast and I was impressed with the graphics on that game, but I personally had not played a THPS for a good length of time since the first one on the PS1.And just like the first one, this one is fun yet challenging. Tony Hawk games never seem to be easy, but they don't seem to be overly difficult either to where you just get frustrated and quit. There is a nice blend with fun and difficulty.One thing that I really like about THPS3 is the varying missions that each level presents. They are creative, and some are humorous. This seemed to start in THPS2, but again I really didn't play that game much.For Tony Hawk fans I need offer no recommendation for this game, you already know how fun these game can be. But for those that own and GameCube and are unsure about this game, this is one that I feel is worth giving a chance. I do not feel that I have wasted my money, and I am more of an RPG, Resident Evil, Legacy of Kain kind of games fan. So this game really isn't in what you might consider \"my type of games\".

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising.

Till the end, did every mission.  Second, while I understand why folks here trashed it because of the SecuRom virus protection scheme, we should all take a deep breath and try to focus on the content of the game (yes, I know its hard)Here is my 2 cents.1)  The game is absolutely beautiful.  As photo realistic as COD4.  The artwork to me at least is a virtuoso performance from the artwork and production design team.2)  The story line is really cool, but you have to have LOTS of patience to get to the end and see how it turns out (which is VERY neat and timely)3)  There are something like 100 missions, of which 60% are completely repetitive and somewhat boring after a while.  You constantly have to travel to the OTHER side of the country just to some inane thing.  Why can't the bad buy be next door for once.4)  The weapons...  well, lots of folks have already commented on how weird they are.  The choices are pretty weak indeed, but I guess they are appropriate for a third world banana republic revolution.  I can see why they had the weapons they had, but it still made it a bit annoying.4a) The weapons.... having 4 weapon slots is fine, but let ME choose what I put in each slot, not the developer.  The game designers made a decision about what would be available in each slot, but unfortunately, their choices are pretty lousy and took away from the game.  Assault rifles and sniper rifles... you can have one or the other.  Dumb.5)  The Save system is really really good, except, you have NO idea what the saves are.  With this flexible a save system, it would be useful to be able to Name saves or describe the somehow6)  The characters and voice acting are totally excellent.  Very authentic and believable.  (a true improvement over FarCry, which was absurd)7)  The transition from cutscene to gameplay is amazing.  The BEST I have ever seen.  It is totally natural and after a while, you forget its a game.8)  Searching for diamonds and tapes...  now this one is really silly.  Yep, its standard video game fare to search for money and stuff, and not all of it is easy to get.  No problem.  But in this game, nearly HALF the diamonds are IMPOSSIBLE to get.  Can't be done.  It would seem like jumping is the way to do it (ala painkiller), but jumping up and rock faces does NOT work at all.  Stupid and stupid.9)  Yep, as others have pointed out, the AI see you whether you creep around in the dark or not.  And sometimes they don't see you when they are standing in front of them.  This seems like well worn territory in shooters, and could have been better.  The code is there, but doesn't work right most of the time.10) Guardpost discovery simply does not work half the time.  You can stand there, shoot everyone, pick up everything, and it still doesn't unlock.  Should have been caught in testing.There are probably 100 other things to be said here.  This game IS AMAZING, but you need patience and time, not something all of us have.The DRM controversy is coming to a head, and its too bad that great efforts like FC2 get trashed on boards like this because of DRM by folks who don't play the game.  I understand why that happens, but its not indicative of the games quality.  The developers and game studio should receive kudos here, while the publisher should be slapped in the face.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2008"}

I love the direction they went with the boxer redemption story, it's very well done (though slightly generic) and I'm sad I didn't get to see the whole story because of the horrible gameplay. The story mode regularly handicaps your character or enhances your opponent to a point where it almost feels like the game AI is cheating. There is many occurrences of this in the story mode, but the one that made me stop playing was the the Mexican opponent that constantly drained your stamina. He does this partially with body punches, but the cheating comes into play when the AI clinches with you. Not only does the clinch completely drain your stamina bar, it also makes it slower to regenerate, and it lowers your maximum stamina. I fought the same guy over and over, and the best I ever did was whoop him in the first two rounds, but after that my stamina was so low that I couldn't fight. By the last round I would almost have 0 stamina, and all I could do is walk around, cover up, and every once in awhile swing a lazy punch. The craziest thing is that I was only on the pro (second lowest) difficulty level, there's no way should I had that much trouble with the matches. I'm no pro gamer, but I've played the previous Fight Night games and never had this much trouble.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2012"}

I haven't played wipeout since its early days so to me the game has a lot of appeal as I feel it controls a lot better than the first game.  If you're coming from some of the later in the series you might be less appeased by what the game has to offer.Either way if you're new to the series, a long time fan, or just a casual wipeout player there is something to be said about really actually being able to play wipeout in a form that looks like it should be on your TV, but is in your hands instead.Wipeout 2048 really sold the Vita to me in terms of it providing an experience I would expect from an Xbox 360 or PS3.  It doesn't utilize all of the Vita's new control schemes and features over the PSP, but it does really show you what kind of games we can expect from the Vita in the future.I don't want just pretty games on the Vita... I want fun, fast paced games that look great too.  Wipeout does that and playing it on the Vita makes me a little sad I've missed out on all the previous games up until now.Another plus for me was Amazon had it priced below even what the PSN discount was at launch.  At full price it might become less of a deal if you've already got a next gen Wipeout.

{"product_name":"B00005RKO7","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"Fun Exploration, Weak Combat","reviewText":"Silent Hill 2- Restless DreamsRestless Dreams is almost the exact same game as thePlaystation versionof the game. The only difference is there is an added scenario you can play through. The storytelling is very dark and disturbing. The graphics shift from dark and weird, to demonic and disgusting. The sound in the game is amazing. The problem with the game lies in the repetitive gameplay. I love this game, but I will admit that it has an extreme flaw.Graphics- 9.5/10The graphics don't exactly look realistic, but they are done in a cinematic way that will leave you breathless. The cut scenes are often short, but run seamlessly into the normal gameplay graphics. The picture often has a fuzzy, dark look to it that reminds me of an old horror movie. The cut scenes are done amazingly and you will find yourself immersed in the world they have created.Environments are designed well, and will even change as you go through the gameplay. One time you might be walking through a spooky hallway, but after a major point in the story that same hallway has blood all over it. There is a considerable amount of fog in the game, but it is not to hide graphical failures. You know this because later in the game the fog is gone and replaced by darkness.The dark in this game is creatively done too. If it is too dark, your character won't be able to investigate items or his map. You get a flashlight early in the game, but there are points where you will just not be able to use it and will have to figure out what to do. At the same time though, your flashlight alerts enemies of your presence.The enemies in the game, despite not having many of them, look great. Some stand like mannequins and only move when you get close enough. Others with stumble around until you take them down, then they will crawl across the floor. There are only about 6-7 different enemy types in the game though.Story- 9/10You are James Saunderland. You have been a broken man since the tragic death of your wife, Mary, three years ago. One day you receive a letter from your thought dead wife. She asks him to meet her in Silent Hill at their \"special place.\" James is unsure of what is going on, but he has to check it out.Along your trek through Silent Hill, you will meet many troubled people. Speaking to them will bring chills down your spine. Important characters you meet will be Laura, an 8-year old girl, and Maria, a striking Mary look-alike. These characters all evolve over the course of the story.The story is excellent. It does have a few problems though. One, the story is very complex and you really have to think about it if you want to understand it. You might even have to talk to a few other players to even understand it. The story is left open like that. Another problem is that the monsters that you face off with throughout the game seem to be an after thought. They are not truly explained until the very end of the game. I felt that it was too late by then.Sound- 9.5/10The sound in this game is almost perfect. Early in the game you get a radio. The radio only plays static, and only when an enemy is close. This is a good way to create suspense. Sometimes the radio will actually play words they you should pay attention to.The voice acting is mostly good. I felt that James felt too calm, but everyone else I liked. The monsters all sound disturbing. Gun and melee weapon noises are decent. Sometimes the addition of random disturbing sounds really creates a great atmosphere in this game. Great sound overall.Gameplay- 7/10You start on the outskirts of Silent Hill. All you have is a map, the letter, and a photo of Mary. You make your way into town to try to figure out if Mary is there. You discover a town full of monsters and closed to the public in almost everyway. Mary keeps sending you clues, and you follow them like a dog...because usually every other way is closed off. The game is like a mystery adventure game with some monsters along the way.This game plays out very similar toResident Evil. I have always liked Resident Evil, so I thought this would be a good thing. It is not though. The monsters in this game are lacking, and never really pose much of a threat. They are disturbing, but you can just walk right past them. In Resident Evil, a zombie or a hunter always had a chance to injure you. In this game there is almost not chance you will get hurt by the monsters. When they do hit you, it lacks the suspense. The monsters are just not a big enough deal for you to care about them.The rest of the gameplay has you following Mary's clues. They lead you to Apartments, Museums, and Hospitals. The concept involves you entering a building and trying every door until you find one that works. Most of the doors are broken and you'll never get in them. Every single building, it is the same thing. Once you find a key or something, you go back and unlock a door. However, this never gets tedious. I enjoyed exploring the various building and find out the secrets of Silent Hill.This game implements melee and gun combat. Both are horribly done. All melee weapons in this game are imprecise and often get you hurt before you can hit an enemy. The auto-aim feature in this game is horrible. You often think you have aimed, but instead you will hit the wall or something. There are very few weapons even in this game to start with, and none of them excite you to wield them.Difficulty- 6/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)Difficulty is very well done in this game. You can adjust puzzle difficulty and monster difficulty separately. This allows for you to adjust the two key features of this game for your playing style. This is very innovative in a video game, as games usually just have a couple difficulty settings that change everything. This game allows you to customize different aspects of the gameplay.Why did I give this category such a low score then? No matter what difficulty you put this game on the monsters will be too easy. They serve almost no purpose, so it's not fun killing them. Also, the exploration in the game is based on luck. You stumble onto things that help you. In the beginning, you aren't even told where to go. You just have to search the huge town until you find something. There are not a lot of suggestions as to where you need to go.Overall- 7.5/10I like this game a lot. I really do. I just can't give it that great of a score considering the weak gameplay and luck-based exploration. Sound, graphics, and the story are great, but not enough to pull this one up more. I still suggest buying this one if you are looking to enter a very disturbing world, but don't expect the best gameplay.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2008"}

I asked my wife to watch as I played the game because I thought she would enjoy the story. For the first chapter or so she was bored. I had heard the first hour or so was slow going so I asked her to stick with it. Once I got into the meat of the game, she was on the edge of her seat and wanted me to keep playing. I had to play for two days to finish the game so she could find out who the killer was and who lives and who dies. It was exhausting. The stress of playing and trying to survive through the numerous action sequences was almost too much for me.After it was all done, we still talked about the game/story. It was an amazing experience and my wife was glad I included her in watching the story unfold.There have been some negative comments about the controls, but I think that is irrelevant. There were some frustrating momements when the controls got in the way of the gameplay but that just added to the tense gameplay.It is the story that makes this game so great. The graphics help because if it wasn't as good it would have taken away from the realism.I had another friend over the house who was watching me play it.

{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"Hunter D","summary":"Good Online Adventure Game","reviewText":"I have never played any type of MMORG or variant of it not even Diablo II online even though I own a copy of it. So I am not a fellow fan of such online games and also didn't have broadband Internet until now. Game was quick and easy to install on my Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop w/ ATi Mobility 9600PRO Turbo, Pentium-M 1.5GHz, 768MB PC2700/333MHz RAM, 60GB HDD 4800RPM, and 15.4 Wide Screen +. Game runs good using wireless G, but a slight smoother connected through ethernet. Being the game is still in its popularity stage you will experience a lot of connection stall/chug during gameplay and a few disconnect as well.Everything is online you will not be able to play offline for those expecting it to be like Diablo II in everyway. If your running solo its possible to get strong, but you will eventually need to pair up with others to complete harder tasks. Most of the early quest are short and don't offer much other than Exp points and low quality items you find throughout the land. Gold is the hardest thing to come by early on like most RPGs, then exp points aren't given anymore for killing weaker lvl monsters after you get stronger. Also there is a homing attack effect that no matter what you do projectiles will always hit you so trying to dodge or run is useless.Seems like most people just adventure solo. A lot of dancing and other stuff in the towns, but its nice scene to get away from the forever fighting. Nice to see others like yourself taking a breather as well. If your at lost with certain game features just chat it out and someone usually replys. So far I have logged about 15+ hrs and doing it solo majority of the time. Fighting is so much easier teaming up than the typical strategy of luring a couple of the monsters away from the bunch and repeat being higher lvl monsters tend to attack and lower lvl just walk right by. So far so good, and for my first Online RPG/Adventure exp I like it much. Also the FREE part is a huge + so no need to rush through it giving me time to play other games like HL2, Painkiller, etc in between. Buy the game if you have always wanted to experience the Online adventuring and its going to be a long one as well. Worth it! See you on Guild Wars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}

On top of that, the campaign mode is not much more than 5 hours of play. Weapons customization, while relatively expansive, does not seem to impact gameplay as much as it should.

The game combines elements from Hollywood action thrillers with the latest in video game technology to deliver a highly original gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Lacking in depth, but not in substance","reviewText":"The best thing Max Payne has going for it is a tremendously effective immediate atmosphere. From moment one, you feel like you're a part of this gritty, grimy, underground world. You're convinced that drippy, rusty pipes and dirty snow are the only constants in your own life, and all of that helps to make the central character, Max himself, much more understandable and sympathetic. All of the little things work together, from the graphics to the storytelling to the various ambient sounds to the characters themselves, to paint this immersive picture of a city overflowing with criminals, corrupt cops, self-centered politicians and very few true good guys. Even Max himself is far from a squeaky clean do-gooder, and seems more like a comedically poetic Punisher than a Superman as he fires out one overly wordsmithed sentence after another like so many dirt-encrusted bullets. Really, Max only distances himself from the guys on the receiving end of his wrath through an admirable drive to discover the truth and a tragic origin, and this lack of any true, identifiable hero works toward that aforementioned greater good, delivering a more realistic setting and allowing the story to take some liberties with its subject that would have otherwise been taboo.Max's tale plays like a solid motion picture; you come in just as the action gets interesting (a rookie cop living the \"American Dream\" comes home one night to discover a set of intruders in his house, and fails to gun them down before they slaughter his wife and infant child) and hang around as the anti-hero quickly loses his inhibitions and his mind, accepting an undercover job that predictably goes bad and leaves him cut off in the middle of a criminal underworld that feels he's betrayed them. The story is compelling, and is always laid out in one of two ways; either through a live-rendered cutscene in between scenarios or by way of a series of narrated, graphic novel-reminiscent storyboards. It's nothing new to see a game featuring speaking parts in the middle of a mission any more, but the paneled storyboard work that serves to bookend each sub-level is an interestingly novel concept that somehow manages to avoid the cheesiness you'd think it would be drowning in. Although the frames themselves are obviously based off of source photography, and that photography looks like nothing more than a half dozen programmers and their friends out goofing off on the streets and occasionally shooting stills for a game they happen to be working on, there's a certain charm to these pages that helps the player to further identify with the events that are going on within. It's a nice break from all of the tense, blood and guts action of the rest of the game to sit back and take in a quick comic book-based scene, even if that scene does happen to involve just as much blood and violence as the gameplay.As Payne slowly begins to lose friends and brain cells, he also begins to lose his focus on reality and slides into several amazing, if frustratingly tedious, hallucinogenic nightmares and fantasies. These are the scenes that really help to set the storyline apart from its peers, while at the same time dragging its gameplay a notch or two below that universal standard. The world spins hazily and blurrily around you, your field of vision is always clouded by a sort of dizzying grey cloud, things seem to move just a little bit too fluidly, and time slows to a crawl... they really are some of the best in-game visualizations of a dream-like state I've ever seen, and are crawling with the same sort of bloody, twisted, hopeless tone that fills the rest of the game. You'll hear the last wails unleashed by Max's wife and the occasional wounded scream of his child off in the murky depths, and the first three or four times they'll send shivers down your spine. Once you're on your sixteenth jaunt through the area, they'll grow more than a little annoying. Still, if it weren't for these little bits and pieces of horror, the game would tread dangerously close to straight action, with no respite.Gameplay itself is slick and easy to master, with the first few levels acting as a great primer for what's to come. There's no real \"lock-on\" mechanism, as is so prevalent in similar games, but there is Payne's infamous \"bullet time\" function, which makes the process of aiming precisely at a moving target a bit less hairy. If you've seen The Matrix, then you probably already knew what I was talking about when I said \"bullet time\" and thus don't need a more detailed explanation, but for those who haven't; Max leaps into the air in some sort of dramatic, gun-wielding swan dive, and from the moment he leaves the ground until the moment he touches dirt again, time slows to a crawl. It's the same sort of thing that was employed previously in Conker's Bad Fur Day and made you groan when you saw a CGI cow performing it in the trailer for Kung Pow a few years ago, but is actually handled with some restraint so that it doesn't feel all that gimmicky and truly blends in as a helpful new gameplay element. You get a limited amount of \"bullet time\" to dole out, (exactly how much depends upon the difficulty level you've chosen) so you're not doing it over and over and over again, and you're given enough control of your actions in the middle of a dive to keep it from being an easy, surefire kill every single time.Payne's graphics have long been hailed as a measuring stick of sorts for the Box, and while I'll certainly agree that they're far above the standards set during the N64-PSone war, they haven't aged all that well as this generation's battles near their end. The textures and character animations have become almost run-of-the-mill over the years, and while that may say a thing or two about the game's long-lasting impact on the industry and the trends it may or may not have set, it doesn't necessarily come across that way when played for the first time today. The characters themselves have always appeared to me as though they lacked real weight and mass. They look like scarecrows, especially in profile, with regularly-sized heads and hands, but stick arms and bodies with thick clothes just draped over to give the illusion of substance. The facial textures, while beautiful, don't look particularly professional and feel more like user-submitted skins wrapped around the same body several times over. The constant smirk adorned by Max himself only serves to further reinforce this sensation. The environmental textures that wow you from the ground level don't carry over as the skyscrapers near the roof level, and while that's not something you'll notice in the game's first few levels, later stages take place almost exclusively atop high rises and warehouses, where the poor walls are featured, front and center. Building interiors are sufficiently varied, with little bits and pieces of black humor thrown in like a porno poster on the wall or a hidden video camera facing the bedroom behind a false wall in a seedy hotel, but occasionally distract you with sealed doorways that look identical to the doors you'll need to be breaking open or casually pushing aside as the game progresses. This isn't a bad looking game, but I wouldn't say it's deserving of excessive praise, either. It's close, but the effort and attention to detail seems to drip away as you reach the later levels.The sound, especially the voice-over work, is very well done. Although the majority of the game is merely accompanied by ambient noise, (and, more often than not, screaming and gunfire) you'll occasionally run into some music or white noise that is particularly effective in setting a mood or getting a laugh. The programs running on the few functional televisions you'll discover are especially funny, and smack of the kind of comedy you'd expect from the various radio stations in modern chapters of Grand Theft Auto. When somebody's speaking, which is really quite often, the voices suit the situations almost shockingly well. Payne himself sports a deep, gritty, exceptionally noir-detective baritone, and pounds out the game's sometimes over-the-top dialogue to terrific results. Sometimes I have trouble discerning whether this game was meant to be a revival of the noir genre or a parody of it, as the acting varies from extremely camp to chillingly effective, and that's a fun line to walk as the events progress.Playing a game of Max Payne is like owning a passably good movie on DVD. It's not great, it won't be bringing home any Oscars and it isn't quite my definition of an epic, must-see production; it is solid entertainment for a couple of nights. You'll pop it in once in a while when you don't want to have to think about anything in particular, and it'll deliver a fun time. It's got just enough depth to keep you motivated throughout a long session, but momentarily entertaining enough not to demand your time in huge, six hour bunches. I can see how those who rushed out to pick up their copy on release day were disappointed... this isn't substantial enough a game to justify a full fifty bucks. It's short, relatively easy and overly linear. There's no immediate replay value, despite the ability to unlock a few new modes of gameplay, because they're all essentially applying questionable new rules to the exact same game. It introduced a few new gameplay elements and represented itself strongly in both visual and audio, but just doesn't have that undefinable \"it\" factor to push it up and above the rest of the pack. Every time the story would take a step forward, the gameplay would take a step back, and vice versa. At this point in its lifespan, and for the price you're likely to discover it for today, I'd say Payne is worth the expense, but I can see why some of my running buddies felt betrayed by it back in '01 when they were expecting another GTA, which is pretty much what it was advertised as, and got a straightforward noir-era third person shooter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2005"}

It lacks in SO many departments that keep in mind other games have been shun, and crap on for having within there game. Does Brink ring a bell too anyone? It just seems that ME gets away with these problem compare to other titles, which isn't fair, but the fans thinks it ok, so it whatever at this point. I just won't be shock if ME3 the same way, which is why I'm waiting instead of buying it  the first day, especially after playing ME2, but enough of that, here are my complaints.The first and most important complaint is, the squad AI. Now I've heard this has been a problem in ME1, which I don't understand why Bioware didn't fix it here in ME2? The game isn't hard to begin with, and basically once you get to insanity mode; you're basically soloing the whole game, lol! And that sad. The squad AI is just AHHH is  EXTREMELY dumb! The control or \"supposedly\" controls for the squad members is a simple layout that is pretty much easy for anyone to pick and learn. Up on the D pad focuses on what you're attacking, which they don't attack, and left and right is set for where you want them to take cover, which they don't usually take cover. I remember when I was doing Garrus loyalty mission, and at the end where you fight the two mechs, he would always rush in and get kill, even though I order him to stay in cover. And this happens A LOT, which makes the game extremely frustrating, and the squad AI will occasionally block you line of fire too, which at this point, I was like F this game after I beat insanity mode.The second complaints is, you can't skip some CS's and the skipping dialogue function is broken. This is 2011, not the 90's where skipping CS wasn't a issue for some games, but now we're in new era, and there no excuse for not being able to skip CS's at this point. If MGS4 can do it, then you can to, lol! Can this kill replayability for some? Yes, and no. It still something that I detect was laziness on the Bioware part, but that just me. Now this is where I was reaching my half way boiling point, and that the skipping dialogue function. How in the hell, can you mess that up? One button, skips dialogue, and the other is use to ok your decision. How hard is that? They did it right for the DA series, why not ME2?My last list of complaints, which are minor, but need to put out there. The load times. The infamous loading times that Bioware has yet to fix for console users yet. ME2 isn't a long game, but add on the loading times, it turns into a over 60+ game. Seriously! You go to the Captain cabin to feed your fish XD, long load time.  You go to the engineering deck, long load time. It's ridiculous. I also didn't like how they didn't add a option to remove your helmet in the in-game CS's. DA did it, why can't you ME2? :DOverall ME2 is a ok game. I'm glad I didn't fall into the hype like most people did though. I'm glad we PS3 user got the game, but that doesn't mean we should look a blind eye about the problems, so that we can get ME3.

I was late getting onboard 'NextGen.' Usually I do that on purpose when a console comes out so they have a couple years to work out the kinks and I end up with a better system for having waited. Well, that's exactly how it worked out in this case. Of course the funds have something to do with it too :P I did the same when the PS2 came out and I loved that thing and instead of going nextgen last year I got another PS2. When the nextgen consoles first came out I was much more drawn to the PS3 and picked up a PSP in anticipation of eventually getting a PS3. I have played on the 360 at friends houses here and there for the past few years and was always really impressed with it, but I just couldn't get over throwing down $300+ for something that was likely to break on me within a year or so of my purchase. So I was holding out for a PS3 (which I'm sure is a great system as well, for the record :)So in April of this year I started looking at FPS games, which I particularly enjoy, and was really intrigued by what the 360 had to offer over the PS3 (mainly just the online experience in general). So I really started thinking about it again and asked all my friends and the 360 just fit what I was looking for in a nextgen console. So now the question was which one to get. Then along came Microsoft at E3 and I had all the answers. I waited 4 days after the announcement and went for it. It was a little crazy on Amazon because the 'availability' status of the console kept changing every few hours or so, but I got mine as promised before the expected delivery date and Amazon did an incredible job at shipping and everything else, as usual.So onto the console itself: It is very stylish and just cool looking. The touch buttons are awesome but you can turn the console on and off via the controller, as goes for the disk tray, so you don't even need to touch the console if you don't want to. I have had no issues with the wireless, and gaming online is as awesome as everyone has made it out to be. I really don't care that I have to pay for xbox live, as it's really not that expensive and definitely worth it. I have also called xbox support a couple of times with just some general questions about warranty and so on and they were very helpful. Granted, I didn't need to reapair anything, but xbox support seems top notch.For those who don't have an HDTV, I bought this monitor at Sams for $180 to go with my new toy:[...]It works incredibly well and looks as good if not better than any HDTV out there. I would highly recommend gaming on a monitor if that suits you, but do your homework about what cables you will need. They can all be found on Amazon.The few Gripes I have about this 360 console are as follows:- In the short time I've had it (one month) it has frozen on me once during gameplay while playing Gears of War. While it was a little annoying, anyone who has gamed on a PC knows that freezing is just a part of life. I'm not really concerned about it at all or think there's a detrimental problem with the system.- It does run pretty hot on the top vent (when sitting horizontally), which concerns me a little. So I set a fan on it to be extra cautious. Problem solved... I thought there were more gripes, but no. That's all I can think of. I suppose I can sympathize with the owners of the previous xbox and certainly those who bought the console at launch. I would have been very annoyed had I taken the plunge a month before this console came out like I had planned. It just goes to show that good things come to those who wait. If you've been thinking about getting an xbox 360, do it. You're already here on Amazon reading my review, so you might as well. I highly recommend it; this console is AWESOME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A terrific game with uneven voice acting and no Japanese audio option ~","reviewText":"Update:Very addictive of course. There ARE long stretches of dialogue, but with the interesting story and characters, it's not really a chore. And you can skip the dialogue scenes if you want. But later in the game the story gets a little more serious. And the characters are mostly interesting. Especially Rowen. Alvin is still a minor annoyance, especially since we wonder why they keep taking him with them. He's obviously self serving even early on. But when you get Rowen things get a little better. I would say the best part of the game starts about the time you head to Fort Gandala.But once you add a couple of extra AC (with the assault and assault 2 skills) you can really start to enjoy the battles. Still the Artes are a bit wonkier than earlier Tales games, but linking 20+ hit combos is really fun. I actually found more enjoyment in trying to piece together longer combos than actually beating the enemies. Go figure!---------------------------------For the record - I am a LONG time fan of the series and have played every Tales game up to Xillia, including a fan translated original for the Super Famicon. I love the series.First question: Why are companies not including the original Japanese audio as an option? The royalties cannot be that expensive. Many older Bandai Namco and NIS PS2 and PS3 games had the option (Soul Calibur anyone? Atelier Totori and Atelier Meruru?). Normally I wouldn't complain too much except that the actress who voices Milla is terrible. Other reviews have described her voice role as weak, but I would go further and say that in comparison to the rest of the core cast, she is awful. And outside the other core characters, the voice acting is uneven at best. Luckily the dubs of Jude, Alvin, Elize, and a few others are very good. My partner commented that Milla sounded like a lispy gal who just had her tongue pierced minutes before recording. And she sounds like she's just reading. I mean, you can be monotone and still interesting. Like the gal who voiced Motoko in Ghost in the Shell SAC.Second issue - the problem everyone seems to comment on - the dated graphics. Now I am not going to reduce the rating based on graphics. But the game really does look like a port of Final Fantasy X. The Tales series has not been blessed with amazing graphics (well, since the original game on Super Famicon), but the graphics look dated beyond the two years since it was published in Japan. It is marginally better looking than Tales of Graces F, which was a Wii port.The last item I will address is the repetitive gameplay. I've played many of the games and there are a few items which need to be addressed under this rant. First, the Artes system is very well done, but for some reason the system seemed to take a step backward from Tales of Graces F. Granted you have the linking system, but that often becomes more of a hindrance than a help. Having to force links and chains in combat (with lackluster control) gets tiring. The battles are still fast, but they seem less fluid and less fun that the previous several entries in this series. I found myself often avoiding the weaker enemies and only engaging tougher ones so that I would have less total battles, but still level up.Other curious items: the leveling system (Lillia Orb). I enjoyed the system used in Final Fantasy X, and this seems to be a variation on a similar structure. The problem is that you really can't take a character on one track without either sacrificing extra GP or being forced to collect most spots in order to open up a new row. It's in a web shape and you have to open nearly every point on the previous row to access outer rows. So you can't just go for strength at the expense of agility, magic or such. You really have to balance the characters.The abilities system is also tiresome. You have a certain amount of skill points, and you can add skills to currently use. Other than adding an extra attack chain they are average or useless. But the system is cumbersome rather than pointless. I would prefer a system more fluid.The game reminds me quite a bit of the later Star Ocean titles. Though I could have used a good synthesis setup in this rather than the donation of items to shops. Even perhaps a system like Final Fantasy 12, where you sell loot and as you sell more loot or specific loot, items are unlocked to purchase. As it is in Xillia, you collect loot to either sell or donate to expand shops. Again, cumbersome.But if it sounds like a mindless rant, well it is of sorts. My expectations were high for this game, perhaps too high. The story is solid, though not terribly original (Final Fantasy 6 and virtually ever Tales game combined into one story). Jude is a great character, perhaps one of the best Tales heroes yet. He is demure, mature, and honest. Not whiny like previous Tales protagonists. Milla is an interesting character despite the poor English dubbing. But I expected a few more changes from previous Tales games, and there were not many. In fact, there was little updating from Tales of Graces other than a few slight battle changes, and a few other elements of the game.But story beats anything else, and the story is solid. I enjoyed playing the game overall. I very much enjoyed the little in game moments (the select button scenes) that help to shed a little personality on the characters. There are many side quests to undertake as well. Once you acquire the world map, travel is instant and easy.Overall? Very good, just a few minor annoyances. It's not the best Tales game, but it is among the better few. And if you have a limited summer game budget, grab Shin Megami Tensei IV for the 3DS first. I think it's a more addictive RPG, though of a different style.Pros:+ Great story (not too original though)+ Quick battle pace+ Artes still fun to use and chain+ Adjustable difficulty setting+ Interesting and beautiful world to exploreCons:- No Japanese audio selection- Uneven English dubbing cast- Slightly dated graphicsRecommended","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Tale Well Told","reviewText":"The Good:+A good cast of characters+A very in-depth battle system+A good balance of character customization+The music is absolutely fantasticThe Bad:-Some areas could've had more details-Exploration sometimes feels limitedThe Tales series has not been huge in America.  Case in point, we're just now getting Tales of Xillia when Japan received the game a couple of years ago (and already has a sequel out).  Tales of Xillia made a big splash in Japan.  It's said to be one of the best Tales games ever released.  When playing it's easy to see why.  It's a very fun JRPG that helps remind us why the genre still has life while other times reminding us why it's not quite as popular as it once was.  Nevertheless the pros win out as Tales of Xillia is an amazing game.Tales of Xillia centers on two characters.  The first is a medical student named Jude Mathis.  The other is a mysterious woman named Milla Maxwell.  You're allowed to pick one character or the other to start the game.  Picking one changes how you see certain events and the perspective of the story.  The end goal is, for the most part, the same, but if you really love Tales of Xillia, you already have an incentive to play through it a second time.  Their story takes place in the world of Reize Maxia where mana seems to be slowly draining away.  Milla, along with her four spirits decides to investigate, while Jude gets wrapped up in the conflict.As you might have guessed, the story in Tales of Xillia doesn't get off to a very quick start.  It takes time to really get you to understand the world it takes place in as well as getting you used to the characters and their banter.  So while it might take a moment of Tales of Xillia to really get going, you'll appreciate this once you really get to know the characters.  One of the best things about the Tales series is the characters.  Certainly they each play one typical role or another, but Tales has always gone to great lengths to develop them.  The story itself really comes to life because of the characters and their chemistry with each other.  They each have a distinct personality.  Likewise, Tales of Xillia contains skits (a Tales staple) where characters will joke with one another, talk about certain events going on within the story and sometimes just talk about themselves.  By the time the journey is done you'll learn a lot about them, and they'll change and develop quite drastically.  Because of these characters, the story is that much more enticing as a result.The only real downside to the story is the same that Tales has often come to be associated with.  There will be many moments of long exposition.  Sometimes explaining things you already know (and that the characters know).  Sometimes you'll travel somewhere with few battles in between only to be lectured about current events in the story.  In the long run this won't bother anyone.  It can feel like you're getting bogged down in it all, but the game is no where near as bad about this as previous games in the series.The battle system is going to feel both familiar and new to any Tales fan.  Battles are contact based.  When in battle you can move around freely and attack.  There's no turn based system here.  You and your allies can run all over the field and attack at your leisure.  Tales of Graces F certainly added a new spin onto the series but here things go back to be on par with Vesperia more so than any other game.  As usual you have tech points (TP) which can be used to perform Artes, which are like magic to deal extra damage.  Some things have changed, however.  There's more to Tales of Xillia than button mashing.  It can feel this way at first, but as the game progresses you'll really need to put some of the new mechanics to work.  When in the heat of battle you can backstep to evade attacks and surprise your enemy from behind.  Most unique of all the new elements, though, is the ability to link with other party members and perform linked attacks.  You'll be able to flank enemies, for instance.  Whoever you are \"linked\" to will also cover your back.  More impressive is that you'll be able to perform linked artes as well.  All this seems like it would make Tales of Xillia a pretty easy game, but the truth is that at some point there's a lot of strategy involved.  You need to be smart about who you link with, for example, and you need to be smart about how you evade and utilize your TP.  It's not exactly a hard game (unless you up the difficulty) but it is a game that really wants you to understand the system at play.You are only able to control one character at a time in battle.  The other three are controlled by the AI.  In most games the idea of the AI doing anything on your behalf is a nightmare, but in Tales of Xillia they hold their own.  You won't have to spend a lot of time babysitting them, and you can customize strategies for them to use.  The game also provides you with the ability to sign certain artes from other characters to a shortcut.  If you need a character to cast a specific spell you can assign it to a shortcut to have them do so.  You are also able to switch between characters any time you want in battle.There is more to the battle system.  Each character has a Lillium Orb.  As you level your stats don't increase.  Instead you get GP and move along a characters Lillium Orb.  Using the Lillium Orb allows you to develop characters at your own pace by letting you increase their individual stats and learn new artes and skills.  If you find you don't want to have to constantly make decisions about what stats to increase or artes to get, the game allows you to auto level and it'll develop the characters accordingly.Graphically speaking, Tales has never been a big leader in this department.  There aren't a lot of detail to the environments.  In particular, running around the fields can sometimes feel like you're running down the same path over and over.  There just aren't a lot of details in any of the dungeons or towns.  At times environments feel strangely empty.  This isn't likely to bother many players.  By now most Tales fans pretty much expect this graphically.  At the very least the cel-shading itself isn't bad.  Character models are fairly detailed and have a unique design to them.  They really stand out.  Plus, with how much fun you'll be having with the battle system and how good the story is... it's safe to say that the graphics being below the standard is a very minor flaw in what is an otherwise very good game overall.Musically, however, Tales of Xillia may have the best soundtrack in a Tales game yet.  It's very good all around.  Often evoking the right mood and tone.  For those who picked up the Limited Edition you'll get a music CD to help you sample.  The voice acting can be a mixed bag, however.  As is usual, the voices themselves fit with the characters, but the voice talent themselves isn't always up to par.  At the very least, Tales of Xillia has some well crafted dialog to really help things along.  Again, the voice acting is probably a more minor thing.  It's never cringe worthy.  There are just times you wish it packed more of a punch--especially in the game's more emotional moments (and there are a lot of those).Tales of Xillia is far from being flawless, of course.  As noted, the graphics aren't the best and the voice acting isn't quite as good.  These are the minor things.  What may be a little more major is how the world in and of itself feels slightly smaller.  One of the best things about other tales outings (particularly, Abyss, Symphonia and Vesperia) is that there was a huge overworld to explore.  Here, things are a lot more linear.  Often the game doesn't really let you branch off the beaten path.  If you try many times the game simply won't let you--usually reminding you to get back to the quest at hand.  There are plenty of sub events and sidequests that can be done, but Tales of Xillia doesn't always feel like it's a world that can be explored and traversed.Nevertheless, Tales of Xillia is a very fun game in and of itself.  It's a rewarding JRPG which is a lot of fun to play and has a good cast of characters to carry the story along.  If you're a fan of the Tales series then you should definitely play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWZHS","description":"","reviewerName":"JJ4prez","summary":"(edit) [Retracted a star]Shines all in all, but has it's flaws.. (Quick review)","reviewText":"(edit: 11/6/2012)Played a little more last night and noticed a few crucial things in MP. Almost every gun is considerably weak compared to any gun in the assault class. Everyone just runs around with the assault class because it's the only weapons that can actually kill someone with half a clip. I want to play the other classes but it's near impossible. The pistol selection is crappy, assault gets 1 pistol for awhile, the sniper class gets the G18 (auto-glock) and it kills people faster and easier than most automatic rifles and SMGs. There's a huge unbalance in weaponry which is ruining the game for me, which is why I subtracted 1 star from the rating.------------------------Single player (didn't beat it, just played a small portion of it): Fun, engaging, decent story, etc. But as other reviews state, and multiple gaming online sites, it's only about 4-5 hours long. Similar to the first Medal of Honor.My review is mostly about the Multi-player aspect of the game; which Danger Close did a great job on. Let me start off with a pro's/con's list just so you get a general idea then end it with a brief explanation.Pro's:+ Awesome HUD system; love the on-screen MAP+ Great respawn system, they hit this right on the mark in my opinion.+ Quick, easy game play. Really reminds me of SOCOM style mixed with a bit of Call of Duty.+ There is 8(?) different soldier classes to chose from, with all types of different abilities, weapons, and customization.+ You unlock different Countries, and the stats differ from which country you chose.+ Smooth game play, hardly any lag latency issues, which is rare on console game play.+ Plenty of things to do, unlocking different weapons, playing around in the menus, etc.+ Map design is great!+ Each class has it's own kill streaks and special abilities. Great addition and is quite fun.+ Plenty of different game types you can do, something for everyone.+ Surround sound is awesome in this game, constant explosions, things great really loud. Playing through TV speakers does not do justice for this game. Everything sound cheap and bad when going through regular 10W TV speakers.Con's:- The tomahawk (melee system) can be a little wonky.- The game play is quite fast, a little too fast in my opinion. I suggest starting in TDM then go from there.- The graphics are just plain bad, it honestly looks like Counter Strike Source. I am not playing on this. But I guess they did this so the game would run smooth.- Everything is a little confusing at first, there is so much to customize and chose from it leaves you just playing with the assault class.- You can literally throw a grenade across the map. Not that the maps are small, you're just the Hulk of throwing grenades. Kind of ridiculous in my opinion.- Some guns are just too weak, I can kill someone quite fast with a M4a1, but when it comes to a spec ops weapons - it can take the entire clip. They need to fix this.- Sniping is sub-par. It's wonky, feels weird, and takes some getting use to. But the snipers don't have any 'umph' to them. When you shoot a sniper, you should feel like you are shooting a really powerful gun. In this case, you really don't feel much.Why I gave it 4 stars: This game is great, but it honestly feels dated due to a variety of things, especially graphics. If this game came out in 2004, it would be the COD4 of the gaming FPS world. But there is so many different choices these days with FPS genre, it's unreal. It honestly just blends in to the gaming choices. I am a huge BF3 fan due to the vehicles you can drive, realistic game play, and all out 'total war' experience. But I play that on PC, where it should be played. Warfighter is a great game just to pick up and play. It plays smooth, it has a few great adaptations Danger Close picked up on and changed to their liking, and is relatively easy. This game really shines in all of the customizing you can do; it really gives you the choice for anything. One of the biggest reasons why this game won't do so well in sales; is because once Black Ops 2, Halo 4, and Aftermath for BF3 release, this game will simply just fade away in the gaming community.Thanks for reading!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"B. Mills","summary":"One of the best in the series!","reviewText":"For me this edition is up there with MGS3 and MGS1 as the best in the series (in my humble opinion anyway)This game which truly feels like it should be called MGS5 is like is MGS Portable Ops and MGS4 had a love-child.  The result is this great game!  Unlike Portable Ops, which I quite enjoyed, this game really feels like its a part of the MGS narrative, where as my biggest disappointment with MGSPO was that it felt extraneous, nothing story wise is really that important about it, except maybe introducing Col. Campbell.  Basically it felt like: \"hey, enjoy your favorite series on the go!\" where as this feels like it's a true part of the series.In terms of story though, this game is a lot easier for player's unfamiliar with MGS to pick than PO was, or really any game other than MGS3 or MGS1, so if you never played the series but want a great PSP game, don't worry, anything you needed to know about the events of MGS3 are tactfully summarized.  It's def a spoiler-fest if you ever want to play that game tho.  If you haven't played MGS games before you might be kind of confused, \"all I need to know about MGS3? What about 1 and 2?\"  Well MGS3, MGSPO and Peace Walker (this game) are set in the past BEFORE the other games, hense they are not needed for UNDERSTANDING, although I still recommend you paly the games in the order they are released if you really want to do it right.Speaking of filling in the story for new-comers, the story cut scenes are great!  They are the same comic-book style as PO but I think the character designs are more similar to the in-game character's this time, and they have added QTE and other interactivity actually looks great-same style ( I hate tacky looking button icons in QTE)  and really work well, it's kind of amazing to experience and took me by surprise.  All in all the comic-scenes are a lot more fluid this time around, the characters really move properly, none of this disjointed marionette-looking arm movement or slow zoom-in on a still image.  And there are other types of in-game cut scenes too to help tie the story together better then in PO where it abruptly went from in-game to comic-book.Worth mentioning though I can't confirm it, I believe that an item I CHOSE to equip before the mission without any instruction to do so, just an impulse thing (I don't want to say item or when for fear of spoilers) actually CHANGED one cut-scene.  Maybe it was just a really weird coincidence but if not it's truly amazing because the cut scenes are drawn not rendered... just wow.  And it is the kind of thing Hideo Kojima WOULD do.They took a lot of the game elements of MGSPO and really expanded them like they did with the cut scenes, now you have a real base that you build up, where you do a lot of the stuff you did in PO in terms of recruiting people and assigning them tasks, but the whole affair is just more carefully crafted then before and much less confusing.  You can assign what you want your tech people to make instead of it being a weird surprise.  And recruiting soldiers in game is SO MUCH better than before!In terms of game play it also plays a lot like MGS4, there are other control schemes (including a Monster Hunter style one, how cute) I tried them and decided to stick with default, with a couple tweaks I highly suggest such as lowering the sensitivity on the camera, and setting first person to be in relation to character direction NOT camera direction.  Once I did this I could not believe how fluid the games controls were, not even just by PSP standards but MGS standards.They are actually the most fluid controls with the exception of MGS4, but more fluid then all the others; seriously, anyone who has played MGS games knows how cumbersome they can be.  I am not even criticizing them, it's just one of those love it or hate it things about the series and this one is no dif, but it is better AT WHAT IT DOES than others.  It's confusing, but you'll get it when you play it.Basically this game is even more then it promised to be for long time fans, and even new-comers can enjoy it too!  A lot of the staples from MGS games of the past are here.  I hesitate to say anymore for fear of ruining the surprise for you but suffice it to say: this game has a glut of novelties which we have come to love about the MGS series!For PSP owners there's not much of a good reason NOT to own this game unless the premise of the game is not your cup-of-tea.  But anyone intrigued by Amazon's product description or if you have ever enjoyed a MGS game and you are dying for a UMD to get your PSP running again.  This is the game!  It almost feels like it was made as a personal favor to PSP owners because let's face it, sometimes we get the shaft.  NOT this time!Great game, 5-5 stars without hesitation, no hurry up and order it already!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00DV16N6U","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Clank's `mini-games' prevent this from being a 5 star title.","reviewText":"Let's address the elephant in the room. Clank is a tool (both literally and figuratively). I've now played three Ratchet & Clank games, and he adds little to no value to the franchise. I put up with the pointless Clank mini-games in Crack in Time and Tools of Destruction, but the buck stops here. I'm putting Insomniac on notice - stop with pointless mini-games or you will lose a customer (as if they give a damn, lol). I just needed to get that off my chest, now on to the review.Combat - As usual, this is primarily a third person shooter with a tiny bit of melee sprinkled in. I elected to turn off the auto aim which resulted in tougher combat. I liked the tougher combat because previous R&C; games were a bit on the easy side. It would have been nice to maybe see a different melee attack. It's been the same wrench throwing/swinging attack for the past few games, and it's starting to get boring. I understand the wrench is a staple in the franchise, but couldn't we get another melee attack in addition to that? Maybe Clank could be used in a melee attack, being that he's not doing any damn thing else...Weaponry - Out of all the R&C; games that I've played, this is my favorite group of weapons. There's too many for me to discuss, so I'll just touch on a few of them. Once you collect the full catalog of weapons; you'll be able to turn enemies into snowmen, unleash lethal demons, throw sticky grenades, use a rocket launcher, target enemies from a distance with a sniper rifle, and make use of a `jack in the box' that can literally scare bad guys to death (one of my personal favorites). But the fun doesn't stop there. If you collect 9 missing `blue prints', you'll be granted with the mother of all super weapons. It's called the RYNO VII, and it's nothing short of spectacular. It has more than 1,000 bullets, which is unusual for a R&C; weapon. To put this in perspective, the next closest weapon holds under 100. Here's a little tip: Unlock this as early as possible. I didn't get my hands on it until very late in the game, so I had very limited use with it.Enemies - Unfortunately, this is the weakest area of the game (besides Clank, of course). There are only 4 or 5 planets, so I'd expect to see a different enemy type on each planet. The same few enemies were recycled on all of the planets, for the most part. I'll go out on a limb and say the same 4 or 5 enemy types were reused over and over. The boss battles were fun, but nothing too special. While playing the game, I felt like the enemies never quite measured up to the awesome weapon choices.Miscellaneous - There are several side-missions to do (only offered on one of the planets). Also, I didn't think the game was as short as some of the reviewers made it out to be. If you take your time and explore the planets, plus do some of the side-missions, I think you can probably eke out about 10 hours of gameplay. For those die-hard R&C; fans, you'll be happy to know the arena battles are alive and well.I deducted a star because Clank's little missions were beyond frustrating, and you'll be forced to do them. I'll put it this way: If I were ever to meet Clank in person, I'd buy him a pair of lungs, then I'd probably lead him to a lake, and hold his head under water until he drowned (or rusted to death, whichever the hell comes first). Now you have an idea how frustrated I was while playing as him. If they feel the need to include such nonsense in the game, it'll be good idea to make them optional side-missions, just saying. Also, the enemy variety wasn't great, and that contributed to my overall score. Into the Nexus is a pretty good game, just not a great one. God of War I, you're up next!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2014"}

Hayes","summary":"Mario Bros at its best!","reviewText":"New Super Mario Bros Wii is an experience that every fan of the classic 2D Mario games may want to purchase and play.  It features the same sort of game style that we have come to expect from all of those classic Mario games and combines most of their mechanics into one game.  It uses mechanics that were seen in Super Mario World 2 with the ability to ride Yoshi, some of the music choices from those games, some of the level designs and mechanics from Super Mario Bros 1, 2, and 3, and uses their music.  It is loaded with so many references and uses of enemies, items, and mechanics that it brings a smile to my face everytime I play through a level.Playing the game is really quite simple. First there are three modes of gameplay; the main story in which up to 4 people can take control of the characters (Mario, Luigi, and two toads), and progress through the levels (even with more than one player, the levels can be progressed through and unlock more).  There is a free for all mode in which everyone is competing for score, and a coin battle mode in which you compete for score. Free-for-all and coin battle only work on stages that have already been cleared.The game is essentially easier with one player for one doesnt have to worry about other players pushing them into obstacles nor do they have to worry about what the other players are doing or the number of powerups they take from you.  There are some benefits such as being able to ground pound simultaneously to clear the enemies off the screen, or jump on each other to read greater heights. It can be fun with more people if everyone is on the same page and not just throwing each other around and pushing obstacles into them (and its a great crutch to use since it essentially equates to at minimum of 5 lives per player on screen if a level is that hard).  For single players there is a super guide function which has Luigi take over and complete the level for you, if you die eight times on a stage.Control wise, there are two styles of play, single wii-remote and wii-remote and nunchuk.  Controls are easy to grasp and I wont go into detail here, but there are what I consider waggle controls (shake the Wiiremote and the character will spin to go a little bit further when making a jump, shake it to move closer if you are floating on a stage, and lastly, shake it to lift obstacles).  The controls are easy to grasp and not too difficult.Presentation wise, the graphics are excellent for the game and get the job done.  Sure it isnt a game that is graphical defining on the Wii but they do look crisp and clear for a game set in the Mario Universe. Most of the good looks here is the chance to see nostalgic enemies and environments in a new 480p light. Soundwise, nothing new hear in terms of sounds for the Mario universe, Mario and Luigi appear to have the same soundbites (Toad sounds just the same as they were in Super Mario Galaxy), songs sound either remixed from their classic counterparts or are all memorable.  Nintendo seems to have delivered a great experience in terms of presentation here.-------The bottom line is that NEW Super Mario Bros Wii is an excellent addition to the Mario Universe and brings back the feelings of odd with the series.  The gameplay is excellent, being able to play with friends on these levels is a great experience (locally, though the lack of online co-op for this is questionable though not worthy of scrutiny) but doesnt leave people who have no one to play with lacking the ability to complete the game, and the presentation Nintendo offers us here in terms of music and graphics is worth its weight in gold.  For those who havent bought a Wii game since Super Smash Bros Brawl (yes there are a few of us) as well as for those who are looking for  an excellent single player and multiplayer experience on the Wii, New Super Mario Bros is a game to get.Note:  The Red case design and boxart is amazing and I hope Nintendo does more like it in the future","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

Best game in the series to date...","reviewText":"\"Fatal Frame III - The Tormented\" is probably the last FF game we'll see on PS2, and I'm more than happy to report that the series is ending - hopefully temporarily - with a great big bang.You control Rei, a young woman whose guilt over the death of her fiancee Yuu in a car accident is having a huge negative effect on her life. At work one day with her assistant Miku, photographing an allegedly 'haunted' house, Rei sees Yuu and gives chase, only to end up in some kind of nightmarish world of vengeful spirits. Returning home, a blue tattoo invisible to all but her starts to spread across her body, to match the one she saw on a spirit in her waking dream.And from there on in, \"Fatal Frame III - The Tormented\" becomes a symphony of gameplay and scares. This is Survival Horror in its purest form - a gripping storyline, incredibly strong atmosphere (far more so than the two excellent prequels) and a big dose of genuine fear all come together to make this the most rewarding game in the FF series to date.GRAPHICS: 5/5Simply amazing. The cut-scenes are far more detailed and plentiful than before, with the Manga characters taking on a more believable depth of realism. The enemies are more detailed and more defined now than ever and, in terms of design, are quite terrifying - the Woman Brushing and Shrine Carpenter ghosts are two of the scariest Survival Horror enemies ever! The backdrops are gorgeous - richly detailed and very convoluted so as to lend more of a sense of Nightmare to the dream worlds that Rei has to traverse. The cinematic aspect of the game is perhaps the most important one - the closest comparison I can make is like a playable, immersive version of the original 'Dark Water' movie. Camera angles, though still fixed, give such a sense of the epic to the visuals that it really is, in places, more of an interactive movie than a videogame.SOUND: 5/5Better voice acting than before (thankfully! Fatal Frame is not known for the quality of its voiceovers but here, they're pretty good) and some excellent spirit sounds provide ample punctuation in an overall game score that's probably got Akira Yamaoka and his buddies over at 'Silent Hill' quite jealous. The ringing feedback and white noise sounds contrast with overlong moments of silence to produce a tension quite unlike most other Survival Horrors - the only other thing I remember being this good is the point in Silent Hill 2 where you meet Maria in the underground prison. Overall, \"Fatal Frame III - The Tormented\" sounds every bit as good as it looks, and that's no small feat.GAMEPLAY: 4/5I'm a big fan of Resident Evil 4, but to me, it's just not survival horror. I felt the same things playing that as I did with the Metal Gear: Solid series on PS2. Here, it's a whole different ball game, as the slow pace of the characters and the repetitive nature of the dream-wake-dream-wake environment force you to notice far more about the game world than in other titles. For atmosphere, this is a good thing, though some players may be put off by expecting the fluidity and responsiveness of Resi 4 and suchlike. Puzzles are good - tough and cryptic enough to keep you guessing, but not so hard as to make you need a walkthrough guide. The overall difficulty is about the same as Fatal Frame II, so it's not the longest game in the world - but it is one of the most enjoyable.OVERALL: 5/5You'll come back to this again and again. As usual, new play modes and costumes can be unlocked with multiple plays through the game, but trust me: for the atmosphere alone, you'll enjoy more than one trip through the beautiful, terrifying world of \"Fatal Frame III - The Tormented\". It's big, it's immersive, it's compelling and it's completely brilliant. Minor control quibbles pale in the face of such an effective piece of software that accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: it scares the hell out of you. Totally recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2006"}

VANQUISH is a game that wasn't talk about a lot, but should have been.  I consider VANQUISH to be an instant classic hit.  This game is so much fun to play.  This game takes a little bit from the movies Star Wars, Aliens, War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and Predator and mixes them all together to make one great game.  This game is directed by Shinji Mikami, who in the gaming world is considered a gaming god and a genius for making great games.  I think the AI in this game is very, very good.Anybody who has played the VANQUISH demo will tell you that that the demo is very fun to play. There is a lot of action going on all the time.  But the demo is just a small part of this game.  The demo just covers the very first part of this game.  You think the demo was great.  Wait until you play the rest of the game.I will give you some good examples of what to expect. You play the role of someone named Sam who wears a special armor suit who fights along side with other armed soldiers against a Russian Nationalist who has taken over a space station high up in space above earth. The Russian leader sends robotic like creatures to fight against you. I noticed right away the space station you are fighting in is huge. I thought the armored space ship I was in to approach the space station was huge until I saw how small it was compared to the actual size of the space station. You'll notice how big the space station really is when the heavily armed space ship you're in crashed lands on the space station. I think the graphics in this game are pretty good. The colors in this game are real vibrant and bright.Anyway, on game play, I was fighting along with some other American soldiers in a fire fight with some robots and I caught some robots out in the open.  Well another robot came along and actually formed what looked like a cement wall in front of the other robots so they could hide behind it.  I thought that was so cool.  In another area, I notice spider like robots that when you blew them up they actually turn into groups of smaller spider like robots.  I thought that was cool too.  I noticed the robots you fight against will constantly try to outflank you and try to get behind you.  That is where your armor suit you are wearing comes into play.  You have this special armor suit on that has booster rockets attached to it so you constantly slide really fast across the ground to your target.  Well you can slide real fast to any targets that are trying to outflank you and take them out before they know what hits them.  I like how you have all kind of different weapons to use throughout the game and you are constantly upgrading your weapons all the time.  The sound effects in the game are really good.If you are looking for really good shooting game that is fast paced, then I recommend trying out this game.  This game seems to have a lot of replay value.  This is one of my favorite games to play right now.  I hope they make an expansion pack or a sequel to this game.  Give this game a try.  I don't think you will regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

This will curve some of your frustration.Then, if you are still having trouble, put in some infinite ammo codes. This will level the playing field a bit. I'm not joking here. A challenge is nice, but not a mass murder of player 1. It took me about 6 times to advance to the second level, then out of breath, saved it. It took me a whole week to get through the 2nd level. I am still on the 3rd level. I thought this was supposed to be \"Easy\" mode? And the guy that says we are whining - I don't know what your problem is, but I have been a Twisted Metal player since 1996. I cruised in Crimson Fury, defeated Dark Tooth, and got the Medium Sized TMIII T-shirt from Toys-R-Us (with preorder) before the turn of the millenium. I have played the games and beat them over and over again. I would consider myself very good at the series. But this game is fricken hard. Someone mentioned bosses. I can only imagine how that would go.Very entertaining game but extremely frustrating at the same time. SUPER SUPER SUPER HARD. Put in the codes. Do not believe those that say it is easy, it is not a walk in the park and is barely enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"Bowman373","summary":"A Decent Game...","reviewText":"Bioshock takes place in the 1960s. You are Jack, the sole survivor of a plane crash somewhere in the Atlantic. You swim to a nearby lighthouse and soon find yourself in the underwater world of Rapture, created by Andrew Ryan. Rapture was created to be a place where the great could thrive without the restraint of the government, but it soon evolved into an awful dystopia. Rapture is a creepy, mysterious place, and it's up to you to figure out what happened before you got there.  That's just the beginning of the story, and you'll have to figure out the rest on your own. The story of Bioshock is excellent, and you'll constantly be wondering what comes next. You'll find audio logs left by citizens and workers in Rapture, which give some insight to the backstory of this underwater city. The voice acting is excellent, and some of the characters give some very intriguing monologues. The ending was very satisfying, and there are up to three that you can get.Bioshock is a FPS, and it allows you to use guns and Plasmids. The latter are special abilities acquired throughout the game that allow you to shoot flames, electric shocks, use telekinesis, and much more! There are many ways that you can approach and deal with a situation, and I doubt any two people will experience the game in the same way. Vending machines are scattered throughout Rapture that allow you to purchase guns, ammo, plasmids, EVE (to recharge your plasmid meter), health kits, and other various things. You can also loot things off of enemies you've killed, mostly money or first-aid kits. I finished Bioshock in about a week, and I left feeling mildly satisfied with the game. Although it was initially a blast, I soon found myself to be very bored. The gameplay seems to be very repetitive, and I was kind of hoping the ending would come along soon. It was very frustrating sometimes, because you would come *this* close to completing an objective, then be sent on a whole new one (gathering necessary objects to unlock this door, etc.) in order to complete it. This happens many times during the game, and although it was a fun challenge the first few times, it soon became very tedious. The game was pretty easy, too; I played on Normal, and only died once during the entire game. I've heard from numerous people that Hard wasn't very hard, either. Unfortunately, I'm not seeing any replay value in this game.Overall, Bioshock is a decent game. Although the story is very good, the gameplay quickly becomes boring and bland. You can pick it up for a bargain (about $20) right now, but I'd just recommend renting it for the story or saving up for another game. Yeah, I know you're seeing a lot of 4 or 5 star reviews on this, and that's what mostly persuaded me to get the game, but for me, anyway, it seems extremely overrated. Hope this helped!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"TorridlyBoredShopper \"T(to the)B(to the)S\"","summary":"That's Not the Mr. Bubble  I  Remember","reviewText":"Considering Bioshock was heralded as \"a must have\" by some and \"the game of the year\" by many respectable outlets, I have to say I went in with high hopes and a sweaty trigger finger. As I played through the game I found that the trigger finger was kept busy and that many portions of the play wee fun and sometimes impressive. The mental powers, the types of weapons, the way the \"big brothers\" look as they glisten into a room and tap dance on your skull; all of that was a sexy sonata that seemed worth listening to over and over again. Then can the redundancy of enemies, the convoluted essence of storytelling that oftentimes made me scratch my head and ask \"why,\" and this over-all feeling that I was playing a different game than the thing I had been promised.To say that this left me with mixed feelings would certainly be an understatement.This isn't to say that the game didn't have some grand upside because it most certainly did. One of the brightest burning of those was quite possibly the graphics, detailing things in ways that really made me think \"next generation.\"  The quality of the imagery, from the people to the background was outstanding and then some, and that made me wonder if people possibly voted the game so highly simply on this one trait. When you step through the corridors of some of the environments and look around, you can't help but feel that they are totally immersive and that the world they depict could possibly be real. It has this Pulp feeling, like the child of a 1930s science fiction parade and a graphic's department dedicated to their beloved baby. The levels that show you the ocean, for instance, give you this feeling of awe and intensity that says that you are living in a small and underwhelming base and that this little pocket of air is truly living on borrowed time. When you see people, the sisters and their companions especially, you can't help but stop and admire the designs because they look inspired. Combine this with the fact that many a door opens, many a weapon glistens, and many a cackling person happens to be wielding something you can use later and you really have to give it to the graphics teams because they really sold a tangible element that becomes intangible as you progress throughout the game.The storyline is actually better than expected one you get into it, too, and the subplots are funny when you stop to pay attention. As you go through the game you find tapes that people have recorded just for the \"whatever\"  of it - you don't have to play them and many aren't really \"necessary\" but they oftentimes give you a sliver of 4111 and a good laugh to boot. There is a con to the storyline too, and this con seems a bit bigger than most people want to admit and I'm really not sure why. Frankly, it seems that the creators wanted too much too quickly and they haphazardly combined some elements into a tale just to keep it moving. You first find out about \"the sisters\" in a round-about way, for instance, and you think that this is something that will take a backseat to something more important. The sisters quickly become the overall theme of the story, however, and you quickly find your interesting little foray into the game dominated by children and metal playthings. Considering the advertisements that literally overwhelmed me I thought I would be kicking it in a metal suit with bathysphere head AND that was further fro the truth.Instead, I was just a man with normal weapons, a bit of psychic prowess, and a fetch-questor. That caught me off-guard more than anything.While this seems to be a testimonial leaning toward the negative, I still have to say that the game has been a lot of fun and that it has a lot of redeeming qualities. The action elements of the game run smoothly, pieces of the story transition from one place to another decently, and the powers you can obtain really make you ant to keep on keeping on. The game happens to be a tad on the short side as well, and that means a quick jostle on the playground instead of an intense love that comes when you meet that special videogame and share 40 hours of your life with it, and the easy of the harder settings were a tad disconcerting. Combine all of that into a 360 forum and I suppose you have what a lot of other games have; you have a pretty picture, a lot of toys to kill with, and music that is really underrated because it manages to set the table quite stunningly.All in all, this is a game you should play BUT that you should try out first, forgetting the hype bug that stings the wallet a little too severely sometimes. I hope the candor of this helps with your buy/don't buy decision.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"Horrible \"Execution\" (Pun Intended) of a Good Premise","reviewText":"\"Assassin's Creed\" is a third-person action adventure set in the Middle East during the outset of the Crusades.  You play as Altair, a disgraced assassin attempting to restore his good name within his former guild.  There is also a parallel present-day storyline that I won't get into here (spoilers), but it feels unnecessary and drags the game down somewhat.But that really drags the game down is the gameplay itself.  First, the camera alternates between hyperactive and totally fixed, and in neither case is it doing you much good.  I found myself constantly (and I mean constantly) correcting it with the right thumbstick.  And just wait until you're in the middle of combat and the camera suddenly swings around and gets stuck in a tree - yes, the camera can get stuck in environmental objects - or else is suddenly behind a flag.  You get to enjoy the scenery while hearing yourself meet an ugly demise.Second, the controls themselves are among the worst that I've ever encountered.  Ubisoft designed two parallel sets of control - one for gentle motions and another for more forceful ones.  You obtain the forceful motions by holding the right trigger.  However, most of the game is spent using this set of motions, so you basically hold down that trigger for 3/4 of the time that you're playing.  Hand and controller fatigue ensue.  Plus, Altair is clumsy to the point of ridiculous.  Much of the game is spent parkouring (didn't know that that dated back to the twelfth century!) around differnt locales, but Altair often fails to jump where you want him to, or else slips off of an overhang to his death, or else refuses to jump to safety as guards approach.  Again, more frustration that the game's storyline can justify.Stealth and combat should be the hallmarks of a game like this, right?  Of course, but both stumble here.  Stealth requires little more than moving slowly; there's not much in the way of figuring out your environment, shadows, etc. in order to get around.  Just move slowly and don't physically run into any guards, and you'll be fine.  Of course, doing so just prolongs the more boring transportation portions of the game.  Combat is basically a series of animations spliced together depending on your button mashing.  It doesn't take long before you feel like you're just watching loops of cutscenes rather than participating in something dynamic.  I call it \"Dragon's Lair\" combat - press the right button at the right time, you get a treat;  otherwise, you get the sharp end of the other guy's sword.Ubisoft took an interesting period of history and wasted their own opportunity with this frustrating, buggy mess.  I would say that it's worth only a rental, but the problem is that it's also overly long (and not in a good way - very repetitive in terms of missions).  So, you'd never be able to finish by the time that it was due back.  That said, just avoid it altogether.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000WINB56","description":"","reviewerName":"PantsuPanic","summary":"Some things you may not know about Endless Ocean.","reviewText":"Instead of describing this game's gameplay as plenty of other reviews have, I just want to touch on a few topics that aren't immediately apparent concerning Endless Ocean for Wii.First off, Endless Ocean for Wii is actually the third game in Arika's underwater diving simulation series.  A more apt title would actually have been \"Everblue 3: Endless Ocean\".  If you take time to play Everblue and Everblue 2 on the Playstation 2,  you will immediately realize that Endless Ocean is clearly a successor of those earlier titles by the same developer no less.  That said, you don't need any prior knowledge of the Everblue series to enjoy Endless Ocean, the game easily stands alone and is self contained lore-wise and gameplay-wise.Secondly, I have read so many times that \"there's nothing to do\" in Endless Ocean.  People who say that obviously did not play this game very long, or they simply are impatient action shooter fans who have no frame of reference for a game like Endless Ocean.  Here are some of the things you can \"do\" in Endless Ocean:1. Uncover the campaign story, reveal Katherine Sunday's past and ambition, help her realize her goals and discover the truth about a myth that permeates the sea around you.  Doing so concludes Endless Ocean's plot and gives the player the staff credits, proving that yes you can \"beat\" Endless Ocean as any other game.2. Fill in your fish encyclopedia, a very Pokemon-esque aspect of the game where you try to \"catch them all\", or rather, \"catalog them all\".3. Fill in your entire map of the sea, this alone will take quite some time and is very rewarding.4. Complete your salvage collection of lost items you discover during your dives.  You have a book of sorts that slowly fills in as you find lost treasures beneath the sea.  Some of these lost treasures are broken, but when you find all the pieces and complete them, they become special tools that allow you to find hidden areas of the sea you might not otherwise.  Some treasures unlock plot aspects as well.5. Befriend certain animals (such as a dolphin) and train them to do new tricks, as well as become better partners for you.  Yes you can bring a partner with you while you dive once you befriend one.6. Be a diving guide and take jobs showing other (computer controlled) divers around the sea, usually trying to find one particular creature to show them.  Doing this gives you a guide rank and will help to unlock new gear for future dives.7. Be a diving photographer and take photos of certain creatures upon request for in-game magazine articles.  Again, you get paid for this with new diving gear.8. Manage a huge aquarium that you design insofar as its ecosystem is concerned.  Every fish you catalog you can bring into your aquarium and enjoy watching them swim.So those are just some of the things you can do in Endless Ocean.  Don't believe for a second that there's \"nothing to do\" here, that's just an erroneous belief!Lastly, Endless Ocean is often described as being too relaxed with no stress.  I don't believe this is the case because of a few aspects.  Such as, if you are being a dive guide, you can get stressed out because you have to do a good job and please your client.  If they don't enjoy the dive you will get a bad rank and can lose your ability to be a dive instructor.  The same goes for being a photographer, if your photos aren't good enough you'll stop being hired to take any more.  Another aspect is that there are sections of the sea that are downright creepy or unnerving to explore.  Such as a deep sea abyss, mysterious aquatic ruins, a labyrinthine cave system, and the deeply haunting \"Ship's Rest\".  Thus Endless Ocean is not always just a \"relaxing stress free diving game\" as some would have you believe.All in all, I hope this review has helped to shed some light on Endless Ocean's history and common misconceptions.  I fully recommend Endless Ocean, it is another gem among the many unique Wii titles and is well worth your money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GKA4","description":"","reviewerName":"C. H. Mauricio","summary":"Finally, a portable Resident Evil game worth playing!","reviewText":"First off, I would like to just point out that the apparent one save only per cartridge file rule is something that has no effect on me whatsoever. I do not trade in video games that I buy, I also buy second hand goods for Japanese imported video games exclusively. If this manner is of concern for you, I would like to say sorry to you and the inconvenience that this has caused you. I do not work for Capcom or have any affiliation with the company. But I ask any of you who are disgruntled, to please read my review from start to finish before hitting the not helpful button. I'm not here to fight or argue, I come here in peace and would like to talk about this game that I purchased.Capcom's world famous Resident Evil series has finally hit the infant Nintendo 3DS, and really, from a technical and gameplay standpoint, this series definitely has a future on this console. The Mercenaries has traditionally been a mini game bonus found on Resident Evils 4 & 5. They certainly were a fun addition adding tremendous replay value to an already stellar campaign story. The origins of this minigame go far beyond the modern RE games. Back on the 32 bit days, starting with I think Resident Evil for the Sega Saturn, Capcom would add a bonus mini game of sorts when you completed the game. The modes were fairly quick gauntlets that challenged the player with surviving hordes of monsters on a room-by-room basis. The term The Mercenaries came about as the bonus minigame from Resident Evil 3. If you remembered the 3rd game, you met a group of mercenaries sent by Umbrella to help suppress the Raccoon City viral outbreak incident. Fast forward to now, Capcom has maintained this name for RE's 4 and 5. Because the new RE games are played on a full 3D plain, the mode now is more about combo racking and trying keep the time from draining.So how did this mode do as a full fledged 3DS title? Well, I think its a darn good translation of the beloved mini game with a polished control scheme and lots of grinding for those who enjoy the experience. You do have to keep in mind that this is a portable version of the mini games so a few concessions have been made. First off there is no campaign whatsoever. Instead you have a set amount of missions to progress through. A typical game flow works like this, you pick a character, then you pick what skills you want to raise, pick a mission, and try to do your best on that mission. All missions can be played with all characters, and each mission tracks down the best ratings on a character by character basis. This, along with the skill grinding artificially increases the game's length so this game can take a while to complete with all characters beating all missions with the highest marks, and maxing out all skill levels.The gameplay has mostly been translated quite well on a portable. Controls feel quite nice with now the option to strafe and shoot at the same time, a feature that has been absent since the Outbreak games on the PS2. Though I opted to stay with the traditional methods (stand still and shoot), I was able to get some of that sense of panic once more by standing still while a group of majini get on a circle and start trying to attack me. Now why did I say trying? Well because the AI has been toned down significantly which makes this in my opinion, the game's worse feature. The majini at this point become target practice waiting to be head shot. It does remove a good chunk of the suspense when they are dumped down to those levels. Some of the quirks from the previous games have been smoothed out here as well. For example, you can now also reload and move at the same time, the inventory screen is now 100% accessible by putting it strictly on the touch pad. The dpad has been relegated to be a weapon selector much like you can map on RE5 with your 9 item inventory. Things like this I feel are a welcome improvement.The graphics are simply outstanding, but the 3D effect here is nothing outstanding but character models, enemies, and the stages (all taken maps from RE 4 & 5's Mercenaries modes) look like the source material where they come from. Load times are short and performance offline is pretty smooth albeit some slow down from time to time. The sound is on the other side of the spectrum. Low quality sound effects remind me of Resident Evil 4 on the PS2 with weak gun effects, badly sampled grunts, overall low fidelity sound effects plague the game.In the end, if you have an affinity with games that have you grinding, trying to beat your own personal best, and love the franchise in general, Resident Evil The Mercenaries 3D is a great debut on the Nintendo handheld. The foundation has been set for solid RE games on this console and I only hope it gets better from here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"\"...where the grass is green and the girls are pretty...\"","reviewText":"EA's insanely fun Burnout series takes some big steps forward with Burnout Paradise, which takes the series' formula to some new levels.  Most notably is that the game features an open-world environment, otherwise known as Paradise City.  The game has virtually no linear feel to it as you are basically free to drive, crash, and smash until your heart is content, as you come across objectives to keep progressing up the game's ladder of licenses.  One thing I've noticed based on other reviews here, notably the negative ones, is that many are complaining that Crash Mode is nowhere to be found.  Yes, it's sad but true, Crash Mode is gone, but one new feature that what we get here instead is Showtime Mode, which is a sheer blast to say the least.  Yes, Crash Mode is gone, get over it.  The game itself looks gorgeous and is wonderfully detailed in its scenes of vehicular destruction, and the driving and racing elements are still as fun as you'd come to expect from the series by now.  XBox Live support is nearly flawless as well, nicely implementing the use of the XBox Vision Camera, which is a neat little feature in itself.  The one thing I absolutely couldn't stand about Burnout Paradise was the game's licensed music soundtrack.  This has become a staple with just about every sports/driving-themed game to come out of EA, but the songs here are just plain annoying.  Also, there are a few glitches and hiccups that pop up now and then, but they're not too noticeable.  All in all, Burnout Paradise is a welcome change of pace for the series to take, as it still provides heaping amounts of mayhem that fans of the series old and new can enjoy, and if you've never played any Burnout game before, Burnout Paradise is a more than welcome place to get acquainted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2008"}

Learning that the monster Sin is responsible, and seeking answers to his fate, Tidus joins Yuna in a journey to defeat Sin.  But he learns more and more that there's much more to the journey than just defeating Sin.  Corruption, betrayal, drama, it's all here.My dad got FFX for me the xmas right after it was released and I was not really taken by it.  The cover with Tidus to me was different from what I was used to (Cloud, Sephiroth, Medieval dark knights, armor).  So it sat for a good year at least until I actually started it.  It turned out I was missing out on arguably the best RPG experience to date.  In my opinion FFX for me, is the best of the series (even up to 14), because it blew me away from start to finish. I enjoyed it so much I beat it almost 3 times.  This review is for my favorite game I've played and I've played every Final Fantasy up to 14 (but ironically not X-2).  Let's split it up by Pros and Cons.PROS-Story.  Incredible is an understatement.  FFVII is the only game that can compete with a story like this.  When it comes to a complex dramatic, making you wanna move forward story, FFX is by far the best.-Characters.  Many people complain about the characters in this game, but I'm not sure why.  Characters need to have something key role in the story at some point for them to be memorable.  And every character played a memorable role.-Gameplay.  The leveling up system with the spheres to me, is the peak so to speak of the series.  Sphere levels made it possible to level up whenever you want and allowed for actual freedom and individuality.  This made it possible for Yuna to be a hard physical attacker, or Auron to be a agile fighter.  I say the \"peak\" because it definitely seemed to downfall at FFXII, and even FFXIII, trying to simulate it, made it too linear.  Everything else, overdrives, switching party members, fighting with aeons, puzzle temples, environments, playing blitzball all worked very well for me.-Weapons/armor.  Every character has their \"celestial\" weapon which is obtainable in a subquest in obtaining ultimate weapons.  These weapons each represent a planet in the solar system, that is also complimentary to the character themself.  It's also possible to customize weapons, and even break the 9999 damage limit for the first time.-Aeons/subquests.  The aeons first of all, were pretty cool, they actually fight, and have moves.  Then there's the extra aeons which I found really, really cool.  Other subquests, were very challenging, but not as tedious as they were for IX, VIII, XII, XIII, and some others.  And I couldn't hope for more than that.CONS-Colosseum.  I'm trying to be as objective as possible and not naively say that I enjoyed everything about this game.  I did not really appreciate that you can catch every monster in the game for prizes and battles with incredibly hard monsters.  I found it a bit tedious, but still I tried it, and it definitely is a at least a step up from the card games from FFIX and FFVIII.-Customizing difficulty.  I played FFX a good while ago but one thing I remember was the customizing for breaking damage limit and breaking hp limit, stuff like that was incredibly hard to get and nearly impossible to get them altogether for each character.  I'm not sure, but I think there were a few issues I had with customizing, although I still liked it.BOTTOM LINEAll in all, I'd say play it!! If you haven't then you're missing out.  Pretty much anyone can enjoy this game.  But it is a hardcore RPG, so if you hate RPGs and don't have the attention span for a good story, then nevermind.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2011"}

It is an amazing game series and is a must have for all gamers. It has a great story especially if you enjoy Greek mythology like me. I think it has the best boss battles in video game history and I am being serious. There isn't anything that I don't like about the games.What I don't like is..... Finding voucher to download God of War Origins. I always prefer disc version over download content. I actually thought I was missing a disc after I opened it. It doesn't say anywhere in the detail description or even on the game case about download voucher so I thought it was very misleading for Sony to do that. I know exactly why Sony did that though... They want people to buy NEW so they get the profit and stop people from buying/selling used. However, it bothers customers like me who feels like I was duped and I never had any intention of ever selling God of War Saga.Hey Sony.... Next time, put an asterisk on the cover and say \" *God of War Origins comes as download voucher\".*Edit: After reading the tiny (font size 0) licensing mumbo jumbo on the back of the box case, Sony makes reference to God of War Origins voucher. It is hidden under all the video support, online pass, licensing, distribution, trademark and other lawyer stuff garbage that nobody really reads.

I think most people can agree you aren't getting 5 five star games.  Playing them nonstop is going to highlight flaws, more than having been in GoW withdrawal between original releases.Cons:origins is not playable on PSP & PS3.  Since it is about HD and 3D upgrades, fair enough, but this does mean the vouchers do not have a plus side.GoWIII doesn't appear to include the DLC.I & II didn't get too much of an upgrade.The product detail on amazon is not complete and the actual product packaging is misleading with some of the details on the back in tiny print.  For other information, you have to search even further, online.  Picking up a bargain pack, shouldn't involve this much time and research just to see if it meets expectations.So, given the factors detailed below, instead of rounding up to 4 stars, I am rounding down fairly to 3.Buy it:*Do not own and have not played GoW*Cost of Saga is less than cost of getting games (at least 1-3) via other means*Want all five games,,even if voucher or incomplete at one stop shop*PS3 only play ok*don't mind vouchers*want the extras without paying extraDon't buy it:*Want all five on disc (go buy them seperately)*Can get for less $ separately (even if that means used and you are ok with that)*Don't buy anything with vouchers on principal*would rather not own, than pay for anything less than your idea of perfect collection (all DLC, all disc, etc.)*don't really care about the PSP ports*want to play the psp titles on your psp (or vita)Value for the money thoughts, as this is a bundle:You can look at it as getting 3GoW $10 ea + vouchers $5 ea + two bonuses = fair.  Really, as long as saga costs the same or less than GoW1-3 otherwise, the value of saga should be fairly obvious.  Especially to people like me, who don't own any GoW or others who maybe own one title.  Black Friday folks made out like bandits.[Really, playstation plus trial should not decide whether you buy this or not, but could cause customer dissatisfaction if you haven't done your research on the trial]*Playstation Plus trial credit card required*playstation plus more like rent, than own for free games*playstation plus - have to remember to stop it from auto renewal charges if you want full year or don't want itI got a free trial with another game and I liked it, well enough, but it doesn't make sense for me to subscribe at that time.Anyone critical of this product, even balancing it out with reason still get a load of unhelpful votes. *popcorn*","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2012"}

Air Pirates? A bit corny then&quot;. But then I read so many good reviews on different gaming magazines that I eventually got a copy of it myself. I imported it from States for I have a Jap+States Cube (and an Australian Cube - but this game is a hard to find gem in Aust.) and tried it out.The starting part was like typical RPG stories, hero got involved in an evil plot while looking for his dreams. However, the story gets better and better and you got some good tricks and twists from time to time.For the battle system, it is like a mix of Final Fantasy and Wild Arms. It is turn based which you go through different commands for different characters and you have different elements and class of magic. So you would expect to see Fire Fira and Firaga but in a different term. Also it adopts a SP system which is similar to the FP system in Wild Arms 3. You accumulate SP every turn and when certain amount of SP is accumulated, then you would be able to perform a super move. The difference between Skies and Wild Arms is the SP in Skies is shared among all 4 characters, so you have to plan ahead strategically as super-moves could cause devastating attacks or protect your parties from enemies attacks.  Nonetheless, you could speed up your SP accumulation by using your turn to Focus, which could be helpful under certain occasions.On top of regular battles, the introduction of ship battles gave you an alternative in game play. Nonetheless, since most of the ship battles are story driven, they are mostly boss battles that could take up a lot of time. You really need to plan strategically to win these battles and it could take you a whole hour to finish one if planned badly. The crew system in the ship battle nonetheless is very unique and despite you might not be usuing the crew in the battle a lot, when you use them, they DO contribute to the whole battle.In terms of story, Skies of Arcadia is very clever in a way that some of the side quests are actually stories that you could weave into the main story. The side quests also integrate into the game world very well. For example the Bounty Hunting side quests make you feel like you are really a good pirate going around the world ridding the evil, no matter big or small. The dialogues are actually less corny than expected. The Final Fantasy series sometimes is annoying because of really bad dialogues and extremely stupid characters. However in Skies, the characters are well balanced and they have the kind of subtle humour that you would share their laughter. I think in terms of character building Skies of Arcadia is much better the most of the Final Fantasy series.Another strong part of Skies of Arcadia is the vast world they was built in the game. Each world has their own distinct culture and by upgrading your ship, you would be able to reach areas that are not opened to you before and there would be new discoveries for you to earn a good fortune from. The dungeons in the world of Skies of Arcadia are also cleverly built. I particularly like the one that you need to wear the underwater suit from time to time to solve the puzzle. They are really well designed, and at the same time integrated to the particular culture of that dungeon world. You would be able to find cultures similar to the Maya, Arabians, Westerners and the Orientals, and these are just a few of them.There are heaps to do and play with in Skies of Arcadia and it could take you a considerable amount of time to finish it if you want to do everything. The only down side of the game is the random battles are like stars in the skies. It could get really annoying at the beginning for your weak characters. However, running from battles are not recommended in a way that it could affect certain course of the story and character development in the later part. I heard that Sega actually reduced the encounter rate in the GameCube version. If so, I feel sorry for the players of the original one then.All in all, Skies of Arcadia is a very well developed game with brilliant ideas. So far, everyone I know who had played this game love it and as I said the game is a rare commodity in Aust. and the price at ebay for a second hand copy is staggering. This could tell how good this game is considering it has been out for so long already. I heard the sequel is in development for GameCube, just couldn't wait at all now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2004"}
