I love it, great re-playability, options to save instead of starting over, lots of different ways to play (focus on this or that). game is fun, recommend getting 100%.so i got it for free via PS+, i'm assuming the lag is the PS3 system and not the d/l vs. disk game. That being said, it's a bit laggy when moving characters or during certain moves(actions on base). Luckily this game isn't a fast paced FPS, it's a turn base system so it's just a little bothersome and doesn't actually affect gameplay. If you were going to buy it, and had the option of PC vs console i would buy the PC version. Last time i tried multiplayer there were a few glitches not sure if they fixed any of that yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

Cue a sudden earthquake that shatters the jar Ico was bound inside letting him loose inside a castle maze full of cages, swinging chains (press O when you are on one), staircases, levers, openings, windows, pipes, elevators, rock faces, tunnels, sewers, blocks, trains, cranes, bombs, fires, gates, graveyards, vents, ropes, windmills, cogs, waterways, towers and of course the shadow demons who are trying to kidnap the little glowing white girl you have found who can mysterious open special doors by standing before them if you grab her by the hand and manage to lead her through the maze after you have worked out the various brainteasers that allow you both to navigate it (she can't climb chains, crawl across walls or manage large drops). This is the kind of game that puzzle-lovers and those who like a good challenge should immediately pick up and insert as quickly as possible into that PS2 DVD drive. It requires your thinking cap to be on... for all of it.Apart from the fact that is one of the best 3rd person puzzle games ever made, the quality of the 3D art on display is beyond belief. Most of the game is jaw dropping awe inspiring. When it was released as a demo in late 2001 (a year after the PS2 came out) it made quite an impact on those who played it with its bleached out overexposed Manga cartoon look and the stunning free camera mode which is used by moving the right thumb pad with zooming ability, left everyone flabbergasted. The problem was that the game was in Japanese with subtitles and so distribution was sadly poor in the West with very few shops bothering to stock the game when it came out. It is even hard to track down on the internet. Thus if getting Ico is difficult then sadly most of the PS2 owning world is never going to play one of the best games of all time. For those who got it, you will remember how gorgeous every single moment of this game was, from the opening sequence being led into the castle to the golden beach ending. Take any still shot of any section of the game and you can easily hang it as a painting on your wall. Imagine a game that looks totally stunning with a fun game play element that requires a bit of an IQ level. The only drawback was the girl you need to drag about the place. Sometimes her AI is bit like a very low IQ... but we are only cribbing compared to the utter experience of playing a marvel like Ico. It is four years old and still has the ability to put things like the XBOX 360 to shame. It is not surprising that in 2005 the makers of Ico brought out the breathtaking \"Shadow of the Colossus\" that looks like you are playing it on a PS4 or an XBOX 1080. In short, PLAY IT and then get \"Shadow of the Colossus\" right away after it. What are you waiting for? DO IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00KAI3KW2","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"An Incredibly Reliable & Advanced Game Console","reviewText":"Xbox One was initially announced and revealed this past June and received a lot of heat for its DRM policy that would've hurt used game sales. I was one of those people who wasn't fond of such an idea. Even though I buy mostly new games, I didn't like that the disc was pretty much a coaster after you installed it, as I'm the kind of gamer that likes to have a collection of physical games and not have everything online-only. So I wasn't going to buy an Xbox One.Fast forward to them announcing that they were doing away with the awful DRM stuff and I was sold. I then pre-ordered one along with a PS4. While I was turned off by their original plans for the console, they heard the complaints and did the right thing, even if it was a tough pill for Microsoft to swallow.So now what we have is a game console like any other. Whether it's a new or used game, it'll work, and this is the way it should remain for any future game consoles. As we saw with the PSP Go, the digital-only model doesn't work for this industry unless we're talking Steam.Onto the console, the Xbox One is a large device and pretty weighty, but it has a very reliable feel to it. The Blu-ray drive is quiet and takes the disc smoothly, you can hardly hear the fans, and the whole thing is generally whisper quiet. In addition, the user interface is smooth and works very intuitively with the new Kinect.And let's not forget the Xbox One controller which feels like a durable and well-made piece of hardware including an improved d-pad and ergonomics from the Xbox 360 controller.Here are some 2014 exclusives still on their way:Sunset Overdrive - The new open world sandbox action game from Insomniac, the creators of Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet & Clank, and Resistance. Featuring beautiful art direction, a huge world to explore, lots of free-roaming, vertical parkour allowing the player to reach great heights, etc.D4 - The new game from cult game director Swery, the mind behind titles such as Extermination, Spy Fiction, and Deadly Premonition. It looks original and interesting for fans of his work.Halo: Master Chief Collection - 4 games, 3 confirmed for 1080p/60fps, the other 1 being worked on to reach 1080/60fps by launch, and over 100 multiplayer and co-op maps. Halo 2: Anniversary graphics completely redone from the ground up with new CG cutscenes.Ori & the Blind Forest - Looks to be a beautiful and emotional journey unlike anything else out there.Below - One of the most anticipated independent titles.PS: I also own a PS4 which I posted an Amazon Verified Review of.

{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Beset by problems, but the unusual story and good writing make up for it","reviewText":"Dragon Age II is the successor game to Dragon Age: Origins, although not a sequel in the traditional sense. It takes place in a different location with a (mostly) different cast of characters with, unusually, a much smaller and tighter focus than the first game in the series. These changes have proved controversial, with praise for the focus, the writing and the characters being contrasted with harsh criticisms of gameplay changes and problems resulting from the game's rushed development.BioWare released Dragon Age II in early 2011, only eighteen months after the release of Origins. Electronic Arts, which took over BioWare shortly before Origins's release in late 2009, is alleged to have mandated a 'quickie' sequel to be developed on a very tight time schedule and budget to help make up for the lengthy (and therefore expensive) five-year development of Origins itself. There was resistance to this at BioWare - the lead designer of Origins quit in protest, fearing the game would suffer from being rushed out of the door - but ultimately they had to comply. At the same time, EA seem to have been rather impressed with Mass Effect 2 and various mechanics from that game, such as the dialogue wheel and the loyalty missions, were transposed over to Dragon Age II.The result is a schizophrenic game that hangs between some excellent conceptual ideas, characters and writing but in which the gameplay feels like it's been compromised to make up for it. It's still very playable and very enjoyable, but it does feel like a game that's been rushed out before it was fully ready.To deal with the bad issues first, the most annoying problem is combat. Battles in the game start in the traditional manner with you spotting a bunch of enemies and engaging them. However, most battles will see additional 'waves' of enemies arriving (usually just as you think the battle is about to end) who can't be seen coming and can attack from any direction. Early in the game there seems to be more care taken about how these enemies arrive (jumping down from rooftoops or rushing in from nearby buildings) but by the end the designers have given up and enemies simply materialise directly onto the battlefield. This means that positioning your characters in the best place to have an impact on combat is now futile, as you can be swamped from any direction at any time and not be able to do anything about it. The developers help you out by turning off the 'friendly fire' option on area-of-effect spells (you can switch it back on again at the higher difficulty levels), so you can firestorm the heck out of massed gangs of enemy without fear of sustaining injury, but this simply removes the (limited, but still present) tactical realism of the first game and makes the whole thing feel too arcadey.This is not helped by the fact that Dragon Age II has simplified inventory management beyond even the heavily-streamlined mechanics of the original. Your companions' armour cannot be changed at all, although you can give them different magical amulets and rings. Only Hawke's weapons and equipment can be changed at will.Another major problem is the re-use of the same maps for locations. All the mines in the game have exactly the same lay-out as one another. The same is true for mansions, caves and sewers. The developers drop different partitions into the maps to try to change things up, but they are all clearly the same places (and the mini-map never changes to take into account the partitions, often resulting in you going down dead-end passages which are shown as being open on the map). Obviously this is a result of the crippling budget issues, but even so it's repetitive and monotonous to the point of boredom.The final issue is the lack of choice in the game: major events happen in the game which it is impossible for you to influence, even when it feels like you should be able to (some of Anders's actions in the endgame, most notably). This silliness reaches its zenith in the climactic battle where you have a lot of choices to make and the battle ends up unfolding more or less the same way regardless. The much greater freedom and resonance from your decisions seen in Origins is absent here.So, weaker combat than Origins (and Origins itself was riddled with some major problems in that regard anyway), a lack of choice and some seriously bland locations should all make for a poor game, right? Not entirely. Dragon Age II does do a lot of other things right.Most importantly, it is far better-written than Origins. Dialogue is less expositionary and portentous. Instead, it's more naturalistic and enjoyable. The voice acting is superior right across the board and the companion characters are more interesting. The 'loyalty mission' mechanic from Mass Effect 2 also helps in this area. Each companion has their own interests, problems and issues to deal with, and by helping them out you can improve their loyalty to you. This will determine who stays with you, who turns against you and who flees during the culminating battle. It's a nice idea as completionists will want to complete all of the companion quests, resulting in a better understanding of the characters (in Origins there was a whole bunch of characters I left in camp and never bothered with because the game never gave me a reason to use them over my core team) and their relationships with one another. BioWare have done a better job of giving the characters their own arcs (some rather tragic) and making them deeper and more complex than those from the first game.Additionally, the story and worldbuilding are much better-integrated with one another. Origins suffered from presenting Thedas as yet another epic fantasy identikit landscape, with the more interesting background elements (such as the the templar/mage tensions and the Qunari) kept to one side in favour of dealing with the generic horde of generic monsters. Dragon Age II, on the other hand, brings these elements front-and-centre and makes them far more compelling as a result. The game also tries to make up for its lack of scale and smaller number of locations by using Kirkwall as a city in which the affairs of the larger world are both reflected in micro and can also cause reverberations across the continent, acting as a sort-of medieval fantasy version of Babylon 5's titular space station. It's an idea that almost works, though the fall-out from the events of this game will not fully be explored until Dragon Age: Inquisition (the forthcoming third game in the series). Dragon Age II substitutes the epic scale of Origins for something more focused and intimate which has its drawbacks (Kirkwall is a well-designed city but you'll be sick of it by the end of the game) but broadly works in furthering the game's themes of tolerance, coexistence and family.Dragon Age II (***) is a far cry from the unmitigated disaster some have labelled it as. It has some problems, sure, but then so did Origins. In fact, the two games seem to have swapped their issues: Origins had better combat but poorer writing. Dragon Age II's combat is less satisfying but the writing, story and characters are superior. Ultimately, the two balance out, leaving Dragon Age II a reasonable - if flawed - companion game to the flawed - but enjoyable - original game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0047THYWC","description":"","reviewerName":"IdrilCelebrindal","summary":"Fun game, forgettable experience","reviewText":"Dragon Age: Origins is officially one of my favorite games ever.  While I've had other games that kept my interest a month or two, I literally played Origins from Nov 2009 when I bought it straight through to the release of the sequel.  Sequels are an opportunity to build on your first game, take what worked, throw out what didn't, and improve.  In the case of Dragon Age II, I feel like BioWare overall did none of those.  And when compared to improvements made from Mass Effect 1 to 2 and Baldur's Gate 1 to 2, that fact becomes all the more disappointing.There was much emphasis put on the alteration in graphics, and I'll say overall, I think both are fine.  Both games look good, with some of the prettier environments standing out; animations of a few of the darkspawn really stick out as being radically different, but the character models are still generally the same.  People hold their hands stiffly and make the same awkward gestures at occasionally non-sequiter moments.  It didn't bother me in the first and it doesn't bother me here.Combat has been sped up, and in theory, the idea of it is fine.  And admittedly, it can be more fun to watch (though that appeal can growing boring fast).  In general, most abilities are executed almost immediately, and that's a welcome change.  That being said, the increased speed actually becomes a problem when combined with some of the other changes.  For instance, both the removal of the top-down camera, and the complete inability to disable the AI.  Meaning that, to some degree, the computer will be taking control of your party during combat; and I know I for one spent a fair amount of the game feeling like I was never quite entirely in control (except for a few of the harder bosses).  And I knew about the top-down camera in advance and thought I might get used to it.  Except that when you select a character who's shoved up against a wall, you literally can't see anything.  And lining up of Area of Effect abilities is oftentimes shooting in the dark, as the mage/rogue is too far away to get an accurate gauge.  If there's no top-down camera, there needs to be some free roam with it of some kind, because the way it is now, it is undeniably flawed.There are new ability trees, and warriors are now restricted to weapon and shield and two handed-weapons (and dual-weapon rogues can only wield daggers).  I was disappointed to lose the dual weapon warrior (which was my favorite from Origins) though I understand wanting to lessen the crossover between the two classes (which was very prevalent in the first game).  I actually enjoy the new ability trees, the fact that you can upgrade specific abilities, and that there are cross-class combos, rather than just particular combinations of mage spells.  I enjoy both ability trees from each game in this case, though given that especially by the time you reach the end of Awakenings, there's almost too much, I can see the appeal of having a smaller number of abilities, and giving them upgrades that, for example, lessen the duration of cooldown (meaning they can be used more frequently).90% of the game takes place in the city of Kirkwall.  And though it does have half a dozen different areas within the city, as well as the opportunity to explore both day and night, there's no changing the fact that by the end of the game, I was very sick and tired of Kirkwall.  Even random ventures out to a few surrounding areas is not enough to temper that fact.  And there is a great deal of re-use of caves visited, and the like.While the PC still has a homebase, like in the first game, the remaining characters all each have their own similar spot in Kirkwall.  And while this works on a story level, on a party management level, it just adds to the hassle.  There's no way to give a look through of all your party stats, level up, and inventory management.  If I want to give Aveline that new shield I just found, she has to be in my party.  It's not a huge detail, but it's one of those minor changes that adds to the annoyance of the whole.The dialogue tree has been replaced with the dialogue wheel from Mass Effect 2, and the PC is now voiced.  This is another area in which I have no strong opinion either way, though if forced to choose, I'd probably prefer the tree, as it gave more options, and I always knew exactly what I was saying.  I didn't particularly care that my PC was silent; it doesn't really add anything to the game to change that.All that being said, particularly after playing the demo, I knew going in that it was very unlikely I would like it as much as I did the first.  But the single greatest reason why I would peg this game as a let-down is the story.  And it's not just the fact that it's a framed narrative (meaning that the beginning and ending are always exactly the same, and none of your decisions throughout ever have serious impact).  It's the fact that the whole thing comes across like a series of sidequests.  Which, of course, is partly due to the fact that this game has sidequest overload.  Gone are the long dungeon-crawling campaigns of the first game - where the main threads to the overall plot would take hours to complete.  Instead, 90% of the quests that you participate in read roughly like:A. Speak to person to initiate quest.B. Travel to warehouse/cave to defeat foesC. Report back to personAnd it's the fact that the \"main quest\" reads roughly the same.  And on top of that, none of them take more then 15-30 minutes to complete.  Also, the game is divided into three Acts, each of which has a climax to its end, and aside from one minor thread between the first and third, there is absolutely no connection between the three.  So the overall climax to the game is introduced too late, has very little build-up, and there's no backbone narrative to the game.  I never fail to become emotional during the climax and finale of Origins, but when I got to the end of this one, I was, at best, indifferent.  If you've seen any marketing for this game, you basically know the story: Refugee rises to become Champion of Kirkwall.  Try summing Origins all up in one sentence.And I'm hard on this game because this is BioWare!  I feel that even as the gameplay for games like Baldur's Gate has become outdated, those games had fantastic and epic stories.  And this studio has cultivated a well-earned reputation for making some of the best RPGs over the last 15 years!  If this had come from a lesser studio - and not on the heels of a great game like Origins - then it would be seen in a better light.Also, a number of the changes they made really fall into the category of fixing what isn't broken.  Things like the top-down camera were working so well in the first game; and them removing it doesn't feel like trying to make a better experience, but rather an excuse to cut corners graphically, so that they could rush production of the game.  And with disabling AI, that was present not only in Origins but in both Baldur's Gate.  That, and other valid complaints (like not being able to be other races, the removal of all non-combat abilities, etc.) are things that BioWare has had previously.  It's not like critics are coming from Fable or WoW and demanding changes to be similar to another franchise.Did I enjoy playing this game?  Absolutely.  The fundamental gameplay is addictive and seeking out combat encounters was rather exciting and satisfying.  But I never really thought about it once I stopped playing.  I even started a second playthrough once I was done to try a different class and alter the emotion of my reactions, but kind of gave up about 5 hours in.  I just didn't care; the different classes and minor plot alterations aren't enough to make up for the repetition of environments and the fact that there isn't really a story.The fact that this came out a mere 16 months after the first one, combined with the limited environments, the overall lack of strong story, and elimination of and alteration to a number of interface and story choices does make it feel like this was a rushed product.And it's hard not to feel like BioWare doesn't care.  They made enough significant changes from the first that disgruntling fans of Origins was inevitable, but they seem more interested in bringing in new fans than even trying work with any of the fans that they already have.  A look at the reviews here gives a good sense of that, and you'd be hard pressed to find a fan that loved Origins and feels equally the same about its sequel.I love Dragon Age: Origins and will still be playing it for many years to come.  And while I don't regret buying Dragon Age II, if this is the direction the franchise is heading, I will not be rushing out to buy the third.  Because at the end of the day, Dragon Age II is just a pretty good game, when it could have - should have - been a great one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"Randi Morse","summary":"An Epic Adventure For Any Game Lover","reviewText":"We purchased Epic Mickey for our 10 year old son for Christmas. He's an avid gamer and has played through almost all of the Mario games, as well as a few Link games, so we were very surprised to see our son have such a difficult time with the game. The reason why he's having a hard time with it isn't because it's difficult to control - on the contrary, it's very easy. It's because it's the type of game where you really need to take your time.Epic Mickey isn't a \"rush through and finish it out to win it\" game, but is, rather, truly an epic adventure. You get to be Mickey in an entirely new (or old, depending on how you look at it) world, where he needs not only to save himself, but to help many others. The game changes depending on how you play it. If you help out a lot of people, for instance, they'll be there to lend you a hand when you may need it. Or you can skip helping others and can just rush through the game yourself, but if you do this the game is a bit more difficult.PROS- The controls. You get to run around and paint and thin things. How much fun is that? Granted you can't paint or thin everything, but there are a large number of things that you can paint and thin, and what you choose to do changes the way the land around you looks, truly personalizing the game.- The sheer size of it. It's huge. It's a game where you can run all over the place and still not see everything, much like Disney World itself.- The sentiment. We just got back from Disney and seeing some of the same things, like \"Mean\" street and the Disney statue, are so sentimental for me. And watching Mickey's animated face when he sees Walt's statue - priceless!CONS- The camera control - you don't have full, complete camera control like you do in some games, and I can see where that would be frustrating to some people. To me, however, it's just another challenge to the game, and it doesn't bother me too badly.Epic Mickey is a great game - not the easiest game, but definitely great. It actually got emotion out of me whenever one of the characters were unremembered by Mickey, and when they talked about being forgotten about by the world. Any video game that can not only challenge you and intrigue you, but also make you feel emotion, is a good one to me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}

The campaign introduces you to all the \"future\" weapons and accessories like going invisible and what not.  The multiplayer is where this game truly shines.  However, like many before it, it's still a few updates away from being perfect.  The spawns aren't always the best and some of the maps allow for really cheap camping from newb snipers.

{"product_name":"B003O6E7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"Joey Z. \"Joey\"","summary":"Professor Layton and the Unwound Future","reviewText":"The Professor Layton series has been a hit in Japan and a sleeper hit in Western states. The third installment, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, hopes to duplicate the success of the first two, but is it enough this time around? Yes.The game starts out with Layton and Luke receiving a letter from a supposedly future version of Luke. From here, the game spawns an incredible turn of events ranging from time travel to a few run-ins with old friends and fiends. The game's story is phenomenal like always, and constantly keeps you on your toes guessing as it twists itself through plot-twists. That being said, the story felt right. It was never rushed, and was kept at a great pace, just like the first two. I found the story to not be as compelling as the previous title, Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, but it still kept me captivated and wanting more each chapter. Speaking of chapters, the game is split into about 10 chapters, and the game will take you 6-8 hours to complete, adding countless more for all 165 puzzles and extra games and challenges. The overworld is huge, mainly taking place in Future London, and spanning multiple areas such as Chinatown and even Present London. Navigating is much easier thanks to the nicely implemented undergrouond railways, letting you go from one place to the next.The whole premise of the Professor Layton titles is puzzles. And the game is full of them. Any citizen around town's got puzzles for you, and interacting with items usually spawn Layton or Luke to challenge each other with a puzzle that reminded them of that item. The puzzles are great this time around, ranging from difficult to just right. Hint coins are scattered around town, and these help you unlock hints for those super tough puzzles. New this time around is the super hint, which costs two hint coins, and usually gives away the answer to the puzzle. These puzzles take place on the lower screen of the DS and have great touch-screen compatibility as you slide blocks and write numbers. I did have trouble with handwriting recognition, but that was just me. Navigating around London is easy, just tap the foot in the lower-right corner of the screen and tap where to go.Aside from the main quest, Layton's chest offers tons of things to do. If you're lost and need to recap on the story, just tap Hershel's journal and you'll be caught up in no time. The puzzle index is also in here, so if you want to replay a puzzle anytime, just stop in here. The new minigames this time around include Luke's toy car, which offers a fun diversion as you navigate yourself around a little course. Also new is the storybook, a Mad-Libs-esque story, letting you collect stickers and complete picture books. The best one, though, takes place in the parrot mini-game. This little fellow, helping you in your main quest as well, helps you deliver packages to citizens in a fun test of skill. If that isn't enough, just like the last game, Nintendo's offering weekly puzzles in the form of Wi-Fi events, but don't expect any if you're not hooked up.Once more, the music is the best it's been, offering a new remix on a monotonus puzzle tune, and featuring beautiful pieces for the areas of London. The graphics didn't receive much of an update, but it didn't need it. The crisp voice acting and greatly scripted video sequences are a great addition as well.Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is a fantastic DS title. You can start here, or with any of the previous titles. The story may not be as compelling as before, but it's fantastic puzzles and gameplay keep you around for more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2010"}

I'm going to guess that you wouldn't be able to power up with everything in one play through so there is some re playability to it as well.The combo system is pretty intuitive and easy to pull off and the power ups mix it up enough that the game doesn't get too monotonous.I'm not sure what the price is on it right now, but it's definitely not a game worth the full $60.  It's a quick game as well and can probably be finished in one sitting if you're up for a marathon.  I finished it in one weekend.Overall fun game, I'm sure I'll be picking it up again in a year or so to play again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

There is nothing quite as satisfying as picking apart a robot and watching it's cybernetic body part fly off before it explodes while trying to craw to you. It's amazing. I love the story also.

{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"Fun game. Not an RPG","reviewText":"In honesty I haven't played a Paper Mario game since the first one on the 64, and a little bit of Thousand Year Door. I Did watch the one on the Wii get played but I never played it myself.To sum it up, PM3DS is NOT an RPG in the sense that All the other paper Mario games are. If your looking for Exp and levels and stats this is not the game for you. It's more like... like Zelda than an RPG. You have a certain amount of HP that can be increased by finding heart containers (+5 HP Per) that's it. your attacks are based on the Stickers you find and they are all one use attacks. Once you use them you can't use it again ever unless you find the sticker again. Now this may seem horrible but actually it creates a really fun strategy game in a way.You get X amount of pages of stickers, on average you can fit about 15 per page, some stickers are bigger and take up 4-8 slots on a page so you have to be careful. But these big ones are the strongest attacks in the game and are fun to watch. They are like summons from the Final Fantasy series. I say X amount of pages because you gain more of those as the game goes on.Now as for the stickers themselves, there are 96 combat stickers and 64 \"Thing\" stickers (These are the Big stickers, i like to call them Summons). Once you find a summon sticker you can buy it again and use it, however you can only have one of the same summon at a time. But they have more than just uses inside of battle, these stickers can (and some times HAVE to) be used outside of battle to open up pathways or to clear a sandstorm etc... and this is where I think the game gets fun. It doesn't hold your hand at all you have to figure out which stickers to use, where they are hidden and if you chose the wrong sticker you do lose it. It's where the Metroid/Zelda feeling hits me that I like it. Problem solving has always been a plus for me in these kinds of games, and having to backtrack a bit to find a lost item i missed is entertaining... mostly. I think Metroid takes it a level TOO far but that's OK.As for the combat since this is a Paper Mario game. I find combat to be a lot of fun. As I said you use your stickers to fight and there are plenty to choose from. It's a matter of choosing which stickers can kill your opponents in one shot or not. But it's not a simple one click and watch fight (well the summons are) you have to hit the action button at the right time to perform a timed attack just like in the old Mario RPG game, and all the RPG Mario games since. The boss battles are a bit more ridiculous and even involve a bit of problem solving. Each boss tends to have a weakness, usually one of the summon stickers. For instance one will become much weaker if you use the bat on it. Sadly I never had those stickers for those fights and i end up using a lot of my battle stickers to win, but I found it to be a lot of fun. Lastly, the main point of the game is not only to collect stickers, but coins as well. With coins you can buy more stickers and summon stickers, and it gives you access to the battle spinner in combat. The battle spinner gives you a chance to use more than one sticker in a turn letting you combo certain ones together. It's expensive but a lot of fun. I ended up spending all my money to kill a boss cause I messed up big time. But I killed him!All in all I think it's a fun game, the humor is silly and all paper themed, but in a good way. I like that they are aware that they are paper and don't really question it. If you are however looking for a good RPG... this isn't it. In fact I wouldn't even call it an RPG same as I wouldn't call Zelda an RPG. It's more of an... Action Platformer. A great addition to the 3DS library all in all and it's even available on the e-shop.Things I Like:+Figuring out which stickers to bring and managing them is fun to me+The levels are silly but fun, as is the humor+Plenty of stickers to collect and use+Summon stickers are fun to watch+Rewarding when solving a puzzle as the game has 0 hand holdingThings I thought were meh:Not an actual RPG. I would have liked at least an Attack or Defense stat, as it stands I have to remember the damage of every item:I'm slightly worried about game length, it doesn't appear to be that long a game though I may be wrong:Sometimes the Dialogue can go on for a bit longer than needed, though not oftenThings I don't like-The loss of a battle companion is sad, i liked having a sidekick-The bosses can be unfair at times and if you didn't bring the right summon sticker than it's going to be a LOT harder, though still possible-You find out what sticker to use on the boss... after you kill it or during the fight where it's already too late-Selling Stickers takes a long time sometimes.as it stands I give the game an 8/10. it's not GOTY, but it's fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"But it was already great!","reviewText":"I grew up playing Chrono Trigger. Most of 1995 consisted of playing through it on weekends, going to a friend's house to see who he used and why, and what level his characters were, and if he'd decided to... use the item indicated by the title. Whew. Spoiler narrowly avoided there. To say that I'm a little biased towards it is an understatement; if it's not my favorite game, it has to be in my top 5.Chrono Trigger, when it was released on the SNES, featured a number of new features that set it apart from the Final Fantasy series, which were clearly the style of the day. The biggest of these was its Active Time Battles, which it borrowed from FF while making them its own. Instead of a flashy transition to battles, the characters simply whipped out their weapons and fought right where they stood. The designers took this idea a step further, and had proximity and enemy orientation affect certain attacks. All this contributed to a game that plays similarly to Final Fantasy, but feels entirely different. I was a bit disappointed when the excellent sequel, Chrono Cross, didn't carry over these features. If there's ever a 3rd Chrono game, I hope they bring this style of fighting back.Chrono Trigger also boasted a robust anime-style art design with detailed character animations and environments. Simply put, the game looked amazing when it came out and still impresses today. Since the game was a demonstration of the power of its art design instead of simply a technical exercise, its virtues still shine through.If you've never played Chrono Trigger, what you'll need to know is the following; You are Crono, a mute hero living in the small Medina kingdom in the year 1000 AD. The Millennium Festival has just started. You enter it to find a mysterious and beautiful young lady, who asks you to escort her around. Your friend Lucca has prepared a presentation of her new machine which transports matter from one place to another. Your new ladyfriend pops into one of the pods... and disappears into a time portal.Chrono Trigger's triumph, as the name implies, is its integration of time travel into both the narrative and the gameplay. Your actions in the past affect the present, and future, and not just in terms of the plot. Certain areas will change based on your actions in the past, and some chests will contain better items if opened in the future. A memorable side-quest involves an item called the Sun Stone, which must be left in direct sunlight for millions of years in order to get back its power. Certain sequences in the game are just plain clever, as a trial in which previously mundane actions become important to the verdict.I could name others; the redemption of Frog, the encounter with Magus, the revelation in the far future, the unexpected death, the decision to trust a once hated enemy or kill them forever. Even thinking of these, they still contain genuine impact. The writing of Chrono Trigger was above the bar for its time, and is better than many modern JRPGs. The characters shine, and there's an unexpectedly philosophical conversation late in the game (during one of its many sub-quests, no less) that teeters on the edge of meta-humor but never falls off.And don't forget about New Game Plus, the single best reason ever to replay an RPG; once you've completed Chrono Trigger, you can play back through it with all the items and levels from a previous save; this also allows you to complete the game by fighting the final boss at any time, thus leading to a slew of different endings.I'm gushing. People who have played the game will find ample reason to come back; the re-translation makes the game more consistent and re-tooling of some of the underlying programming has corrected some of its balance issues, though it is still a little on the easy side for its era. The extras this time around include the ones from the Playstation remake, as well as 2 extra dungeons, both worth the trip. The only minor quibble I have is that these aren't as difficult as the ones in the Final Fantasy remakes for the Game Boy Advance. Of course, those were punishing to say the very least, so maybe it's okay.Chrono Trigger is a classic, no two ways about it, and if you haven't played it, you owe it to yourself to pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2011"}

It is simply fun to play! And best of all? No controller to wave around, no weight-limit having board to stand on, just you having the time of your life!I have a Wii and from the git-go I was not impressed... Wii sports was lacking anything really fun, as bowling is the most popular in my home, as I'm sure many others. Wii fit is a joke!!! If you are very overweight like myself you can't use it! How am I to get in shape when all I can do is watch my family use the damn thing? The motion controller all but ruined Metroid Prime Trilogy for me as pointing at the screen constantly gets really old really quick! The only thing I keep my Wii around for is New Super Mario Bros.

I do plan to get Donkey Kong Country Returns, but again it uses the motion control very sparingly.Now I don't have a PS3 but Move looks like the exact same technology as the Wii with MAYBE a few MINOR upgrades. Although the PS3 has a camera which eliminates the stupid balance board so bonus points there, but all in all it's the same point and shake controller scheme that the Wii has had for a few years now.Microsoft has dared to think outside the box (or controller) on this and my current and future gaming thanks them!

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"D. Ferrari","summary":"A clone?  Yes, but a good clone.","reviewText":"Let's state the obvious here and move on.  It has been well documented and beaten to death that this is a God of War clone.  I'll take it a step further and say that yes this is essentially God of War with different graphics, and replace Greek Mythology with Christian Mythology.  I say \"So What?\"  This isn't the first GoW clone but it is the first good one.I just finished this game last night, and I was surprised at how good it really is.  Is it an amazing, earth shattering, monumental game achievement?  Not at all.  What it is is a really well polished, smooth, fun, button masher.  If you are the type who will dismiss a game because it is similar to another game then I honestly pity you because you'll miss out on this.Honestly, the story was a gimme, but really bears very little resemblance to the original work.  And yes it is God of War with new graphics and new mythology.  I give them credit however, for obviously putting in the time and effort to make a game that is graphically amazing, glitch free and very little if any load times at all.  What really sets this apart from God of War though is the ability to either absolve, or punish your enemies and in doing so you level up your holy or unholy powers.  This allows you to upgrade either your cross (holy) attacks or your scythe (unholy) attacks.Also some of the imagery is truly disturbing.  The souls of unbaptized babies are pretty gruesome.  At the first encounter you wonder what to do.  I honestly waited until they actually attacked me because I thought maybe I was there to save them or something.  I couldn't bring myself to punish them any baby I encountered was absolved.All in all Dante's Inferno is a well polished fun hack -n- slasher.  If you are a 360 only owner like me, it really is a must have.  If you own a PS3 or both, it's really your call with GoW 3 coming out soon.  I'd say it is at least worth a rental to play through the story (takes approx 9-11 hours).  There's no real replay value to it at all until April when they release the multi-player which looks killer.  The only question I have at this point is if the sequel will be called Inferno 2 or hopefully Purgatorio as would follow the Divine Comedy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003ZHMMEM","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Back to the jungle","reviewText":"If you owned an SNES consoles back in the 1990s chances are you'll remember the Donkey  Kong Country games (1-2-3) and look back fondly on them. Skip forward to 2010 Donkey Kong Country Returns is released for the Wii. I'm quite happy to say that the game developers Retro Studios did an excellent job with this old beloved series, often when a new game of an old series comes out it is not like the classic games and fans are disappointed. This is not the case; DK Country is back in all its glory and the game is close the SNES ones and is a really fun one. Things have not changed much since the original, except this time around you play as Donkey and Diddy (Donkey Kong is stronger and Diddy is faster and can fly for a short period of time with his jet pack, Diddy can also hop on DK's back)at the same time meaning you don't tag anymore. This is likely due to success of fully multiplayer games like Super Mario Bros Wii where you play the story with multiple players. I find this co-op gameplay fun, it's a simple yet very good addition to the series and on the Wii it will be beneficial as multiplayer is possibly the Wii's strongest point.Retro studios captured the feel of the DC series with the look and the music; it's faithful to the series. One thing I noticed is that the difficulty has increased, not necessarily a bad thing (and hardcore gamer will probably approve of this) but it's definitely noticeable. I find this one harder than 1-2-3 but it's not really a problem. I must say that I was a little disappointed that you don't get to fight King K Rool and that you now fight tikis (a la Crash Bandicoot as other reviewers have pointed out) instead of kremlings but it doesn't take away that this is a great and fun game. It's great that they kept the K-O-N-G letters, the puzzle pieces, barrels, vines, the mine cart levels (of which there are many) and more. These elements were a big part of the Donkey Kong Country series. The collectibles you earned can be exchanged for helpful items at the shop. As for the game's controls you have the option to play with the Wiimote and the nunchuk or with the Wiimote tilted on the side for classic controls. Personally I prefer the classic controls but playing with both controllers is fun too.If you ever were a fan of the Donkey Kong Country series for the SNES then you will probably enjoy this one as well, I don't see why you wouldn't. There really isn't much to criticize about the game it was very well done and should please the fans just like it pleased me. This game could also be recommended for someone who enjoyed Super Mario Bros Wii, it's similar in the sense that it's a good 2D side scrolling adventure -except with DK of course! If you're just looking for another fun Wii game that you can enjoy with friends and family this is a great addition to a Wii library.

The game felt more like an extension of the previous game, rather than a sequel.  As a result, problems from the first game are back in the second one.  For instance, the graphics still suffer from occasional clipping.  The enemy A.I. is schizophrenic.  On one level, an enemy guard noticed my footprints in the dirt and started following them.  For fun, I decided to move around and around in a tight circle and the guard was with me every step of the way.  It was comical to see, but not very realistic.  Aiming is horrible.  I still don't know why it takes five shots to take out a light.  The same goes for headshots.  The voice acting is atrocious.  Michael Ironide as Sam Fisher and Dennis Haysbert from &quot;24&quot; are serviceable, but when South American and Israeli enemies speak in perfect English, it makes you scratch your head.  There's also nothing new in the selection of weapons.  Sam Fisher can now whistle to distract enemies, but that's about it.  Granted, SC2 is still a good game.  The CG movies are fantastic.  The lighting is photo-realistic and the story is refreshingly complex, albeit a little hard to follow.  Still, the game feels more like an expansion pack than a true sequel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2004"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone. Hunt together with up to 4 players online or take on arena quests with 2-player split-screen action. In single player mode, you even have the ability to hunt with AI-controlled characters named ChaCha.Communicate Online- Because communication is key in coordinated huntsMonster Hunter Trisupports Wii Speak and text chat.Monsters with Unique Abilities and Attacks- Monsters have unique and dynamic personalities, abilities and defenses, increasing in complexity as the player progresses. They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Incredibly deep, satisfing, and difficult","reviewText":"Monster Hunter is a franchise of limited popularity in the Western world, it demands a great deal of time, perseverance, and devotion. Ill say this right off the bat, Monster Hunter tri is an incredible game, but beware, it is not a game for folks that want to play for a few minutes then leave. It has an incredibly difficult learning curve (but much less so than previous MH titles), and its that difficulty that makes MH3 so rewarding and frustrating at the same time.For the first few hours, gamers won't find much in terms of action and adventure. MH3 is a VERY deep game, it has strategies with branching strategies that can only be achieved by using OTHER strategies. The first few hours will be spent going through text box after text box, collecting remedial items, and learning the aforementioned strategies. This game is as complex as they come, and i will openly refuse to recommend it to those who want a simple type of fun, as this game will not deliver it.After the initial slosh through the long tutorial (which is cleverly disguised in a plan story mode), you'll be set out into the world to fight monsters, collect bounties, and simply harvest necessary items. Eventually you gain the ability to create your own armor and weapons based from the items you've collected. Defeating monsters grants you the ability to \"carve\" them, IE collect items from the monster. Items are unique to specific monsters, and several are necessary to complete a piece of armor/weapon. Its a chore at times, but the brilliant system replaces the archaic leveling up of ancient RPGs. As you progress in the game, you'll gain access to new lands, deadly monsters, and different items, all of which can be used to build newer, stronger weapons/armor.Everything you build has a distinct appearance or similarity to the monster it originated from. Much more than color is used to identify a weapon/armor to its original monster. Physical traits, edges, fangs, textures, and in game attributes are all often used to bring a weapon together with its original source. For example, a monster has a heavy poison attack, the weapon created from its materials will have its own poison attacks, or the armor may be resistant to poisonous attacks.It the weapon/armor crafting/upgrading system that grants MH3 such an addictive quality. As soon as you find a new monster, you start to wonder how its weapon will look or handle, or how the armor will be. Although it takes a long time to amass the required materials or money to craft a certain weapon, the ending feels so worth it.There are several \"large monsters\" (18 in total), each with its own style, attack patterns, weaknesses, strengths, materials, and appearance. Since each one is unique and different, and there are so many different monsters, it hard to get bored.Which brings me to my next topic, the actual battle system. The core combat in MH3 is very much like a simple 3D brawler. There is no camera lock on, several combos, full camera control, and dodging. A good deal of criticism directed toward this game was about the camera system. At first it was difficult and frustrating to use and handle, since constant movement of the camera was necessary to fight and kill a monster.  After practice, the game rubs off on you, and you begin to handle the camera before certain events, such as evading or running away. Items are an absolute must, since the enemies are strong, and have much, much more hit points than any warrior. Items to raise attack/def, health, stamina, efficiency, and weapon sharpness (after repeated use, a blade weapon looses sharpness and deals less damage). Most of these items can be made by combining materials found in worlds, others can be bought, or other given to you.Monster Hunter Tri has some of the very best graphics and art design found on Wii. It's right up there with Red Steel 2, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, and Dead Space Extraction in terms of graphical fidelity. Everything from character models to armor and monsters is incredibly detailed (so much so that some of the details are \"clustered\" together in the Wii's limited 480p presentation), locations are beautifully redendered, designed, and animated in such as way that each area  is it own unique and living world. Monsters are given an incredible amount of polish, from design to animation as well.Monster Hunter Tri is one of the few MH games to include online play, and Capcom has done an incredible job with the online infrastructure in the game. Like everything else about it, Monster Hunter Tri has a complex online system that links servers to lobbies to \"cities\" of only 4 players.  After the hard learning curve, youll find buddies, shops, exclusive quests, and items that can only be gained in the online mode. Players can join and play with any group of people without friend codes, gameplay is almost always lag free, and keyboard and WiiSpeak chat is included. To use the keyboard, the game provides a simple on screen variation if you don't have a USB keyboard; otherwise it's as easy as typing and posting. To use WiiSpeak, at least 2 people must have the devise, and have it enabled, and then each must be a \"friend\". Keep in mind this is not Nintendo's infamous \"friend codes\", instead its merely sending a friend request, and having the recipient accept it.--------On Wii Speak--------Having played Monster Hunter Tri online, ive found (on several occasions) that those using WiiSpeak MUST turn down music and SFX volume in order to use it effectivly. See, the music/SFX are easily consumed by the \"echo cycle\" described below, so turning down the in-game volume yields great results. If BOTH parties have said settings, WiiSpeak works well enough. The voice quality is still low, there is still the second lag, and you still can't communicate with more than 1 person at a time without your voice turning into a confusion of random bable, but it works.The microphone is intended to receive the voices of several people, and in that effect it attempts to receive a wide range of noises, including those from your TV speakers. What this does is create long echoes. Noise sent from one Wii Speak is received by the other, is produced by the others TV set, and is received by Wii Speak 2 and set back to Wii Speak 1. This vicious cycle never ends.-----------------Monster Hunter Tri is a difficult game, one that takes a great length of time to understand, and an even greater time to master. It's a game that demands time, attention, and focus; casual gamers beware, this is NOT a pick up and play title. It is, however, very satisfying to spend hours to forge a weapon, or finally defeat a monster after an hour long battle. Despite its faults, it manages to go on beyond its pieces and become a masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

With so much hype, I got S2 Day-One as I had never played the original. To be honest, I thought it was slightly above mediocre. I had more fun with the single player than playing competitive multiplayer.The graphics are nice, menus are slick, and the three classes are very distinct and balanced. There's no one obviously 'better' class, which is something I cannot say for just about every game out there. Overall, the game feels polished. The menus and game have been updated for added intuitiveness. Despite this, I just couldn't play it for long hours. There was just no 'hook' for me to get sucked in and want to learn all the strengths and weaknesses of all the units, etc.The DRM with Blizzard games really don't bother me. The games have such a good community surrounding them that I think I may even prefer it. I can log in anywhere that has the game downloaded and play my account.For less than $40, I think it is well worth a try. RTSs and this game in general has a very wide demographic.

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"VG Fan","summary":"Great Game getting way too much criticism","reviewText":"People are giving this game way too hard a time.  It's a fantastic game that is very well done and very fun.  The only really big issue with it is that you have to always be online to play.  This is lame, and it's why I took off a star, but if you don't care about that then it's definitely a 5 star game.Some of the complaints I'm seeing don't make any sense, particularly the complaint that it's only 1/3 a game.  It's not 1/3 of a game!  It's 29 complete missions and an entire epic story.  That's close to the same number of missions as in the original SC (I don't remember the exact number), and SC2 has lots of extras, like upgrades, more cut scenes, and more.  There are even 9 special challenge missions you can along with the campaign.  In addition, there are lots of achievements in the campaign and in the challenges that are well thought out and entertaining to try and achieve.  You could probably spend months on the single player part of this game if you tried to go through on all the difficulty levels and work on the achievements and challenge missions.The multiplayer matchmaking and leagues are a ton of fun--you generally get matched with people around your skill level, which I enjoy quite a bit.  I played the heck out of the multiplayer for months and had a blast.  Everything is done first class, just as you'd expect from Blizzard.  I really can't think of any complaints.In every way except the DRM, this game has the same high level of quality as all of Blizzards games, and I've owned every one since Warcraft 1.  It's probably the best 3 star product on all of amazon.  Unless you aren't buying it because of a moral objection to the DRM--which I can totally understand--you should do yourself a favor and pick this one up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"J.

{"product_name":"B00002STFD","reviewerName":"Patrick L. Randall","summary":"Solid addition to Nintendo's Star Wars empire.","reviewText":"\"Shadows of the Empire\" was one of the debut games for the Nintendo 64 system, and it was a quite a debut.  Capitalizing on the huge popularity of the Star Wars series of novels, LucasArts took one of the more popular books, \"Shadows of the Empire\", and created a video game based on it.  \"Shadows...\" starts off with the Hoth snow battle where you use one of the speeders to take out probe droids, AT-STs, and AT-ATs.  From there, you play as mercenary Dash Rendar, whose job it is to assist Luke and Leia in the capturing of a super computer that contains details of the next Death Star and to battle the Black Sun crime syndicate.  The varying locales of each and methods of gameplay for each board allow for a diverse, entertaining experience.  There are space battles, battles aboard moving trains, and numerous battles on foot help increase the intensity of the gameplay.  One of the best boards comes late in the game and involves a mission to infiltrate and destroy Prince Xizor's (the head of Black Sun) palace.  The music effects are the best this side of the original trilogy soundtrack and graphics create a haunting environment of a castle that is very dark, almost fog-laden, and very forbidding to proceed through.Of course, there are a few flaws in this game as well.  It's very clear that Nintendo was still trying to realize the full graphic potential of the N64.  Several of the background images, and even some of the foreground gameplay, resemble that of Super NES games.  The background is flat and the pixelization is frequently choppy.  Nintendo would get it right not too much later, though, with the release of the spectacular \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\".All that being said, \"Shadows...\" is a fun game to play.  Even despite lacking 'gold medal goals' like \"Rogue Squadron\" has to help increase replayability, it still remains fun to go back and play even after beating it numerous times.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"One of the Best Platformers.

I think it is more fun than this year's poorly made BF4 and COD Ghosts.  But two features make the game tedious and detract from its fast-paced gameplay: (1) collectibles, (2) looting.(1) You collect TV sets, VHS tapes, and notes that unlock weapon upgrades.  There are about 100 collectibles and it is very tedious collect them.(2) To get credits and cyber hearts from killed enemies, you have to look down at their bodies and press a button.  Upgrades cost a lot of money and each enemy yields only a small amount of credits, so you kinda have to loot each enemy which gets very,very tedious.I hope they will make a sequel.  If they do, I hope they make looting easier and eliminate collectibles (or at least make them completely optional).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2014"}

You should probably bump up the difficulty one notch from the default while playing with Move after you get use to the controls because it becomes a bit easier game.  Sound effects and graphics are great and gameplay is fun.  I would rank this game better than Crysis 2 and Halo:ODST in terms of fun and about tied with Halo Reach.

Newcomers can enjoy the game as well as it is not strictly required to have played the ones before to get into the story presented in this one now starring Edward Kenway.As hinted before, 'Black Flag' surpasses its predecessor in many ways: the score is really great, it is visually superior and the naval battles (one of the features introduced in the previous entry) have been improved and expanded (as a side quest it is quite entertaining to attack and loot other ships in order to upgrade your ship, the Jackdaw) The ability to hunt sharks and whales in the underwater missions is also quite fun.While it took me a little about 10+ hours to complete the main quest, I have invested a fair amount of time in side missions, after playing it for an additional 15+ hours, I am currently at 50% of completion, so if you think the game is short with only 10 hours of gameplay think again, the side missions offer a large variety of tasks and are really quite entertaining to play, the thing I find the most entertaining is the naval battles and upgrading the ship, they really did a great job with those.I have to admit |I had a lot of problems getting into the AC universe as I found the first game to be repetitive and longer than it should have been, fortunately, this has changed as the saga has progressed and the gameplay has been improved with every release. 'Black Flag' has to be one of the finest entries in the saga and I can't recommend it enough.If you have never played AC and enjoy open world games I strongly suggest you give this one a try, you will not be disappointed. On top of all this, the PS3 includes the option to purchase the PS4 version at $9.99, I have yet to download it but I can't wait to see how this looks in the next-gen console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2013"}

After first playing the game, you realize just how big the environment is, how many interiors you can go into, and just how FUN swinging around the Big Apple is. The game goes downhill from there.The graphics are pretty good. The city looks fantastic, the interiors are great, and Spider-Man is well modeled. But, when looking at every other character model, you want to cringe and cover your eyes. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst should sue this game. Tobey looks like a goofy nerd straight from The Simpsons, and Kirsten looks like she would be right at home with Charlie Brown. Don't get me started on the pedestrions. Their lips don't even move. Also, they will say to Spider-Man that a police chase or someone is falling THAT WAY, but they don't point anywhere. Is that wierd?Now I will start on the so-called music. The Spider-Man theme is pathetic, and some unknown but ungodly terrible band called The Distillers provide the rest of the music. It sounds like Mario games with electronic punk rock. Not too good. Also the voice acting is lazy. Alfred Modina is funny, not menacing, and Tobey maguire must have had a microphone stuck to him while he was still in bed at four in the morning, because he sounds asleep. Also, Mary jane from the game does not sound like Mary Jane from the movie. And the little kid who loses his balloon? You might want to put your fist in his face after hearing him cry a few hundred times.The gameplay is great. Swinging is easy, and every other spider-man move is easy to execute. There are just too many combos to rember, and they are complex to pull off, so that bothers me. Also, it can be hard to go where you want to.The story mode will take a good chunk of time to complete, and after that, you can explore the city for awhile. Warning: This game WILL GET DULL after playing it for twenty or so hours. I'm a bit bored, and I have had the game for two days. it would have helped if there were more missions, and more street crimes to solve. There are around eight simple problems that you can solve in your spare time, and I don't think that the same eight crime happen in New York City every day.I was ecstatic that this game took place in New York, because it is my favorite city in the world. I was excited to see Times Square, The Empire State Building, and The Statue of Liberty. Aside from that, swinging is very exciting, and going on top of the skyscrapers is too. Spider-Man 2 is a game that you will have a tought time deciding to rent or buy. Bottom Line: If you LOVE Spider-Man and/or New York City, you should buy this game. Any other gamers, this game merits a wonderful rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2004"}
{"product_name":"B009S4JTTC","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Half and Half","reviewText":"Ratchet & Clank:  Full Frontal Assault is really only half a Ratchet and Clank title.  You wander through maps doing your typical platform-and-gadget-hunt gameplay, but this time those bolts you collect are all towards the other half of the game:  a Tower Defense title that has you buying fortifications for a base.  Your base has generators that must be protected (or repaired when damaged), and while this really means Full Frontal Assault isn't a full Ratchet & Clank title, the integration of the two halves of the game is fairly seamless.  At points in the map you do simple quicktime games to unlock weapon upgrade choices.  As you wander the level looking for these points, you periodically hear the alarms of a Tower Defense styled wave, and it's back to the base to defend it.  Further achievements can be had on replay, such as finishing the level with all generators intact or finishing below a time limit.  A nice touch is that you no longer buy ammo:  you simply collect it from various spots on the map that will refresh themselves after a certain amount of time...and they give you a visual way to see how long it's going to take to recharge.  People who struggle with platformers will have a much easier time:  Ratchet zips around on rocket boots and can slow his fall and better aim his landings using these.Because you never leave the platformer perspective, Full Frontal Assault turns the Tower Defense mechanic on its ear:  you can wade in amongst the waves of attackers and deal damage, or dash around to pick up more ammo, repair damaged generators, or take on the more powerful attackers that require some skill.  As you play you earn Medals, and these promote you and give you bonuses to your skills.  As you use your weapons, they also gain levels and get better at what they do (an idea introduced in Going Commando).  As with other Ratchet and Clank games, you'll spend time being some of the other characters.One really great feature is, sadly, half-baked:  Cross Play is the idea that if you buy this for the PS3, you can also download it on the Vita.  That part is not finished and has been delayed to early 2013.  The good news is, as an apology Insomniac are going to make their first DLC for the game free to everyone who owns Full Frontal Assault.If you like Ratchet and Clank, you'll be a bit disappointed that Full Frontal Assault is only half a platformer.  However, given that this is thr 10th anniversary of the series and there are so many good Ratchet and Clank titles that come before this, I suggest you give it a try--if only for something fun and different.  I love tower defense games so the other half of Full Frontal Assault will be plenty entertaining for me until we get the next full title in the series (wonder if it'll be for the PlayStation 4?).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2012"}

God of War 3 is easily my favorite game since Halo 3 (just as the GOW series itself is my favorite series since Halo).  I just couldn't put it down and spent an entire weekend after getting the game playing it until I beat it - and I'm not usually that enamored with a game to spend my entire waking existence playing it.  It took me about 13 hours to finish it, which I guess seems to be about average.  The first big boss battle truly set the tone for the rest of the game and continues to be one of the most awe-inspiring openers I've ever seen in a game.  The game didn't stop from there.  Big boss battles are everywhere (I was amazed at how many parts were in killing Hades, but it was truly fun despite how long it takes to finally whittle him down), which is partly why the God of War series has been so successful - they're truly jaw dropping!  Being as I'd never played God of War 1 or 2 before (I'd only seen in-game movies and cutscenes), and having recently finished God of War 2, I must agree with some reviewers that the story isn't nearly as deep or telling as God of War 2's.  Musically, although I own the soundtrack, it's up to par with the amazing soundtracks of its predecessors, but I still feel GOW2's score is superior.  I also found the flying scenes to be more than a little annoying as there seems to be absolutely no rhyme or reason in terms of trying to navigate through them without hitting something (I think it's impossible), and I died many times before I finally made it through by sheer luck with enough health meter left (there's just no way flying that fast with the amount of beams and whatnot in the way that you can avoid them or fit through the small crevice you need to in time).  Puzzles can be annoying, especially when you have to do something with the clock ticking (it takes a few tries), but nothing was as time-consuming puzzle-wise here as some of the puzzles in God of War 2.  Graphically, God of War 3 takes the top, of course, as detailed in the big boss battles.  Overall, God of War 3 is one of the main reasons a PS3er should buy games (or one of the top games for anyone considering getting a PS3 in the first place).  Despite its very minor flaws (notably lack of deeper story and cool, albeit at times annoying flying scenes), God of War 3 is a resounding success through and through, a testament to everything today's action video games should be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2010"}

There are enough reviews for me to skip the details so I'll stick to my own gameplay experience.I find the leash you use to grab enemies and draw them in to be effective, well implemented and generally fun.  It slows them in mid-air to set up skillshots and aim them for environmental kills.  The skillshots are many and some are easy to pull off while others demand precision or require certain conditions like something to impale an enemy on or getting two or more lined up to take out at once.There are unique weapons like the flail gun and drill that add variety to the gameplay, and each weapon can eventually have a charge shot added to it that does something different than the normal blast, such as the pistol having a flare shot that sets an enemy ablaze or sniper bullets that can be detonated on command once you have guided one into a target, allowing you to blow up him and any nearby enemies all at once, with all multi-enemy kills giving point bonuses.  When you fire the sniper rifle, you get a behind the camera view of the bullet in flight and control its path with the right stick, meaning you can even hit enemies hiding behind cover.There's a decent level of variety in the enemies, and the stages also change up just enough to allow numerous types of environmental kills.  Since creative kills yield more points to buy ammo and charge shots, all your sadism feels like it has a purpose.  Without giving anything away, there are some good boss fights, which is very rare for a FPS.  There's a ton of cursing, some of which involves phrases that don't even make sense, which even your character pokes fun at once.  While I don't find it adds to the game, it's not so blatant as to get on my nerves.Online frag-fests bore me to tears so I can't speak to the online experience.I'm a gamer who rips on most FPS's for all being the same, but there's definitely enough originality to justify picking this one up, especially now that the price has dropped.  I've experienced no bugs and the whole experience is polished and fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"A must buy for PS2 owners","reviewText":"I highly recommend buying these memory cards. While most people would like to think that \"more space equals better\", keep in mind that Sony only makes 8mb and 16mb cards; anything else is third party and will cause reading issues or the inability to save first party games. With this memory card, it does exactly as you'd expect it to. Which would be saving games; and it's a reliable accessory.I won't go in depth with a review being that these cards are the best option for saving PS2 games even if you need to buy a few extra. The best part about it is they're priced alot better than Gamestop or your average video game store. (I purchased mine at under 5 dollars)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

They aren't stored even though you can store tons of huge items. Once you pick it up, it's used. They're pointless anyway because my health meter never changed once even though I found 2 health drinks in a row.Weapons - Yeah they break.

{"product_name":"B002I0K7ZI","description":"","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"Demo showed off best part of the game: the fights","reviewText":"I have played almost every Move game and Kinect game and wanted to break down the best and the worst. This game was first a demo  which I replayed and finished 4 times while really looking forward to my pre-order. The Wii version was one of my favorite Wii games of all time, so I was sure I was going to give this a 5 star rating (I already rated the Wii version with 5 stars). The problems begin with the little side quests. In the Wii version, you'd play knock off games of the Atari 2600. The games had a real retro flare, and were FUN. In the PS3 version, you drive around on a motorcycle which can be infuriating at times, especially when you drive into a tree (light pole). If you drive into a tree with the Move controller, you'd have to either use the Sixaxis controller to back up or just get off the bike. The Move controller didn't allow you to back up if you ran into a tree for some reason, although allowed you to back up otherwise by hitting the trigger button. So, you'd end up running for a while, and then you'd call for your bike again. The side quests all related to some kind of tropical environment. Collecting coconuts was fun with the Wii version, but this side quest on the PS3 was just weird. Mowing the grass was weird because I couldn't figure out the controls (although in the end, I always earned a lot of money :)). Some of the side quests were fighting related, but required you didn't get hit once. If you do, the challenge ends, and you can restart or just leave.The bosses were fun. I especially liked Electroman, and took me a while to figure out how to beat him. I let my friend borrow this when PSN was down and he said he didn't like it at all. The weird thing also is that this game was 10 dollars cheaper as a pre-release than it is now. The trade-in value is also low, so take that into consideration.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

The first time I played the game, the typical \"gamer\" in me came out. The goal, to get from beginning to end, while trying to take in some sights along the way. After I completed the game, I got it. It hit me what the point was of the game, and I restarted my Journey again the next night. I spent more time looking around, and found little hidden symbols along the way. Then suddenly someone showed up in the game with me. You can't talk, or type in the game. They are just there. You can chose to run around together or not. These other people just drift in and out in the game, all on their own journey. After I completed the game a second time, I had spent longer enjoying the amazing music and the astonishing visuals through the game. I put it away and didn't play for a while.Then some time later, I learned there was such thing as players called \"white cloaks\". I wanted to see one, so I went again into the game and meandered around online. I met one who was on their journey, and decided to play through the game with them. We had so much fun working together. We had no way to communicate, we just had to use our intuition. We completed the game together, and it was almost a shocking moment for me. This game and it's meaning are so much deeper than one can understand on the first play through. The older you are, the more the meaning of this game will touch you.After working for a while, I finally found all the hidden symbols in the game, and became a white cloak as well. My red garment turns white when I play, and my scarf regenerates itself, letting me fly for longer periods of time. While the game itself is short, it's got enough content for several play throughs. There is an incredibly deep meaning to the Journey, it's what the journey stands for. It's who you meet along the way, and your choices of whether to go alone, or take the journey with someone else. You can't \"die\" in the game as others have mentioned, but that's because it would defeat the meaning of the game. I agree with what others have said. Play this game alone (not offline, just alone at your home without distractions of other people around), on the best TV you have, with the best sound and in a dark room or in the evening. You will get the best visuals from the game, and have a better environment for contemplating the full meaning of the game.

Your expense is currently about 2.50USD/minute in the US, check EA's support page for your rate if you don't live in the US. Say you sit on hold and get the call done in ten minutes. There goes another 2.50USD to play a game you supposedly already own!What is an activation? Install the game, that's an activation. Change a piece of hardware, that uses an activation. Reinstall Windows without changing any hardware, that uses up an activation. You might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver. Adding a USB peripheral device could use up an activation. You get 5 of these, then the game ceases to function and you'll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy (not call them for more activations as it should say).SecuROM has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to CD/DVD drive incompatibility problems (usually older drives). You will typically get CRC or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive. SecuROM also maintain a \"black list\" of processes where it won't allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or running.SecuROM is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasn't had much impact on piracy at all.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Skitz","summary":"I've Never Been So Afraid Of The Dark","reviewText":"I honestly thought this would have been the usual scenario. People complain, but the game's actually good. Well, not this time. At least, not when the sun sets. I'm upset at this game. It could've been a lot better than what it was. When I popped the game in it blew my mind at first. Stunning visuals, and I do mean STUNNING. Great voice acting, nice music, the story seemed really cool, the controls were feeling good (using my NGC controller). Everything was great. Then came the night stage. I thought I was gonna like it, and everyone was overreacting, but I wrong. So so so wrong. It hurts just playing one of those night stages. The controls that were great suddenly suck tremendously, the music that was vibrant turns into fantasy golf Pangya music, and the stage overall is so boring that the night time look and golf music put me to sleep.Not only that, the day stages which were amazing finished so quickly, but the night stages are so darn drawn out and long. And for NO reason! It's just platforming but at its worst, with no substance to it. Mindless lame action with repetitive enemies, attacks, and scenarios. It's too terrible to put into words. This is the worst sonic game on the Wii in my opinion. Too much non-sonic material make up this game. I'm glad I didn't pay for it myself either, I'd have shot myself in the face. It really sucks cuz my first sonic game on the Wii was Colors, and you KNOW how good that game is. This just threw everything off the table for me. It's lucky I even gave it 3 stars. It's like too completely different groups made this game. Some awesome hide speed-fun loving know-how guys made the day stages, and some band of depressed sour party poopers made the night stages.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

Its multiplayer, however, is only partially up to snuff.In the one player mode, you have several different difficulties, just like in the original. When you play on the lower modes like Agent, you have fewer objectives and I'd imagine that the enemies shoot a little slower or something. And on 007 Classic Mode, you have to make use of body armor to protect your health, again like the N64 game (although there aren't any health packs).There are two ways to progress through Goldeneye: 1) Sneak around. 2) Blow everyone to kingdom come. Option 2 ultimately results in a Call of Duty clone, and that's no fun. I really enjoyed the stealth elements of this campaign. It's very easy to get into the scenario, asking yourself questions like, \"Will I get caught if I sneak this way?\" or \"Will I able to shoot this guard, then shoot the one watching him before he calls reinforcements?\" I know that I felt nervous for old James more than a few times while playing this.There are only a couple of spots where enemies spawn infinitely, which is great because I've always hated that. You can clear the area of enemies, then roam around completing objectives at your leisure. This too is reminiscent of the original. The graphics of the campaign are good, too. They're not the best Wii has to offer, but they're certainly up there.The online multi-player of this game is where it falls a little flat. Black Ops Wii, which was released around the same time, is all kinds of better. I won't say that Goldeneye's multi-player gameplay is actually inferior, but the graphics and overall amount of options certainly are. In stark contrast to the campaign levels, the online maps are verging on N64 material. Heck, I think Perfect Dark looks a little better than this game's online mode. But even so, the maps succeed in the fun department. There are an abundance of sniper spots on these levels, and the aim assist makes killing players pretty easy.Goldeneye is the only Wii FPS with a local multiplayer of which I'm aware. There are probably others, but it's doubtful any of those can hold a candle to this one. Worthwhile to the max, yo!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"Mr. T \"Randall\"","summary":"One of the Hardest, Darkest, and Fun game on the NES","reviewText":"I have many fond memories while playing the NES Castlevania.

I like that Nintendo basically ripped off Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller, since that is one of the best controllers ever designed. The only real difference is the right analog stick is positioned higher, and the 360's controller has a crappy D-pad (they fixed that on the Xbox One controller though).I very much enjoy that this is a standalone controller. I like the old Wii's classic controller (with dual analogs), but hated that it had to be connected to a Wiimote to use. This one doesn't need to be connected to anything else, but that also explains the higher price.The sticks, buttons, and triggers all feel very nice and are comfortable to use. It depends on your game library, but there are many many games out there that I would HIGHLY recommend this over a Wiimote for. But if you mostly play single-player games, the Wii U gamepad makes for a decent controller too, so you may not need to get one of these. For multiplayer games though, don't force your family/friends/guests to use a Wiimote when there is this much better controller you could purchase instead. :)Keep an eye on the price difference between the black and white versions of this controller, they fluctuate and can vary as much as ten bucks. I personally prefer black, but honestly, I would recommend going with whichever color is cheaper at the time. I'll probably buy a second one soon. 3-4 of these will almost certainly be a necessary purchase once Mario Kart 8 and the next Smash Bros are out, so in the meantime you may want to just keep an eye on them and buy them during any sales or price drops.FYI In regards to another reviewer saying these are counterfeit: Make sure you buy these &#34;Shipped from and sold by Amazon&#34;, and you will not have this problem. Third-party vendors are a roll of the dice; I bought my controller from Amazon as the seller and certainly did receive a genuine Nintendo product.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005V6BB","description":"Medal of Honor: Frontlinemarks the debut of the Medal of Honor franchise on the PlayStation2. InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Dojo Master","summary":"Pretty good","reviewText":"The game itself is relatively simple but fun to play.I'll admit that it took me a while to get used to it and that's because the game is set in World war 2 and I'm used to more modern weapons instead of just simple handguns and the like.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

I agree that it's difficult to review this game without some knowledge or comparison to the first Mass Effect game, but my review will have an open, purely Mass Effect 2 focus. Enjoy!What I enjoyed;- The dialogue and voice is impressive and very engaging. I like the choices that you're given during conversations, allowing you to see Commander Shephard react in different ways. The voice cast is star studded with Martin Sheen, Carrie Anne-Moss, Keith David, Yvonne Strahovski, Seth Green, and many more. Everyone, I mean EVERY one in this game does a tremendous voiceover work.- Graphics are incredible and breathtaking! There is so much detail and intricacies in this game. The environments are wonderfully designed and is very immersive. Upon reaching the end of the game, I thought that I would be bored with the environments, but the Mass effect 2 team did a good job creating a variety of different maps, planets, etc. You may see many similarities, but never really redundant places.- The cast of characters and Captain Shephard's crew are likable and a joy to be around. I found myself having a lot of fun mixing and matching different characters to take with me for a mission. For missions, you may chose 2 others from your crew to accompany you. Throughout the game, you'll really get to know all the characters and dig deep into their personal stories. Not to mention, guys will have a fun time trying to win over Miranda, and ladies will enjoy getting to know the male counterparts of the crew.- RPG gameplay appeals to many different gaming tastes. Whether you're a RPG fan, First person shooter, casual gamer, this game blends so much together to create a very complete, engaging gaming experience.- I like the upgrading and leveling up aspect of the game. Sometimes, this may get mundane and repetitive, but the upgrade and research system in the game is extremely satisfying and actually makes you want to find the little weapons, money, and find everything during the missions. Sensible reward/motivation you may call it.A few drawbacks- AI is suspect. The behaviors of your crew and the enemy can be puzzling sometimes.- Levels are very open and has lots of places to explore, but can still feel linear occasionally.Overall, a very complete gaming experience with space exploration, interesting characters and development, breathtaking visuals and environments, and fun and pulse-pounding missions. You may also import your Mass effect character into this game, as well as import your mass effect 2 character into the soon to be released mass effect 3. Can't wait! Keep up the good work Bioware.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"T. Jones","summary":"Bleh","reviewText":"Alright, this is a good game for the 360. It has moments of fear, shreds of character development, and sparks of charm. What it fails at it everything else. Consider this, SH2 was one of the best games of all time, according to most reviwers, and Konami wants that same success. What to do? Why not make a game like it with a similar story?So yeah, instead of a greving husband seeking his wife, you play as an amnesiac would-be soldier who treks through his home town of Shepards Glen (Why not Silent HIll?) trying to find his little brother.SPOILER: The Character of SH2 who sought his wife knew his wife was dead yet she sent a letter telling him to go to Silent HIll. It turns out he killed his wife. Well, SAME FREAKIN' PLOT TWIST! Yeah, older brother killed little brother Josh accidently and thus ruined some hokey religous sacrifise thing done to keep Silent Hill from Silent Hill-ing the nearby town of SHepards Glen.The gameplay is fair, having a half-decent combat mode for your character. You have a dialog selection that usualy does nothing to the ending of the game, five or six people wandering the otherwise desolate town, and a brief reference to Piramid Head from SH2 (Seriously, he might as well have danced for us for all the good he did for the story). YOu would think that the game would be good right?Well, HA-HA! No... it stinks to high heaven. It just does not feel like Silent HIll. It feels like Resident Evil 5 with the lights dimmed down. THe monsters feel phoned in, the levels range from too vibrant to too dark, the game is largely linear, and the story is recycled from the second game.There are also only two or three choices made in the game to determine the ending. Before in the older games, like 2, the game measured your progress to determine your ending. DId you rescue this person? Did you get this item? Did you throw it on this person? Did you protect them from harm enough? Did you collect this widget and use it in this whatsit? Well, in Homecoming you have three choices: Kill mom or let her die, forgive dad or forsake him before he dies, or save your token black friend from death. So yeah, pointless.As a fan of Silent HIll games, I hate to see this exist. It could have been good on its own, but they stuck Silent HIll on the cover and it simply could not live up to the expectations. It rips SIlent Hill 2 story page for page, almost, and then references older games through paper articles like we are supposed to expect this game to be a masterpiece among masterpieces. Not happening.Buy this game if you are an action game fan. If you are a horror game fan, ignore this. If you are a Silent HIll fan then igore this.

{"product_name":"B002I0K956","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"PS3 on the MOVE","reviewText":"MOVE VS. OTHERS :)Ever since the launch of Slim, the PS3 has been undertaking a quiet revolution or... could it be the console's midlife crisis? :) Here's what happened recently - and I will only note the more important developments going 12 months back (writing this in Oct., 2010):- NetFLIX streaming, now disc-less, 1080p, 5.1 surround sound- Much larger disc (this one is triple the size of the original Slim)- Move- 3D gaming- Blu-ray 3DThis is a lot of new 'stuff' for a 4 year old console. I am not going to go into bean-counting mode and compare the PS3 improvements with what we see at the other guys but, clearly there is a lot of life in the PS3 and a lot of what the PS3 has to offer today - 3D gaming, Blu-ray 3D - either cannot be duplicated or is unlikely to be implemented by other consoles of this generation.WHAT YOU GET, WHAT YOU MAY NEEDBriefly, this is what you get in with this bundle and I will make it very short because there's a lot of info. at the Amazon page:- PS3 Slim with...* 320GB HDD - as far as I know, the largest hard disk a console has ever had. You CAN upgrade it to a 500GB if you want but 320GB should probably be enough. See PS3 Slim reviews for details and features* Move controller, of course* PlayStation Eye camera (must have for the Move to work)* Sports Champions (Ping Pong is simply awesome, some of the games play much better with a second controller)* A demo disc so you can see what Move can do for you (most of the demos can be downloaded from the PSN)- DualShock 3 controller (rumble, motion sensitive)- ONE USB wire mostly to charge the controllersI marked with asterisks the items that come with the bundle are not included in the Slim 160GB package.Depending on how you are planning to use the PS3, this is what you don't get but may end up buying eventually:- HDMI cable for HD output (a component cable should work too but you can get a decent HDMI for $3-5 or so)- One or more extra USB wires same as above, don't pay more than $2-3 for one- One more Move Controller (some games will either require two controllers or will play better with two)- One or two Navigation Controllers (you can use the DualShock in your left hand but it feels weird)- Dedicated charger, especially if you have more than one Move controller or you also have a Navigation controller- PS3 TV remote controller to use when watching moviesTO BUNDLE OR NOT TO BUNDLEWe got the bundle because we really needed a fresh console but, it turns out, if you already have a PlayStation 3 Eye camera all you need is the stand-alone Move controller to be able to play Move games. If you don't have the Eye then it's going to cost a little more but the general idea is that it's possible to ease yourself into the Move universe and possibly stop if you feel that the Move is not for you. However, if you get yourself hooked, the odds are that you are going to spend A LOT on extras, eventually - see above.THE PS3 BUNDLE VS. OTHER OPTIONSAt the time I'm writing this you can get a Move-less, 160 GB PS3 for $100 less. In my view, it's probably worth buying this bundle even if you do NOT want the Move because you should be able to sell your brand-new Move controller ($49), the PS Eye ($30) and the Sports Champions ($40) game and make close to $100 in the process and you will STILL have a console with TWICE the disc capacity.MY RATINGThis bundle is probably the best PS3 deal ever - see my notes on how you could sell the Move stuff if you don't want it and still end up ahead. I've been a PS3 owner ever since the 60GB classic became available and I've been impressed with the PS3's reliability, versatility and its sheer power - and I've owned both 'classic' and 'slim' models, upgraded most, gave away a couple. In the end it's a matter of personal taste but the PS3 is increasingly the most popular 'gaming' or 'entertainment' implement in our household. And we DO own an Xbox too.I will not go through the long list of PS3's features. It would be an exaggeration to say that it does 'everything' but, in my view, it does a lot more than the competition and it's doing it increasingly well. Agreed, features and capabilities do not come for free and sometimes they don't even come cheap (see my list of possible add-ons above) but I can't say that I have the feeling of being constantly nickeled and dimed when I upgrade my PS3. I will have no choice at this time but to order the extra Move and Motion controller from Sony but the charger, the larger discs I used to upgrade my old classic, all of the cables came or will come from third party vendors and even for the old SixAxis and the remote controller there were alternatives at the time I decided to buy the Sony-made ones. In addition, the 'basic' PS3 console can take you pretty far as it is and you can have a lot of fun without having to spend one extra penny.To conclude, this bundle gets 5 stars:- for being chuck-full of 'stuff' (controllers, game, huge hard disc)- for being the most cost-effective PS3 deal at the time I am writing this (Sep. 17, 2010)- for the PS3 being the most feature-rich, well-balanced console you can get these days____________________________________________Aug. 16, 2011 Note:Quite a lot happened to the PS3 since I posted my review. A week or so ago Netflix became part of a new category named TV/Video Services with Hulu PLUS, Vudu HD Movies, NHL GameCenter Live and MLB.tv. I've had Netflix for quite a while and if Hulu adds a lot of movies show to what I'm getting from Netflix I may say goodbye to my satellite provider. Under the Music tab I can see now Qriocity. I believe there is a 6 months free trial but I'm a Pandora guy so I'm not sure I'll sign up. It's good to know it's there.Oh and... funny coincidence. I just read that Sony cut $50 of all consoles sold in the US. I paid $499 for my first 60GB PS3 back in 2007 (came with 8 or 10 Blu-ray movies so it wasn't THAT bad a deal) and it's still one of our 2 PS3. Not even a hiccup after 4 years of gaming and movie viewing.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

We knew the game had plot, but never before has a Metroid game had so much actual story, and here's the best part of it, its a darn good one too!Samus is on a survey mission when she is attacked by a parasite called X. In order to save her, the medics of the Galactic Federation genetically fuse her with Metroid DNA. The benefits of this fusion is that she can now absorb the X, the downside is that she has inherited the Metroid weakness to ice, and has to regain all of her powers, and there is an X Parasite who has decided to mimic Samus at full power (which can kill you quite quickly I might add.) The bosses in this game range from pathetic push overs to so frustrating you'll break your GameBoy Advance (which I haven't done yet because I toss it into a nearby couch pillow...) the game is not easy. Finding secrets and hidden passages in as it always has been. If you have played previous Metroid games you'll know what to do, if you haven't I highly suggest at least playing through Super Metroid first, as this story is a direct sequel to that game, and some story elements may not make sense otherwise.Graphically I am impressed. Metroid Fusion features the graphics I have been waiting to see on the GBA, a handheld loosely based on Super Nintendo technology. I have seen some SNES looking games, but this one actually surpasses is SNES predecessor, which is amazing.The music for this game is also amazingly well done, especially if you are playing with a good set of headphones! This game has both great graphics, and great music, which proves that the GBA can have the best of both worlds, unlike Castlevania Harmony of dissonance which had decent graphics, but horrid music.I highly recommend this title, but more so for the seasoned Metroid fans, or for fans of the more recent Castlevanias. The complex game play may not be for every gamer out there, especially for younger audiences. Never the less its good to see Samus back in action, with the option of a classic 2D side scrolled for those who may not be interested in the 3D Metroid on GameCube (shame on you if you're one of those few!)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

Watch Dogs has been on my must have list ever since they announced it a couple years ago, then delayed it because they said they needed more time to make the game fun, then released it recenly. If you like Grand Theft Auto games, plus enjoy the hacking aspects other games, this will be your cup of tea. Imagine a game where you basically have to use the environment to win, and this is it. Things I loved about the game were the stealth dynamics that were involved. It really reminded me of dishonored, splinter cell and thief. The world you play in is pretty much Chicago in all its glory, which is cool to see. Their are a few graphic blemishes in the game (dynamic shadows), but overall, this game looks great on the Xbox One. This game was developed before Microsoft made it not mandatory to use the Kinect, so expect the sequel to run at 1080p. The multiplayer takes this game to a next-gen level if you ask me. Its crazy seeing random real players jump into the game and cause mayhem against you and your world, very neat stuff. I knocked a star off the game because I feel they rushed it out to meet a deadline, and trimmed corners on cool things like hacking and driving.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"C. Kim","summary":"I Can EASILY stop playing FF8","reviewText":"My very first Final Fantasy experience came from FF6(or FF3 in the State), and I loved every second of it.  What I must say, must say is that Final Fantasy series does separate itself from rest of RPGs out there with the excellent graphic, skillfully done music score, and last but not least, story line.However, FF8 was something different from rest of FF series.  For couple hours, I thought it was good, then it became apparent eventually that the game doesn't live up to its legacy.  I easily stopped playing it because simply the magic it used to pull me in from FF series wasn't there anymore.  I didn't think the plot was something which i would go 'wow' nor characters were fresh visually for being realistic rather than super-deformed, but other than that there was nothing, nada.Personally I love Dragon Warrior series.  It doesn't boast any graphic, nor has well plotted story lines of FF series, but Dragon Warrior does a really excellent job in game play balance.The FF series was able to go head to head, shoulder to shoulder with ENIX because of their graphic, music, and storyline.  But this time, it was way out of its own league.  Graphic was good enough, music, however, didn't give that masterful feeling, and ultimately storyline was just,,,horrible.It's a decent RPG.  However, I would consider it as a failure from FF's perspective.  I really did expect alot from FF8 since the main theme is love.  I really did anticipated alot...  Play this game when you have plenty of time to kill, no other game to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2002"}

Despite being set on an ice planet, the game manages to throw in different enviroments so you're not constantly walking around in white snow and ice.GameplayOverall, this is very solid.  The game is played from an over-the-shoulder perspective, similar to Gears of War (albeit from a zoomed out perspective).  The weapons and reloading are fairly intuitive; and like most new games, you can only carry two weapons at a time.  Now, it wouldn't be a Japanese sci-fi game if it didn't have mechs; and this game has plenty of those.  They're integrated fairly well, and there is plenty of varity in mech types.  The last mech, however, is a ridiculous flying machine that attacks with lazer swords - great for japanime fans; not so much for everyone else.  The singleplayer campaign is pretty linear.  You move from point A to point B with little variety; but that doesn't make it dull.  The bosses in this game are a great throw-back to games of the 80's when bosses were big, hard to beat, and usually involve some hidden weakness.StoryThis is where the game loses a lot of points.  The story is poorly told, and just plain stupid.  The cutscenes are generally pretty silly, and you'll enjoy the game more if you skip through them.  I won't spoil anything, but I've seen this is a common complaint - the story is worse than something you see on weekday afternoon cartoons.Online playOnline supports up to 16 players at a time and has 4 game modes: Elimination (every man for himself), Team Elimination, Post grab (control different areas); and Fugitive which is the only unique game, pitting the host against everyone else.  The online play is fun, and there are enough achivements to keep people playing for a while.  But after a while, it feels repetitive and a little frustrating.  It also fails to separate out language zones, so you may be stuck on a team with French and Japanese - try to coordinate anything then!This game was a fun renter, and the campaign mode is long enough that it should keep you occupied over the weekend.  The online play is fun, but after a few hours, the novelty wears off.  Avoid the story in this game at all costs.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}

This game is one of the best Gamecube titles next to Metroid Prime.  The Legend of Zelda series never disapoints and this one surely doens't either.  The game features our hero Link as he's back to kick [...] and take names and of course...Once again rescue Zelda and and land of Hyrule.  The game features some really memorable new elements and gameplay which I simply loved.  The cell shaded graphics are just fantastic!  Nintendo did a really great job with this amazing series by boosting up the graphics.  The game has a simple story which I'm to lazy to tell but I will say this game is amazing.  This isn't as good as the legendary Ocarina of Time but still a classic Gamecube game.The cellshaded graphics is beautiful in this game and everything about the enviroment makes it even better.  The water, character, ect it's all great but you'll notice if you do a close up on the main character you'll notice a big line in the Texture but that still doesn't ruin the experience of the game as it features a [...] load of new things also the new concept of riding a talking boat that holds the truth to your destiny and not to mention you're also be joining Pirates which also has a big part in Wind Waker.  The game, just like the rest of the Zelda series, has some really great Dungeons and one of them which involves lava is a very memerable moment in the Legend of Zelda series.The game has great boss battles, very memorable ones I might add.  Though they are a bit easy but still nothing wrong with that.  The Zelda series has always had some really great moments and this one has alot of great moments.  Link is now more of a child then an adult and is really \"cute\" how it is done.  The game may turn some off cause of the \"cute\" cell shaded visuals as most like to call it but most Zelda fans will highly enjoy this and put this in there Gamcube library.  I remember getting this game when it first hit stores and I must say this is one of the most entertaining games I played in 03.Good-Cell Shaded Visuals are amazing-great gameplay and lots of great exploring-the story line let alone is what is really great besides exploring..-Some very memerable Boss Battles-The Dungeons never looked this great!-The games plot is pretty linear of course but still a great and still a classic in my mind..-The new concept of exploring through the sea with a Boat...a very special boat which I won't spoil..is just great..Bad-Some gamers might be turned off by the cell shaded visuals-A bit on the short side I still enjoyed it..The Ugly..-Link and Zelda getting it on..eheheheOverall this is a really great game and is an instant Classic for the Gamecube.  It has amazing visuals, awesome gameplay and a really good score with lots of great Dungeons and great boss battles.

Mizov","summary":"Great Plot, Above Average Elsewhere","reviewText":"I've been looking forward to Homefront for a few months once I read up on the story. The idea of a dystopian future where a unified Korea occupies the USA? Sounds cool to me. Tack on that the script is written by John Milius, the same writer of Red Dawn and Apocalypse Now and I'm sold.I'll say straight up, the story delivers. It's an involved story in a well developed universe that really sucks the player in. I even read the book leading up to the gameHomefront: The Voice of Freedomto get me in the right mindset to play. Even though the campaign is relatively short the story was solid all the way through and the set pieces were very cool and dynamic.Enough gushing about the story... how does it play?Slightly above average is the quick answer. It is a typical shooter, the controls, the enemy AI, the level layouts, etc. all remind me that this is a genre typical game. If you're looking for something groundbreaking in terms of play, graphics, sound, etc. you're not going to find it here. That's not a bad thing. Everything in the game is very competently done, I was very happy with it. The graphics looked decent, the controls were tight, the sound made me feel like I was in the thick of battle. The only problem is that at the same time, nothing really stands out to me.I haven't had a chance to delve into the multiplayer yet but there are a lot of offerings, but is it enough to pull you away from Black Ops? Depends on you. It's not an upgrade, just a different offering. As I said before though, this isn't a bad thing, it really comes down to preference.To sum it up: if you're interested in the story in any way, absolutely pick up this game. If you're looking for something groundbreaking in terms of graphics, gameplay, engine, etc. than this may not be the best choice (that would be Battlefield 3, or much sooner, Crysis 2).I personally enjoyed it and I don't regret picking it up at full price, but it's ultimately up to you.Pros:Great storyCompetent gameplayDecent graphicsBooming soundLots of multiplayer offeringsCons:Doesn't break new ground (but that's okay!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

Taking the same formulae from the first game and exploring the legend of the land of Ivalice, this game delivers an excellent experience for fans of the Final Fantasy Tactics experience.  Unfortunately, where the game loses its allure is in the realm of people who are more casual or less interested in exploring over 400 different quests.Storywise, FFTA2 starts off extremely slow and the ending is quite predictable.  Like the first game the kid character is transported into the world of Ivalice through a book.  He lands in the middle of a field and joins in a Clan.  The player will explore life in the land of Ivalice and take part in about 50 or so quests to get to the final storymode battles, or up to 400 to explore tons of sidequests. The story that takes place in the land of ivalice is more exciting than the main story itself.  Characters are charming and adorable and I loved the comments made by the main character.Graphics wise, the game could be a game on the GBA. It has colorful sprites and world map, there is a lack of 3D used and most skills do not push any graphical limits.  Finally soundwise, the soundtrack is awesome and some tracks seem like they came from Final Fantasy XII.The gameplay ranges from fun to extremely brutal and difficult on easy mode.  The boss battles are excessively difficult because of the main enemy having a tendency to get rid of the judges (in this game the judge leaves if you break a law and the only lose is the inability to use phoenix downs or revive characters). The gameplay is fun if you are able to find and enjoy the elimination of units or exploring some of the side stories in the quests.  Other battles can be challening if the law cards dont cater to your style or you do not use items.  There is the same job system with about 12 or so jobs that have their own skills.Ultimately the only difficult aspect are the difficult boss fights that will drain all of the items you use. Also the tedious part is trying to get and create weapons that will allow and enable you to learn new other abilities.If one can embrace the difficult and plow through the experience is rewarding and most players will probably not be able ot get through the final boss.  However the experience is fun and such. (Annoying aspect: inability to rotate the camera)This is a definitive DS title that most people should play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2009"}

The weapons are cool, and while you won't see as many as say in COD game, the guns are all useful in their own way like in Halo.The boss fights are interesting, and requires a bit more strategy than &#34;pew pew pew&#34;.  The voice acting is good, and while the main character could've used a voice of own, the ride is still good.  The graphics are good, though there are certain elements of the environments, chiefly the outdoor ones that use a bit too much bloom.  There are other eyesores as well, but only if you stop and stare out of random windows for minutes at a time.The campaign is good like I've alluded to, but the multiplayer is...a bit lacking.  The formula for the multiplayer is flat, just &#34;pew pew pew&#34; your way through levels, and there's no other gamemodes!  Yes it's fun, but it's not too different from the campaign!  There's no split screen, no minigames, and I feel that's why I have to leave this game at four stars.BTW, at this point, the multiplayer is dead, so if you get this game, get it for the campaign.

Love it or hate it, Final Fantasy 7 broke new ground in the RPG market, and games today have a lot to be thankful for that Final Fantasy 7 made possible.For those who haven't played this title, it is going to appear very dated, especially the hideously deformed polygon characters.  But the backgrounds are beautiful scenes based on hand drawn pictures.  The backgrounds are set, so they don't move.  Instead you move around them.  It was a style used extensively on the PS1 and still used in other games today (especially on the portable systems).  Granted, many of us would love to see a remake, and that might happen someday, but not likely any year soon.I will just sum up what I love about this game, even in today's market of amazing games (and a lot of terrible games or super easy games also).  First, the game was insanely easy.  I died once on my first play through (against Lost Number before I realized what to do), and I don't believe I saw a gameover screen since.  But the ease of the game is not an issue.  There is still some challenge, and part of what makes the game enjoyable is the lack of 'cheap' enemies.  But once you get the hang of things, it is super easy.The story is amazing, and only Final Fantasy 10 has really compared.  Final Fantasy 6 was such a great title, that I never thought anything could top it, but FF7 just drew me in and didn't let me go.  I couldn't believe the intrigue, the depth, the complexity of the story.  I found myself on edge at school (I was in high school when it first released) and I couldn't wait to get home to play it.  When Cloud goes against Rufus near the end of the Midgar arc, I knew I loved this game.  When it took over 2 hours of game play to get to a world map, I knew something was special.  And when the game cuts (in real time) to the CG of Junon's cannon, I was stunned.With the pretty games of this era, one might be unimpressed, but if you remember the era when this game was made, it broke ground that developers feared.  First true epic big budget RPG with cut scene CGI.  Low to zero loading times (so happy for that!).  A central character that is killed mid way through the game.  And an amazing depth of side quests and extras at the end of the game that were fun and rewarding.Going back, it may not match up against some more recent titles in every facet, but overall this is still a solid and spectacular game.  In my opinion only Zelda The Ocarina of Time and Super Mario World can compare with this title in overall quality and fun.  Though I have other personal favorites (big shout out for Ogre Battle!), I cannot argue that Final Fantasy 7 is among the three best games of all time, and easily the most ground breaking RPG ever.  As nostalgic as the earlier titles are (and I love them all), this game just proves that solid gameplay and an amazing story are timeless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

Warning: This review can be considered to contain SPOILERS!(Well, mostly just in the \"story\" section).Graphics (10/10): Well, by today's standards, the graphics aren't so good.  However, for their time, they deserved a 10 out of 10.  There's something about seeing a character in 3-D (albeit rather blocky 3-D) that helps you identify more easily with the characters, and even though we now have such advanced graphics with current gen systems, I still find FF7 completely playable and not too hard on the eyes.Music (10/10):  What can I say?  The music in this game is both evocative and distinctive.  The music fits the scenes and conveys mood very well.  This is especially true of the overworld music-I feel like the world really is in dire straights whenever I hear it.  And let me tell you, the first time I heard One-Winged Angel, it put the fear in me (consequently, I died and had to try again - ha ha!).  Anyway, I loved this game's music so much I had to buy the soundtrack!Characters (10/10): Wow.  Characters are excellently portrayed; they all have personalities and some kind of backstory.  Even Yuffie.  I mean, after playing a certain recent FF (12, cough), I've really come to appreciate the fact that no character in FF7 is just tacked on to the party (cough, FF12's Penelo, cough).  Every single character has a backstory that's relevant or ties into the main story in some way.Story (10/10): Wow.  That's all I can say.  FF7 has an amazing intricate network of subplots and character histories on top of the main story.  I love the complexity of it.  However, the one drawback to this complex story is that it requires multiple playthroughs and some thought before you catch everything.  To me though, this makes the game better, not worse.  Also, the pacing of the story is excellent.  I never felt bored or compelled to continue \"just to reach the end\".Plus, I love the fact that your main character, Cloud, has a flawed memory (spoiler, I know, but who doesn't know the story of FF7 by now?).  Because you see the events of the game through his eyes, you never quite know what actually happened, and  what is the product of his confusion. I believe that having a less than 100% reliable narrator makes for a much more interesting story for the player because it keeps you guessing.  Loads of RPGs feature narrators/main characters with some sort of amnesia, but this is one of the few games I've seen that that actually puts a large focus on \"unreliable narration\". Some people have complained that FF7's story is confusing and poorly told, but I strongly disagree.  Stories in literature that feature \"unreliable narration\" (Edgar Allen Poe used this alot; he doesn't catch any flak for it!) are completely legitimate ways of telling a story.  In the case of Final Fantasy 7, it serves to let the player know (in a dynamic and creative way) that Cloud is possibly psychologically unstable. If you pay attention to the game (you might need multiple playthroughs to catch it), you can figure out what's really going on.  This is in direct contrast to a game that just has a crap story and doesn't make any sense because of poor writing (for an example of this sort of game, see my Grandia III review).Battle System (10/10): Once again, I have no complaints here.  I absolutely love menu-driven combat (I know you all are going to laugh at me, but I can't be the only one who likes turn-based stuff).  I love the materia system-it allows for some good customization, which I enjoyed.  In many ways, the materia system is awesome because it allows you to use any character to do anything, which means that no one character is so worthless that you just never use them (with the possible exception of Aeris, since her attack is so low).Gameplay (10/10): This is my catch-all category. The game is just chock full of extras and side-quests.  Plenty to explore and accomplish.  The side-quests are a good balance of combat related things (like destroying the Weapon monsters) and more relaxing non-combat things (like racing and breeding chocobos).  The controls are easy to use and are rather intuitive.  I really have no complaints.Overall (10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score. Personally, I cannot recommend this game enough.  I realize that it looks rather dated by today's standards, but it's what's inside that counts, right?  The core of this game is still gold.  FF7 is like a fine piece of literature-it may be old but it's still a classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2008"}

Jongeling \"slice of heaven\"","summary":"What a stupid game","reviewText":"I'm a long-time veteran of Resident Evil, having played every installment since the first one in '95, and completing most of them with A rankings. Believe me when I tell you I'm a veteran. I've read the books, seen the movies, yada-yada-yada.This game is horrible.First of all,Controls:The controls are difficult. Using your target is like the equivalent of catching a fly with a fish net. The game talks about hitting the \"critical areas\". I've discovered that if you are not hitting the \"critical areas\" you are either hitting air or you're just wasting ammo. Don't expect the game to tell you where the critical areas are, (except for the millisecond blink of the white light in your fishnet) so you'll have to botch it on your own.Controlling your gun and your person are, as I recall, more difficult than the original Resident Evil with the bizarre camera angles and \"tank-like\" characters. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a challenging game, it's just a stupidly designed, malfunctionary controlled game that makes it unnecessarily hard to play.Difficulty :On top of the underdeveloped control system, the difficulty of the actual enemies are like trying to escape a zippered sleeping bag while sinking to the bottom of a swamp. Helpless is the word, as you're surrounded by unfathomable attacks. Your \"partner\" does not help you at all, as they do in Resident Evil Zero. I'll have you know I tried and failed at the game on \"Easy\" mode, finally reaching stage three after four hours. Don't expect the game to get any easier, just more frustrating and less exciting. Like watching wallpaper. Moving wallpaper.Bosses are stupid hard, and unless you are hitting those \"critical zones\" you are wasting ammunition.Pick-Ups :Not plentiful, not visible. Just hidden and sometimes sparkly. In a game that requires lots of ammunition, you sure are short-changed of it. That is unless, you can somehow ace your way to burst open boxes within the 2-3 seconds you're in a scene, grab ammunition, and clear a screen of zombies and gorillas while you're treasure hunting. You might be fortunate if you can find a First Aid Spray or a green herb, but be warned - you'll need one again after another 20 seconds of battle.Enemies :Here's a tip : Aim for the critical zones or you will be screwed. Really. Did I mention you have about 2 seconds to make your ideal shot at a moving target before it attacks you? Nine out of ten times you will be attacking enemies in multiples. So aim sharp, shoot often, and hope that you don't get your face mauled by an angry gorilla. Those things are mean.So to sum this up, this game is unbelievably hard. Never in my life have I had to repeat scenes and levels with such complacency and frustration as I have here. The learning curve is a steep one, and unless you're a sharpshooter you'll be widdling away at this game for a few hours before you get the hang of it. With the lack of health items, ever-dropping ammo count (unless of course you're using the pellet gun they call a Samurai Edge), and the poor shooting system you're sure to be frustrated within a few short minutes of play.After numerous wasted hours and a wrist that is throbbing, I've concluded that this was a waste of money, and really - the experience wasn't even that thrilling.1/2 star.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2011"}

The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"It'll make you jump, scream, and curse","reviewText":"This game deserves a spot in every Gamecube owner's collection. Capcom took its aging first installment in the Resident Evil series, spruced it up with photo-realistic graphics, new areas, and even better voice-acting, and released it to critical acclaim. It's a tense and addictive adventure, and one that begs to be played through until every secret is uncovered.Of course, with repeated playthroughs the inherent flaws in the gameplay become more and more obvious. These aren't flaws that Capcom missed in the game's production, rather they're built directly into the game and have become a part of the Resident Evil experience. Your character controls like a human tank, stiffly and without much precision in movement or combat. Enemies that would be very easy to kill or avoid become absolute pains when you have to steer around them in tight hallways. The inventory and save system, which can only be accessed in select areas, forces you to make repeated trips for the necessary items and feels like a cheap way to extend playing time. These flaws are more appearant now that Resident Evil 4 has eliminated most of them.Still, the trick with the Resident Evil games is to master the flaws, which can be overlooked in relation to the overall gaming experience. Definitely grab this one if you don't already have it, or snag the \"Pure Evil\" two-pack which also includes Resident Evil 0.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2005"}

I never played the first one, so I was skeptical going in whether or not I'd be able to follow the story. I am happy to say that you'll have no problem playing this one without having played the first game. There's enough informational items and flashback-like scenes to help fill you in and from what I read, this story takes place parallel to the events in the first one.After booting it up, I have to say I was pleased with the graphics, sound, and controls. Everything seemed familiar (as is the case with most FPS's), BUT the backgrounds and detail to the creepy atmosphere bumped it up a level or two above an average, typical shooter. The whole plot with the ghostly girl, Alma, is compelling and makes you want to fight forward to find out just what went on in the research facility.The locations are somewhat varied, some inside and some outside. You are always in a first person perspective, though you do get to man a human controlled robotic suit for certain sections of the game--still in a first person view.The graphics are not mind-blowing, but they are clearly next-gen, particularly the particle effects and water effects. The attention to detail on the weapons is particularly nice. Each weapon seems to be thought out well and not just added as an after game multiplayer ploy. Likewise, the sound is good and sets the tone for the creepy moments you will encounter.The enemy AI is pretty good and pretty hard on the default difficulty. Sure there are occasional things they do that scratch your head, but for the most they act pretty intelligent and as a group collective.I only noticed an occasional slowdown or glitch, which I think everyone is becoming accustomed to, particularly on multi-platform games.The game is about a solid 10 or so hours and with the exception of the ending level (just play it), the levels are well layed out and have abundant checkpoint saves.

I cut my teeth on the FEAR universe by playing both the original FEAR and FEAR Files on the 360.  I really enjoyed both, but as many critics have pointed out, those games tended to be repetitive and bland.  FEAR 2 has corrected those short-comings and presented itself as a very effective and fun FPS horror game.  The color pallete is much improved and the graphics are marginally better than its predecessor.  The levels are more varied in that you spend more time outside rather than creeping around hallways and office buildings for hours on end.  The guns look and sound phenomenal.  Probably the most fun sequence is when you get to jump into a mech and lay waste to your enemies.  Wow, just wow.Unlike the original FEAR on the 360, I now rarely use the reflex (bullet time) feature on the PC because the level of control with the mouse and keyboard simply affords me that option.  Plus, the reflex feature is binded to the control key, which is hard to reach during a fire fight.  I just learned to live without it.  I supposed I could change the key binding, but I had fun without using the reflex feature.The story of FEAR 2 builds upon the original FEAR.  The game begins shortly before the huge explosion at the end of FEAR.  Throughout the game you pick up lots of pieces of intel that unravel just what Armacham had been up to.  That, along with the intermittent fire fights, really grabbed me.  I was hooked and just couldn't step away from my monitor.I have not tried the multiplayer yet, but I'm not a big MP guy anyway.

The new Need for Speed: Most Wanted is basically Burnout Paradise 2, and I thought Forza Horizon was Turn 10's take on trying to be more Need for Speed to attract people my age (I'm 21), but aren't necessarily gearheads.  Little did I know, it's basically a free-roam version of a Forza title, but less simulation.  The release of the demo a few weeks before the game's released made me very excited to play the full title.  Luckily for me, a local Meijer had copies of the game ready to go at midnight, so a short walk led me to having a copy of the game in my hands.TL;DR version:  I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  If you like Need for Speed-ish games, but want something more realistic, grab it.  Don't even think twice about it.  If you're a die-hard Forza fan, play the demo first.  If you're curious, again, play the demo first.Forza Horizon is based on the fictitious Horizon festival in Colorado.  The Horizon festival centers around a rave theme, which is appropriate considering that EDM has taken off in the States.  Along with the theme comes the race events, which you'll take part in, with the goal of working your way through the ranks to take down the three-time champion, Darius Flynt.  It reminds you of a friendlier version of the original Need for Speed: Most Wanted, since, although you are racing in the streets, the game does not center around illicit street-racing.  However, there is an option to engage in illicit street races, and they also carry a hefty pot if you just so happen to win one.From the beginning of the game, you're introduced to Scott Tyler, one of the three DJ's for Horizon's three radio stations.  Scott is the DJ for Horizon Bass Arena, a station for those that like House (it sounds a bit like Acid House to me), Electro, Dubstep, and Drum & Bass.  Horizon Pulse is the Indie station, and Horizon Rocks is, obviously, the Rock station.  Although it's described as being more of a \"Hard Rock\" station, it's more of a \"Punk Rock/soft Rock\" station.  If you're expecting to hear something that sounds like Disturbed and Metallica, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  If you're not a fan of Skrillex, Modestep, Wolfgang Gartner, Netsky, Nero, Digitalism, or Sigma, you're not going to like Bass Arena.  Fortunately, the Xbox 360 allows custom soundtracks for every game, so you're not forced to listen to the stations if you don't want to.  Personally, I LOVE Bass Arena because EDM is currently my favorite genre of music.Once you fire up the game, your thrown in a 2013 SRT Viper, cruising on the streets of Colorado, when Scott Tyler states that the champion is on his way to the festival and he \"does not play nice with others\".  At the same time, Darius's Ferrari 599XX (yes, the race-version) passes you and you're instantly thrown in a race against a car that's much faster than yours.  It's not a complete blow-out, and it's possible to pass him, but slip up once and he'll gladly show you what the exhausts look like.  There is no reward for reaching the \"finish line\" before Darius, though it is an exciting experience to be thrown right into a high-speed race with Drum & Bass thumping in the background.  The \"finish line\" is actually a group of racers, with your nameless protagonist among them, listening to the radio and watching as the Viper you were driving and Darius pass them, still in a heated race.  You're then informed that there are only ten spots left to participate in the festival, meaning you're thrown in another race in an attempt to earn a spot in the festival.  Once you finally reach the festival, you're greeted by the CEO of the whole event, Alice Hart, then introduced to Dak, an elderly gearhead who clearly has a place in the game.Your very-first car in the game that you get to buy is, surprisingly, either a 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI or a 2008 Mitsubishi Lancer EVOLUTION, because your first event is an off-road event.  Introducing the first-born child of Forza and Dirt, ladies and gentlemen.  Unlike the previous titles, you start off in pretty-decent cars.  It's also insanely easy (compared to previous Forza titles) to obtain money and to buy faster cars.  I was able to buy the million-credit Koenigsegg CCXR before I was even halfway through the main career.  The game rewards you for turning off assists and turning up the AI difficulty.  For example, turning off everything, but leaving the transmission on automatic and the AI difficulty on medium doubles your winnings in every race.  If I'm not mistaken, the highest bonus you can receive is 120%.  That means, for example, if you win 30K in a race, you'll actually walk away with 66,000 credits, because the 120% bonus granted you an extra 36K.  It may sound like the game is a walk in the park, but Hard and Insane difficulty settings actually live up to their names.  Matter of fact, I don't think the computer makes mistakes on Insane.Also, from the start, you're introduced to the \"Stars\" of the Horizon festival.  For example, the first Star you must defeat in order to move up in the ranks is Romana Cravache.  This is where the similarities between Horizon and Most Wanted come into play.  In order to advance in Most Wanted, you needed to complete the challenges set by the Blacklist member you're trying to beat, then race him/her.  Beating them gave you a chance to win their car.  In Forza Horizon, you must win enough races to earn the amount of points needed to advance to the next wristband.  They go from Purple to Gold, with Gold being the last wristband you earn.  Once you earn enough to advance to the next wristband, the Star of the previous one will challenge you to a race.  If you win, you keep their car.  When it comes to the story, you're actually beating the Star drivers to the next wristband, knocking them out of the competition.  Them challenging you to a race and putting their pink slips on the line is more of an attempt to get \"revenge\" due to you eliminating them from the competition.When it comes to gameplay, Forza Horizon attempts to balance out realism with an arcade-feel.  Imagine not worrying about damage like in Need for Speed, but still needing to pay attention to cornering and throttle control like in Forza.  Returning from Forza Motorsport 4 is the option to have Manual with a clutch.  You can still upgrade your cars, for example, by putting a body kit or the always-present Forza bumper and spoilers to improve your handling, but tuning has been completely eliminated from the game.  The only \"taste\" of tuning you get is you have the option to upgrade a lot of the cars to whatever Performance Index you want.  You can take a B-class EVOLUTION an mod it so that it can participate in R1 class, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform very well at the class.  I bought a Gallardo Superleggera (a stock S class), had it at R3 class, and tried to upgrade it to R1 class.  It's horrible at R1 class, but is amazing to drive at R3 class.  To add to the simulation feel, this game still requires you to learn the appropriate line to navigate the track.  You're not going to take many corners at 150mph a la Need for Speed, unless you're on the highway in a Koenigsegg.  To better explain how the game feels, imagine Forza Motorsport 4, but easier.  You don't have to worry about throttle control to prevent oversteer as much (unless you're in a high-powered vehicle), and you don't have to take every corner perfectly in order to win the race.  It's more forgiving this time around.The cars in the game range from your typical \"middle-class\" vehicles to the toys for the wealthy, to a few full-blown race cars.  Some of the cars include the Koenigsegg CCXR, the Pagani Zonda R, Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, Ferrari F50GT, Ferrari 599XX, Toyota Supra, Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 V-SpecII, Nissan GT-R, Shelby GT500, and the Lamborghini Aventador, just to name a few.  A full car-list can easily be found online.  While the game does have a nice blend of cars, and a lot of cars I actually like, I can't help but feel the race cars are out of place here.  The theme is an event that takes place on closed roads (with the occasional illicit street races).  You would think all of the cars in the game would be street-legal to match the setting.  To balance it out, though, you can't go to many events with the fastest cars in the game, and the ones that DO allow the fastest cars aren't unlocked until the last wristband anyway.  It works well with the whole, \"Darius only races the best drivers at the festival\" story bit, because the best drivers are driving the fastest (sometimes race-built) vehicles.There are a few things I didn't like about Forza Horizon.  For one, whenever you're in a race against one of the Star characters, they tend to repeat their lines and movements.  With Ali, this wasn't as big of an issue for me because I actually liked him, but if you didn't like the characters the first time you ran into them, you'll hate them by the time you finish the game.  Another thing I didn't like was that the map, as big as it is, doesn't have a lot of road to take up the vast amount of empty space.  You'll also find yourself on the same track throughout multiple wristband events.  For having 216 roads to discover, you'd think they would be able to have more variety in the tracks.  Granted I only remember repeating five of the circuits, but still, that's five too many.  The story, while again, featuring characters I do like, is a bit too bland.  You start as the new guy without a name, work your way through the ranks, beat Darius, and then........nothing.  You just beat him.  You win the last festival race, beat him in a street race, win his car, and the credits role.  For having such a long build-up to the final race between you & Darius, I was hoping for at least an ending.  Instead we get \"Well, this car is now yours\" and credits.  To say the ending is a disappointment is an understatement.  Also, the day/night cycle is too short.  According to the official forums, it's about 45 minutes.  While I appreciate the cycle, I wish it were much longer, especially since night-racing is so much fun.Overall, Forza Horizon is an amazing game, that actually does a pretty good job trying to capture the modern \"young adult\" culture in regards to style and music.  The game is very-fun to play, has a nice blend of an arcade feel with realistic physics, and successfully blends the two things I love the most, electronic music and cars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2012"}

It has almost everything you could want in a Western, open world game: Action, humor, drama, suspense, good story-telling, good acting, amazing visuals, and a ton of extra content.If all you cared about was the main story, you'd finish it (while having a great time) in about 15-20 hours. But if you do all the extra content/side missions, it'll take you close to 50 hours to complete. And that I did. From hunting wild animals (and selling their parts), to catching and training horses, to looking for buried treasure, to gambling, to finding ingredients to create potions, to quick draw competitions, to clearing hideouts of gang members and capturing wanted criminals (I could keep going), you were never bored.In short, you felt like the star of your own Western movie. Riding horses felt natural, while shooting all the different kinds of guns produced great sound and impressive \"hit physics\" on victims. \"Dead eye,\" which slowed down the action so you could get headshots easier, was awesome, especially when using a revolver (where main character John Marston would flick the hammer in rapid succession, just like in the movies).The visuals were truly stunning. At certain times, I literally stopped moving just to swing the camera around and enjoy the view. Moonlit nights, sunsets, pouring rain, mountaintops and canyons provided exquisite vistas that made me forget I was playing a video game for a few seconds.The setting is split into three areas: a traditional southwest US plain, with lots of flat land and shrubbery, a hotter, more orange Mexican zone with giant stone pillars and sprawling villas, and finally a true town that borders a snowy mountain.Throw in the dynamite (no pun intended) DLC, Undead Nightmare, and you could easily spend 75 hours in the world of John Marston and Red Dead Redemption.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

An amazing in-depth sci-fi role playing game that combines both in game decisions, and First Person shooter aspects.  The game is more ideal i think for the Role Playing game fan rather then just the straight run and gunner type.  There are a variety of classes to select at the character creation screen each with their own strengths, and weaknesses.  You can choose the male or female base for your character, and do a little customizing on the features, and the viola, you're ready to go!  If like me you cut your teeth on BioWare's other golden game Star Wars: The Knights of the Old Republic for the original Xbox.  I guess they decided to jump into the pool fully dressed and emerged with their own franchise, and it's a winner all the way.Follow your hero known as Commander Shepherd as he or she tries to save the universe from the Reapers with a collection of aliens by his side.  You go about the game recruiting your crew, and building relationships with them.  You explore this wide and colorful universe around you in your search to stop the villainous Saren from unleashing the Reapers on humanity.There are many options on how to play even if you want to be a true Paragon of heroics or a more roguish Renegade with dialogue cues to match your playing style.  With that little inclusion you can enjoy multiple playthroughs and see what happens when you alter your choices.I'm such a fan that i could just go on and on about visiting other planets stopping the evil agents of Cerberus, and romancing members of your team but then that would take away from YOUR experience.  Trust me.  If you're a fan of sci-fi games, and you like to really be immersed in your game play and you don't have time for WoW or BioWare's new baby the MMO Knights of the Old Republic then THIS is an excellent substitute for you.

Although it wasn't too terribly lengthy (expect in the replay aspect category, and then only to earn those extra fates that poor James suffers) and it did have moments of annoyance because of seemingly pointless boons a players has to fetch/tasks they are asked to do (rowing a boat across a lake, for one), an addiction to the bone-chilling atmosphere began almost as soon as I emerged from that pixelated PS2 womb and into that sadly perplexing, emotionally saturated tale. I'm not sure what aspect it was exactly that kept drawing me back to it, either; if the fabrics twined by a more and more engrossing storyline as it crossed through bleak recollections and haunted valleys held me in their grasp, if it was the crystalline clarity developed within both the atmospheric fogs and haunted corridors and in the monstrous abominations that were portrayed so well that even their skin wore a glossy, almost wet sheen, if it was the background thumps and the radio screams that developed into a maelstrom of chaotic sounds as enemies closed in from - somewhere - and that kept my heart pumping and my eyes leerily teetering from side to side, or if was simply because I, like Jame's wife, simply wanted to return to Silent Hill; my \"special place.\"When the story begins, the player finds themselves fully submerged in a dilemma of horrific proportions, one that isn't hinged on the last tale in any way. James Sutherland, manipulated by gamers across the globe, opens by recounting that he's received a letter from his wife, Mary, telling him to meet her in Silent Hill. The only problem is that this can't be. Mary died three years ago. Still, he's certain that its her handwriting that yearns for him to join her in their \"special place,\" stirring up memories and ghosts of a more tangible nature that grow as James moves forward. From that beginning on things morphos with a complexity that is mesmerizing, adding in disturbing characters with disturbed lives that lead you through the haunted abodes of Silent Hill and into the embrace of, well, an ending that is just as tragically disturbing as the beginning.Along the way some sightseeing is involved as well, introducing more of that mist-enveloped town that bleeds as Jame's heart bleeds, yearning for answers that he will only find in the darkest of expanses. This is something that the first game lacked, giving it depths that sometimes transcends even our true claustrophobic responses to the unknown. A word of caution before you play, though. If you do scare easily, this might not be the game for you. The sound effects alone seem to have a hair-raising effect on survival gamers, keeping them shifting in their seats and trying to see down darkened corridors that shouldn't be able to illicit effects like that on them. I know, because it played with me like this as well, tossing me like a ragdoll in my seat until it was through with its tale. If you are like me and you do want to be scared and rewarded for your time by something a little more meaningful than your casual fright-filled experience, though, then explore the tourist attraction that has haunted countless souls. You won't be disappointed.TBS-MSL","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMB4","description":"","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"Works with (electric) basses too, and definitely an improvement over the original","reviewText":"I've fiddled around with bass in the past, but lately have wanted to take it a little more seriously. So I gave the original bass-compatible Rocksmith a whirl and, while it was a great idea, the execution left me a bit let down. When I received a copy of Rocksmith 2014, I was pleasantly surprised to find when I started it up that it included bass functionality (this was not advertised in the Amazon product listing or on the game's packaging).Let me get this out of the way up front: Rocksmith does not want you to use an HDMI cable for audio (they call HDMI a &#34;non-ideal setup&#34;). However, I'm a huge gamer, and I'm not rearranging all my cables between my consoles, TV, sound system, headphones, switches and receiver for just one game. So read what I'm writing with the knowledge that I'm running the game audio through HDMI.The game eases you into the experience - calibration is a snap, tuning is intuitive, and it has you pick your preferences (lead/rhythm/bass guitar, headstock configuration, right- or left-handed, etc).This is where I ran into bass-specific issues. The game will only recognize four-string basses, so put that five-string back on the wall. Also, it could not calibrate my acoustic-electric bass (again, this might be an HDMI issue). So keep that in mind. My regular electric bass and my electric six-string guitar had no issues.As for the game itself, it's definitely an improvement over the original. The UI is improved but still intimidating to a newcomer. Extra modes have been added, and the game's sense of your progression (and, consequently, the goals it gives you) is much improved. Thankfully, the game starts out really simple and gradually works its way up, tailoring the pace to what you're actually doing (even having you practice certain movements of songs that are tripping you up).Every now and then the game will goof and give you a huge difficulty spike. I gave ThunderKiss '65 a try - my first runthrough had maybe 60 notes, with 50 of them being open E strings and most of the others 2nd-fret A strings, and I aced it. I immediately restarted it and the game gave me a bigger variety of notes (and much more of them) much sooner and faster - in the first 15 seconds I had already surpassed both and felt like I was drowning.Make no mistake, though - this isn't Guitar Hero, where awesome finger reflexes alone will get you by. A lot of learning will be by brute force. The Rocksmith UI is really good, but it's passing a huge amount of information at you very quickly. In Guitar Hero you're keeping an eye on a maximum of five &#34;lanes.&#34; In my first thirty minutes of Rocksmith I ran into a section where there were over a dozen &#34;lanes&#34; on the screen. Think of this less as a game and more of a challenging but accommodating tutor.I can't fault the setlist, which covers a broad swath of rock - Bob Dylan and The Who to White Zombie and Avenged Sevenfold. It's a varied, but solid, collection.All in all, if you're looking for a game, look elsewhere. But if you want to learn how to play your instrument, strap it on and plug it in. You'll have to put some time into Rocksmith, but if you do you'll see results.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00008URUF","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Stick with the SNES version if you can.","reviewText":"Donkey Kong Country was a big deal when it came out in late 1994. It was -the- game to get, and sold out everywhere in no time. I remember reading game magazines that had screen shots, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This was a GAME?? It looked like a movie or something! They say graphics don't make a game, but they sure as heck didn't hurt DKC. The game was, and still is beautiful to look at. Essentially, DKC is a Super Mario World clone, but with so much more style. You could have two players play co-operatively, or competitively. There were 101 hidden areas, many of which required you to drop off of platforms to find them or go behind the beginning of a level- something not many people figured out for a while. It also has what I consider the greatest soundtrack of any game. Yeah, I played this for hours and hours, and was excited to get the GBA version for my daughter since she's pretty big on the main Nintendo guys now too. While she likes playing it, as a veteran of the original, I find this \"enhanced port\" very disappointing. If you still have your SNES, track down the cart. If you have a Wii, I'm pretty sure you can get the DKC games on the Virtual Console.Playing the game is simple- you play as Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, as they go after the Kremlings (big nasty reptile dudes) and other henchmen of King K. Rool. Kong's bananas were stolen by them, and he wants 'em back. You run, jump, slam, roll, cartwheel, and barrel your way through level after level, finding hidden areas as you progress. If you've played a Mario game, or even an older Sonic one, that's what DKC plays like, and it's great fun. Just like the old Donkey Kong- DK throws barrels at enemies. Some are regular barrels that keep rolling until they fall off a ledge, some break upon impact, and some are TNT barrels that can blow up walls and multiple enemies. There are also a couple of friends to help the Kongs, like Rambi the rhino who hauls ass and rams through anything in his path. Winky, the frog who can jump high and even take out the spiked Zinger enemies. Expresso the ostrich floats gently after jumping, and can run pretty fast too. And Enguarde, a swordfish for the water levels, that lunges at any baddies who come your way.So if the game's so much fun, what happened when it was ported to the GBA? While most people complain about the graphics and music getting toned down ('kinda expected considering just how much this game pushed the SNES when it came out compared to Super Mario World and others), that's not my problem...though it does suck that the perfect soundtrack is missing a lot of the magic it originally had. No, my problem is a bunch of little things. Donkey Kong can now either jump higher, or a lot of the levels were shortened. This is apparent right off the bat in the first level, where you can go back into the tree house to get a 1-up balloon. Originally, you had to bounce on the tire in there to get it, but now, DK can just jump up on his own and nab it. This hurts him more than it helps in some levels, since there are enemies on platforms above here and there, and you can now easily jump into them, losing DK. Hit detection is also very weird. There'd be times where I swore I jumped on an enemy, only to have Diddy Kong take the hit and run away. Hey, if I jump on a Kremling's head, I expect him to be taken out, not have Diddy somehow fall through it, then get hit by him. They also added a couple of very, very stupid mini-games, a fishing one and a dancing one which I'm sure you'll play for all of 2 minutes, then never touch again. There are also pictures/cameras to collect, but I found it to be more tacked on than a cool extra feature. This port just screams lazy, and by taking time to add extra things that are dumb and pointless, I don't get why they could've just given us a straight port and save some hassle.The one pro though? Boss fights are much harder, and I loved this. It was a big surprise when I fought the Zinger boss, and had to throw barrels at smaller Zingers that surrounded it after each hit. The Master Necky Sr. fight is good too, since you now have to fight the original Necky at the same time, having two bosses at once. 'added some good extra challenge.I know it might seem nitpicky to dock stars because of what might be harmless additions, but the hit detection ruined a lot of the fun for me. I swear, there was one level that I never had trouble with on the SNES, yet died 32 times on in this version. Also, when you're riding an animal with both Kongs, instead of having the other Kong trail behind, both ride the animal, and when you attack, it looks like your partner is...well, a partner in more ways than one. 'could've done without that too, though it never fails to make me laugh. Still, if you've never played DKC and a GBA or DS is your only system, you should pick it up. Just know that the game is much better in regular form.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Don't listen to the bad reviews. Just get the Extended Cut Endings DLC and you're fine","reviewText":"The Good: Excellent visuals, huge decisions around every corner, weapon customization is a welcome addition, more solid and hard hitting combat, no more resources to findThe Bad: Space exploration still sucks, original endings are poorly put together, collision detection issues, very linear in level design, shorter than the past two gamesMass Effect made such a huge impact on me and the gaming world that no one probably expected. To create such a vast universe in likes of Star Wars is just incredible. BioWare pulled it off, and each game is very memorable. Mass Effect 3 pulls all the punches this time around and is the epic climax to the Reaper invasion that is sent to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. Of course Commander Shepard is supposed to fix this along with his/her recruits that you brought along throughout the series. Never before has a game spread so much across a trilogy. I have never kept a game save so sacred as I have my Mass Effect save because every choice you make carries heavily throughout the whole series.It was obvious in ME2 how choices carried over, but ME3 is huge. Main characters will die, some that died in the last games will make an impact on how ME3 turns out. Instead of going around recruiting people like the last two games you are recruiting entire war assets for the war on the Reapers. You are trying to bring whole nations together and making huge decisions that will impact the galaxy for the rest of time. Things like whether or not you should cure the Krogan genophage, help the Council, help Cerberus, or just say screw it and make everyone's lives hell. You have the choices here and they will make you think a lot. Never before in a shooter have I cared about seeing certain races die or get hit. Seeing the Turian home world Palaven getting creamed left me feeling sad and determined to make choices that helped them. In this game some civilizations actually get wiped out due to your choices. Some are just as subtle as helping someone out on the Citadel with a side mission that decides whether the Elcor, Hanar, Batarian, and Volus survive or not. This game is that big and bold.Aside from the obvious story, the gameplay has improved a lot. The action and shooting are more refined and feel better. There are whole new weapons, cover system, as well as a dodge and roll mechanic that comes in handy. Everything just feels tight and weapons hit heavy. Speaking of weapons you can now customize them by adding mods to improve damage, stability, accuracy, and even clip capacity. You can now buy mods through shops on the Citadel from the Normandy instead of running around on every planet trying to get what you need. You can also buy armor and have more customization options for your character which is very welcome. You also can't carry every weapon with you anymore. I guess with was to balance the game more. Each weapon you have will add weight which can be reduced by upgrading weapons. Carrying every weapon with you will slow you down and reduce recharge speed of biotic powers so choose carefully.The overall structure of the game is just more streamlined and less messy and annoying. Small side missions usually are stuck to the Citadel where you have to find an item for someone during space exploration. Exploration in space still isn't fun, but it's a lot better than scanning every damn planet for resources. They were completely scrapped this time around so everything is just bought with credits which is how it originally should have been. You can still scan, but you do it on the map and EDI will tell you if she found something. Certain planets will have a war asset or an item someone on the Citadel is looking for. If you scan too much the Reapers will come after you and you have to high tail it out of the system before they catch you and come back after a mission has been completed.Almost everything you do in this game is big, and I can't think of any mission that felt small like in the last two games. ME3 is just huge in scope and there are some memorable and impressive moments. The story is very cerebral, but here's the catch: If you have never played a Mass Effect game before go back to the first one and start from the beginning. You just won't appreciate every decision if you jump right in. The comic that explains the last two games isn't enough and doesn't do this excellent and amazing sci-fi series justice. Only fans who have played through the last two will appreciate this game and truly feel that every decision is personal.The controversy about the endings is understandable. I got to use the Extended Cut DLC while playing this and after some research the ending would suck without it. Without any spoilers the ending gives you three choices at the end this time around instead of two. The choices are explained more and there are some extras shots stuck in the endings to make more sense of it all. The original endings were just sloppy and, to be honest, lazily put together. BioWare did everyone a service by offering these endings for free.Overall, Mass Effect 3 looks amazing, plays well, and has some of the most memorable choices I have ever had to make in a game. This is about all life as we know it and not just some city or civilization. This is about all organic and synthetic life, and what ME has done for the gaming world is a huge feat that I haven't seen since Star Wars. This is a true sci-fi masterpiece that all fans of the genre will love. If I did have any complaints it would be the said original endings, and there are some issues like collision detection, linearity, the game feels shorter than the last two games, and the space exploration pretty much sucks. These are minor though and don't really bring it down much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}

I'm having a blast with my character, and I appreciate that there are things I can do solo as well as with my friends. I also appreciate that it's essentially free-to-play once you pick up the discs.

Plan on a whole evening. An hour to install the game, and another two hours to download the updates. I didn't have that much time set aside the first three times I tried to install it, and I had to stop it and start again over the next time.

This game is a clunker in comparison.  As in BiB you play as 2 characters: Ray (the gunman) and Billy (the indian kid).  After slaughtering a few dozen bad guys (as Ray), you switch to the Billy character.  As Billy, you have to climb down a mountain, enter a farm, climb to a roof to get a gun and ammo, shoot targets, kill a dog, cross a bridge into town where you give up your gun to the marshall, enter a bar/bordello to get another gun and your whip before diving out a window and running out of town.  Here Billy finds himself on another mountainous ledge where he has to flick his whip to swing over chasms.  This is very tricky.  For example, when you finally get to a tree that you can use, be sure to hold down the right trigger after you latched it otherwise it is all for naught.  Fail and you have to do the mountain scenario all over again.  THIS GETS DOWNRIGHT MONOTONOUS.  Getting a checkpoint in this game (and other UBI-soft titles such as GHOST RECON:ADVANCED WARFIGHTER ruins alot of your enjoyment.  For this reason alone, I give this game a 3 instead something higher.  It looks good and I'm still playing it, but find it hard to recommend highly.

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"thePersian{Knife","summary":"It's a keeper after all the troubles","reviewText":"I've spent time on both sides of the Singularity fence, and have concluded to keep it.I'm playing through for the 2nd time on hard, and I'm sure that I'll get my goose cooked plenty.This is a great game for $10, especially if you're a Bioshock fan.

DiSpirito \"mentored1\"","summary":"I ain't drinkin' this kool-aid","reviewText":"This review takes places at 9:00 p.m. on Madden NFL 10 release day (8/14/09).  I picked up the game at midnight on said day--yes I'm a nerd--and played two full preseason games (simulated two), 6 regular season games (simulated the rest), and one full off-season rotation.  I spent several weeks watching ads, preview videos, interviews, and developer comments about the game.  I loved--unequivocally and fervently--Madden NFL 09.Madden NFL 10... underwhelmed me.  It is disappointing.  It was overhyped.  If the developers took into account comments from fans, then I'm way out of step with what the fans of Madden NFL are looking for in a good football game.  On to the points of my review...  This is by no means an exhaustive review, since I'm exhausted after wrestling with this *bleep* game.GRAPHICS & SOUNDImproved visuals and on-field audio were a hyped part of the new Madden.  Okey-dokey, where are they?  The visuals are the same and, in some spots, not as crisp.  To my eye, on a 1080i Samsung 40\" LCD, it appears they added some more contrast and livened up some colors.  That's it.  The animations and player models aren't any better than 09.  Many folks seem to think so, but I'd say it's likely wishful thinking.  Some of the animations during plays looked better in 09.The menus are gaudy and remind of me of the transistion from Windows XP Pro with classic menus to Windows Vista.  Shiny, colorful, and distracting.  The functionality is essentially unchanged from 09, but the navigation and placement of selections is different enough to be confusing for a little while.The sound and music are the same as Madden 09 in quality.  Some different sounds and songs, sure, but no better or worse quality.GAMEPLAY & FRANCHISEHere's the biggest letdown of all.  The much-touted PRO-TAK system is a sham.  Gang tackles?  Okay, big deal.  Didn't anyone have more than one defender come at them in 09?  It's a visual trick that doesn't add to the gameplay at all.  If anything, it makes the plays more arcade-like; if you like that, right on brother.The playcall system isn't as smooth as 09.  Each play is assigned to a different button as you scroll through the playbook.  It isn't hard to use, it's just not an improvement and hence not a feature to go touting around as such.The game's default speed is MUCH lower than 09.  You can change this in the game's options, but I wonder why a speed setting is even relevant.  If it's an NFL simulation, why add an arcade-like setting to play tortoise ball or hyper-ball?  Weird.Ouch... ouch... No training camps, none... nada... You don't progress your players until the end of the year.  But wait!  The CPU does it for you.  How quaint!  Go from being able to train as you please in 09 to not at all--awesome!Injuries are abundant.  You can turn down the injury slider to reduce the frequency, but I never had to do that in 09.  It seemed to be pretty balanced right out of the box last year.  But, hey, we're progressing right?  Don't matter that EA has no competition.Fumbles are frequent and frequently annoying.  EA added a new, albeit optional (turn on / off) fight-for-the-fumble button-mashing contest.  Even if three of your players and one of the opponent's fall on a fumble, you may lose the ball if you don't press that crazy sequence of buttons properly!  Yeah arcade!  As an addendum, have fun trying to grab interceptions or control the receiver.  It's an exercise in futility.  How does a cornerback rated at 88 have three interceptions bounce off his outstretched hands in the same quarter?  Just asking...There's really no change in the trading, free agency, draft, etc--at least in the core way it operates.  The presentation is different for the draft and the CPU will sign players with a bit more attention to detail.  Shouldn't that have always been present?There's an annoying quirk that was with us last year that hasn't been remedied.  Given all the hyped-up improvements, I'm greatly disappointed these weren't addressed.  First, why can't I get a basic, number-displayed total of assets when I'm upgrading the stadium?  A simple \"here's what you have in the bank and here's what it costs\" would be great.  Second, where is the owner mode that was in 08?  Where did it go?  I still can't set ticket, concession, etc prices.  Not a big deal, but come on--it's a simple detail.MISCThis one really sent me rolling.  You can download and add in cheats from the \"Madden Store\" for your franchise.  Some of them are one-time \"get out of jail free\" style cards that heal an injured player or give your players a 10% boost in their stats for a game; others are more long term, like effective scouting for a season.  Downloading cheats for Madden is sad in and of itself, but here's the best part: they're NOT free.  You have to fork over real, hard-earned cash for them!  Isn't that great!  Pay $60 for the game and then a few bucks per cheat!  RIGHTEOUS!EA Sports... I love you guys...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR3K","description":"","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"High Tech Warfare in the future","reviewText":"The Call of Duty franchise started off with tackling the last great World War as you fought in the trenches from various perspectives. Later on the folks over at Infinity Ward took us out of the history books and moved us up to current affairs with Modern Warfare. Treyarch decided to up the ante by making one of the most fun to play shooters of the genre simply called Black Ops. Now they are at it again with a sequel that looks to be better than the original. We are about to give you everything you need to know in this review of Black Ops 2.The single player campaign goes between two time periods of 1980 and 2025 and during each period you will be playing either Alex Mason or his son David Mason. Both of the timelines are woven together as you go against the story's main protagonist Raul Menendez. What happens in the year 2025 is that there is a cyberterriorst attack on the United States and control of all the automated warfare systems has been compromised. It is up to you to find out what is going on and to regain control before these automated defense drones cause too much damage to the US. There is a branching path system during the missions and each path will give you an advantage by taking one path over another so this adds to the replay value of the game. However the single player campaign is a bit short as I have heard people beating it within a few hours so if you're looking for a satisfying single player experience you might want to look elsewhere.Multiplayer has been beefed up with some new game modes and a new way to create your own class. You are given ten points to spend on abilities, weapons and attachments so you can create the class that you want to play. There are 55 levels of progression and with each level unlocks new equipment, weapons, abilities and armor. One of the most sought after multiplayer modes in Black Ops was Zombie mode as you took on a map with your friends in order to fend off the zombie hordes. Zombie mode makes a comeback and there are some changes in this installment as there is now a story mode. You will be able to navigate the story within Black Ops 2's zombie mode with a friend but I haven't seen how you can do so solo.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

I couldn't believe that the old WWII CoD that we now of grew up so beautifully. CoD4 doesn't wait time with plot, or story (it's there and it's great) it just throws you in the battle from mission one and it's a roller coaster ride of nuclear explosion (YES full real-time nukes!!!) helicopter rides and stealth missions unlike no other. The game is so realistic yet lets you play the game like previous CoD games let you. What I loved so much is you had to work with your team mates or you'd die! That's right! REAL A.I.! The friendly AI is almost smarter than you are. The game sports many weapons from MP5s to AK47s to even good old RPGs. The game is about an Arab terrorist using Russia's nukes to hit the good old red, white, and blue.The campaign could have been a good two to four hours longer but the six hours you do play are fantastic and flawless...yes flawless. I never got a chance with the multiplayer but I know it's the best part about this game.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Metal Gear 4 is SOLID","reviewText":"This version of Metal Gear has to be the best. Possibly, this is the best PS3 game, yet. The story is just great. Snake must pose as a militia man and be in the middle of a war between them and the PMCs in order to Liquid Ocelot. Ocelot never will go away, will he? The militia men are the allies and the PMCs are the enemy forces. Live fighting is constantly going on between the two. You hear and see people getting killed. There's explosions and blast constantly going on. Kind of reminds me of Call of Duty 4. Now, since the PMCs are after the militia men, Snake is not their priority, like the other versions. They still must be avoided, though. While the constant fighting is going on, you are sneaking through the battle to get to your destinations. Urban warfare couldn't be more unpredictible. Every corner you turn, you may just happen to bump into some PMCs trying to get into fighting positions to destroy the militia men. Now, you must find a way to avoid them. Sometimes, you may have to kill some of them. Sometimes, killing them can be easy because they are constantly shooting at the militia men. Helping the militia men fight them is cool, too. I wouldn't say that it is the best story because I liked the fact that I got to play Big Boss in the the MGS3 Prequel. Unfortunately,the setting was in 1964. Being in the woods can be kind of boring. Plus, no modern weapons during those times. The weaponry is great and unlike other Metal Gear titles, you can obtain weapons by killing an enemy or finding one. Plus, you can upgrade weapons however you choose. Weapons can also be sold in order to get better weapons This is something that no other Metal Gear title has never offered. The graphics are as good as it gets. Heck, they were pretty good in the other Metal Gear titles, so you figured that the graphics would be a huge step up. I love the gadgets. I love the MkII robot, who can scout for you. The Snake Eye is cool. Plus, the oil drums can be hidden in and used to roll over enemies. I like the new CQC moves. Also, the cutscenes keep you feeling as if you are in a movie. Overall, this game lives up to the hype. It is clearly the best Metal Gear. There really aren't many flaws in this game or the story, so far. This game is definitely a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Subject7","summary":"Pretty good but...","reviewText":"Visually, GTA5 is quite beautiful and more colorful than GTA4. It also has an impressive amount of customization available for your characters and their vehicles, with online even allowing you to choose your character's sex. The controls are pretty good except in the case of undersea diving which feels like trying to control a floating rock. Flying is difficult but in a (somewhat) fair way that ensures that those skilled enough will have an advantage over those who are not. Being pretty good at it myself, I was able to outmaneuver a higher level player online. He had an attack chopper while I had a civilian chopper so it was basically a fun cat and mouse chase, only the mouse was Speedy Gonzales and the cat was Sylvester.The main story is gripping to the end and the multiple smaller stories you find throughout offer great distractions. Admittedly however, I disliked virtually everyone in this entire game. The characters from GTA4 were sympathetic and quite likable, but everyone in GTA5 is greedy, self-absorbed or just plain psychotic. The dialogue is atrocious and beyond excessive with every curse word imaginable being used for little to no good reason. Niko Bellic (GTA4) cursed in moderation and only when he was under extreme duress so you knew when things just got serious. But here, \"f***\" and \"c***\" are as common as \"the\" and \"is\". Another nitpick is the game's overall feeling of restraint. Compared to say Just Cause 2 or Saint's Row 3 and 4, GTA5 seems hellbent on keeping fun as far out of your reach as possible. The police are relentless, acquiring military vehicles is extremely difficult, your character's life bar is rather small and body armor gives little protection.Finally there's online which is a mixed bag. Often it's a ton of fun, whether you're working with other players or trying not to get killed in crossfire. Other times however, it's barren and tedious. On average, it takes me 10 to 30 tries to get a good session populated by more than 2 other players (5 and over is best). I don't know if the recent release of both Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghost is the cause, but wandering aimlessly throughout San Andreas alone and bored is not how I planned to experience GTA online. Each activity pays between a few hundred to $20,000 (high rewards usually require more players). In a game where the best things are priced with 6 digits (and in some cases 7), coupled with too many inactive sessions, money gain and leveling is often too slow.If you can look past the excessive language, inactive online sessions, and more subdued but realistic open world experience, then GTA5 is a good buy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

Rainbow Six 3 is a first person shooter; with sqaud tactics. This is NOT an arcade shooter like &quot;Quake&quot;. In the Rainbow Six world, you can get killed with a few well placed shots. You need to be stealthy and think of the best way to kill your targets. You will be fighting along with three cpu AI. By giving simple commands such as hold, regroup, bang open and clear and much more. You will be killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, and disarming bombs.Graphics (10)- the enviroments are nicely done, with detailed buildings (interiors and exteriors), weather effects; snow, rain, night time. Good use of light and shadows. The character models looks nice and animate smoothly, firing weapons with recoil action and reloading as well. The animation also uses &quot;rag doll&quot; physics, so when someone gets shot it will look realistic; shoot them in the shoulder to send them in a half spin, shoot in the head and see them jolt back violently with blood splattering the wall behind. The weapons look and fire realisticly. Everything looks wonderful in RS3.Sound (10)- The sounds are excellent and add to the intensity of the game. Going from dead silence, to hearing gun fire and the thunderous booms in grenades, people screaming in pain with shot, different footsteps in wood, snow, gravel. Terrorists speak in different langauges, tense music and you got yourself an earful of great sounds.Controls (9)- The controls are efficient and easy to learn. But if you have trouble, you can always go back into the in-game tutorial which trains you on the different button functions. Getting around is easy as a first person shooter can be. And giving orders to your teammates is as easy as holding one button then pressing a commmand. One button switches weapons, the other trigger to fire and another to reload. If you buy the head-set with the game, then things will be even more easy to give commands to your teammates. You tell them to &quot;frag open clear&quot; and you'll see your team carefully open a door, toss a grenade into room, then run in with their guns blazing to finish the job.Gameplay (10)- RS3 is an amazing game not only because it looks, sounds and controls great but, also because the gameplay is intense. It made me jump out of my seat. One of my favorite levels; I went with my team into several houses, sometimes the wooden floors in the house wood creak and alert the enemies, so they hid behind furniture trying to ambush me. I would hear wind howling and suddenly gunfire breaks out and I see my teammates shooting it out with enemies in the distance. The outcome is fast and deadly as you can get killed by 3 shots or less &lt;depending on what type of weapon is used&gt;. The artificial intelligence in the game is excellent. You'll see them ducking for cover, peaking around corners, tossing grenades to flush out groups, sometimes the enemies surrender by dropping their weapons and putting their hands up. Other times they go into a berserker rage; screaming while running towards you and firing wildly. While other times they try to ambush you. Your teammates are equally smart and will use appropriate tactics. In one of the coolest battles: an enemy hid behind a car, so I sent my team to try and sneak up on him. The enemy panicked and ran out of cover shooting at my team, then one of my teammates did a strafe move and shot the enemy dead. When that happened the other enemy terrorists opened fire trying to kill my team. But my team was smart enough to use cover and fired back, the shoot out got heavy, So I threw a grenade at the baddies and blew one of them away, but one survived. My teammates smothered him with bullets.Rainbow Six 3, excels in everything and should be in your collection if you like first-person-shooting- simulations. The controls, sounds, gameplay and artificial intelligence in the game make it one of the best games to date!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2003"}

The epic presentation matches the story - many games threaten you with the end of the world, but so few games have the cajones to actually carry out global destruction over the course of the narrative.Final Fantasy VI also to me hit a sweet spot in it's difficulty,it's challenging enough to keep you interested but never becomes so hard That it's makes you want to explode with anger. To me that's ideal as I usually play video game to escape stress,not add to it.Final Fantasy VI also seemed More fun to to me then any other Final Fantasy.The music is fantastic as well.Now here's the part were i explain why FFVI ascends the turn based Rpg(my favorite genre),and become the best game i ever played.A lot of games i've played after a few years start to bore me,but even though i've been playing this game since 2006 i have yet to get bored.Any game that still can feel fun after 6 years and over 20 playthroughs is to me is worthy of being called one of the best games ever.However,Final Fantasy VI is top of the top,the best of the best,because It did something no other game has done for me it mad me so immersed in the gameplay and the story that when sad moments happened i cried,and joyful moments i was happy,and when I finally met the main villian,i hated him. No game has ever done that for me before,or since.Why is that? I think because alot of games focus more on one aspect,then trying to balance everything out.Like Some games focus on the story,others focus on the gameplay and a few games were too easy or too hard for me to truly enjoy them.Some day I'm sure there will be a game i find a game i like more then this,and honestly I can't wait.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2013"}

The battle system was great and there was lots of monsters to pick from to create my own team besides the familiars that oliver starts out with. There was some grinding required to pass on normal mode and beat the bounty monsters but grinding is easy just stay in the perdida area and kill the tokotokos that are in that area and cast veil before they see you to gain the advantage and first strike, easy 8,000+ experience per each tokotoko!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

White \"Dragnilar\"","summary":"A new franchise is born!","reviewText":"An incredible action game that takes aspects from inovative platformers such as Mario 64 and blends them with intense action from the likes of Devil May Cry and Dynasty Warriors. Let us not forget the immense amount of Greek mythology that is being employed though, as God of the War is without a doubt one of the best 'Greek' games to have appeared on any console in ages. In fact, it might just be the best one yet. Featuring all of the classic Greek characters and monsters that we have all come to know, God of War will be enjoyable to many due to just it's sheer accessability. It also has a great storyline to boot, featuring the slow yet intense character development of a man who has been driven into madness by his thirst for power and his fall from grace by murdering the only people he loved. He is now left to explore only one goal: revenge upon the one being who gave him the power that he has today. And so comes the title of the game and it's eventual last boss: \"GOD OF WAR\".Moving on, the soundtrack to God of War is very good as well, but it could use some work in places. The music is a little dreary from time to time, and it seems to just repeat on the same few notes when you're in certain places. The music does though capture the feel of ancient Greece rather well, but one could become rather bored with it rather fast if they were listening to it out of context. Beyond that though, the music performs wonderfully, especaly with the way it is used to cue in and cue out battles. The music will end on epic notes and choruses as you expel all of your foes from a room, for example. The sound effects in the game are also very well picked, as they all give you the feel that you are watching a movie. And the voice acting fits perfectly with the theme and setting of the game.The graphics in God of War are also very good. The way the light reflects off of everything and the detail put into the cinimatics makes you sometimes forget that you are playing a PS2 video game. They also make you wonder if the limits of the PS2 have been indeed reached. There is a slight flaw with the graphics though, as the cinimatics do sometimes not seem to capture the emotion that the main character feels when he is yelling. The artists also seemed to have had a bit of a problem putting expressions on people's faces at times...Despite the graphic errors though, God of War has a lot of power packed into it. This leads to some very addictive game play (which is a sign of a very good game.) It also has a lot of replay value built into it, with the unlockable content that you receive from completing the highest difficulty, the different costumes in the game, and the frustrating challange of the gods mode. All in all, God of War is very well worth the hype, and leaves us hoping for a great number of sequils in the future.I actually would give this game a 4.5, but due to Amazon not allowing for such a rating, I had to round up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00BY0G0YU","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"A wonderful HD update with very few reservations!","reviewText":"I grew up with the Final Fantasy series and have been a fan until recently.  I count Final Fantasy X among the best - some might criticize the story, others critique the less 'ATB' focused battles - but I think it was an entry with a winning formula.  I will discuss the differences and some pros and cons comparing this to the PS2 version.  Oh, Final Fantasy X-2 was a lot of fun also - very different at the time, but I'll post a bit about that as well.Cons:- Remastered soundtrack.  Look, I love the remastered version!  But many of the songs vary quite a bit from the originals.  Most noticeably is the battle music.  It's great, but it's much more intense and a bit louder than before.  It's quite jarring.  Luca's theme for example is also a bit odd - some weird sound effects which sound out of place.  But other tracks, such as Zanarkand, Yuna's theme, the Shine themes, and especially the boss themes - are great improvements.  So pro and con I guess.- Loading times.  Yes, Final Fantasy X on the PS2 had nearly unnoticeable loading times.  No loading screen.  HD graphics in this game for sure, but the loading times are a bit much, especially when it's a long load for a six second flashback to Tidus as a kid.- NPCs.  Yes, they are rough.  The graphics were tweaked, but the non players are very rough and it shows.  The other problem is that they left the sprite glitching.  So when a character puts his/her hand on another's shoulder, the glitchy gap still appears.  I would have hoped they would have fixed some of these minor interaction issues.- Character dubbing / mouths.  Yes the dub is great.  But I would have loved a Japanese audio.  Mainly because the higher resolution graphics REALLY demonstrate the disparity in the speech and the mouth movements.  It's borderline comical at times.  Reminds me of Bruce Lee films!Okay, so that sounds really nitpicky - and it is!  But let me tell you what you get that makes this a solid FIVE star re-release.+ Widescreen baby!  All I really wanted was a true widescreen version of this game and Square Enix delivered!+ Gorgeous graphics.  Just think about this - it's still basically a PS2 game but with updated textures and 3D rendering.  So there is a lot of the PS2 edging, but much has been smoothed out.  You really notice the smoothing vs edging on Tidus' hood.  That is the most common thing I noticed.  But the background textures pop vividly.  Again - this isn't a true PS3 game - so it isn't going to have Final Fantasy 13's level of graphics.+ Two and a half games in one!  And an interactive novel of sorts...  But it does leave us wondering if there might be one more sequel to this series.  The main treats are Final Fantasy X and X-2 of course.  Also added in some interesting extra challenges into the games - secret bosses and such!  =)+ $39.99 release price for Special Edition and subsequent standard edition.  A great value.  Especially since this is a solid, main line game from SE.  Consider: many remakes of Dragon Quest, for example, were the same release price for DS.  Granted - those are full overhauls - but still, the point can be made - amazing content for the price.+ And finally - what I consider among the best Final Fantasy games.  The additional challenges in the monster arena, for example,  were some of the great joys.  It's not a hard Final Fantasy game - the Aeons are incredibly overpowered - but it's an engrossing game.  Everyone will have their particular favorites of course, but I count X among the better of the more recent systems Final Fantasy titles - and much better than a LOT of the PS2 RPGs out there (with some exceptions of course!)If you haven't played it, this is a solid RPG that deserves a run through.  It's an amazing experience.  And the addition of X-2, which is great fun, but kind of a wonky, fan service type of story, is a great bonus.  Both games are highly recommended.  And bonus story and content never hurts!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00BY0G0YU","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"\"Listen to My Story...\"","reviewText":"In 2001, the original Final Fantasy X came out and single-handedly brought the JRPG into the PS2 generation.  It was a remarkable feat.  It had a brilliant story, a good combat system and a soundtrack that was to die for.  It quickly became recognized as one of the greatest JRPGs you could find on the PS2.  It has had it's ardent fans and ardent haters alike.  It is a game that garnered a lot of strong responses from gamers.  Square-Enix is a little late at jumping on the HD bandwagon, but if there was one game in their catalog that definitely deserved one, it was Final Fantasy X.  Final Fantasy X-2 is here as well, but it did not make the same splash as its predecessor.  There are some things about Final Fantasy X that are still brilliant.  It's nice to relive it and to experience it again.  As for Final Fantasy X-2, though I would not claim it to be as memorable as the first one it had some great gameplay elements that still hold up well today.Final Fantasy X centers on Tidus.  He is a star Blitzball player, like his father before him.  One night during a game a mysterious entity called Sin attacks and takes Tidus from his home and sends him into the land of Spira.  There he meets Yuna, a summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to the various temples in Spira so that she can have the power to destroy Sin.  Final Fantasy X has a lot to its story.  It had a lot of well developed characters, but mostly it was willing to tackle a lot of themes.  In particular, the large amount of time it spends looking at the fictional religion of Yu Yevon and the teachings present.  It's quite a story.  It is only a shame that the voice acting isn't that especially good.  Final Fantasy X didn't have great voice acting in 2001 and it's certainly not better now.  It's a good story but the voice acting takes some time to adapt to.  Final Fantasy X-2, by comparison, does a slightly better job (although not by a whole lot).The gameplay in Final Fantasy X still resonates quite well.  There are random battles to be fought, but the battle system was quite intuitive at the time.  You always know the order in which you and your enemies will take action.  This allows for lots of strategy and planning as opposed to being quick on your feet.  For some this made the game easy, for others it allowed for them to have more control over combat.  Each character also had an overdrive gauge which was very similar to Final Fantasy VII's limit breaks.  When the gauge is full you can use an overdrive attack, which is a powerful attack.  Each character also has their own uses and \"job\" in battle.  Tidus is good at hitting agile enemies, Wakka hits flying enemies with ease while others miss, Auron has piercing attacks, Lulu casts her magic, Rikku steals and disassembles machines and Kimahri can absorb abilities of his enemies and use them.  But the most interesting is Yuna who can summon aeons that you'll use in battle.  Each with their own set of abilities and attacks.  You can also switch characters in battle at any time provided that they are not knocked out.  Every character shares in experience.The most amusing aspect of Final Fantasy X was the sphere grid.  The sphere grid is Final Fantasy X's unique level up system that has certainly influenced some RPGs (most notably Tales of Xillia).  Each character gains sphere levels and follows a path along the sphere grid.  You activate various nodes using spheres to raise your stats and learn abilities.In a nutshell many of these elements in Final Fantasy X still hold up.  Final Fantasy X-2, on the other hand, was somewhat polarizing back in 2003.  Yet, for what it's worth, over a decade later it's really not a bad game by any means.  The story is not as strong and neither are some of the characters.  On the other hand, it is a more open world than Final Fantasy X.  In particular, the battle system is still fast paced and fun.  It goes back to the ATB battle system instead.  Each character has access to dress spheres where they learn various abilities to be used in battle.  The jobs affect how fast they attack and this makes Final Fantasy X-2 a fun game to battle in.  The system is unique.  Each job plays its own role.  White mages heal, thieves steal and warriors attack.  Final Fantasy X-2 has such a non-linear approach it can come across as quite tough and challenging at times.There are some moments in Final Fantasy X-2's tone that certainly clash from time to time with Final Fantasy X.  Where as Final Fantasy X is quite sad in many respects and downtrodden, X-2 is a lot more upbeat.  Both games are rather fun to play, but fans probably still see Final Fantasy X-2 as being a less \"serious\" game.  Originally when I played Final Fantasy X-2, I did not care for it.  Here, I'm okay with it.  The battle system is fun.  And while the story isn't nearly as good as the first one, it's not necessarily bad either.The HD Remaster has quite a few things of note, however.  While I would like to point out the HD visuals first, I'd rather start with the fact that this is the international version of the game.  Meaning that for North American players there's a wealth of new content.  First and foremost, the sphere grid.  There is now a standard and expert version of the grid.  The expert grid allows for slightly more flexability.  Where as the standard grid kept most characters contained to their own section, the expert one lets you divert a lot sooner.  This means characters may learn other characters abilities sooner rather than later.  It is also a less straightforward path.  The expert sphere grid will require more grinding.  There are more paths that diverge.  Where as the standard is a more straightforward path, the expert sphere requires you to be a lot more aware of what you're doing.  You might find yourself going back one direction just to get an ability you missed.  The standard sphere grid will, for the most part, take every character to every ability along their path, but the expert sphere grid is less concerned with that.  It can make the game harder or easier.  The reality is that you need to zero in on what you want sooner rather than later.  The expert sphere grid alone can give you a totally different experience with Final Fantasy X.  I would highly recommend veteran players go with it.  Newcomers should stick to the standard grid.The other big addition are the dark Aeons.  In 2001 North American players completely missed out on this optional quest.  These are ruthlessly challenging bosses with millions of HP, requiring the best and boldest from players.  Likewise, there is another hidden boss called Penance  These bits of extra content are worth your time if you're willing to invest it.  But most of all, they make Final Fantasy X worth revisiting even for those who mastered it over a decade ago.Final Fantasy X-2 doesn't really include much (if any) extra content, unfortunately.  No new bosses or story elements.  But the collection as a whole does include \"Final Fantasy X-2\" Last Mission as well as a prologue to Final Fantasy X-2.  There is also an audio credits sequence.  In terms of whether or not you're getting your bang for your buck it's no argument... you are getting a lot of content for the asking price.There are some other notable changes.  The visuals are actually quite noticeable.  The font of the text is different, for instance.  But more important, the actual look and art style is more expressive and vibrant.  It looks fantastic and it runs in 1080p.  Not only that, but it's just a smoother looking game.  A lot of HD remakes neglect to touch up on some of the pre-rendered stuff but Final Fantasy X and X-2 certainly do.  Even the prerendered scenes have no muddied textures or blotches.  They're also in 16:9 like the regular game.  It's clear there was a lot of care taken with this one.  Lastly, the music has been rearranged.  While I still remember the original soundtrack quite clearly some of the new arrangements definitely do justice to the original tunes.  Final Fantasy X-2 does not have a rearranged soundtrack, however.  It's a good sounding game.  The voice acting on the other hand isn't that good.  As I said, it wasn't that good back in 2001, but now it just sounds terribly outdated.  You almost wish they had re-recorded the voices.  I'm not too especially bothered by it, however.  The gameplay and story trumps it and there's something deliciously nostalgic about bad voice acting and.There are smaller things that I'm somewhat picky about.  Chief among them is that Final Fantasy X spends a lot of time expressing its dialog in various cutscenes.  The option to skip them isn't present.  I wish Square had added that for when one decides to replay as some moments can get a little dragged out.  Likewise, with the audio there are moments when the game has small hiccups or pauses before other characters begin speaking.  The dialog doesn't always flow naturally because there are moments when the next line has to load.  Those nitpicks aside there isn't much reason not to get this HD collection if you loved Final Fantasy X and X-2.  Even if you liked one and didn't like the other, there's enough content to justify the purchase of just one game.  Square-Enix included a lot of stuff here that makes it worthwhile for fans.  The version I had also came with an artbook and it's gorgeous.  It has an introduction by Yoshinori Kitase, the game's producer.  It's a neat little artbook that comes with the Limited Edition of the game.Overall, I'm satisfied with this HD reissue.  Final Fantasy X was a fairly remarkable game to me and it still remains so.  The updates and care taken to the game are worthwhile.  For fans of these games, it is certainly work taking the time for that trip down memory lane.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2014"}

However, does that mean it stacks up as a game by itself?In No More Heroes, the player takes the role of Travis Touchdown, a 27-year-old fanboy living in a small apartment in California. After obtaining a Beam Katana - essentially a lightsaber - by winning an online auction, Travis decides to become the #1 ranked assassin in the world. The game is divided into two types: Trying to move up the ranks from #11 to #1 by challenging the ranked assassins above you, or working to get enough money to enter an official petition to go after the next assassin.The assassin challenges are the combat segments. You run through an area fighting various low-level goons before reaching the boss - the ranked assassin. Travis' beam katana is the main weapon in combat. It is swung with the A button, but will strike differently depending on if it is in high stance (the Wii remote held straight up) or low stance (the Wii remote held to the side). The beam saber can also be charged up for a larger attack. Enemies who are injured enough are \"finished off\" by waving the Wii remote in the direction indicated on the screen for a final, bisecting slash. The beam saber has a short battery that is drained by attacking and guarding, and drained even more by a charge attack. Once the battery is dead, neither attacking nor guarding is possible with the beam saber. To charge the battery back up, the Wii remote has to be shaken up and down to \"get the juices flowing again\". Besides his saber, Travis also has an array of unarmed attacks, including punches, kicks, and throws, that can be done without draining the sword's battery. The fighting in the game is fun and decent, with some innovative uses of the Wii remote - it really feels like they're trying to make the Wii remote a part of the fighting and not just a gimmick. However, in terms of gameplay, it's overshadowed by more pure-action games like Ninja Gaiden. On its own, though, it's reasonably fun.The money-gathering parts of the game are significantly less fun. Later in the game, Travis can use his reputation as an assassin to take assassination jobs (which are combat segments), but for the early parts of the game Travis will have to take regular part-time jobs. Everything from mowing lawns to collecting garbage to sweeping for mines is included in this part. They're essentially mini-games; there's only a few of them (nine total), but you have to keep doing them to earn more and more money. They're kind of a drag to do over and over, and really, if you can just do a repetitive activity like this in a game, you might as well do it in real life and earn some real money. Of course, it doesn't seem like it was meant to be fun, anyways.Besides submitting challenges, it's also possible to buy various new items with your money. Travis' entire wardrobe is customizable with new clothing, and in addition he can buy new beam swords to increase his performance. Travis' apartment is the main base of the game; Travis can change options and equipment, as well as simply sit back and enjoy himself by watching tv or playing with his pet cat.The graphics are a neat cel-shaded style, with lots of blood, but in technical terms it doesn't look great. It looks, to be honest, like a Gamecube game more than anything else. Furthermore, the lighting isn't very good, and shadows tend to obscure way more than they should, so it's hard to see things. Overall, it looks really dated, and this tends to detract from the action sequences. The sound is pretty good in voice acting terms but not great music-wise.Overall, No More Heroes has some interesting ideas, but the creators' desires to push boundaries ultimately causes the game to be less fun overall. It seems more like an experiment than a real game, and despite some neat innovations with the Wii remote (including some parts where the remote is held to the player's ear and used as a radio), it's really not that fun of a game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2008"}

{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories........","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories is, essentially, a 3D remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories that was released on the Gameboy Advance. It was released as a standalone title here in North America but was originally the second disc of Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ in Japan.The game itself starts off exactly where the first game ends. Upon which, Sora and the gang follow a mysterious man(whom we find out later on is part of Organization XIII) into Castle Oblivion. Sora is given a card and is told that \"The more you find out, the more you lose.\". That's, basically, where the game begins. What makes this game different than the other game is the fact that when you're in battle you use cards to make your moves. There are cards for attacks, magic, combos, etc. These cards can temporarily run out, so to replenish them you have to charge them. If you completely run out of cards during your battle, you can't continue fighting. Like other card games(Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic:The Gathering); you collect cards, make decks to use, drop cards that are of no use to you, or combine them to make more powerful cards. Some cards unlock certain rooms to help progress you through the game. Some cards take you to rooms that hold valuable treasure. When you level up, you have a choice of either having more HP, being able to hold more cards or learning newer abilites. What you do is completely up to you. Yet, be warned-gamer, Strategy is the key to this game so choose your cards wisely. As in Yu-Gi-Oh or Magic:The Gathering; the cards you choose could work for you or completely against you. Once you learn that one thing, beating the game is fairly easy. You'll end up wishing there was more to the game once it is done. Course, lol, there is more to the game as you get to play through the story as Riku but you start the process all over again and play through the same scenarios. Still, playing the card game is awesome.Honestly, though, the only thing I loved about Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories was the fact that it was done in 3-D and the few extras they added onto the game such as the \"Reaction Command\" function from Kingdom Hearts II and new cutscenes and battles that weren't in the original game. Otherwise, I prefer the Gameboy Advance version better. Least, with that version, you can carry it around with you and play on the go.Do I think it is worthy of getting? Oh, Definitely. Don't let certain reviewers here stop you from making a purchase just because they couldn't get into it. The same might not hold true for you. If you like card games, you're bound to like this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2010"}

Smith \"otherthani\"","summary":"Far Cry 2 is Far off the Mark","reviewText":"Id like to preface my review by stating that in no way has my opinion of the game been swayed by the DRM used for piracy protection by Ubisoft. This review is solely in regards to the gameplay itself.With my pure enjoyment of Far Cry and Crysis, I was extremely excited about the release of this game. Unfortunatly when I began playing the game, I became more and more disappointed as I played. In fact, if it werent for the graphics, this would easily be considered an instant bargin bin title.I have so many gripes about this game that Im not quite sure where to begin, so I will start with my biggest one... the firefights. You have so much against you from the very beginning that it is extremely difficult to find them enjoyable. In fact you feel as though you are being punished just for taking the mission. Your gun will continuously jam. You have malaria, so in the middle of a gunfight you may need to pop a pill to get over it (everything turns yellow and fuzzy). If your health gets low (and it will... continually from all the sharpshooters they have in Africa) you must first pull the bullet out, then.. you must heal yourself. I must ask... why?? I suppose it was to add tension, but only succedes in being frustrating. You will die often... not because you get overwhealmed by the (incredibly stupid) AI, but because of a gun jam, having to heal yourself with a two step process or because you get a malaria outbreak.As I get off that rant, I invite you to another. Lets investigate the whole \"sandbox, free roam, open world...\" direction in which the developers decided to take with this sequel. First off the compass is horrible and the map is even worse. Not because they are a bad concept... they work extremely well in GTA and games of the like. The problem is, your objective is sooooo far away that even when you pull out your map, because it isnt a full map, all you see is the general direction you are supposed to be going and not able to pinpoint the best route to take or where exactly your objective is. This is compounded by the fact that you hit several checkpoints (more on these later) that ensue a \"forced\" firefight... and I believe I already explained how much fun they are. It will take you at least 10 minutes to get from point A to point B because of this. Rediculous.Now, remember the checkpoints. These lovely roadblocks are apparently set up by guerillas (no... not gorillas) who attack you when you come close. I guess that makes sense, however, the frustrating part is after you destroy a checkpoint, they respawn so every time you drive by, you get attacked again and again and again. If you try to blast through in your vehicle, a car chase ensues.... sounds like fun right? Wrong, because no matter how fast you are going, they magically appear behind you and if they shoot your vehicle 3 or 4 times, it stalls. And I bet you thought the engine was in the front of the vehicle. So, because of this you end up getting out of your vehicle and... you guessed it, a firefight begins... malaria.... damn... gun jammed... shot need health... pull out the bullet... use medi.... dead.Finally the vehicles themselves. For some reason, the geniuses at Ubisoft only give a 1st person view of driving... so you try to drive, look at map and compass at the same time and because the vehicle handles so poorly you hit a boulder and the vehicle stalls out, so you get in front of the vehicle and fix it. Get back in and hit a lovely checkpoint further up.There are several other nuances in the game like no checkpoints... well theres lots of those, but I mean autosave points... so hit F5 ALOT or your 10 minute trip from point A to point B can take you 30 minutes. There isnt really much of a story here to be found either, so you really just find yourself doing side missions... even the main missions seem like side missions which dont give you much of a feeling of accomplishment.I realize I have been on quite a rant, and most of my reviews are not as negative or sarcastic as this. As a matter a fact I dont think I have given a single star review to anything before... but this game definitly deserves it. As I attempt to leave with a positive remark, I am at a loss. I could mention the graphics, however theyre really not better than the original Far Cry... and I can max them out on my machine.I was extremely disappointed and feel my $60 was just wasted. Ive played the game for about 11 hours, and cannot bring myself to finish it... and thats an extreme rarity for me. With all the great games coming out this year, spend your money on something else.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}

From the screen caps and the description it certainly sounded like Far Cry. Large, non-linear maps; Realistic weapons; Lots of vehicles; Stealth and sniping; Lush, vivid environments. So what if there was no mention of mutant gorillas or mad scientists tinkering with genes? It's not like they can give away the entire plot on the back of the box, right?Well, there are no mutants, no Faustian knock-offs. Aside from the hang-gliders strewn across the map there is little here that indicates a direct inspiration from Far Cry. The storyline and characters from the original do not appear anywhere in this sequel, nor is there any tropical island scenery. Other than the machete (now your default - and unswappable - weapon) none of the guns from the original's arsenal are available. If you were looking for a nostalgic return to the islands, and possibly more cut scenes of Val in her unmentionables, then Far Cry 2 is sure to disappoint.However, if your tastes go beyond a mere sequel, or if you have not even played the original Far Cry then you might be pleasantly surprised by this title. This is one exceptionally detailed and finely crafted game. That's not to say that it doesn't have its quirks, but overall Far Cry 2 is an astounding achievement.Some Highlights and Irritations:- Incredibly detailed environment: Seriously, the pseudo-african \"nation\" where this game takes place has been intricately and lovingly crafted. Even at the medium settings the scenery is practically photo realistic and at the ultra-high settings it becomes a framerate killing showpiece for the graphics engine. Only a dedicated gaming PC will be able to handle the top-tier settings and still remain playable, but like I said, even on medium the game's environment is gorgeous. Grass, trees, and plants sway in the breeze; zebras wander the grasslands and gazelles will sprint across the dusty roads as they hear your jeep approach. There's a day and night cycle, weather... I could list the details all day, but the point is that the scenery really lets you immerse yourself in this fictional world.- Realistic Weapons: Far Cry 2 features real-world weapons (or exact approximations thereof) from old stand-bys like the AK-47 to the more exotic grenade and rocket launchers. You won't find any completely out of place gluon-guns or experimental laser pistols here - the core concept is realism, so your choices reflect the types of weapons (one assumes) you could actually find in a black market shop in war torn country. Each weapon is incredibly detailed, both visually and in terms of game play mechanics: each weapon has a realistic fire rate, recoil and damage associated with it. Weapon reliability also plays an important role, as guns will jam with increasing frequency over time and will eventually break altogether. Weapons picked up from fallen foes are visibly rusty and worn and extremely unreliable . This adds an interesting aspect to the game play as you have to weigh your weapon selections wisely. For longer missions you may opt for the less accurate but more reliable weapon, and out in the field you might switch to your pistol rather than risk grabbing that crummy assault rifle your enemy just dropped. There is a good range and variety of weapons - several sniper rifles, pistols, heavy and light machine guns, assault rifles and shotguns. In addition to the standard FPS arsenal you can use IED's, (basically these serve a your remotely detonated explosives), a mortar (yes, a friggin' mortar), two types of rocket and grenade launchers and a crossbow that fires explosive tipped arrows. For the stealth fans there is a scoped dart-rifle, silenced pistol, mk5 and shotgun. Grenades and Molotovs are your standard throwables.- Destructible everything: Pretty scenery is nice but if the environment is no more than a backdrop it does little to heighten the gamin experience. Fortunately, the environment in Far Cry 2 plays an integral role, offering cover, vantage points and multiple approaches to both the player and the AI, and creating a dynamic playing field where a safe spot can suddenly become a death trap as the battle takes its toll. Some structures are entirely destructible and will come crashing down around you if hit by a grenade. Others have roofs of straw that offer little protection from mortar rounds, or corrugated walls that allow larger caliber rounds to penetrate through. Almost everything that can burn in real life - the grass, trees, wooden posts and planks, can catch fire - fuel barrels, propane tanks, and other explosive containers can be set off by brush fires or errant rounds, quickly spreading flames and chaos. In this ever changing environment you learn to scout your targets and throw your grenades wisely.- Virtual Sandbox: The game is basically a wide-open playground that allows you to approach objectives at your own pace and with whatever tactics your prefer. If you like to run in shooting with a SAW and tossing grenades left and right then the game gives you plenty of ways to sate your appetite for explosions. If you like the silent approach then you have a decent selection of stealthier weapons to assist you, not to mention, you can choose to prowl elusively under the cover of darkness. How you enter a  fight has consequences beyond the current battle: because this is a continuous map (with no loading screens) your activities will draw attention from enemy positions nearby. If you make a lot of noise you will have to deal with reinforcements - suddenly the sleepy safe house with 2 guards is swarming with Jeeps and is in the scope of a distant sniper. Alternately, if you are discovered sneaking into camp you'll find yourself engaged in a close range fire-fight where your arsenal of stealth weapons is badly outclassed.Minor irritations:- No leaning: Unlike Far Cry you can not lean out of cover. I don't know why this useful combat feature is not present here but it bugs me to have to not be able to lean in and out while taking cover behind a wall or doorway.- No scope \"bounce\": For a game as dedicated to realism as this one, it was disappointing to find that the scoped sights don't move an iota (in real-life it is impossible to keep your hands/arms completely still. This natural movement is amplified when you view an object through binoculars or a scope, making long range targeting much more difficult). This reduces even the longest range shots to a simple matter of pointing and clicking. This is a major oversight for an FPS like this, particularly given that Far Cry had this feature.- Invisible walls and unscalable objects: Of course there has to be some type of border somewhere, the map can't go on forever. What irks me is when you run into invisible walls in the middle of a map where the game designers simply decided they didn't want you to go. Too often you'll spot a great location to scout or snipe from only to find it is artificially inaccessible. A similarly frustrating quirk is that you sometimes will not be able to jump or climb up to a height (like a rock, or the hood of a car) that is at the players waist level. There are occasions where you get the option to climb up on something, but these appear to have been specifically programmed in. This wouldn't have been such a big deal if the diamond side quest, which has you looking for hidden suitcases containing rough diamonds, didn't frequently take you to rocky ledges and so forth where the next step up seems just above the characters ability to jump up to.At the end of the day this is a fantastic game for those looking for a well-crafted, non-linear FPS. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2010"}

First thing I noticed. You CAN walk while you aim. Yeah. You can walk.

Survival horror 101.You can NOT shoot from the hip. Basic Third-person feature. If you've played Gears of War, you can SHOOT WITHOUT FOCUS-AIMING. What kind of game.. doesn't have such a basic feature? What kind of game forces you to AIM in order to shoot your weapon?Lastly : This one just proves that EA has no idea they are doing : Isaac is STILL the protagonist. In the Survival Horror genre sequels have new main characters. (See : Silent Hill, Resident Evil) Dead Space's major flaw is that it should NOT HAVE THE SAME PROTAGONIST.Survival Horror is filled with locked doors that can NEVER open. THERE ARE NO KEYS FOR THESE DOORS. EA tries to open these doors with Dead Space.. and no. Dead Space 2 is not a survival horror game and it's not better than Medal of Honor, Halo, and it's not the game of the year and it has nothing to do with Assassin's Creed.Just play Plants Vs.

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2H4","description":"","reviewerName":"Lionheart","summary":"Good, Not-So-Clean Fun","reviewText":"A good game that starts out like garbage. Somehow the president of the Saints Row street gang becomes the President of the United States. A few dumb jokes are told, then an alien invasion takes place. You're shooting lasers at malformed mutants in the White House, and your eyelids are drooping.But soon it picks up: the aliens abduct \"the President\" and drop him/her into a digital version of Steelport that they've created (apparently) for their own amusement. It's sort of like the Matrix, except the Neo here is fully aware from the beginning. And like him, once you get to know the rules of the place, you can bend them.This clever little scheme by the Saints Row folks has its positives and negatives:+you can do things you could never do (but always wanted to do) in a GTA-type world, like jump over buildings, pick up and throw cars with your mind, \"freeze\" enemies, etc.+new takes on the same old side missions and games; for example, you are not just \"completing activities,\" when you win a race, but destablizing the system (and incidentally giving a big up yours to the aliens who devised the thing)+more complex and intelligent missions: for example, there is a mission where you need to steal a robot to download an helpful A.I. into. Compare that to the usual snatch the bag of dope or diamonds thing.+nearly unlimited customization. Again, much like Neo, you can have things as you want them.+the creation of chaos and the loosing of blood is encouraged -- that's actually the goal. That will destabilize the system and give the \"President\" the upper hand. No more holding back for moral reasons -- nobody here is real anyway, except you.-Nobody is real except you (and a companion or two). So the driving around, shooting people up, interacting with pedestrians, is all pointless unless it's irritating the aliens.-With super powers like super sprinting and jumping, why drive to get where you want to go? Answer? You don't. And that takes half the fun out of the world.-Previous games had many enemies to fight, various factions. Here there are really only aliens. You'll miss the variety.-Realism is extinguished. This game is like playing with the cheat codes on from the beginning.Still, the overall sensation is a good one. It's fast-paced. There's always plenty to do. The city is larger, with huge buildings and towers to scale for palpable rewards. You can spend hours just completing side activities, or just stay with the main plot, yet hardly notice any difference -- all missions seem to blend together. Endless surprises, crude humor, constant plot twists, blasts from the past, you name it. One of my favorite features is being able to finally customize a weapon. Gold plate that handgun, buy extended clips, make it more powerful, accurate, yes! That's what I call fun. And why I want to earn all that money.You'll miss the real world. Yep, you can customize a car, but for no point whatsoever. I did it once and never wanted to again. Waste of money. There are no \"cribs,\" either. Rather you have \"gateways\" that lead to a ship where all your gear is stored. So really, you aren't taking over the city, though the game says you are. But it doesn't feel like it. You don't buy any shops, exterminate any gangs, purchase any real estate, etc.But you'll like the alien version. Hopping all over the place, knocking cars aside like nothing, starting fires with your mind -- what's not to love? Saints Row 4 is also a little filthier than previous versions, if you know where to look. Always appreciated.Couple final notes: the soundtrack is terrible, aside from the classical station. Apparently the aliens don't know good music (other than Flava Flav!). It's still too easy to accomplish things and gain levels. The game was half over before I knew it. And I still can only have maximum 3 companions?! Come on people! The aliens bring a dozen at a time.Suggestions for Part 5: Bring it back down to earth, pick a new city, and have a Saints versus Saints thing going on.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005RKO7","reviewerName":"Marc Perez","summary":"Great game .. not the Best","reviewText":"Silent Hill is one of the most eeriest game you will ever play. My only tip is play it with somebody and have the lights on. (...) Konami gave the XboX owners some extras with the game: an Xbox-exclusive extra episode in which you play as Mary the wife of the main character. Even with the extra episode it may not be reason enough to buy it for XboX if you have played it in PS2, but it will extend your playing time for about 6-10 hours.You play as James Sunderland, a man who comes to Silent Hill after he receives a mysterious letter from his dead wife(Mary), asking him to meet her there. When you finally get there you notice that there is something very wrong, it is up to you to find out. As usual you will be spending most of the time solving puzzles but along the way killing tons of zombie-type creatures, which RARELY is a challenge (note:Enemy AI is (...)). One thing I like about the game is the mapping system, it will help you alot since you will know what areas you have missed along the way if you get stuck.The graphics and sound of the game is definitely been refined for the XboX version. The creatures in Silent Hill 2 sound as scary as they look, but their AI is something to be worked on. All in all a great game and worth the fifty bucks you will be buying it for, if not rent it. For parents out there this game is not for kids, even a 21-year old gamer like me gets nightmares from this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2001"}

It's within a class of its own due to the way it is played.You're practically playing a movie and making decisions as to how this movie unfolds.  It's astonishingly creative and its graphics are impressive as they are detailed.The theme is very strong, though, I would not advise you let anybody whose under the recommended age play this game.  Fist off they'll get bored, but should they get engaged, the theme is violent and the scenes portray the crudeness of life as the majority of people on this planet experience it.What comes close to this game on its genre is silent hill, perhaps, with a tad less beat-up action, but with a lot more drama and intensity in the gameplay.  The game shifts quickly from stagnant scenes to life-threatening, chilling situations.I was curious about buying this game, especially because it's a PS3 exclusive, the only kind of game I buy for this system.  I have to say I don't regret buying it over GOW III or Uncharted 2.I gave it four stars rating, because the game, although very interesting and engaging, seems like one big promo to Sony's Playstation Network Home channel, if you've ever played it where you enter a virtual reality and interact with other users.Although this kind of game is great, I am against the Home Channel in the sense that we're coming to a virtual reality where, well, everything is fictitious and that's how we interact.  I don't believe this is anywhere a good idea.  We need human interaction and contact.  Our intuitive minds are difficult to develop and this just doesn't help.As long as the gameplay stays in a game and not in a channel, I'm all for it, but we're really alienating ourselves from one another, and this cannot be good ever.So, yes, two thumbs up for this game, good job Sony in the innovative gameplay interaction, but please save us from a virtual reality.

Since the first game Super Mario Kart, the series has been a phenomenon.  Banana peels, turtle shells, item blocks, mushrooms, and more wacky things could only have come from the geniuses at Nintendo.  The series continued with Mario Kart 64 which brought the 3D change to the loveable kart game.  Some loved it and some hated it, but again it was a successful classic that was very enjoyable.  Now after 6 years Mario Kart: Double Dash arrives on the scene; is it as good as everyone hoped for?  Read on to find out!First a look at the graphics in general in Mario Kart: Double Dash.  As always they are colorful and vibrant, and the design of each level is very unique.  However, if you were looking for graphics that take advantage of the Gamecube's power, then you will be somewhat disappointed.  The background animation and level design is very simple and colorful, with no real graphical detail.  The characters also don't look as well rounded as in Super Mario Sunshine.  You see some pointy polygons here and there.  Overall, the game's graphical output is average, just like the Mario Party games, yet not a real distraction that will limit your fun in the game.Next is a look at the sound and music department, and again it falls below expectations.  I was expecting musical quality that rivaled Mario Kart 64, instead I get some lackluster and somewhat cheesy background music.  Just listen to the music when you finish a race and you will see my point.  However, I do commend Nintendo on the good sound effects.  The voice acting for each character is fine, as is the engine running in the karts, the clash of the different items, and the different environmental sounds.  As with the graphics, the sound is nothing that will distract you from the game, but I do suggest turning on some more upbeat music to help you get more into the competition.Finally, we come to the gameplay, now while most reviewers were disappointed with the game, I found the gameplay to be a original and refreshing change to the series.  The newest thing brought to the series is the addition of teams.  You now can choose 2 characters, and based on the combined weight, you can pick from a variety of cars.  Basically cars are measured by weight, acceleration, and overall speed.  How items work is another essential part to this new addition.  Basically there is a driver, and the item holder.  You can press the Z button to have your character switch positions during the race.  Whoever has the current item, say a shell or mushroom will be in the back, while the character without a item drives the car.  I found this tag-team style system to be very innovative and a lot of fun.  Now on to the different modes of play...There are 3 different styles of gameplay in Mario Kart: Double Dash, which include, Battle Mode for multiplayer, and Grand Prix and Time Trial for single player.  Grand Prix has 3 modes of difficulty which include 50cc, 100cc, and 150cc, each being more harder than the first.  I found the difficulty for each cc to be equally balanced, so you won't feel overwhelmed in going to the next difficulty level.  There is also 4 different cups each with 5 unique stages to take part in, each being unique in their own way.  What I also found interesting was the number of laps you will have to go, depends on the length of the course.  The miniature Baby Park requires 7 laps around it; while the much longer Luigi Circuit only has 3 laps.  Basically at the end of every race you get points depending on how well you scored, and if your team has the most points at the end of the cup, you win. Time Trials is basically what you would expect, you race around the course trying to get the best time possible.  To help you, you get 2 mushrooms to help with some extra boosting power, and you can even save your ghosts, to help you get better times by racing your previous self.Battle Mode is the multiplayer style of play that can be done with 2-4 players.  There are 3 different battle types: Balloon Fight, Bob-omb Battle, and Shine Snatch.  In Balloon Fight each team is given three balloons, and for every time you are hit with an item or fall off the stage, you lose 1.  Lose all 3 and you are out, those who played Mario Kart 64 will be familiar with this.  Bob-omb Battle is basically as the title describes, as bombs are the main weapon of choice.  Shine Snatch is kind of like capture the flag, but with a time limit.  Whoever gets the shine and can hold on to it for a certain amount of time wins.  All 3 battle modes are a lot of fun, and can provide plenty of action for parties or get togethers.All in all, Mario Kart: Double Dash isn't the best or fastest racing game out there, but it certainly is just as fun.  If you liked the previous Mario Kart games, or are looking for a great party game then be sure to check this one out.  Also, as you have noticed a Bonus Disk comes with the game, with a lot of cool stuff on it.  Sonic Heroes, Rogue Squadron III, F-Zero GX, Mario Party 5, and more all appear on the disc in demo playable form, and they are all great games.  So, be sure to pick this one up for the holiday season, you won't be disappointed!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

I hurry home to play the game and the game started out good.  The beginning cut scenes are great and the graphics are really good of Shanghai, China.  I was impressed because the graphics in this game reminded me a lot of the graphics in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.Okay here is the difference between this game and Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.  The AI in Uncharted 2 is a lot better. I played the role of Elliot Salem in the Single Player Campaign and the AI played the role of Tyson Rios.  Well, in our first firefight together I told Rios to hold fast in front of enemy soldiers while I went around to try to outflank them.  Well by the time I got around behind the enemy soldiers, all of the enemy soldiers were aready dead.  Rios had killed them all. I thought what fun was that. I wanted to fight and kill some enemy soldiers. Then the next time I told Rios to go take prisoner a enemy officer that was behind a group of enemy soldiers.  Well Rios sneaks up on the enemy officer while the enemy officer walks in front of the enemy soldiers.  Rios was able to grab the enemy officer and hold him hostage in front of all the enemy soldiers.  I thought to myself why didn't the enemy soldiers react and do anything to stop Rios from grabbing their commanding officer?  It didn't make any sense. Then I noticed when I shot at the enemy soldiers that they fall down and die way too easy.  The enemy soldiers in the first Army of Two game were a lot harder to take down and kill.Now I've only played the first part of the game and maybe it will get better later on.  I suggest for the first part of the game to play on the hardest setting.  If I notice any big differences in the game later on, I'll try to update the game with a better rating.JANUARY 20, 2010 UPDATE:  Okay, so I just finished playing the game and here are my thoughts on the game now.  The first part of the game I reviewed was the first Chapter to the Single Player Campaign. There are a total of seven Chapters to play through. The first Chapter is more like a tutorial on how to play the game. It was easy but the later Chapters got a lot harder.  The AI is actually quite good in the game.  My partner (Rios) in the game helped me out quite a bit and the enemy soldiers were pretty good at using cover to hide behind and trying to outflank you.  I love how you can upgrade your weapons and how you can use your partner in a lot of different situations to help out.  The battles and firefights throughout the game are pretty intense.  I ended up really enjoying the game.  I would recommend going out and buying the game. I give the game five stars now on my rating instead of three.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}

I had heard a lot about the screen issues on the 3000, so I went with the Daxter pack.  I am glad I did.  The screen looks great and I have little issue with it.  It is light, looks great and plays well.  This package, obviously, comes with Daxter.  I started playing it and it's a fun game.  It also comes with a 1 GB memory card and a Family Guy UMD.  I had previously only played the initial release of the PSP, and the load times seem to have improved.

With the current price($17.45), worth getting.My cons:1.  The controls:a.  Not that responsive.  I must've clicked on one button 3 times before it actually did what I want it to do.  With it, hacking is horrible.b.  Not that hacking is hard, but it gets to be a problem when time is essential.  I've pressed the EVE gain button by accident 7 times through the whole game when I meant to hack something.2.  The view of the game.  It's a first person perspective, but your limited to view.  This is especially a problem when on later mission.  The environment is dark with little light, so you can imagine how annoying it is.Pros:You've never played this game before.  Even with Fallout 3(my favorite game ever), it's something new.  No aliens, no terrorist, no human soldiers, etc.  Even with the zombies thing.  The enemies are called slicers and they are lively.  Sometimes performing normal things like dancing or carrying a conversation until they see you.  So the A.I. is pretty good.Side note.After finishing the game their isn't anything worth playing again.  Their is an offer for downloadable content, but couldn't access it.  Possible removed.The game works with a duel process of switching to guns and powers.  Problem is that its limited.  I hate that.  I wish you can carry more, but not.  That really sucks where I have to use resource management.  DAMN!Still worth purchasing let alone extremely worth renting.PARENTS:  I can't really tell you if the game is safe for kids.  Their isn't any harsh cuss words, but it is bloody.  I've walk over bodies(bloody and not).  No sexual themes, but their is... well it includes pregnancy and back room.  Their are children and they attack eventually.  That's it.  Think PG-13.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

On Sly's eighth birthday, he is given the Thievius Raccoonus, an instruction manual passed down through the Cooper family for generations on how to be a great thief. But ruthless villains bust in and steal the manual, split it amongst themselves, and then vanish. Sly, along with his two friends Bentley and Murray, must embark on a platform adventure to recover the pages of the book and prove to the world that Sly Cooper is the world's greatest thief. Different skills, such as stealth tactics and platform jumping, are required throughout the game. You'll also pilot vehicles, play minigames, and fight bosses as you proceed.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Sly Cooper rocks.....","reviewText":"At first, I'll admit, I didn't like Sly Cooper too much. My initial reaction was that this was just another ordinary action platform game. After playing it awhile, I soon realized it wasn't your 'ordinary' action platformer. Developer Sucker Punch proves you can still innovate in a genre that's beginning to get old and show its' age. By combining stealth with great platform action, you got one killer game on your hands. You play as Sly Cooper and, with the help of your two friends:Murray and Bentley, you go on a quest to find pages from your family heirloom(the Thievius Raccoonus)which is a guidebook for thieves. Rest assured, it's not teaching anything bad here as its' taking back what is rightfully yours. Everything from plot to presentation to control and gameplay, everything is dead-on in this game. Even the cel-shaded graphics compliment the games' cartoony atmosphere. No boring sleep-inducing fetch quests here...Oh no! You can collect clues to unlock new moves to use in the game but it isn't neccessary just to finish the game. Sucker Punch keeps thing fresh and simple in this game. You can tell this was a labor of love for them because alot was put into this game and that's why it is so great. I, personally, look forward to a sequel. It's easily the best action platformer on the Playstation2 thus far.I highly recommend this game to everyone, young or old.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Like a One-Armed Zombie, this Game Feels Incomplete.","reviewText":"Left 4 Dead is the best zombie apocalypse game to date.  It borrows heavily from movies like 28 Days Later and Zach Snyder's Dawn of the Dead.  By borrowing heavily, I mean that if they changed the title screen and the name of the game to \"28 Days Later\", it would be a really good movie game.  The city is overrun with fast zombies and a band of four Survivors must brave the zombie infested areas to reach a Safe House.  The Xbox Live Modes are really fun, but the Single Player Campaign is repetitive and only 4 hours long.Gameplay:  8/10You must battle your way through the hordes of zombies as a team.  Each Character carries a pistol with unlimited ammo and one of the following; a machine gun, shotgun, or rifle.  Pipe Bombs, Molotov Cocktails, and Exploding Canisters can be found if you explore the levels.  Characters also carry a Health Pack that can be used to heal yourself or a wounded ally.  Some Zombies can quickly incapacitate a Survivor and their teammates must rush to their rescue.  Without teamwork, you're pretty much dead.Every time you play a level, the zombies and the massive 100 zombie rushes are in different areas.  As a team, you must quickly find the best defensible position and survive the onslaught.  You've really got to use your environment to your advantage.  Defending a hallway is much easier than an open area.  Closing doors also helps you because it takes the zombies a few seconds to break them down.  Shooting destructible fuel canisters explode into a wall of fire.  Working as a team to survive the frantic zombie ambushes is the best part of this game.Single Player:  4/10The Entire Single Player Campaign is made up of 4 Missions composed of 5 Levels each.  Each Level can be finished in 10-15 minutes.  You can finish everything in 4 hours.  What hurts the Campaign is that all of the Mission Objectives, Weapons, Enemies, and Gameplay Mechanics are identical.  If you've played one Campaign, you've played them all.  The only difference in the Campaigns is the level layout and the art.  In every Mission, you play along 3 AI Controlled Allies, but even after 2 hours, the game already starts to feel repetitive.Multi-Player: 8/10In Multi-Player, you can form your group of Survivors with 1-3 friends and play the game.  This plays exactly like the Single Player Mode, but it's more frantic because you really need to coordinate your efforts when the zombies attack.  4 Players can also play as the Special Infected:  There's a Boomer that vomits zombie attracting barf on party members, a Hunter that pounces on victims, a Smoker that has a 50 foot tongue and can drag Survivors away from the group, and a TANK, which is a hulk-like behemoth with a lot of Hit Points and Damage.  Scrambling to safety as a team is a blast and ambushing the Survivors is also great fun.  When the Survivors reach their destination, the teams switch and the level repeats.  Although this mode is great, there are some drawbacks.  The game only keeps score of the Survivors, so if you play as the Infected, you have no idea how you did.  Also, when you spawn as an Infected, the game chooses which creature you must be.  You don't get to select this.  If you are killed, you take a \"time out\" for about 15 seconds before you can respawn again.  Hopefully, they'll add more types of Infected and allow you to choose in the sequel.Art:  6/10The art isn't going to win any beauty contests here.  The game was made with the Counterstrike Source Engine and looks outdated.  The Cutscenes are lacking and the load screens are generic.  The Production Value just isn't here.Sound:  8/10The music is creepy and the sound effects really add to the atmosphere.  Hearing what lurks around the corner really keeps you on edge.Overall:  6/10The weak Single Player Campaign and limited Online Modes prevent this game from reaching it's full potential.  The game is arguably the best 'zombie apocalypse' game to date, but it feels limited.  With only 6 weapons, 6 enemy types, and cookie cutter level design Left 4 Dead feels like half a game.The game is rated Mature for Language, Violence, and Gore.Buy it if you want a fun Cooperative Xbox Live Game or you're dying to play a game that feels like 28 Days Later.Rent it if you want to blow through the Single Player Campaign in 4 hours, and try out the Xbox Live Gameplay.Avoid it if you don't intend to play it on Xbox Live.If you like this game, check out Resident Evil 5!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"trashcanman","summary":"A new level in multiplayer gaming.","reviewText":"\"Left 4 Dead\" is simply the most intense gaming experience I have ever had.  Get four friends in a room with this baby and listen to the profanity fly.  The setup is as simple as they come.  You and three other survivors are stranded in the midst of an epic zombie outbreak. And it's not a shambling, living dead zombie outbreak either.  We're talking full-on sprinting28 Days Laterand mutated infected who want nothing more than to tear you to pieces.  Your only concern: survive.Each level in the very short campaign requires you to simply get from point A to point B.  Hasn't gaming passed the time when a game could get away with such a generic setup?  Not when the entire game is controlled by a malevolent AI that inducts the next level of replayability into the shooting game genre. The game itself changes on the fly as you play it.  It adapts to you, you must adapt to it.  The numbers of infected vary, the places they come at you vary, their strategies vary; you simply don't know exactly what you are in for on any given playthrough.  This keeps the game fresh and scary on multiple playthroughs.  The better you perform, the harder the game will hit you.  The AI even controls when the music kicks in.  L4D's AI director is a fantastic innovation in interactive entertainment and more than makes up the the game's brevity and lack of variety.In his novellaThe LangoliersStephen King defined the difference between running and scampering; running being with a purpose and destination and scampering being aimless and panicked.  Well, in this game the zombies/infected are running and you, my friend, will be scampering.  The speed and insanity of L4D is truly something to behold.  One minute you could be in a small building, gearing up and healing your wounds, the next you could have any literally any number of baddies diving through windows, breaking down doors, busting through walls, and even pulling you out into the woods away from your allies to be torn to pieces.  A chill runs up my spine every time I hear the rising howling roar of a massive horde of incoming infected.  You and your friends gear up as best you can and take the best positions you can find, but no matter how well prepared you think you are, you are in for some surprises when the river of zombies crashes against your shower of gunfire.There are several breeds of specialty zombies that inevitably turn the tide away from of your favor.  Smokers, for instance, have an extremely long tongue which they can use to snatch any survivor and pull him out of position from cover.  Hunters creep in and leap on top of you, tearing you to pieces.  Either situation is inescapable without help from your comrades.  But while they help you, the horde are free to pour into your position and wreak havoc.  And then there are the massive zombies known as Tanks.  When one of these guys bears down on you, you will scamper regardless of how many Big Daddies you killed inBioShock.  Remember the first time you took one of those guys on?  Well, you get that experience every time a Tank shows up in L4D because you never get any stronger and they sure as hell never get any weaker.  He tears chunks of the environment and heaves them at you, he charges and smashes anything in his path, and he does not slow down.  Once he's got you, you're a goner.  No amount of automatic fire will even slow him down until he finally collapses.Now all of this is fine and dandy, but the fact of the matter is you must experience this game in multiplayer to really experience it at all.  The AI guys are usable, but there is no replacement for hearing your buddy actually shouting for help as he's hung helplessly from a tower by a Smoker's tongue or the inevitable exclamation of \"Tank! Tank! TANK!!!\" that will instantly kick your adrenal glands into overdrive.  Accusing each other of friendly fire is also mandatory.  Lots of cursing involved.Even the quiet moments between skirmishes in each level are often filled with dread since you can often hear the moans and cries of the infected bosses around and about.  The Witch is an instant-kill wonder who can usually be found sobbing by herself in a corner somewhere. If you are lucky, you can creep past and she will not attack. But shine a light on her or startle her in any way and get ready for pandemonium.  Setting off car alarms and other loud noises or staying in one place for too long will bring down a host of infected on your position, so careful haste is the order of the day.So how many zombies can you shoot and how many times can you defend the same old positions against the same old enemies using the same old weapons?  Bored now?  Fine.  Drop into online Versus mode.  Now you can play as the zombies and make it your business to wreck other players' day.  Be a Smoker and induce profanity in your fellow man by tearing them from their protected little cubbies, be a Hunter and take someone down opening them up for zombie chow time, be a Boomer and blind the puny humans with your vomit, or even be a Tank and smash EVERYTHING.  Admit it; you're sold on this game now.L4D does not redefine the shooter genre, but it does redefine co-op multiplayer within it.  After 5 hours of this game with three friends the other night, I literally felt shell-shocked. I felt like I had just been through an experience for the first time.  Only real combat could be this intense.  The frantic pace, the tension, the sheer visceral thrill of L4D is unrivaled in any game that I have played.  Valve is promising more levels available for download in the future so yay for that.  This is my kind of zombie apocalypse. Buy this game and share it with the ones you love.  You may hate each other after your escape plan falls to pieces for the umpteenth time, but \"Left 4 Dead\" will keep you together.\"You may think you're running, but you're not. You're scampering.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2008"}

I am/was not a South Park regular viewer simply because I don't watch much TV but I 'got' the game immediately without being able to make associations to past TV episodes and this is a good thing.I am not going to reveal the plot because that would not be cool but, for any gamer not sure whether to invest time and cash on this one, know this: it's a well executed, brutally funny turn-based RPG heavily biased toward the brutally or raw-funny side. If you don't mind 'gross' and especially if that makes you laugh you are going to be happy with this game. If you are not so good at turn-based RPG, don't worry about it, you'll do good. And, of course, if you are a fan of the show AND a gamer, you are going to be in Heaven or ummm... let's not go there.You may not want to let this game anywhere near your console of PC if there's no way to play it without your little kids watching you play or them asking you to let them play it. Unless you are willing and able to spend a lot of time with them before and after each play session, discussing the 'facts of life'.In a few words it's a super-funny, gross, easy to play RPG-like adventure that you are either going to love or hate with a passion.

The shooting feels good, the aiming feels right (can be a bit easy because of how accurate the guns are) and the motion feels nice.The story drives you through the game.  It's good. At first I thought 'this is alright', and just played it for the general satisfaction of a skilled gunfight, but then the story started growing, becoming more complicated, and my own characters became more complicated as it progressed... And it was a good experience.An odd statement, but this is as close as consoles have to the Uncharted series. That's aided by the fact that the main voice actor is the same as Nathan Drake, but seriously. The expanding story, the characters and dialogue, and the action.  You go from gun fight to dangling from a raftor still trying to fight people with your machine gun in one hand.It's good. And considering it's so discounted because it was generally ignored, it's a steal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

SAND EVERYWHERE!!!!Was starting to run out of hope that military shooter games would continue to interest me and this game blew me away.  The story is way too complicated to ever explain in a review.  Lets just say that the story is slightly ambiguous and you will have to decide for yourself what kind of person your character is.  He is put in situations that pressure you to make a decision that has BRUTAL consequences.  You can see how someone becomes a monster almost accidentally-or not, depending on how you interpret the events.  One thing is for sure- this game will make you think.It's brutally violent but obviously not as much as actual war.  Spec ops is art.  A very thrilling and emotional game. I'm an absolute sucker for an amazing story.  Dubai is a very interesting place and you get to zipline from building to building while enjoying a view of the city.  Excellent and believable main characters.Ran the game on 2.9ghz dual core and GTX 460 768mb and it ran flawlessly.  I could even put textures on \"Very High\".  I was extremely impressed with the graphics and the gameplay was excellent.  This is definitely not a weak PC port, have no fear.  I mostly play shooters and am very picky about how \"fluid\" the shooting is and was pleasantly surprised.Amazon is selling this for 14-15 bucks?

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Testosterone","reviewText":"This game is highly entertaining. Nothing is slow. You just blast your way through one obstacle after another, with no pit-stops in between. It will rapidly eat up the hours of your day. If you're not in Vice City making a daily consistency of 5,000, you're stealing your favorite cars right off the streets, and leaving their owners to bite the dust.You've served your time in jail, and now you're back on the streets not about to live a normal life. Instead, you return to doing services for your old Boss in NEW YORK, who is head of a Mafia division, and he sends you on down to MIAMI FLORIDA because that's where all the gold is nowadays. It's 1980 and drugs are in high demand. They've got to be shipped from somewhere overseas, and what better a place if not VICE CITY? You, Tommy Vercettie, go there to pick up some 'Grade A Colombian.' But little do you know that your Boss, Sonny, is setting you up. He wants you out of the way, and out of sight. Evidently, you angered a lot of people before you went to jail, and to be seen working with you would be detrimental to business.This game has the most elaborated digital city I have ever seen on the PS2. People skating along the beach side. Old fogies waiting for city buses. People fighting. People arguing. Street lights changing from green-to-red. Stop and go traffic. Police chasing down criminals. Gang shoot-outs. You can even fly in a helicopter and spot a few sharks or turtles swimming in any given area of the ocean. And whoever designed it sure did their homework, for this city really does look like Miami Beach, and the people in it act accordingly, from the Haitians to the Cubans, from the city red-necks to the bikers - all of whom you will work with temporarily, and kill later, as you slowly sneak your way into the center of all the corruption, where you can begin to construct your thrown.The graphics are much better than GTA3. Sun glare through windows onto marble floors, reflecting, getting dimmer as day turns to night. I liked the ultra 3D effect when it rains - how some drops splatter on the TV screen when you drive really fast. Not to mention when you cut someone up with a chainsaw. Just the overall definition of every image was superb.The gameplay could be better. Although the missions were highly anticipating, I thought a good number of them were outrageously hard. No one wants to die, die, and die again. I'm all for a challenge here, but I would enjoy myself a whole lot more if my playing skills didn't require sheer luck to beat some of these ridiculous missions. All missions were challenging, forcing me to play them in multiple ways to win, and I like that a lot, but come on, be reasonable. I also didn't like the fact that the only way Tommy knew how to kill, was by firing a gun. Wouldn't it be great if you had ways of silently murdering individuals without ever alerting the cops or FBI, but at the same time, also have the option to just go on a raging killing spree? How many times can a man out-run a horde of cops before he gets thrown in jail? Just because I out run them to my house doesn't mean they're going to give up on me. This isn't a game of tag here - I JUST KILLED 30 or 40 PEOPLE! I remember shooting up a mall. My mission was to destroy every window display. Cops and everyone was running after me until I destroyed the last window on the list. Then they just turned their backs on me and walked away as if nothing had happened. Some things like that make the game so unrealistic. What's wrong with visiting the mall as a casual customer and having to plant bombs when security isn't looking? That can be equally as challenging. But even these minor delays can't overthrow the entire game, which for the most part, was really entertaining. There's nothing like taking over a city by force, and making everyone fear you. That is, after all, your main objective.Your Character is cool. Really temper-mental. Walks a little funny, but that's for having too big a package for such tight pants. For a guy that does so many wrong things, he sure looks like a dork. Doesn't have that cold, mean-steak about him that the guy in GTA3 had.The Radio Stations: While you're driving in your `stolen' vehicles, all radio stations, which you can tuner, has 80s music. You can not go wrong with 80s music. And we're not just talking high squeaky singers with hair saturated with color-coated gels. In this game you hear what RAP was, before it became what RAP is today...and a few talk-shows. Gotta love GTA talk shows. This game seems to mock every human clich&eacute; ever created in American society, from animal conservationists, to Wiccans, to Goths, to people who complain that games are too violent. Nothing makes me more excited than listening to some moral enthusiast speak against violence on the radio while I stick my Uzi out the car window and sever people in half with a spray of BULLETS!This game is not for children. Besides the fact that you DO commit every crime known to man, this game has the 3 most vulgar words: The D word, the P word, and the F word. The only crime you don't commit is rape or molestation. Well, that's if you don't include picking up alleyway whores and then shooting them in the back of the head after they served their purpose, to only get back your money, and the money of their previous clients.Just keep it out of the hands of your children.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"Duke Nukem Is Back... Just A Bit Too Late...","reviewText":"I remember back in 1999 when I saw the trailer for DNF. It blew my mind! Year after year went by and this game just seemed to become vapor ware. While it took about 12 years to develop in the end, Duke Nukem Forever is not the first game to actually take 10+ years to develop. But unlike most games that take a long period to develop the lack of polish and piecing together what was left after the 3DRealms collapse is quite evident. Does it make DNF a bad game? NO... but it fails to live up to the incredible hype while still bringing an \"old school\" FPS into the modern day.GAMEPLAYDuke Nukem Forever is old school. Mid 1990's old school that is. Much of what is here is just a modernized re-hash of what we used to get back when I was a kid. The problem here lies with how the gameplay is put together and the pieces that it lacks. I rarely like to make video game comparisons here but the first 30 minutes reminds me of Half-Life. An FPS that instead of starting you off with a gun, makes you walk around finding your way to a test chamber and interacting with some AI. The game starts slow... but once it actually gives you a gun and points you towards the nearest bunch of baddies it is a rather fun ride. The Duke's Arsenal is back with pipe-bombs, trip mines, RPGs, The Ripper, Shrink Ray. There is nothing more satisfying than shrinking a foe down and squishing him like an ant! The FPS element of the game is simple and effective with no real gimmicks to toss in. Boss encounters are enjoyable though very easy due to infinite ammo which spoiles the strategy element.Despite a solid showing in the \"Shooting\" category the real problem with the gameplay is just how it gets pieced together. It is obvious the game is trying to much, to fast and goes all over the place. From a Half-Life style opening to a teaser of shooting to suddenly a mini-game with an RC car then back to shooting, then a driving segment then back to shooting then a platforming segment etc etc.. While playing you will feel as if you are going through time and slowly observing all the new features added into FPS games over the years. Basic FPS combat... vehicles, rail segments. The game is a time-line from 1999 - 2008 . Only thing it lacks is \"Down the Iron\" aiming. Yet despite the old school approach to the game Duke scoffs at power armor and keycards yet decided to adopt a regenerating health bar and suddenly goes from the 1 man army capable of carrying all weapons to just 2 weapons. The game has platforming segments similar to the end of Half-Life when you had to platform up to teleporters... the difference here is that they feel forced/out of place. Still with all the chaos going on here the gameplay is not bad at all. It is old school pretty much; just happens to be missing a lot of what made Duke Nukem 3D and other old school shooters so good (lack of jetpack, far to linear, 90's style AI, outdated one-liner's)GRAPHICSCompared to the console version (PS3 used for comparison) the PC version boasts the best of almost every aspect of graphics here.  Superior, quick load times. Crisp graphics with no pop-in texture problems.  Overall the game plays much smoother than it does on the console and feels far more polished both graphically and the game engine itself.  But lets not sugar coat it here, the game shows its age.  While no-where near as bad as on the consoles the game does look dated.  It is to be expected however since this game did start development in 1998 I believe and never really got its feet planted solid in one kind of gaming/graphics engine.SOUND/STORYStory... what story!? You're here for the king baby! Duke doesn't need a storyline but every game needs one in the end. DNF keeps it short and sweet like DN:3D. Aliens have come and are kidnapping all the babes including Duke's!. No one steals the Duke's babes!! As for the sound, personally the sound effects, music and voice acting (on Duke's part) wasn't half bad. There was considerable effort put into the Sound aspect for the game to make it polished and enjoyable (after 12 years the sound better be good!). There are plenty of little easter eggs thrown all throughout the game including Halo, Doom and Leroy Jenkins references within the dialogue.REPLAY/LENGTHI pulled around 8-9 hours of gameplay out of DNF which isn't bad but definitely much less than that supposed 12-18 hours originally mentioned by Gearbox. Unlike DN:3D I really did not have the urge to play through DNF a second time. I feel I got all that I could out of it after the first playthrough. There are no secrets to find and the map layouts really do not do much for creativity especially since you can only take 2 weapons at a time. I did not dip into the MP element of the game much so I can't comment heavily on it. The MP plays like an old FPS MP from the 90's. That simple fast paced flow where timing weapon spawns was key to victory and preventing your foes from getting any weapon. It feels unpolished though and rushed; perhaps 6-7 years ago it would be acceptable but not really in this day.OVERALL ... 71% (7.1) C-Sadly in the end I give DNF for the PC a 71%(7.1 rating) or 3 stars. The game is not a \"horrible\" game like places are making it out to be. While it is lacking for a PC title of today's standard it The game feels like a throwback to the 90's that comes equipped with a small time machine that will take you through to around 2008... the evolution of FPS from 1999 - 2008 basically. It suffers on the PC, mainly in the implementation of its gameplay which come in a variety of problems; holding back the overall enjoyment factor. This kind of game needed more enemy spawns and the ability to carry all weapons like old FPS games did. Instead the implementation of some modern elements holds it back from being a good throw-back feeling game.Still... there is plenty of fun to be had here. As said above, this is not a horrible game and for the Duke Nukem fan (like myself) it is a much needed Duke Nukem fix. Despite a vast number of problems you still have a good game here, but for a 2011 title the game falls far short of standard. If you go into this game remembering how games were from 1994 - 2004 then it will feel like a throw-back to the past, just a bit confused as to what it wants to be. If you do plan to pick up DNF I would look no further than the PC version. It is the superior of the versions, though mainly in the graphics / engine department.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Awesome","reviewText":"Hours and hours of fun.

This game further proves that beliefThis is a short review, after 3 days of game play:Performance:  The game runs great on both my desktop and laptop. If you have a lower end PC, you may suffer some frame-rate hits if you are in a heavily populated server and in a highly populated areas with a lot of other players running around. Once you get out into the open world, however, the game should run like silk. I have encountered no bugs or crashes. Frankly, knowing this is an EA release, I was a little worried. I know that some players have had problems with early release codes, but I have to say that overall EA has done a great job with the release.Story:  The cinematic scenes are AMAZING. They are, frankly, better than anything in the last three of George Lucas' films. Just like in SWKOTR, the story is definitely one of the main strengths of the game. I've dabbled in a few different classes: Sith Bounty Hunter, Republic Trooper, Republic Jedi, and each has it's own great story with starting worlds. I think it's too early to tell how balanced the classes are, but that is probably something that will be tweaked along the way anyway.Graphics:  Very scalable. On the lower end it probably looks as good as SWKOTR did, and on high settings it looks way better than anything in WoW.Game play:  The game starts with awesome cinematic scenes that had me pumped up and ready. The first 5 minutes or so I had to get my sea legs, but within an hour the movement etc felt totally natural. So far the quests and tasks are well spaced and really fun and interesting, keeping you hooked with that \"OK, I know it's late, but just ONE more thing I want to do.\" feeling.Overall:  The game will invariably be endlessly compared to WoW. But I guess that's only fair. The fact is, until now, with regards to MMORPG's it's been \"WoW and everyone else.\" I expect that this is not going to be true for much longer. Bottom line- So far the game is living up to all my expectations.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

The sore thumb of this game is the story is stretched very thin and you almost forget what happened previously. My other gripe is the fact that the dungeons are so LOOONG and the puzzles are almost impossible to solve sometimes and when you save and quit you start back at the very beginning and this adds about 20-30 mins to get through the dungeon. My last gripe is the fact that the graphics aren't up to par with what is expected. It looks like a 2004 game and with the Wii it should look ALOT better.With all that aside this is a very charming and warming game! The Wii controls are perfect and even though they don't utilize them to their full potential it makes things simple quick and fun. The story is, of course, very original and uses all the Zelda trademarks in it. The game is VERY long (I'm not even half way through yet) and it'll take you a good 40 hours or so to beat this monster. There are many elements in the game, surprisingly, and not one dungeon or area is the same. You are always finding new weapons and items to use and you use them all throughout the whole game for fighting enemies or solving puzzles. What kind of kills all this is there being NO jump button. You can really tell the developers kind of used this so they can cut development time so they can avoid building bigger and more complicated levels. With no jump button it kind of makes puzzle solving hard since you're used to thinking with a jump button in mind and no walking off a cliff to catch onto a level or pulley...it makes things really odd. This also makes jumping from platforms hard because sometimes Link will just jump off into thin air and it gets very annoying.With all this added up though its the greatest experience you can have on the Wii and is worth all the money you pay for this. Did I mention the neat sounds that come out of the Wiimote! For example Midna's laugh will come out of the Wiimote when she needs to talk to you and when you shoot a bow and arrow the sounds come out of the Wiimote and its very neat!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

In the modern era of digital distribution, with different game modes beginning to fragment and trend towards becoming commercially viable products on their own, something as rich as Splinter Cell Blacklist is quite a treat. Splinter Cell: Blacklist delivers a very meaty, replayable single player campaign, a wealth of deep cooperative content, and some of the best multiplayer content we've seen since...well, probably since Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, thanks to the return of the glorious Spies vs. Mercs multiplayer mode. Blacklist is a labor of love, and a fine return to form for the Splinter Cell series. This is a game that will please both the older stealth fans of the series, as well as newer players who enjoyed the more action-orientated approach of the previous entry in the series, Splinter Cell: Conviction.After an explosive introductory sequence that does a very nice job of teaching you how to play, you take control of Sam Fisher on his floating jet/fortress, the Paladin. The Paladin serves as a hub to the game's different playable modes, as well as serving as a upgradable headquarters where Sam can purchase and modify equipment, talk to his partners, and stay in contact with the outside world. Most players will likely want to start with the single player campaign, which makes up the heart of Blacklist. While the narrative of the campaign isn't as memorable as past Splinter Cell games, it more than makes up for it with not only some of the best level design the series has ever seen, but also a level of flexibility that the series has never seen before. Three play styles are available to experiment with and master: the silent, non-lethal Ghost, the quiet, deadly Panther, and the all-out carnage of Assault. Moving through a level while sticking to a particular playstyle will not only give you bonus mastery points for doing well in each one, but also encourages replaying the levels to try new styles.  Don't want to stick to either of these three? Mix it up all you want! The game allows for this too. Sam Fisher is a much more capable hero in this game, easily able to shoot his way out of a tight situation and disappear into the shadows quickly. Similar to last year's stealth masterpiece, Dishonored, Splinter Cell: Blacklist gives you numerous options for not only playing the way you want to play, but also in how to proceed through each mission. Numerous hidden paths and multiple routes through each level allow each mission to be tackled in the way that best suits the gamer. Like other recent great stealth games such as Mark of the Ninja and the aforementioned Dishonored, Blacklist gives you freedom and flexibility, and in doing do, delivers arguably the best single player campaign the Splinter Cell series has ever seen.Also available from the Paladin is a number of side missions in all new environments that are not tied to the single player campaign. These include missions where you must remain undetected in order to achieve certain goals, missions where you must eliminate everyone in an area and detection will cause for them to call for massive reinforcemnts, and combat missions where you fight off wave after wave of enemies (ala Gears of War Horde mode). Each of these types of missions caters to one of the specific play styles detailed previously, and will force players to move out of their comfort zone. Success in these missions yields various rewards, mostly in the form of persistent monetary funds that carry over across both missions and multiplayer modes. But the best thing about these optional side missions is that they can all be played cooperatively, whether in local split screen or online with a friend. Playing the missions cooperatively adds layers of depth, strategy, and complexity that give the missions a whole new feel. And to top everything off, there is even a set of missions that can ONLY be played with someone else. These missions are a highlight of Blacklist, and are icing on the cake that is one of the richest cooperative games to release in 2013.Rounding out all this goodness is the multiplayer, which sees the return of the classic Spies vs. Mercs two-on-two multiplayer mode. Making its first appearance since 2005's Chaos Theory, this amazing mode is better than ever, with fantastic level designs and improvements to bring it into the modern era. The perfect way it balances the third-person agility and stealth of the Spies going against the slower, heavily armed, first-person perspective Mercs remains a marvel of competitive gaming, creating some of the most tense, thrilling multiplayer around. Whether you are a Spy that lurks in the shadows seeking the perfect opening to hack the information terminals, or the armed-to-the-teeth Merc who's sole job is to stop the Spy, communication, patience, and precision are essential for teams to succeed, making Spies vs Mercs a top-notch multiplayer mode. Blacklist also brings a new twist to Spies vs. Mercs forumla with a new 4 v 4 mode that allows for players to upgrade their weapons, armor, and gadgets and bring them into battle, as well as create custom loadouts for both the Spies and the Mercs. It's a faster-paced, brighter, and very enjoyable mode that can be quite intense, if not quite as much as the classic 2 v 2. Throw in a couple other standard modes (Deathmatch, Occupy a zone for x seconds, etc) that become fresh again due to your ability to play as either a spy or merc, as well as having mixed teams comprised of both classes. These are fun modes, but it's Spies vs Mercs that will keep you coming back for more and more of this excellent and extremely addictive multiplayer goodness.Splinter Cell: Blacklist is the complete package. There is more than enough high quality content to keep you busy for a very long time. The lengthy single player campaign is better than ever, and begs to be replayed. The co-operative missions will allow you and a friend to feel like master spies and use seemingly endless strategies to accomplish your goals. And the multiplayer is among the best out there. This is arguably the best Splinter Cell title to date, and should be experienced by all gamers who like both stealth and action games. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2013"}

The story in this game is really good, better then most summer popcorn blockbuster flicks. The gameplay has been refined to perfection in this one, I can't imagine how Naughty Dog will get U3 Drake's Deception to play even better then Among Thieves, but I bet they can pull it off! The graphics in this game are on par with Metal Gear Solid 4, the voice acting is really good, and the motion capturing is incredible.

{"product_name":"B00GG4BBUM","description":"","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"An excellent game that'll only get better in the years to come on PS4.","reviewText":"--From my \"review ANYTHING\" blog, 47Reviews.BlogSpot.com--MLB The Show is a series I first -- and last -- played in '06. At the time, I left the game feeling unimpressed for reasons I don't quite recall, but I did get a free hat out of it, and the Tigers wound up making it to the World Series that year. Having an Xbox 360 since the Summer of '06, I haven't played The Show since its inaugural go. Since the Xbox One isn't even getting a real baseball game this season, I'm glad to have chosen to get a PS4.One of the most important things for many people getting a game on a next-gen console that's already on a last-gen console are the graphics, and there's no denying that. The Show '14 is a game that, to me, doesn't look as great as, say, NBA 2K14 (for the sake of comparing first year next-gen sports games). The biggest flaws in this game, outside of the soon-to-be discussed commentary, pertain to the graphics... and there's quite a list. First of all, the majority of player faces look nothing like their real life counterparts. The MLB 2K series didn't have particularly great faces (I recall several well-known players having randomized ones), but the ones that were done tended to look pretty good. In this game, when a hitter stands in the box, don't be surprised when you need to direct your eyes to the bottom of the screen just to get a glimpse of who the hell's hitting. On the plus side, the batting stances -- for the most part -- are incredibly well done, and help in identifying players. A nit-pick I have is that players who have tattoos (Prince Fielder, Yadier Molina, Miguel Cabrera, etc.) don't have tattoos, and that's something that I sincerely hope changes in '15. Again, I know it's wrong to compare, but NBA 2K14 has tattoos, why can't The Show? Other things I noticed include the fans. While it's great to see far more original faces in the crowd so it looks more realistic, the fans don't look at the action on the field. Instead, they always seem to be looking towards center field. This has always been a thing in baseball games, but I was hoping for a change. Lastly in terms of graphics, there's also a fair amount of clipping that I noticed in this game. For instance, the bat boy sits on a chair that goes through his body, and when you see a pitcher go adjust their pants, their hands go through. Fans also fill up the stands and are just as rowdy in Houston in the middle of August as they are in the middle of a pennant race. This is a common thing in most sport games, but it's something I'd really like to see addressed next year, as it's just incredibly unrealistic outside of Opening Day in many parks. Again, many people may consider these nitpicks, but they're things that are impossible to not notice.The sound in the show is about on-par with what was seen in the past, when comparing to previous games' YouTube videos. That is to say, the soundtrack is still good, but not great, and the commentary is, as it always has been, absolutely uneventful, bland, boring, trash, and any other negative adjective you can think of. Personally, I don't understand it, at least on Matt Vasgersian's side of things -- the guy calls a game well on TV, but in this game, he sounds like he's deliberately trying to be unexciting, and it will more than likely make many players of The Show '14 want to mute the commentary for yet another year. The stadium sounds are all fine and good, but the sound as a whole is underwhelming, due in large part to the worth-muting commentary.The game as a whole is a lot of fun, despite the shortcomings graphically and with the commentary. It has a nice simulation feel that the 2K series lacked (which felt part simulation, part arcade), and a fair amount of game modes to keep you entertained. One of the biggest additions to The Show '14 is the ability to use quick counts, which can shorten game times considerably. I don't plan on ever using it, but it could certainly be something worth checking out if you don't have about an hour to dedicate to a single game. The most significant downfall to this game as a whole has to be any online game mode, as there is unbelievable lag that renders the game virtually unplayable. For me, this isn't a huge loss, as I play 98% or more of my games against the CPU, but it makes it impossible to have an enjoyable match with somebody online.In its entirety, the game plays very well, but the commentary and fairly unimpressive graphics have left me only a bit more than content with this offering. Most of this review would seem like nitpicking with nothing but negativity, but after hearing Ramone Russell talk about how the whole team making this game are \"perfectionists\", I've seen plenty of flaws (subtle and not so subtle) in this game, most notably the notoriously monotone and uninteresting commentary. I'm looking forward to what MLB: The Show '15 will bring -- hopefully we get a new cast for the commentary, because this commentary is flat out stale, and the commentators are a good part of what makes a baseball game entertaining. Just look at the MLB 2K series; the only reason why the series was playable (outside of the intuitive pitching mechanics) was the great commentary. The Show '14 is a must-buy and no-brainer for any PS4 owning baseball fan, but I can't overlook the graphical flaws and, to be blunt, awful commentary.4/5+: Pleasant presentation overall; saves transfer year to year in most game modes; solid controls; all-around the best baseball game I've ever played.-: Dreadful commentary; Diamond Dynasty saves don't transfer; basically unplayable online, which should cause players who normally play online to be hesitant of purchasing this game; some bugs, including a lot of clipping(that sticks out a lot in a baseball game), annoying animations from the players, and fans who have faces of men, but female bodies... what the.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2014"}

Here you get a good example of what the video game format can do, to give you a great story that you get to play a role in.Bioshock starts off in 1960 over the mid Alantic Ocean, your the sole survivor of a plane crash and the only place to go is in a light house.  Its here you'll find the underwater world of Rapture.  Rapture is the creation of Andrew Ryan.  A place where the best minds in the world could go to get away from the strong hold of religion, corporations, and goverment.  Its not long untill you realize things didn't go as planned.It seemed with the creation of DNA altering ADAM, the people of Rapture have turned on each other.  Factions fight for survival and its up to you to either fight against them or become their savior.  Through radio transmittings you'll get the story and it unfolds before you.ADAM, is the susbiance that the people all want, its the new drug.  Its in that, that will allow you to increase in power and stats.  With ADAM you'll be able to increase the amount of Plasmids you have.  Plasmids are the powers you get, shoot lighting out of your finger tips, Telekinsise, or create a fire with a snap of your fingers are some of the expamles.  If thats too much for you, then you can always go with a gun....this is a first person shooter first and then an adventure game secondly.ADAM is abtained in one form and that's getting to a Little Sister.  Little Sisters are little girls with pale skin and glowing eyes that rome around the city getting ADAM from corpses.  Its truly frightening the first time you see one, but not has frightning by their protectors...the Big Daddiess.  The Daddys are their body guard, they hulk around in diving suites and have a small arsonal to kill anyone that harms the Little Sister or himself.  Its up to you to get passed the Big Daddies and either save the little sister or \"harvest\" them.  The choice is yours.There's much more going on in the game then what I wrote, the game needs to be played rather then talked about.  Bioshock gives you the freedom to play it your way and make you apart of the story, and it does this in a great way.  The graphics along with the killer gameplay make this a must play for any 360 owner.  The is single player only and can take you anywhere from 10-25 hours to play, depending on how fast you play it....but trust me its hard to not to stop and take a look at the world of Rapture.A great game that is an early contender for Game of The Year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Jared Burdick \"JBurd\"","summary":"Graphical hitches aside, a great RPG","reviewText":"Dragon Age is my favorite RPG this generation. As great as Fallout and Borderlands are, the shooting aspect in a RPG is just not for me (I'll stick with Killzone and COD for my shooting fix). I have not played the PC version or 360 version, but everything I have read says both are superior to PS3.As usual, there are 100's of reviews with details regarding gameplay, so I will focus on what I have enjoyed thus far. The gameplay allows you to micromanage, build items and potions and get uber detailed in your experience. The dialouge trees actually effect the story and outcome of the game. When it comes to RPG's, I am looking for a casual experience - I loved Fable and Jade Empire, but did not care much for Oblivion. Dragon Age offers the best of both worlds. You can play in a linear fashion and complete the story in a relatively short time, or complete every side quest and log hundreds of hours. It truly is up to you. I set the game to casual for my first play through. There really is not much of a challenge, and Dragon Age plays out more like a book at this level and is not very difficult. The second time through, with a different class (elf instead of human), I upped the difficulty. It still is not overly difficult, but a bit more challenging. The third time through, I plan on playing as a dwarf at the highest difficulty setting. That in itself says a lot about the game. I really look forward to playing through as different classes multiple times. That coupled with DLC and Dragon Age offers some of the largest replayability of any game I have owned.***UPDATE***I have to mention DLC. As expensive as these games are, some people would argue the game should be complete once you make the purchase. I think that's debatable, and DA:O is the perfect example. There have been a couple DLC offerings that were relatively cheap but gave players several hours of play picking up in game and now the Awakening - a forty dollar game within the game is being released. Although the price is high (and you are probaly close to a hundred dollar investment if you have all of it) you also have have several hundreds of hours of original material. In a day and age of 10-12 hour single player campaigns, this is a great investment if you intend to stick with it. Not only will you get 100+ hours out of the game on purchase, but you can double that with all of the additional material available.The negatives for me are more of a technical nature. Although the game works fine, the slowdown and frame rate is atrocious. I recently have been playing a lot of PS2 games and find that Dragon Age would be considered top notch at that level, but on PS3...ouch. It is an ugly game. Some of the cut scenes are nice and the player models are pretty good, but this does not look like a next gen game. The silver lining to the cloud is that the game is psuedo-realtime. You issue commands and they are performed, but you can pause at any time to micromanage your team. The sluggish framerate would be more of a problem if combat was based on timing inputs, but in this case, it only serves hinder presentation, and not gameplay.Dragon Age is very accessable to casual games and hardcore gamers alike. Unlike a game like Demon's Souls, Dragon Age truly can be played with as much detail and difficulty as you like. It is easily the most fun I've had with an RPG this generation.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2010"}

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"A Fantastic Piece of Hardware with External Limitations","reviewText":"This is a very difficult product to review.The Playstation 3 is a fantastic piece of hardware that is solid, well-built, has excellent appearance, and in general is quite easy to use.On the other hand, it quickly becomes a $400-$600 (depending on which model you purchase) paperweight.  A lack of quality, entertaining games severely limits one's enjoyment of the Playstation 3.But a product review is of the product, not it's accessories, and so there for I will stick to reviewing the Playstation 3 \"as-is.\"  Understand that my 5-star rating is based on the Playstation 3 itself.As an owner of both the Playstation 3 and the Xbox 360, I can safely say that the differences in these consoles are numerous.  Gone are the days of turning on your console, firing up a game and playing.  These consoles have extensive \"desktops\" that can be accessed inbetween or sometimes even during games for a multiple of reasons.  You no longer have to shut off or restart your console to switch games.  The Playstation's desktop is attractive and very easily navigated.  Icons relating to such features as music, videos, games, settings, and internet are layed out in a scrolling, horizontal line.  Sub-menus of each system show up vertically as each system is selected.  The view remains uncluttered, and users can select their own background image, or the default \"wave\" background which is animated.  Note: the ability to change backgrounds was an upgrade to the PS3 system hardware and your unit may not have this option out of the box.  System updates are downloaded through the internet at no cost.  In fact, all internet access - including web browsing (read below) and games are free.  Users must pay to download certain features such as games or game updates, however these are listed in US dollar figures and can be purchased at that price.  This differs from Xbox's Live service, which requires users boy \"points\" in increments of $6.25, but no single download on Xbox live uses these same increments - often requiring users to pay extra and \"save the rest for later.\"The biggest positive attribute of the PS3 is it's generous access to the harddrive.  Users can literally copy whatever they want onto the harddrive, and many users have even replaced the harddrive with larger-volume units.  The instruction manual even explains how to do this.  This is a vast improvement over the Xbox harddrives which only allow importing of music when burned directly from a CD.  In addition, the Playstation supports multiple forms of input drives, from USB to SD cards and more, making it very easy to copy files onto the harddrive.  A few video formats are still not supported by the Playstation - corrections that will hopefully be made through system updates.A few quick comments on other areas of interest:  The controller provided with PS3's as of this writing is the Sixaxis controller - these controllers are wireless (bluetooth connections) and do NOT provide rumble features.  Most owners will want to purchase the Dual Shock 3 controllers which were recently released.  These still provide the Sixaxis motion-detection features, as well as rumble support.The online services of Playstation are very easy to access, though browsing methods could be improved with alphabetizing similar to the Xbox's Live service.  The Playstation adds a built-in web browser that, though with limitations, is extremely usefull.  You wouldn't think so until you suddenly need it because another family member is on the computer, or even when you want to jump out and read a review on a certain game or demo before downloading it, or find cheats/tips/tricks on a game that is troubling you.  The only downside is that the web browser can only be accessed after quitting the current game.The Playstation 3 is a quality, powerful piece of multimedia equipment that could be vastly improved with a collection of worthy games.  I haven't played mine in some time, but am holding on to it in the hopes of \"better days head.\"  For now, it is part of my surround sound entertainment at home and is heavily used for movies and music.*Fingers crossed...*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2008"}

If you already have the guitar from GH2, I'd recommend renting this one; it's not going to take more than a day to beat, so I can't think of any great reasons to actually buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2007"}

I've lost track of the number of Call of Duty games I've bought, and there's \"the one in WWII\" and \"the one with the snowmobile\". I get it, and if you feel committed to the Assassin's Creed series, you're going think I'm nuts for talking about anything not-Assassin's Creed.Fair enough.This is Assassin's Creed with dopey red and blue 3D glasses. Take away the glasses, and it looks and plays just like the one before it. Whether that's awesome or terrible is in the eye of the beholder, I guess.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

If you are going to play RE5 then you have to get this version.The gameplay is like RE4 so it's very good. Also you keep what you get at the end, but of every chapter not the end (like RE4); that makes it even better for replay.I haven't tested the PSMove functionality but the manual doesn't say anything about that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2011"}

The controls are simply perfect with the exception of the SPRINT button which I'll get to later.It is so well designed and intuitive. It gives you the widest range of choices I've ever seen difficulty wise. Are you a seasoned player? Choose an advanced level of difficulty and you'll love it. Are you a newbie to 1st person shooters? Choose the easiest setting and you'll love it. I have only played 2 first person shooters ever because if they are not very well executed controller and frame rate wise, I get headaches because of motion sickness. Halo 3 is one of them. This is the other one. If you;re a newbie to this genre like myself, you'll LOVE this game. They'll take you almost by the hand through the entire game with a special compass so you always know where you're supposed to go. And you can always follow you NPC teammates as well. This is the best shooter I've ever played. The graphic detail is just ridiculous. You really feel like it's happening in real life. Walking with all your senses alert, crouching a little, with a pack of marines raiding rooms, going out to little alleys, F14's roar over your head, the screen shakes, I've never had goose bumps while playing a game before. While you actually shoot. You're on the border of distraction from the actual game because everything looks just gorgeous.Just one gripe: Deep into the game some missions become a little frustrating because you loose over and over again, and have to play the same part over and over again, which is not that bad because playing them is A LOT of fun but sometimes it may become a little annoying, specially since in the level it happened to me, it was because a simple design flaw: In order to sprint you need to maintain L3 pressed while moving and truth to be told, it's just not that practical and a little uncomfortable.________________________Edit:It's been about a year since I reviewed this game. Now I realized I missed a HUGE element in my review: Multiplayer. Why did I not mention it before? because before this game, I had never played am online shooter before. I just bought the game for the single player campaign mode and once I beat it, I filed it on my shelf for about 4 months. Until one day, some online friends talked me into giving the online multiplayer a shot (no pun intended). Let me tell you: The multiplayer in this game BLEW MY MIND. It's like an online shooter with RPG elements. You upgrade your rank, you gain perks, you create character classes and the gameplay...Absolutely flawless. It was then when I realized that beating the single player campaign mode was just scratching the surface. To this date, almost a year since I purchased this game, I play about 2 or 3 hours EVERYDAY. No exceptions. This game is by far the Best Game I've ever played in my life and needless to say, the best current generation title for any console. It's literally, 2 games in one. Think about it: A game that 1 year after the initial purchase, keeps you coming back for more on a daily basis? That's a hell of a value in you purchase. To this date, the vast majority of gamers around the world consider this game is the best shooter ever made. (Yes, that includes Halo).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}
