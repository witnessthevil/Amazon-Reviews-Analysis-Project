{"product_name":"B00019AZBO","description":"Shocking and evil, Mortal Kombat: Deception pushes martial arts-style fighting and the Mortal Kombat franchise to new heights with an innovative fighting system, unparalleled depth and brutally intense action that will appeal to long-time Mortal Kombat fans as well as next-generation gamers. The game features lightning-fast hand-to-hand and special weapons combat, secret and returning characters, moves and combinations with new death-dealing battles and fatalities.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"An Improvement over Deadly Alliance, if little else...","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat: Deception had been long-awaited by MK fans, after the surprising success of Deadly Alliance.  However, you may realize within 5 minutes of playing the game that Deception is not really a new Mortal Kombat game, but actually a moderate update to Deadly Alliance.The game picks up immediately where Deadly Alliance left off, with a shocking opening cinema revealing the death of Earthrealm's heroes, and featuring the return of the dreaded 'Dragon King'.  With this powerful foe resurrected, unlikely allies join forces to battle him but are unsuccessful.  With both Shang Tsung and Quan Chi apparently dead (for now...no one stays dead in Mortal Kombat for more than a game or two), the Dragon King is now free to rule the realm, but he would not have been able to accomplish this had he not deceived Shujinko, the game's new main character, into resurrecting him in the first place.The intro is exciting and very well done...compared to the laughable opening cinema of Deadly Alliance, Deception's opening vid is gorgeous, with outstanding graphics, music and sound.  It definitely hooks you and gets you wanting to play the game.  So, what does the game itself have to offer?Not much different than Deadly Alliance at all, MK:D features returning characters Sub-Zero and Scorpion(of course) alongside some of Mortal Kombat's more obscure classic characters, namely the stars of Mortal Kombat 3.  All of the classic characters of the previous game have been sacrificed in favor of these 'one-game wonder' classics, featuring fan-favorite Kabal, the enigmatic Noob Saibot, Sindel, Nightwolf, Jade and more.  These characters return alongside a series of new characters, some of which are interesting, others which almost seem to be out of place with Mortal Kombat.The fighting engine itself is virtually identical to Deadly Alliance, which may be considered a flaw by some, and a blessing by others.  You can still change between 3 fighting styles on the fly, 2 martial art and 1 weapon.  The same tricks apply, though some of the more unbalanced fighters have been tweaked, but unfortunately the tweaking has made some of them worse.  Because of this distinct similarity, some returning characters from the previous game play identically to how they played in the previous game.  For example, I was able to pick up the game and beat it with Sub-Zero in about 15 minutes in my first play through, as his move sets were nearly unchanged.Gone from this game is the 'impale' manuever, which allowed for players to lose their weapon ability in favor of jamming it through the opponent so that the opponent will constantly lose health through the round.  In its place is a very flawed, very easily abused 'Breaker' system which allows characters to automatically break out of any combo, instantly.  This makes for very unrealistic and ridiculous gameplay.  For example, an opponent being juggled in the air will suddenly drop to the ground on his/her feet and knock the opponent away, out of the combo.  Thankfully, this easily abused system is limited to only three uses per fight, so it must be used wisely.Contrary to what you may have heard, Mortal Kombat: Deception does not feature stage fatalities or pits.  Instead, we get 'Death Traps' which are exaggerated, over-the-top 'ring out' conditions.  So in other words, instead of falling off of an arena and seeing 'soandso wins', you are treated to a gory death sequence from one of the arena's grisly contraptions.  Some arenas have more than 1 death trap.  Others have no death trap at all.  In any case, death traps do not end the fight...despite being chopped to bits in the first round, the second round will begin as if nothing happened, making the novelty of Death Traps wear off VERY quickly (I got bored of them within 2 days) and making the fights more ridiculous and unrealistic than ever before in this series.  Thankfully, the invisible walls of Deadly Alliance are gone, and death traps can be disabled  for a more fair fight (as death traps are easily abused).Fatality fans were disappointed with the abysmal finishers in Deadly Alliance.  Deception more than makes up for this with 2 fatalities per character and a new 'hara kiri' move, which is the famed 'suicide-ality' that fans have been rumoring since the Mortal Kombat 2 days.  Though Deadly Alliance featured probably the worst fatalities in the history of MK (Quan Chi comes to mind), Deception has some of the most gruesome, creative, and violent ones yet.  However, many of them are still redundant and ridiculous, so don't expect to like them all.It seems the overall fighting engine and graphics were sacrificed in favor of MK's 3 bonus games.  One game is 'Puzzle Kombat', which is the Mortal Kombat take on the widely popular 'Super Puzzle Fighter' series from Capcom.  The game is frustrating and unrewarding, but addicting if you get the hang of it.  The other game is MK Chess, a very interesting take on the classic chess game that has you select fighters to be your specific piece classes.  However, you cannot simply take a space from your opponent, you have to fight for it.  It is a fun deviation from the normal game.Last but not least is Konquest, which I thought was an excellent but poorly executed idea.  You play as Shujinko from teenage years to adulthood, and the story leads you through how Onaga the Dragon King came to return.  The game clearly tries to expand on the precedent set by Soul Blade/Soul Calibur series with the edge master mode, just on a much more grand scale.  Unfortunately, all Konquest boils down to is mindless, repetetive fetch quests and ridiculously hard challenges that yield little reward.Every MK fan has been waiting for the online component, and now you have it, though it is quite flawed.  Cheat devices are easily implemented, and fights are often unbalanced, due to the gameplay issues with infinite combos and the like.  However, facing total strangers is fun, and while its not quite like the old days I remember of jamming quarters into the Mortal Kombat 2 machine and beating opponent after opponent, it gets the job done.  However, there are many players who simply abuse repetition, and server lag tends to favor such tactics, making the online component a real downer in the end.Overall, Deception is a nice addition to the Mortal Kombat library, even though it is little more than Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and a 1/2.  It sacrificed the previous game's most popular characters in favor of bringing back half the MK3 cast, effectively making the game nothing more than a showcase for the one-game wonders.  The game makes no remarkable improvements, and even steps backward on a few issues.  However, Kombat fans will love the game and will love to see their old favorites return.Bottomline, the game feels more like an expansion pack to Deadly Alliance rather than a new game in the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2005"}

The battle system is engaging (although somewhat a button masher) and the character development is believable. Even the interactions between characters seems realistic and you slowly begin to see character relations evolve as the story progresses (few very of the RPGs on the market have believable character progression from what I've seen so this is impressive).Story:The story begins with the main character Yuri Lowell who lives in the Lower Quarter who, by chance, is sent out on the world. I'm not going to spoil anything regarding the story but as the story progresses you slowly will see how Yuri's own problem slowly becomes less of an issue as he uncovers greater issues. There are hardly any moments in the story when you have no idea what's going on and each piece of the story leads you to the next seamlessly. However, the story often has moments where, even at the end of the game, you're confused just to what had occurred. There are a lot of times where loose ends are not tied up and it just is confusing as to the purpose of the story in regards to that because of it. Without spoiling anything, also, the story does get better as it goes on but the end was somewhat anti-climatic and I had not expected it to end as it did. Regardless, the story, even as it is, was engaging and fun to play through.Battle System:The battle system in the game is very similar to any other Tales game but this time in 3d space. Tales games generally have side scrolling battle arenas where you instantly are placed in once you encounter an enemy on the map. In these battle arenas you use your skills button or your attack buttons to fight the enemy while other characters in your party automatically use their own abilities. In Vesperia you have to pay attention to the whole arena because often your healer will be attacked while you're fighting up front so you have to force yourself to run over to the attacker to protect them. This adds a bit of difficulty to the old system.Voice Acting:Voice acting in Vesperia was well delivered and very few times do the lines sound out of place, with the wrong emotion, or not as part of the environment. Oddly enough there is a mix of some lines having voice acting while others not. For the most part key scenes do have voice acting, however.Creation System:In towns you can use items found through monster fighting and on the world map to create new items. An example of this would be to take your old weapon plus some other ingredients to make a weapon + with higher attributes and skills often more so than what you'd find in the store. Some items can only be found through the synthesis so it's imperative to play around with it. Luckily the game tutorial system does a pretty strong job of teaching the use of this system so you'll pick it up quickly.Linear:The game is, for the most part, fairly linear. In dungeons there is only one path to get to your destinations and even after you have a mode of transportation you find that it's unlikely you can really explore more. To give it credit though you are able to reach areas with higher level enemies quickly you just will find yourself spending a lot of time searching for these areas because you don't have many other choices. Towns are also fairly small and while the backgrounds often show big cities you are limited to the areas you can explore. Often there is just the item shop, the inn, and one or two places to enter although this isn't necessarily bad if you consider the other extreme where you search forever in a town you only spend 10 minutes in anyhow.Exposition:A lot of the story is done through exposition and while you often know your next step you may feel like you're being force fed a lot of the info. I liked the level of exposition because I often would leave my game for periods at a time so it got me caught up with the story but I can see it annoying people who would play the game non-stop through the story.Getting Around (Confusing):The only real annoyance I found was more toward the end of the game. While in the beginning the linear environment forced you to go a certain path at the end of the game (when you can fly) you're told to goto certain areas on certain continents as if you'd have any idea where these places are. Given I don't have a giant map of the game world this left me confused for awhile. It should be noted that there is a way when flying around to find the game map (I think it was the select key) so you can sort through each area to find the destination (or so) where you wanted to get to continent wise but it's not very intuitive. Given there are so many continents in the game and everything has a fairly unique name you may get confused as well.In general, I thought this game was much better than the other Tales I've played and has a story that is both exciting and interesting with plenty of character interaction to keep you interested in continuing on. Toward the end of the story the game begins to get more confusing with aspects of the story not fully explained and a somewhat anti-climatic ending (although exciting none the less) but in general you'll be driven to play more. Definitely one of the few RPG games for the XBox 360 to add to your collection.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

With the poor showing as a possibility for any Japanese RPG in the western market, there is pressure on developers to change their formula in one way or another. Tales of Vesperia goes against the grain, in that it doesn't try to change anything. For fans this slight evolutionary step might be enough, but this game doesn't make any attempt to draw a new crowd.Being on the 360, the game does move the series forward in obvious ways. The graphics, still cell shaded, are more detailed in just about every way. The game also takes good advantage of 5.1 sound if you have the system. The widescreen display does well for the battles and keeping all your characters in a viewable area. That said, these things are really all considered standard on any Xbox 360 game.The rest of the game is pretty much like any one of its PS2 counterparts. That isn't to say it is bad. The characters and plot are all compelling and the real time tales battle system is still very fun. The downside is that the game still plays very slowly compared to other modern games. You still have the encounters where it loads a battle scene, and then when you win you still have a victory screen showing the results. That slows down the game considerably, but you can always avoid battles since the enemies are visible on screen. I also felt the story sequences could have been speed up a little. When the game is just starting you get a lot of story and it feels like it takes a while for it to pick up momentum.All in all the game is exactly what fans expected. It doesn't have any surprise turn offs, but there really isn't much to set this game apart. If you're a fan of Japanese RPGs then I'm sure they will plenty to like. If historically you've avoided the genre, there isn't anything here that will change your mind. It is a good game, but its been done before.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Lee","summary":"Good but with flaws","reviewText":"The Good:Graphics - Once you see people's expressions, their eyes, lips, and so on; it's hard not to see characters in other video games as lifeless mannequins. The buildings and rooms also look really great and it shows. On the 360, this game has three game discs which is huge.Voice Acting - The acting and script make the game feel believable for the most part.Story - The story is pretty engaging for about %30-%40 of the game in my opinion.Variety - There are a lot of optional side missions you can take, and with a few exceptions they're pretty fun overall; tot to mention there are some puzzles and platform based gameplay (running, jumping, climbing) that changes things up from the interrogation, clue finding, and shooting.Scripting -  The game is a little flexible, it's not completely hard on rails. ex. You can shoot a someone you're chasing early and call it a day. However, if you don't get to him in time, he may take someone hostage.Flexibility -  You can visit locations and interview suspects in whatever order you'd like, but this changes the ending in some cases. How you interrogate people may lead to a different ending for a case or whether or not you get leads for another location.The Bad:Story - Overall the story is ok, but I don't know if it's just me; the conclusion of the 2nd major part of the game made little sense to me. I could go into details, but I don't want to spoil the game. The 3rd major part just ends up being boring plot wise except for one revelation... Overall I'm not sure who screwed up the story. It wasn't horrible; it just wasn't great.Graphics - Graphics are great as long as you're not driving. The game has trouble loading graphics when you drive, especially when you're driving fast unless you're in a scripted chase (where the game knows exactly what route you're going to take because you're tailing someone). There are just too many times when the roads and buildings either disappear or turn into a pile of watery goo. When you go north west there are too many times where it seems like cars are driving on air or water. This isn't acceptable. The good part is that you won't notice this until you move up the ranks about mid-way into the game. Maybe this issue will be fixed in a future update.Scripting - Once people pull out the guns, there's no choice but to kill them no matter how close you are even if they're in the process of reloading.Flexibility - Ultimately regardless of some of the choices the game gives you, you don't really have choice. For example, you can't become a dirty cop or a dirty harry. In their defense I believe the story wouldn't have been as tight and the budget and time to make this game would have skyrocketed. Not to mention there's only so much time you can get from grade A actors.World - Because you're a goodie goodie cop and there's only so much time and money that game publishers and developers have, there's not much you can really do in the game outside of the side missions and main storyline. This is a small nitpick given the main meat of the game and because it's still a pretty decent length when you add the side missions.Loading - Even if you install the game to your hard drive, it feels like the game is loading all of the time. In their defense given the level of graphics and the amount of audio in this game, I don't see that they had a choice. It's a small price to pay for the graphics.Notes:The game doesn't really explain the difference between 'doubt' and 'lie'. You can only accuse someone of lying if you have actual evidence where you can prove that they are lying. When you think someone is lying but you have no proof, then you can 'doubt' them. Interrogation is more enjoyable once you figure this out.Summary:Overall regardless of some of its flaws, I think gamers should get this game. It's a good change in games that's stands out as an original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPC","description":"The year is 2027. The machines of Skynet have risen, reaping a bloody harvest of human flesh across the globe. You are a soldier of Tech Com, a ragged team of human resistance fighters intent upon stopping the overwhelming onslaught of cybernetic assassins in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Your ultimate goal is to reach a time travel device in time to send Kyle Reese back to 1984, with the hope of preventing a relentless Terminator model T-800 from murdering Sarah Connor, mother of resistance leader John Connor.This game is set before the events of the firstTerminatorfilm. There are three playable characters, each with specialized skills and abilities, including Kyle Reese, hero of the film. The 11 massive missions take the player through diverse, richly detailed, highly interactive environments. The dynamic camera system allows the player to target cyborgs with speed and accuracy, using never-before-seen weapons of wanton destruction.Terminator: Dawn of Fateincludes both missile and melee combat in third- and first-person play modes.","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Good concept, lousy execution","reviewText":"Terminator: Dawn of Fate is a pretty fair game- but it tries so hard to be a good game, but hardware and perhaps even legal considerations just kept getting in the way. Dawn of Fate tells the story of the events leading up to Kyle Resse's eventful trip back to the past to save Sarah Connor and destroy the CSM-101 Terminator sent to kill her and prevent John Connor from being born. The game is built around the standard premise of killing terminators, collecting technology for upgrades and of course, the survival of all mankind against the evil and monolithic, Skynet. You get to meet General Connor, Justin Perry and Catherine Luna- friends and comrades of Kyle's and you switch characters between missions.It's odd that they managed to capture the look of post Judgment Day Earth, the battlefields and ruined cities perfectly. Everything Skynet had- all the vehicles- the H/K tanks and aerial units are all there in gleaming chrome, but that's all they captured. The sounds are all wrong. The brilliant purple plasma guns sound like typical game fair and don't have their deep, resonant stutter from the movies. Even the H/Ks don't sound quite right. It's like whichever studio owns the copyright approved using the appearance of everything, but said they couldn't use the sound effects. Either than or the developers decided to do their own. Bad mistake. Another flaw is that the Tech/Com soldiers and their weapons aren't really representative of the movies, either.All I can say about the character models is BAD. Kyle Reese looks like Christopher Walken did as the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow, stupid hair and all. Justin Perry looks like he was carved out of stone and I won't go into how unfeminine Luna looks. Connor is probably the best rendered of the lot.Mission play is broken up into 3rd person play, starting with protecting Connor from an terminator infiltration attack, destroying Tech/Com's computers and blowing up an H/K tank that has rolled into the top floor of the resistance's hideout. In that mission you have to protect a demolitions expert as he plants explosive charges in the massive hotel base, is a royal pain, because he does nothing to defend himself. Instead, he stands there passively getting blasted by terminators while you rush around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to kill them before they grease him. Later missions involve a secondary story that the programmers must have felt was pretty clever. They're wrong. As well you must prevent Skynet from steeling all the platinum from a Federal Reserve bank.Apparently Skynet has just perfected the CSM-101 series infiltrators, but they have also been capturing normal humans and modifying them cybernetic mind control devices. One of these, Alexander Stone, blames Kyle for the death of his brother Gabriel and so has turned traitor, joining forces with Skynet in order to seek revenge. It is he the player must track down because he has stolen Connor's battle plans for an assault against Skynet's main base at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado. But while you get the plans back, you can never actually kill Stone. I'm not entirely sure why Skynet would create these hybrids- dressed as they are in black and red leather with cybernetic implants visible on them, it's not like they can blend in like the infiltrator terminators do.Finally it's the main assault on Cheyenne Mountain and you fight your way into the very core of the enemy's main base- blowing up everything in site. The hardest part being the attack on the central computer AI- the heart of Skynet which is apparently SO powerful that it is capable of mind control, a process that takes a few minutes while you work feverishly to cut off the computer's power source before it melts your guy's brain, thus ending the game.So it's a pretty standard story line, except for the silliness of the hybrid part. There are plenty of weapons- grenades, rockets, plasma guns, machine guns, EMP weapons that stun robots for a few seconds- pretty basic stuff. The game offers a first person view, but as with any first-person console game, control is terrible and you're better off not using it except to look around at the scenery. One interesting function is Adrenaline- a function that makes you shoot faster and more accurately which enables you to take down baddies quicker than usual. It doesn't last long so it's best used wisely. Another problem is the Dino Crisis effect- opening doors just to get to another small area to open another door in order to get to another small area and, you guessed it, open another door. It gets old very fast.While there are good concepts here, some nice graphics, the game almost seems crippled in places. Heck, you can't even walk off a ledge and kill yourself because the game won't allow it. But for the most part it seems to be a half-baked attempt to tell the same story that Bethesda Software did a decade ago with `Terminator: 2029', a somewhat more entertaining game, if graphically inferior. Dawn of Fate manages to tell a fair story with repetitive game play- go there, do that, kill this- if you've played Star Wars: Bounty Hunter, you'll know what to expect. I'd be interested to see the Xbox version just to check if it at least has better graphics.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2003"}

I understand some people don't like motion controls.  If that is the case Skyward isn't for you.  I also understand some people like high production values with GC cinemas, HD graphics, 5.1 surround and voice acting.  If that is the case, Skyward isn't for you.  Skyward is for Zelda fans who aren't bothered by motion controls.  For me the controls have been flawless.  Many people have claimed the controls don't work well, I have no idea where that is coming from.  Perhaps it has something to do with the sensor bar placement?  Mine sits below the TV, about 4 feet from the floor.  Link perfectly follows my every command.  The 1:1 motion really shines in Skyward.  I love being able to slash in various directions and have Link mimic the motion.  The most important aspect here is the use for puzzles during fights.  One cannot just randomly swing the Wii remote and expect to get through the game.  Fighting requires thought and precise sword movement, such as swinging opposite of where an opponent is blocking.  I for one love the motion controls, for those who don't, fair enough.  Everybody is different.Graphically Skyward has a very nice pastel style.  It isn't a secret the Wii isn't as powerful as the 360/ps3, so expecting Zelda to look like Uncharted isn't fair.  For a Wii game the graphics are spectacular and more important the style is fresh and unique.  The sound/music is the best yet in Zelda and clearly has been taken to a new level.Skyward maintains it's roots, but still changes things up.  The game isn't as open as seen in previous titles.  Skyward is more story heavy and features the deepest battle system yet.  Nintendo kept some classic items while also adding in new items.  I also like the upgrade system for items which is a first in the series.  Overally I have zero complaints with Skyward, it is everything I expected it to be.  Which is a Zelda game with motion controls.  If you like motion and Zelda, buy this game.  If you don't, buy something else.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2011"}

That major drawback, combined with the choppy animation, muddy sound, poor controls, and near none replayability, make Resident Evil: Survivor one big disappointment of a game.  It's worth playing if your a longtime fan of the Resident Evil series, but don't expect much out of it other than an intriguing side story to the saga.

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt32 \"LIGHT WEIGHT\"","summary":"Not what I had hoped for","reviewText":"As a lot of reviews have stated, this game did have a decent amount of hype behind it.  While it was not terrible, I really must say I was a lil disappointed (in some aspects).  I see a lot of comparison between this game and Modern Warfare 2/Black Ops and that is like comparing apples to oranges.  As the only thing apples and oranges have in common is that they are fruits, MOH and MW2 only have the FPS format in common.  2 totally different monsters here.  Call of Duty is more of an arcade type game where MOH is more about realism.  BFBC is the closest game MOH can be compared to.First of all I think the story mode is high quality.  I usually buy games for the online play but I must say I really really enjoyed playing through MOH.  It had enough variety to keep it interesting.  I would say that this is one of the best executed story modes for a FPS.  I like the concepts presented in other shooters but how this one was actually pulled off rocked.  Surely this should be one of the game's biggest selling points.Now for multiplayer.  Did I get my sh*ts and gigs?  Yes.  But is it something I wanted to be stuck on?  No.  I like the fact that each team gets 2 chances in a match, switching sides to make different weapons available to them.  I HATED the feature that forced you to have to completely switch classes when trying to pick up weapons on the ground.  He died, why can't I have my sniper rifle and his M-16 too?  The graphics and environments don't mesh well, they are unpolished.  Either the environment is too small, has two high points that everyone is laid out sniping from where you can't even move on the map, or its so cluttered with junk that its hard on the eyes, making it unpleasant to play.  Multiplayer is very realistic, gun damage fairly accurate, RPGs fly all over the place instead of a straight shot, a lot more \"war like\" tactics used but that is also its downfall IMO.  Its just too stressful to be fun.  As I said, MOH and MW2 are black and white, but I will say this, MOH seemed cleaner than any Call of Duty games. I saw a few people using barrier glitches but other than that, it was all clean kills.  The no perks idea was great, I hate perks but the killstreaks....epic fail, 'nough said.The reason I kept this game as long as I did was the objective game mode, which was very fun.  I liked this mode better than any other multiplayer match.  So if you like having objectives you must either destroy or defend, this is for you.  I know it was great because I used to despise such game modes :)I sold my game a short while after getting it.  I don't know what updates have been released for it and I don't really know how it has progressed, but this review really wasn't about fixable things for the most part.  I would say if you like realism get it.  A Call of Duty fanboy probably will not like this game at all.  If the multiplayer had been a little more tweaked I would still be playing it.  Story mode is for sure the winner here","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2011"}

No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system.

InManhunt's Carcer City, nothing matters anymore and all that's left are cheap thrills. The ultimate rush is the power to grant life and take it away, for sport. This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Pretty good","reviewText":"Manhunt is a tough game to view objectively. On one hand, it's a challenging test of skill that's frequently frustrating and often rewarding. On the other, it's loaded with potent violent imagery as it depicts the world as a dark, evil, rotten place where almost no one gets out alive. From a third-person perspective, you play James Earl Cash, a man given a death-sentence reprieve by \"the director,\" an unseen nemesis who communicates via an earpiece (the USB headset option is a great touch). You can earn your freedom but only by passing through several rundown areas populated by foul-mouthed, reprehensible street slime (supremacists, survivalists), looney-bin inmates, corrupt cops, and merciless S.W.A.T. teams. Oh, there's a bounty on your head, too. You begin with handheld weapons-glass shards, wire, plastic bags, hatchets-and acquire more potent \"tools\" as things progress. Stealth, though, plays a vital role in scoring a successful kill. You can use cans, bottles, and, ahem, severed heads to lure enemies to look in the opposite direction as you sneak in from behind. Playing into this gameplay facet is Manhunt's biggest gimmick: executions that vary in brutality depending on how long you remain poised behind a potential victim before striking. Successful slayings are presented via grainy, handheld footage reminiscent of a snuff film. Yes, this is all very gory, grisly, and absolutely not for kids or anyone with a weak stomach as people are decapitated, disemboweled, perforated, shot, and chainsawed-all to the cackling delight of your offscreen savior (brilliantly voiced by Brian Cox) who relishes each kill. But Manhunt is more than a snuff show-there's some genuine skill required, too, as the difficulty is pretty steep thanks to thorough A.I. Scenes (or levels) are frustrating, time-consuming, and loaded with trial and error-they're akin to those in early Tomb Raider games in that if you try to run through a level or take your enemies head-on, you'll be shredded in short order. In that aspect, Manhunt is far more challenging than enjoyable, and you'd probably feel unclean to admit that you enjoyed it. Manhunt's aesthetics pack a punch. City walls are peppered with graffiti, and the red palette is put to excellent use as blood splatters, flesh shears, and the occasional skull shatters across the screen. However, areas are very dimly lit, and the occasional awkward camera angle does hinder the action. The audio track fares slightly better (especially when played in surround): Voices are clean and audible, and sharp sound effects, such as footsteps of approaching enemies or the jarring jolt of gunfire, keep you immersed in the action.If you crave a dark, challenging game, Manhunt completely fits the bill if you have the fortitude, patience, and (parents, listen up) maturity to hit its mean streets. And although Manhunt bears the same developer name as Vice City, those expecting this to be a simple Grand Theft Auto offshoot will be sorely mistaken. Off you go.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0007D4MVS","reviewerName":"Bruce Aguilar","summary":"Touching is Good, Playing is Better","reviewText":"This is the perfect game for gamers like me.  Someone who likes to play for 15-20 minutes at a time.  Wario Ware Touched is a series of 5 second mini games that are easy to understand, fun to play and full of wacky (sometimes crass) humor.  The quick pace of the games makes it perfect for short gaming sessions and still lets you acomplish something.The main game won't tkae you taht long to finish, but even after you do there are still many other mini games to find.  You find them by mastering the games you have already discovered.  Playing in \"Album\" mode gives you a goal, say 20 repititions of the same mini game, that speeds up as you go along.  It can get real tense trying to beat the game as it speeds up a bit more each time you play through it.  By passing the goal on multiple games you open new mini games.  It's a great idea that keeps you playing to find all the hidden mini games.  Thankfully these bonus games are every bit as good as the main ones.  I'll be playing this game for quite some time trying to uncover all the games and trying to beat my previous high scores.You'll be dragging things , drawing, tapping, rubbing and even blowing on your DS to play these games.  The D-pad and buttons aren't used at all.  Some of the action even crosses from one screen on the DS to the other.  All these features insure that this is a very unique experience.  I think half the fun I had was just playing a game like I never have before.  New players of videogmes can pick up on this games mechanics real easy since it's all about touching and moving things around on the screen.Many times I found myself chuckling or laughing out loud while playing this game.  So be careful if you're playing in public and don't want to get crazy looks from passersby.  They might think you're going insane and maybe you are, but you're going to having a great time with Wario.  A truly memorable gaming experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Nightshift worshiper","summary":"Why did they ruin Elder scrolls?","reviewText":"I can't believe they decided to ruin this series. It's such a let down. In this game you will be doing the same things over and over again until it drives you insane! Finding gates to Oblivion, entering the gates, and finding the source of the gate so you can close it off. Over and over again. The armor and weapon choices are so basic that it's not even funny. It's got quite a bit, but it's all the same, just enchanted differently. No personality in equipment, items, people, or sidequests. And the storyline is just blah. One of the worst things I hated about this game was the fact that they took away the jump spells that were in Morrowind. One of the best things about Elder scrolls. I loved jumping 300 feet into the air and slowfalling back down whilst I'm fighting cliffracers in the air. That was awesome. Nothing awesome about Oblivion.Invisibility makes it a joke. Way too easy! And I don't know how long I roamed around sometimes without running into hardly anything to fight or  any new places. Just a bunch of trees, rocks, and hills. BORING! Oh...and turning into a vampire is absolutely stupid, and a waste of time. Vampirism works totally against you, and being a vampire is not in anyway enjoyable.The basics of this game: turn invisible until you get strong, and then just decimate everything with a warhammer.

{"product_name":"B000BI3QK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"All it's cracked up to be","reviewText":"I hope you have a lot of free time on your hands. In fact, its best to say goodbye to your friends and family right now, you aren't going to see them for a long time. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion will instantly suck you into its world and keep you there for months. Its do-what-you-want gameplay and massive world combine to create an almost flawless game that is incredibly fun to play and improves upon the previous installments.The good news is that you don't need to know anything about the previous Elder Scrolls games. The game opens with the emperor's assassination by a demonic cult which allows these portals called \"Oblivion Gates\" to open all over Cyrodiil. Your job is to figure out a way to close them. The story manages to pull you in right from the start while still allowing you to freely explore the world and take up any other quests that might interest you.Of course you could just as easily ignore the main quest all together and let the people fend for themselves. Feel like exploring the wild? Want to become a thief and steal everything in sight? How about going hunting or becoming an assassin? The game does not exaggerate when it asks \"What do you want to do today?\" There are hundreds of quests, and you will find that you always have something that you could be doing. Even though the game has a remarkable amount of things to do, the game manages to never feel overwhelming. Maybe it's due to the quest log, which keeps all of your quests organized nicely. Or maybe it's the fact that you never actually feel obligated to do any of it. You only have to do what you want to do. So while the main quest will take most people between 20-25 hours to complete, there is easily 100+ hours worth of content in the game if you choose to explore, which you will want to do.The same is true for your character. There are countless ways in which to customize your character. You can pick from your standard list of races like Elves and Orcs and then pick from some typical (and not so typical) list of character classes. Or you can create your own character class if you choose to. Each character class has a list of core skills and abilities, but you are never prevented from learning others. You can truly create a character that fights the way you want to fight.The world of Oblivion is just amazing. Not just in the sheer size of the world, but in the story as well. You really get a feeling that this world has its own culture and history to it. In fact, there are even books you can read in the game about the history of the world. There is a lot of depth to the world if you want to go looking for it. The main quest does a good job of making you go out and do some exploring, but you will only uncover a fraction of the world. There are tons of things to discover out in the wild including dungeons, shrines, forts and even hidden towns. I think it is safe to say that the majority of players will not even see half of what is there. Because the world is so huge, getting around it could have been a problem. Luckily the game features a \"fast travel\" system, which allows you to quickly travel to locations that you have already discovered. When you fast travel, it simulates the amount of time that it would have taken you to walk there, which is a nice touch.The combat in the game feels good and intense. Of course the type of character you make can drastically change how the combat works for your character. I personally made a warrior, so I was involved mostly in close combat (with a bit of spell casting). The combat in the game was pretty simple to learn. You basically have quick attacks and power attacks. As you level up your weapon skills, you gain special attacks. You can use these attacks (like disarming an opponent) by pressing in a certain direction while attacking. You can also block incoming attacks with your weapon or shield if you decide to use one. Battles can have a sort of rhythm to them, with you blocking enemy attacks, following up with your own attack, and then blocking again. The ranged combat in the game also works pretty well. There is a wide range of bows and arrows that you can use as well as a bunch of ranged spells. It feels pretty smooth overall.Experience in the game is done pretty well too, and a bit differently then some might expect. You gain experience in different skills simply by performing the action. So if you want to increase your blocking skill, you simply block attacks while in combat. You level up your stealth skills by sneaking around. It makes the leveling up system feel more natural and less contrived.The visuals in the game are amazing to say the least. The outdoor environments are by far the best in any game. The forests are full of trees, rocks and plants that all animate with the weather. The HDR lighting is in full force, which helps to create some beautiful looking outdoor landscapes. The amount of detail in everything is also impressive. Weapons and armor (as well as all the items in the world) are beautifully modeled and textured. The only thing negative about the graphics is that the frame rate can slow down a bit at times. It is mostly noticeable while riding around the world on horseback when the game is loading the next area. But for the most part the Xbox 360 gives you pretty solid performance.The audio in the game is exceptional. Every single character you will meet in the game has full speech. Given that there are hundreds of characters in the game, this is an amazing achievement. All of the voice acting is superb as well. While it would be nice if there were more voice actors in the game so you would not hear the same voice as much, there are a decent amount of voices. The music score in the game is also perfect.The AI in the game is actually pretty special. Bethesda has created what they call \"radiant AI\". Basically what it does is it gives all of the characters in the game daily routines that are not scripted. For example, if a character decides they are hungry, they might go find some food. When they are tired they go to bed. In the morning they will wake up and go to work. And the system allows for some variations within that schedule. So some days a character might sleep in or something similar. Characters also have dynamic conversations with each other about stuff that is going on in the world. While the conversations can sometimes feel a bit stiff, they are pretty impressive and go a good job of making the world feel alive. Characters also behave differently based on how much they like you. This can effect things like what or how much information they give you on certain topics, to if they will help you if they see you in trouble.Overall, this is one of the best RPG experiences you can find anywhere, and the strongest game the Xbox 360 has to offer so far. It is pretty clear that Oblivion has been a labor of love for the developers. They have poured all of their effort and creativity into this game and created the best single player RPG to come around in ages. This is a game that almost anyone can truly enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2006"}

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Let's Get Scratchin'","reviewText":"After owning it for over a month, I can say with confidence that this is the best fighting game for the 3DS next to Super Street Fighter IV.  And it's not because of the fighter's boobs!  Well, . . . not JUST because of that.The first game from their sexy franchise exclusively on a Nintendo console, Team NINJA made sure to make every hit count.  Everything jam-packed into this single inch-and-a-half game card screams DOA; the pummeling fists and feet, the hazardous multilevel arenas, the precision timing for throws and holds, and yes, the roster of (mostly) vivacious femmes fatales and the hypnotic sway of their gravity-defying 'attributes'.  Graphics do make the game, after all.Along with the mandatory gaming modes DOAD throws in a few extras to make the experience unique.  First up is \"Chronicle\"--part-story-mode, part-tutorial--which compresses the stories of the first 4 DOA titles while teaching players the basics.  The plot itself is nonexistent, the cutscenes are beautifully animated one minute and stagnant the next, and DOA facts posted on the touch screen distract players from the action.  But you'll still want to check it out because button-mashing can only take you so far.Another exclusive feature, \"Tag Challenge\", pairs you with another contender in handicap or tag matches.  But overpowered opponents, less-than-capable AI-controlled partners, and major balance issues ultimately ruin the experience.DOAD also makes the best use of StreetPass and SpotPass with its \"Throwdown\" mode.  While Street Fighter has figurine battles and Tekken has trading cards, in Throwdown the 3DS uses the data of other players to create an avatar you can fight with.  Even if your internet lags and you're the only kid on your block who owns this game (Like me), if you've got wifi, you're good.As you play, you also win figurines among other hidden goodies, which you can also buy with play coins.  In \"3D Showcase\", you can view these figurines up close and take photos of them from any angle.  This feature has caused quite a stir overseas as some of the characters are underaged, and yet no one complains when you throw them down a flight of stairs.Since a growing number of people within the gaming industry think virtual trophies are a good idea, let me take the opportunity to make this proposal to the next company looking to port their game to the 3DS: Why not bundle the game with an actual figurine?  If it worked for Skylanders, it'll work for you.This game is T for Teen: Violence, Adult Language.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004K1EA5G","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"Very fun portable fighter with less-than-stellar implementation of 3D effects","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this game quite as much as I have been. This game comes with a decent diversity of game modes. Unlike other games in the series, this entry is clearly geared toward welcoming new players into the fold. To that effect, a surprisingly lengthy 'campaign' mode introduces you both to the stories from previous games as well as to the controls, giving you advice on various moves and strategies. The 'story' in this is nigh-incomprehensible at points, but what is important is how it allows new players to become acquainted with the DOA universe.The gameplay itself is, as always with DOA, fantastic. Eschewing the combo-heavy action of games like Street Fighter, DOA: Dimensions is more tactical and might be likened to a complex game of rock, paper, scissors. You can, of course, get through quite a number of fights without any kind of discernible strategy, just punching and kicking stupidly, but you'll get creamed if you attempt this in some of the game's harder modes and difficulties.There are various modes on display, such as tag battles, survival battles, and more classic arcade-style assortments of enemies. This title also sports a fluid and workable (if somewhat restricting) online battle system. I suppose I should mention the showcase mode as well, which allows you to take 3D photos of figurines of the various fighters that you win through completing challenges, but most people won't spend much time on this aspect of the game.Control-wise, I am fairly impressed with what is on offer here. The circle pad and various buttons allows for fluid fighting, but there are also touch-screen buttons that allows the player to execute various commands automatically. I personally have no use for this control style, as, even though I kind of suck at fighting games, I still like the jerks and jabs associated with moving an analog stick around and pushing physical buttons. It is nice, though, for people who aren't accustomed to the fighter genre and might have difficulties with the default control style.The number of unlockables in this title is fantastic. Besides the large number of figurines, there are quite a few unlockable characters. The true star of this game, however, is the large number of costumes you can unlock for virtually every character. Many of the characters have 3 or 4 costumes that can be unlocked through completing various in-game achievements, and then have 3 or 4 more costumes that can be downloaded (more on that in a moment). This leads to a variety of looks you can provide for almost any given character.The downloadable aspect of this title is simply awesome. Every day, according to certain release schedules (re-releases of the same costume information are continuing into 2012, which is good for newcomers and bad, I suppose, for early adopters), new downloadable costumes are being released for various characters. Once a week there are special 'throw-down' battles that can be downloaded onto your 3DS. Some of these battles are surprisingly tough, and they can help build your ranking for online battles. The information is automatically downloaded when you turn on your 3DS' wireless capability and close it so that it goes to spotpass. If the information downloads successfully, a little dot appears on the avatar for the game when you're in the main menu, and when you start the game, directly after the title screen, a notification will pop up letting you know what was downloaded. Very useful, and these constant digital releases help keep the game in my 3DS and thus also lead to me playing it more often (almost every day).The graphics themselves, in 2D, are fairly impressive. It looks better than every game that came before DOA:4. Cutscenes are unimpressive, however, as they aren't full motion.Also worth noting is that the language options for this title can be customized. I switch between the Japanese and English language options quite a bit.This review wouldn't be complete if I didn't mention the fanservice/cheesecake factor that is prevalent in this series, and especially in this game. This series became (in)famous partially due to the attention the programmers payed to the breast movements of the female fighters. The breasts are floppy and fluid to the extent that they seem to obey their own set of physics in the battles and elsewhere. The gyroscope function of the 3DS can even be used to shake the breasts of the female figurines in showcase mode (which helps to add considerably to that mode's oddly voyeuristic feel). Moreover, the costumes on these ladies (especially the downloadable ones) can be very skimpy and/or kinky. Consider that at least two female fighters can be dressed up in cat ears and skin-tight leotards which take care to preserve an ample amount of cleavage in the breast area. This will be a definite pro for some and a con to others. This game's focus on T&A; will come across as either awesome or creepy, depending upon your personal temperament and proclivities. If you're uncomfortable with women being dressed and presented as sex objects, I'd advise you to either avoid this game entirely or else only play one of the male characters.There aren't too many problems with this game, but a very big one for me is the implementation of 3D. It's not that the 3D looks bad (although some uses of it are better than others: for instance, it is very awesome, when you play this game for the first time, to watch the game's title pop-out at you in the opening screen, but cut-scenes and battles look pretty unimpressive in 3D), but that turning the 3D on during battles cuts the frame rate from 60 fps to 30! This isn't a problem for some other games with less-than-stellar 3D processing, such as certain turn-based strategy games, but a fighting game needs fast gameplay, and the 3D just kills this title's speed. This wouldn't be a huge issue for a budget title, but DOA is a big franchise! Also, I know for a fact that this game could have done better. Mario Kart 7, for instance, both has a far superior 3D effect AND runs at 60 fps with the 3D turned on. Similarly, games like RE: Revelations do great 3D just fine. I play through almost everything on this system with the 3D enabled, even for virtual console games, where the outside border can be given a slight 3D pop. But I just have to turn off the 3D for the battles in this game, which, of course, are the meat-and-potatoes in any fighting game. It doesn't kill my enjoyment of this, obviously, but it does keep it from being a five-star product. A 3D game on a 3D system should be able to process 3D battles without choking on them.Ultimately, game-play is the most importantly aspect of any game, and DOA: Dimensions shines in this respect. The game is available here on Amazon for under $30, which is an excellent price. Fighting games tend to be one of my less favorite game genres, and yet I've spent quite a bit of time on this game. It is fun. Flawed, but fun. Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007FMSDU0","description":"","reviewerName":"Yemaya A.","summary":"Many improvements from 999 but still pretty disappointing; 3DS version dangerously buggy","reviewText":"VLR contains a lot of UI improvements from 999: the greatest of which is a built in flowchart that lets you see how your decisions are affecting the paths you take and what ending you'll arrive at (the chart will just have a mystery block at places and paths you haven't gotten to yet so no worries about spoilers). This is a godsend as their are more than 20 different endings in the game (as apposed to the 6 in 999) and you don't have to worry about accidentally getting the same ending twice as you can see where you are on the flowchart. You are also able to &#34;jump&#34; around to places all over the flowchart, so there is no need to start from the very beginning of the game each time you complete an ending.Another great addition is the much higher level of difficulty that the puzzles in VLR achieve. One of the few things that I disliked about 999 is that the puzzles were often incredibly easy, making them a little boring. VLR has fixed that with puzzles that raise the bar much higher and actually require some thought (although they can range from very easy to ones so difficult that you might have to switch to Easy Mode or look them up in a guide).The game also gives you a memo for writing things down, an archive feature that allows you retain more items used for puzzles or key events that happen on different paths, a PASS feature that retains the password for puzzle rooms you've already completed, and a secrets folder that keeps background information of various supplementary knowledge mentioned in the game (if you can unlock it by getting Secret Safe passwords).With so many improvements it was hard to see such a downgrade in terms of the characters, setting, and story. I don't hold 999 on a pedestal but when comparing the two, VLR has almost none of the atmosphere and great characters that made the original game so fantastic. Clover (as well as a few more characters from 999) returns--for example--, but she has now been flanderized as a ditzy airhead. But I think the story was the most disappointing. Without any spoilers: The ride you take throughout the game is actually very enjoyable. The ending however, becomes {opinion} a huge clusterf--ck that, while technically making sense, is just extremely stupid and relies on one big cop-out after another. The plot also does not get resolved; having been saved for the 3rd Zero Escape game.Of course I wouldn't give 3 stars just for a disappointing story (not with the gameplay and puzzles being improved so much). The main reason for the rating is that the 3DS version still seems to contain very serious bugs that still have not been patched since release. Thankfully I only managed to fun into a small bug once that just froze my game in a puzzle room. There exists, however, a very big save bug that might completely wipe your save randomly if you save in either the PEC room or the Crew Quarters (where my game froze). Because of this, I just avoided saving during puzzle sections all together. It was annoying but worth it to avoid losing a 40 hour save file. Even with the save bug, the game still appears very playable, but seeing how it is highly unlikely that Chunsoft is ever going to release a patch, I would have to recommend getting the Vita version (bug-free) perhaps.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Riddle Me This: How do you keep a review for one of the best PS3 games simple?","reviewText":"The good news is that by waiting this long to play Batman Arkham Asylum I got the game super cheap. The bad news is that I deprived myself of a great single player game for almost a year from its release date.Since I'm so late to the party with this review I'll try to keep it simple, and simply put, this game is well worth the release date price, and any opportunity to get it for less is money well spent. I thought that Batman AA would be like every other below average movie spin off game out there, but Batman AA is right up there in my book with the best single player games that I've played. And if you care to see the list of games I've played I'll include it as the first comment to this review.There is a lot to this game and it is very well developed. I played on Normal Difficulty and I'm glad that I did, because I died during a few battles and even when I got used to some of the battle patterns I was down to almost no health by the end of my retry. There's a lot of hand to hand combat where you start out with basic moves, and as you progress through the game you earn points towards upgrades that allow more advanced takeout moves, or you can apply the upgrades to increased health or gadget upgrades.I love games where you are rewarded for searching for hidden stuff, but you're not required to find the hidden stuff in order to progress through the game. Rest assured though, the more you search the more upgrade points you'll acquire making your life as Batman a lot easier.You play as The Dark Knight, and this is indeed the \"dark\"Alan MooreBatman, not the bright and happy TV Batman. The game is, well, dark, creepy, scary and exciting to play. And, man, does this game mess with your head sometimes. Your encounters with one particular foe will sometimes run chills down your spine and sometimes make you wonder what's wrong with your PS3.If I had to name the most important piece of advice to playing Batman AA, I'd say remember that it's an action/stealth game, and for the parts that require stealth...you'd better be stealthy!I promised to keep this simple, and I'm feeling like I could go on all day about how impressive Batman AA is. So let me just wrap up by saying that there aren't many games that I'd put ahead of this that I'd recommend. So it's as simple as this: Add Batman AA to your cart beforeArkham Asylum 2comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS5","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Third entry hit the high point","reviewText":"In the late 80's, Nintendo ruled the world with its NES. Countless games had been released and created many memories for gamers around the world. The Mega Man series were running full steam thanks to the underground buzz of Mega Man and the breakout success of Mega Man 2. Revered for the classic shoot and jump game play, memorable Robot Masters and awesome music, the games were a joy to play through and Capcom had to keep up with the demand for more Mega Man games. After releasing a Mega Man title for the Game Boy, they headed back to the drawing board for 1990's Mega Man 3. It was at that point that many felt (including myself) the NES Mega Man series reached the highest point.The story for Mega Man 3 goes like this: After being defeated twice, Dr. Wily decides to be a good guy and help Dr. Light create a new peace keeping robot for their world. In order for it to be fully powered, they send Mega Man to get energy crystals. Just as he leaves for his journey, robots go crazy and threaten to halt the introduction of the new robot. Now, Mega Man had to get the energy crystals and find out why the robots went crazy. Of course, in the end, Dr. Wily was behind the commotion and stole the robot so he can use it to take over the world. Surely, Mega Man stopped him......and found out that he had a brother, Proto Man.The premise of Mega Man 3 is the same as the previous two entries: Choose one stage out of eight stages filled with enemies and a Robot Master. Get the special weapons from all Robot Masters by completing all eight stages. Next, you moved on to the next set of stages (four \"Doc Robot\" levels where you face off against robots \"possessed\" by the spirits of the Robot Masters from Mega Man 2.) Finally, after you clear one extra stage, you reach Dr. Wily's castle and this time it was made up of six stages. By the time you beat the game, you would have played through 19 stages, the most in a Mega Man game out of the entire NES series. There were new additions first introduced to the NES Mega Man series: the ability to slide through narrow gaps between walls, Mega Man's new sidekick (Rush the robot dog) who came with his own adapters that transformed him into various objects, the ability to save up to nine energy tanks and Proto Man, Mega Man's brother who first appeared in disguise as Break Man to test Mega Man. The password system returned to help save your progress so you can continue your game later.The PROS: Mega Man 3 perfected everything that the Mega Man games were known for: a good story, excellent graphics, superb music, good sound effects, perfect controls and a difficulty level that wasn't too easy nor was it too overbearing. Capcom hit all the right notes with new Robot Masters (for the first time one of them was based on an animal, portraying a hint of what has yet to come), new stage layouts, appearances from Mega Man 2's Robot Masters, new abilities, new characters and the longest Mega Man game to grace the NES.The CONS: While it was mentioned in the story, you never ever picked up the energy crystals so it was kind of weird. Some gamers noticed that with this game, the Robot Masters were more prone to receive damage because they didn't have a grace period between hits. This was weird to see but it was just a small fraction against the game since you still had to memorize the robot's attack pattern and avoid touching it.Many gamers agreed that Mega Man 3 was another fun game to play starring the Blue Bomber. It sold very well and ensured that we would see him again. There are good reasons that Mega Man 3 in particular was and is still fondly remembered. All you have to do is play the game. For Mega Man fans, it was awesome. If you weren't a fan by the time it was released, then this game wouldn't sway your opinion. For those who missed out on any of the NES games, you did miss out. Get yourself a copy of this game through any of these methods: the actual cartridge, the Mega Man Anniversary Collection disk (PS2 or GC) or download this game for the Wii from the Virtual Console Cartridge for US $5.00 (500 points.) Any way you choose is worth it. I highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2011"}

It offers the pitch-perfect blend of stealth, intense action, gritty realism, and creepy sci-fi that is able to hook anybody.  While it may not be an official open-world sandbox game like the later Far Cry sequels, the size and scope of the game is massive, allowing you to explore and exploit every opportunity while still keeping you focused on your objectives.  Some aspects of it may seem dated today, like the character models and voice acting, but it still manages to stay fresh and entertaining.The story of Far Cry centers around Jack Carver, a retired Navy veteran who now runs a freelance boat charter company in the South Pacific.  While caught in a storm at sea, a rocket destroys his boat, forcing him to seek refuge in a beached cargo ship.  Inside, Jack discovers a radio, and makes contact with someone named Doyle, who helps him survive the numerous mercenaries scattered across the islands.  In his travels, Jack discovers that a mad doctor, Krieger, is conducting genetic modification experiments, creating ugly hybrid creatures called \"Trigens.\"  The mercenaries, led by Lieutanent Crowe, are there to ensure Krieger's research is not leaked to the outside world.Like I said, this game excels at allowing many different ways to play it.  Since you don't have regenerating health, you must replenish it through health packs and gain extra protection from bulletproof vests.  Furthermore, since these collectables aren't extremely plentiful, stealth is strongly emphasized.  You can crouch and go prone to reduce both your noise and visibility.  Your machete allows you to conserve ammo and make silent, one-hit kills, while the suppressed MP5 can take out a group of distant mercenaries with headshots without alerting them to your exact position.  You have an infinite supply of rocks to use for luring enemies into vulnerable positions, and you can even swim underwater to avoid detection.  Additionally, you have a special binocular that is able to track enemy movement and pick up their conversations, to allow for easier strategy planning.  When it's time to go loud, there is a healthy variety of other powerful weapons to use, including pistols, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, automatic shotguns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers.  You can even take control of various land and water vehicles for added protection, faster travel, and massive firepower.  Unfortunetly, you only have four weapon slots, so you must make strategic decisions with your loadout to be as diverse and deadly as possible.On the hardest difficulty setting, Far Cry proves itself more than a match for experienced players.  The mercenaries you face are very accurate, dish out heavy damage, and work together in groups to suppress and flank you.  Successfully overcoming them requires a mixture of stealth, heavy use of cover, ammo scavenging, use of medpacks and body armor, and utilizing the right weapon for the right situations.  Fortunetely, ammo type is classified according to weapon class, not a specific weapon.  This means if you have a very powerful assault rifle with grenade launcher and scope attachments, like the OICW, you able to use ammo from the M4, which doesn't have any of these attachments.  The Trigens, on the other hand, are brutal monsters.  They're able to absorb and deal massive amounts of damage, and can be equipped with overpowering weapons like heavy grenade launchers.  You'll have to deal with them from a very far distance or use cover for protection while you slowly whittle away their health.  The drastic difference in these two types of enemies means you'll have to switch gameplay styles on the fly, as you'll often encounter both types in the same level.The technical aspects of Far Cry are still marvelous to behold, even today.  Powered by Crytek's signature \"CryEngine,\" the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and immersive, showcasing sunny sandy beaches, dense mountain rainforests, dark messy underground research labs, and water so pristine and smooth, you'll immediately want to drink it.  The advanced physics, powered by the Havok physics engine, give real weight and interaction with environmental objects, and are well used on the enemies to provide killer ragdoll death animations, especially when they're caught in an explosion or you run them over with a vehicle.  Some issues do arise that reveal the game's age, like jerky animations, occasionly stiff controls, and unengaging voice acting, but luckily they don't take away from the enjoyment.Far Cry hits that pitch-perfect spot.  It's not as restrictive, unforgiving, or overwhelming as Far Cry 2, but it's also not as easy, dumbed-down, or unchallenging as Far Cry 3.  To this day, it remains one of my favorite PC-exclusive games ever, and it single-handedly made me re-evaluate my perception on PC gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

Only by working together can the assassins defeat their mortal enemies and prevent the extinction of their order.Multiple Ways to PlayExpanding on the game world woven across the first two games in the franchise,Assassin's Creed: Brotherhoodprovides players with multiple ways to play.

Players once again control Ezio, an assassin in Renaissance Italy, as well as Desmond, his modern counterpart who's reliving his life through genetic memory. Most of the game is the same as Assassin's Creed 2 - if you liked it, you'll like Brotherhood. In fact, I'd say a good 90% of the game is recycled. Therefore, it's more important to talk about the new parts of the game.The combat has been retooled slightly. The weapons are the same for the most part, with a few changes. One change is that some weapons are now automatically paired with a ranged weapon - the main weapon connects to Ezio's hidden pistol, while the sub-weapon connects to throwing knives. This allows for smoother combos, and means that you can use a weapon without having to specifically switch to the ranged weapon. Enemies are a bit smarter, too, and will grab at you more frequently (though they still attack one at a time and are easily dispatched by counter-kills).In AC2, the player had the opportunity to invest money into their home villa to make it more profitable and prosperous. AC:B takes place entirely in the city of Rome, and thus the entire city can be renovated and upgraded. This primarily takes two forms: the first is clearing out enemy strongholds, and the second is fixing up shops, banks, and landmarks. One issue I had with the latter aspect was that the only real \"benefit\" of it was to get you more money (which also happened with the first game), and the only real use of money besides upgrades is to upgrade your property, which gets you more money and so on.One thing I did appreciate is the increased number of missions that are actually about \"sneaking\" and \"assassination\", including the previously-mentioned enemy strongholds. There's actually a lot of missions where there's an incentive to remain undetected, find creative ways to approach a situation, and so on. It wasn't perfect, but it was a pretty neat attempt all things considered. A lot of the game's best moments are a result of these missions - almost failing, but then shooting the sentry with a crossbow before he discovers you, and so on.The titular \"Brotherhood\" refers to the brotherhood of Assassins, who Ezio takes command of roughly halfway through the game. Assassins are recruited from the rank of discontented citizens (the maximum number is based on how much of the city you control), and they serve two purposes. The first is to help you in the game world, either by assassinating a target for you (if you select a target and call for help when not in combat) or helping Ezio fight enemies (if you call for help while in combat). The second is sending them off on missions to get experience and monetary rewards.The upgrade system for the Assassins is unpleasantly simplistic: as Assassins become more experienced, the player can assign points to attack or defense. The problem arises because all assassins end up in the same place (there's 9 levels and only 4 points of attack and defense each). Assassins can be differentiated by their names, facial appearance, and selectable colors; unfortunately, when they hit maximum level their new costume means that they lose those selectable colors, which makes them all basically the same.The Assassins felt sort of unbalanced, too. The combat system is pretty easy, so for the most part calling your allies in felt like overkill. It was neat in some sequences, but it always felt more like \"I don't feel like bothering anymore, you guys come take care of this\". The only time I had assassins die was early on, when my low-level recruits blundered into a giant group of guards and refused to run away. Still, despite these issues, they still seem pretty cool: it's fun to chase a guy, almost lose him, and then sic one of your apprentices on him at the last second.Brotherhood also has a multiplayer mode, based on blending into a giant crowd of NPCs while trying to assassinate (and avoid being assassinated by) other players. While it's certainly innovative and entertaining, it also seemed a bit oddly-paced. It felt like a deathmatch, but with more gaps between kills. It was kind of fun, but just sort of simplistic. Once you'd figured out the gameplay, it just felt like doing the same thing over and over - there weren't a lot of evolving strategies or clever ploys to carry out.My main problem with this game is that a lot of the content feels sort of overdone. The new stuff is fun, but the thing that actually named the game (the assassin recruits) is really underdeveloped. Most of the content is just stuff from AC2 over again - your new hideout, the new flags to collect, the new feathers to collect, the new secret lairs to explore, etcetera. The new levels and side-missions really make up for it, but a lot of the content just felt like a slog that I didn't want to bother going through again. Still, if you enjoyed AC2, you'll definitely want to give Brotherhood a shot.Rating: 7/10.We purchased this game with our own funds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K898","description":"","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"A good start as long as DC will improve on it","reviewText":"Hero MMORPGs have been around for years. \"City of Heroes\" was the first, followed closely by Champions Online, both of which have an established fan base and vocal advocates. With DCUO, the first major comic company has stepped up to join the fun. It took so long getting this out you would think the creators would have taken time to look at what the others offer and try to improve on it. Instead, we get a very limited hero experience that does have great supporting characters and possibilities.Getting to fly around Gotham City and Metropolis are indeed thrills you can beat. The opportunity to have Batman or Superman as your mentor are also great draws to the game. Unfortunately, the flexibility in character creation and power sets are glaring problems. You have roughly a dozen power sets to choose from and that's all. While each power set gives you the opportunity to improve the basic powers with each skill or power point you earn, it is still a very limited experience compared to what's offered. DC has made the character creation screen fairly easy if you want to cheat by giving you the opportunity to become instant knockoffs of major characters like Batman, Superman, Green Arrow, Flash, Beast Boy, Deathstroke, and others (no Green Lantern though). The costume is a little different (like you're some multiverse variation of them) but the power sets are very close.Another problem is the load time. When using a computer, you can set your program up to load and do other things while waiting. With the PS3 version, when the download bar pops up, you know your evening is shot and you aren't playing the game tonight. I have a fairly quick broadband connection, but 11GB downloads are going to take a while no matter what. And don't consider carrying on a conversation with anyone using the pop-up keyboard. You'll need to invest in a keyboard if you plan on chatting.The price for a monthly PS3 subscription to the game is the same as City of Heroes (Champions Online lets you play for free), so the price doesn't make it a draw either.Gameplay is fun (when you finally get in there). The controls are pretty much in line with other hero games out there for the PS3. And there's no denying the opportunity to take on Scarecrow, the Joker, and others is a blast! Also, you might find yourself teaming up with other characters like Superman, Batman, Batwoman, Etc at unexpected moments.Compared to other established hero MMORPGs (and especially considering how many years they've been working on this), DCUO falls to the bottom of the pile right now. Perhaps in the future with a better updating process and more content it will be able to stand on its own. For now, there are other options that are better choices. Paying sixty dollars for a game you have to pay fifteen dollars a month to play is ridiculous. They should have offered the game at half that price at the most.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2011"}

The fighting system allows for individual players to adopt their own strategies and learn to best use each player to be effective in those strategies (I.E. Defensive v. Aggressive style players, etc.).I can't help but compare this game to Virtua Fighter 4, which I still consider to be the definitive fighting game so far. Tekken has a diverse range of characters, true, but they can all be used similarly. When I say this, I mean that a player needs only learn to use moves and combos to effectively hammer away an opponents defenses and win matches. There is less strategy than brute force, and this is in some ways a very admirable thing. However, the game lacks the solid fighting system and overall grace that VF4 reigns in.I once read a review that stated that Tekken was to hip-hop as Virtua Fighter is to Ballet. That's the best comparison between the two I've seen. I think this game is definetely worthy of a place in the library of any fighting game afficionado simply because it embraces a certain brutal aspect of the fighting genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2002"}

McAdams","summary":"Overlord is the first game I have ever purchased for the 360 (outside Live Arcade) and that is saying something","reviewText":"This game is extremely entertaining.  Which, above all else, is exactly what a video game is supposed to be.  The other reviewers are correct, the game is flawed, as most games with a production budget, a shipping deadline, and a market department are.  It was not shipped before it was READY, but it was shipped before it was POLISHED.First, the PROS:1.) The game is funny2.) The minions are adorable (love the random hats!)3.) The graphics are great4.) The puzzles are fairly balanced (although those freaking sea serpent battles I could have done without!)5.) You do not have to be truly evil!  I was worried about this.  But, a'la KOTOR, and Fable, and Jade Empire, etc. there is a path of \"lesser evil\" available in this game, which is basically like the character alignment of \"chaotic good\" in Dungeons and Dragons.  In other words, you can play as a \"Hero\" who doesn't follow the rules. (You can also play as a right evil bastard, if you so choose)6.) The game has a good story, and moves at a good pace, and even has a surprise twist near the end which I wasn't expecting.7.) Production values are very nice: very good voice acting, very good music, sound effects, graphics, etc.Now the CONS:1.) No in-game map is INEXCUSABLE.  I have a very good memory, and even I got turned around/lost occasionally.  Without an in-game map, exploration, and finding things takes way more time than it should, and you can never be truly sure you have found everything.  An in-game map in a game with exploration is kind of like a check list for exploring.  You can pull it up and instantly see where you have been, and which directions have things yet to be uncovered.  The game comes with a fold out map of the major game areas (top side, not dungeons), with most of the major stuff on it, but that isn't good enough.2.) The minion path finding isn't that bright at all.  If your minions get out of your sight, and go around too many corners, then in order to get them back, you will have to go fetch them.  This is annoying, because A.) your minions are CONSTANTLY carrying random things back to portal gates, which means you either need to escort them each time they do this (time consuming) or accept their loss until you are ready to visit a gate yourself (dangerous -- they are your main weapons early on in the game) B.) this led the game designers to introduce the minion \"sweeping\" idea, which is basically that the default behavior of the right analog stick is to move your minion horde around, much like the left one moves you around -- the problem with THAT though, is that it takes away the camera control which is normally mapped to the right analog stick.  In order to get it back, you have to hold down the left bumper, then it controls the camera per usual.  The default follow camera works fine up to a point, but there are PLENTY of times in the game where you need to be swinging the camera around (such as COMBAT! and PUZZLES!) and at such times, this whole contrivance is extremely obnoxious3.) The game is short.  If you just do the main story line, and you don't dilly-dally, I think you could finish the game in around 20 hours or so.  There aren't much other things to do besides the main storyline though, except for dungeon fighting in your tower to get achievements and minions and equipment upgrades, etc.4.) The game is very linear.  VERY linear.  You have a narrator for the entire game, and there is basically no freedom to choose how the story will unfold.  Much like KOTOR and Fable and Jade Empire before it.  That isn't of itself a BAD thing, but at the very least they could have given us more options than simply \"kill everyone and everything in sight\" or, you know ... don't.5.) They should have gone for an 'M' Mature rating, and made the story a bit more interesting.  The mistress tower \"love scene\" was disappointingly vague and tongue-in-cheek, it will sail over the heads of most pre/early-teens, and frustrate everyone else.  They didn't need to go full bore God of War sex mini-game, but maybe a half way point would have been nice.6.) The game is fairly misogynistic (that means: having a hatred, dislike, or mistrust of women for no good reason, for those of you still in K-12).  You don't get any say in whether your main character is a male or a female, you are a male, period.  The game doesn't let you decide to take a mistress or not, you must.  The game also allows you (if you are playing the truly evil way) to capture and keep female slaves as your tower servants.  I fully understand what the game is trying to do and that this is all tongue-in-cheek, and supposed to be humorous, and I am sure the game creators are not actually (all) misogynists, but the facts remain and are pretty damning.  Of course, an evil Overlord cares not for these things, and in a world of games like Manhunt (which I will not speak of), G.T.A. (where you abuse female prostitutes as a game mechanic for regaining health, amongst other horrors), and even God of War with its sex mini-games, this is all tame by comparison.  Still, it is fairly discomforting, especially to females who might want to play the game.  I imagine, that after centuries of this, that the female population is getting pretty darn tired of being depicted as helpless sexual objects in all forms of entertainment.  But that's just my opinion.7.) There are bugs in the game, game breaking ones -- which other reviewers have already mentioned.  This isn't unforgivable in and of itself, but it is disappointing.  However, like has already been mentioned, the truly serious ones are hardly ever encountered, unless you are deliberately trying to do the game as out of order as you can possibly get away with, to which I say kudos to you.  ^_-8.) There isn't much else to DO in the game, other than follow the linear story line.  Revisit an old area, and the peasants will either sing your praises or cower in fear from you (and that is it, no shops, no dialog, not even random battle opportunities), or you will visit an empty and cleared dungeon with some token critters running around which you can kill for life force.  Other than the main story, and your dungeon arena to harvest more life force by battling previously defeated creatures to get achievements, and your equipment forging/upgrading, that is about it as far as what you can do in the game.  You can't even talk to your mistress or other tower inhabitants, except at pre-determined intervals.  That was especially disappointing -- maybe for the sequel they'll expand on that?Overall: good game.  The minion aspect of it makes it unique enough to try, even if you are not a huge RPG fan.  I am told it plays a lot like \"evil Pikmin\" from Nintendo (I wouldn't know, I never played that game).  The game STRONGLY reminds me of Fable for the XBOX.  The linear storyline, the cut scenes, and especially the constant narrator telling you what it going on, where to go, etc. are all strongly reminiscent of Fable.  The Good Vs. Evil stuff is strongly linked to KOTOR in my mind (not that they were the first to do it, but they were to the first to do it WELL).  The one-button combat stuff is strongly linked to Jade Empire in my mind as well (yes, I know there were more button options than that -- but who REALLY used them?).  Overall, it is a good game, and the first real (non Live Arcade) game I have purchased for my 360 (which is saying something) -- but it could have been better.  Hopefully for the sequel (and you know there will be a sequel with the number of units it has sold) it will be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2007"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"TRFB","summary":"Bugs....REALLY!...Aren't game designers doing their jobs!!!!","reviewText":"I rented this game and ended up buying it!!!

I like the fact that you can jump and grab onto ledges without having to hold in the X button like on the PS1.But, now I just can't get past the fact that a bug is keeping me from progressing onto the next level!!!!!  I really regret buying the game.  If I encountered this bug before I bought it, I would've sent it right back.I searched on-line and found out that there is a way to avoid the issue.  However, this means NOT taking a path in the fork in the road to get a treasure.  If you do take that road, turns out when you get to another level and you need to cross a chasm with your motorcycle, guess what?  Yep, the ramp is down and you can't cross for the life of you!!!!  So frustrating.  As much as I LOVE this game.  The story, the gameplay, the bugs really annoy me.  And so I have to say pass on this game.  Or, play the game but, get through the whole game without getting the treasure.  Then, the game allows you to play each level selectively to get all the treasure.  Looks like I'm going to have to start the game ALL OVER again, and this time, NOT get all the treasures.  What a rip off!!!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"dancinhomer","summary":"A Fun 3rd Person Shooter with Horror and Humor Elements","reviewText":"This is a third-person shooter that blends humor and horror in an effective way that makes for an engaging storyline.  I generally eschew games that use sexual puns or thinly-veiled sexual humor, but this game goes out of its way to keep you from taking *anything* about it too seriously so I would think that only the most sensitive of players would be offended.  The title and innuendos aside, it's the atmosphere and the theme of the game (going to Hell to save your woman) that would be more concerning to parents than the violence, as the violence is basically your standard monster-shooting.  As to the game itself, the controls are good and the game moves at a fairly brisk pace.  Upgrades to weapons are great, but the rubies required as currency to buy said upgrades can be hard to find (a minor complaint).  It's very linear, which will bother some and there are no side missions, but the quest itself will keep you entertained for several hours.  It's certainly a fun game for those who enjoy third-person shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2013"}

Left 4 dead isn't scary because there is always 3 people watching your back, saying \"reloading\" every two seconds and you have unlimited ammo. In Dead Island, most of the time you'll be fighting them hand to hand and death can be around every corner. I also enjoyed the leveling and skill tree features. The game is a bit buggy, especially when quest tracking and the map are concerned. Also this is a \"Steam\" game which means once you buy it, you can't sell it or give it away, you need internet access to even play one player, and if Valve decides to it can just take this and all your steam games away from you.Co op is very fun.

I even requested Nov 4th off a month ahead because that's how ready i was for the Kinect. I pretty much already knew what 2 do as soon as i took it out of the box. I've been watching Youtube videos about it months in advance so i knew how 2 play most of the games already. It's easy 2 set up of course. Just plug it in and let it update and install itself and the camera on it is super crispy clear. Better than my previous Xbox cam. And the camera moves when you move around the room and when playing a game, it always lets u know if you're out of the \"gaming zone\". After playing Sonic Free Riders 4 about an hour, i went online with it and i was beating people left and right. lol. You guys really need 2 pick that game up. It's my fav so far. Ignore the low ratings. Kinectimals is aimed at kids but i bought it anyways and it's ok in my opinion. The graphics are nice. I'm sure my neices and nephews would love it though. Kinect adventures is a good game 2 play if you're trying 2 figure out what the Kinect is all about. Kinect Sports is a work out. It will remind u of the Wii but it will be controller free and the music that they play during the events are nice. If u play the Kinect, make sure u have water and possibly a fan in the room because u will be burning calories. I think i've burned a few seeing that i haven't worked out in years prior 2 purchasing this item. Also pick up Joy Ride for the Kinect. I like that game also. Not many people play it online though but its definitely cool because it saves u 100 seeing that that's how much most console wheels cost and most of them break easily so using your arms is way better. There are only about 15 games out for the Kinect so far but i'm thinking about getting Dance Central since i'm hearing so much buzz about it. I wasn't gonna get it at 1st but i am curious as 2 what the buzz is about. Anyways, this is a great product that will bring your family 2gether on family nite or any nite so don't knock it until you've tried it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

For the rest of the game, players will take control of platform-centered levels with Tails and Rose, treasure-hunting with Knuckles, shoot-em up levels with Gamma, and fishing (fishing? Yes, fishing,) with Big the Cat.The Sonic levels are by far the most fun, but have a few minor problems; namely, the camera and some slight control issues.  Sonic's homing attack sometimes gets out of hand, with Sonic floating aimlessly through the air as he looks for the enemy you told him to attack.  When Sonic builds up enough speed on some of the faster levels (like Windy Valley or Speed Highway,) it's hard to control him, so he'll be bouncing off walls.  It doesn't really slow his speed down, but it's kind of distracting all the same.There's just not enough of the high-speed levels; playing as Tails is fun, but the Knuckles, Gamma, and Rose levels are mediocre, and the Big levels are a mess.

Tons of killing, blood and gore! it (aside from the gore) really gives you the \"feel\" of being in prison and not a wink of help in sight. the sense of desperation only grows throughout the game. and the \"creatures\" are inspired by their varied criminal acts! right down to \"bodily fluids\" pooling beneath hanging or fallen bodies! this game is brilliant. its really rare a game with this much violence and gore (till you hurl!) turns out so well when so many turn out so poorly.

And my wife has a good number of hours logged herself. =)  If you enjoyed the GC version, you will definitely love this one too.  And for us adults out there, don't be afraid to play this game.  Sure it looks kiddie but man it's fun! lol  But as one guy said, the fun does wear off as time goes on.  But believe me, you do get loads of enjoyment out of this title.  I love the fact that there are many more species of life in the DS version, namely the saltwater fish.  I caught a shark yesterday and it was too cool!  I do see where the GC version is better than it's DS counterpart but that's no real biggie b/c it's still a blast for item collectors.  There are once again so many things to collect and catch and such.  The one thing in this game that really ticked me off is that I found out that I cannot get Tom Nook's Nookington's with the barber shop in it due to the fact that I am not connected with wi-fi and such and I only have one DS as well.  I also only have a dial-up connection in my home.  So it appears that the main store with the barber shop is off-limits for my wife and I.  That is really really so irritating to me.  Hence the 2 star overall rating. To me this was unforgiveable since the GC version I had no trouble getting the department store all by myself with my one copy of AC.  Nintendo should have thrown in another way to get Nookington's for those like me out there in the gaming world.  But to sum up this title, if you are ok with a \"cutesy\" game with an addictive collecting theme, then pick this one up.

For those who don&#8217;t know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at the first one in the series.The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. What&#8217;s weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don&#8217;t know why though, it&#8217;s definitely unusual. But nonetheless, let&#8217;s continue with the game.The first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, let&#8217;s discuss the actual gameplay.The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic can&#8217;t figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you&#8217;re never sure if the game will allow you to swim. It&#8217;s stupid and what&#8217;s weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so it&#8217;s really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if it&#8217;s a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don&#8217;t actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starman&#8217;s in Super Mario Bros.The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don&#8217;t spin attack them because they will immediately explode.A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. What&#8217;s weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesn&#8217;t let you rescue her for some odd reason, but what&#8217;s even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don&#8217;t understand why early PlayStation games didn&#8217;t allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so it&#8217;s at least not a long and annoying password.If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, you&#8217;ll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.Now while this game has some flaws, it&#8217;s still a good game overall, it&#8217;s not as good as the second and third game, but it&#8217;s definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, it&#8217;s only $6 on the PlayStation Store so it&#8217;s not expensive or anything. It&#8217;s definitely a classic.FINAL RATING:  8 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

Guide Joanna Dark on her journey to become the Perfect Agent. Perfect Dark Zero features a compelling and captivating story pluging players into a world of corporate espionage and conspiracy.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"PDZ isn't anything like Perfect Dark 64 sadly..","reviewText":"In PDZ, you take up arms as Joanna Dark once more, except this time as a teenager and a bounty hunter with her pops Jack Dark. Once her father is killed by the evil corporation of dataDYNE on a mission, and a conspiracy begins to unfold around the same company, Joanna teams up with Carrington Institute to try and topple dataDyne...and to avenge her dad's death as well.You see the world through Joanna's eyes as she runs around blowing away enemies with an assortment of weapons including a shotgun, the Superdragon, a \"Shockwave\" sniper rifle (remember the FarSight in the 64 game? Well this is the equivelent of it), the DY .357 magnum, and many more. You get to use turrets, hover crafts, and this mechanical walker thing with an M60 on it so that was cool too. You can use ziplines to get from one building to the next, and you can even press up against walls for cover and precise firing.Lets talk a difference between this title and it's masterpiece of a predessor on the Nintendo 64. For starters, in Zero before you can do a stage you have to select your weapons and make sure you have enough space in the item slots for it. So in essence, you could really only carry one assault rifle and one SMG. That is VERY lame in my opinion - I don't play a first person shooter to manage inventory. Moving on, in order to unlock new weapons - say a CMP150 SMG that wasn't in your beginning inventory -for use in other stages, you must complete that level while having the CMP150 as one of your current weapons; WHICH means you must toss a weapon, take the CMP, and beat the level with it to have it for further use. Another lame idea. So if you are currently wondering, yes I am missing a bunch of weapons in my inventory. However, Perfect Dark 64 didn't have any of this and equaled out for a much better experience.The multiplayer is somewhat redeeming, but still no match for PD64. You choose a level, how big it is, your weapon set, character/team, bots, and gametype and go at it. There are some interesting games like Infection or Hacking, but it's been done before. However, this game pretty much took out the in-depth character & bot customization process the 64 version had as well as being able to command your team, and in turn, lost a lot of points and was almost lackluster. Furthermore, you must actually beat the game to unlock all the bots, teams, and characters to get the most of the multiplayer - ahem, LAME!. However, it will still provide you with some fun if you and a couple of your friends are looking to just blow each other or some bots away. There is also a Co-Op mode which was pretty fun I'll admit.I'm forced to admit, but this is the best looking game I have ever seen. Everything looks incredibly realistic, the lighting is superb, the characters look humanlike and move as fluid as one as well. The enviroments, be it vast jungles, dense cities, or huge mansions are truley breathtaking. Perfect Dark Zero definitley showed the power of the X-Box 360, and really set the standard for future games. HOWWWWWWWEVER, and this was inevitable to avoid on this review, was the fact that I despise what they did with Joanna Dark's look. She was never a punk rock chick, nor was she a supermodel - she was grotesque in the 64, she was british, she was something that could pass off as a secret agent... sigh, why Rare, why?The music has it's ups and downs. Some songs, like when you are..grr..managing your inventory..are techno-esk and remind me of the glory days of PD64. Then there are the heavy metal / rock sections which help you get pumped up for a big battle. Then, there are the actual rave tunes which truley ruined it all for me. It was ridiculous and didn't help the overall atmosphere of the game at all. The voice acting was good for the most part, except Jack Dark who was just annoying.The ending was flat out bad, but from what I have seen recently, most games are. You destroy the main villian/CEO of dataDYNE (can't remember his name at the moment) who underwent some transformation and became something that reminded me of a Dragon Ball Z character with the kamahamaha blasts and super strength. Anyway, you kill him, and officially join Carrington Institute - hence setting the stage for Perfect Dark 64... not worth it in the least bit.And I'm not going to lie - this game is hard, and then incredibly harder on other parts such as the Jungle stage. The good news? It's short, with a mere 13 missions.With all the hype surrounding this game, and with the memory of how awesome the first game was, I'm actually really dissapointed in the overall experience I had. Perfect Dark Zero had it's moments of decently intense firefights and pretty good multiplayer, but for the most part it was just a run of the mill FPS - albeit with excellent graphics. I suggest a rental, nothing more....Also, in the club mission, if you look around at the videos on the wall...they are the from Windows Media Player. It was Microsoft's own little plug, just like in Condemned.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

I find the game to be boring as all hell, dull, and overly easy.  I bought this game after getting Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 as I loved both games, but unfortunately this game is not as exciting, as fun or as challenging as either of those.Gameplay (1/5) - The game is so boring that it is not even funny.  From the first section NPCs do all of your fighting for you, then when you finally do get to take control and climb through the sewers your magic can kill anything rat or goblin in 1 hit.  Travelling from area to area is absolutely aweful.  You have to trudge across long stretches of land to get from one location to another, this would not be so bad, if there were tons of enemies to kill in the middle, but finding an enemy is like pulling teeth.  The fighting isnt aweful, it actually works pretty well, if you can stomach sword fighting in the first person perspective.Leveling System (1/5) - Oh my god, this is an absolute nightmare.  In every other normal RPG you fight enemies, you get exp and you can level up... not in this one.  To level up you chose a set of dominant skills and you have to use them over and over to increase their skill until you level up.  For instance if you chose Destruction all you have to do is spend an hour shooting fireballs into space and you will level up, or if you chose agility, you jump up and down for an hour and you level up, if you chose blade, swing you sword around for a while and you level up... it dosent even have to be at an enemy, it can be at air... get my drift??Quests (1/5) - Very few of the quests are really fun.  They all entail hiking long distances, to do some repetitive action, fight a few bad guys and call it a day.  Truthfully nothing fun or creative about it.Plot (3/5)- The plot is pretty good, the emporer is dead and you have to find his illegitimate son to take the throne, the only problem is a portal has been opened and demons are pouring out of it, so of course you have to save the world.  Pretty generic stuff, but could be worse.Powers/Weapons (5/5) - I really do love the inclusion of powers.  You can use every combination you can dream of and the magic system was done very well.  My character is a mage base so I use the powers more than I do the weapons.  The powers have different classes from healing to killing to everything in between.  I love using the conjuring, destruction and healing powers as I find them the most useful.  The weapons are pretty generic sword, shield, mace, until you get further in the relly start getting cool.  They are useful, they do the job and they are easy to use.Graphics (3/5) -  The graphics really are nothing to get that excited about.  The scenery and the towns are beautiful, well built and perfect.  But other characters are a disaster, they look aweful.  The targeted landscape or perfection and dropped the ball on character design.Music (3/5) - What can I say? Generic Lord of the Rings-esq music, not good not bad, just, egh.In essence the game is a cross between Lord of the Rings and Fallout.  The came is very mediocre, and is boring as all hell.  I expected it to be similar to Fallout in the amount of enemies and difficulty but I was dead wrong at that point.  Either rent it or buy it used, definately not worth the money.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2012"}

Quite frankly, this is my favorite Wii U game to date. It offers a ton of exploration, in a massive sandbox environment, full of things to see and do. This is truly a game for all ages. The gameplay's solid, the writing's sharp, the graphics are crisp, etc.But I do have one major complaint. What's up with these load times? First we boot up the Wii U, insert the disc and we're treated to some noise from inside the disc drive, however nothing is showing up on the screen, so we wait about 20 seconds and it finally shows the Lego City: Undercover logo on the home screen. We start the game, only to constantly be interrupted by long loading screens when entering buildings. So that's my main complaint, cause these loads are way too long. Hopefully they'll patch the game to cut down on these.Now as for the rest of the game, I don't really have any major complaints, aside from the vehicle handling, which does take some time to get the hang of. I always saw the Lego games as quality kids titles that also appeal to many adults, but they never hooked me, perhaps because they're always based off of established properties. But Lego City: Undercover is entirely original, offering a really colorful cast of characters, well-acted, and an overall humorous and fun plot. As an \"adult,\" I found myself interested in the story and laughing at many of the lines.This game really does feel like a Grand Theft Auto game in the Lego universe, but you're the good guy. I do like how you can climb up buildings and parkour, adding vertical elements to the gameplay. This is a really charming and endearing game, in my opinion. If you always wanted to play an open world game without the violence, it's time to go Undercover.4/5 - I docked 1 star for the load times. If the load times are patched, though, my score would easily bump up to 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2013"}

The bosses are very easy to defeat if you know the correct way of beating them. Each one requires a different strategy. The game has very good graphics, some of the best I have seen on the PS2 I might add. Once you beat the level you are awarded experience points, that you can use to purchase combos, new axes or bows, or even extra armor.The only downside however is the fact that you can beat the game with one character in about 6 hours.

When I say tweaking, I mean that it starts you out on the pro level and I was having WAY TOO MUCH success. It took me about an hour to get used to the controls and once I did, I was scoring 55 points a game with the KC Chiefs... who only had 1 first down on opening day. So, I decided to upgrade to All-Pro. When I did that... the game was tremendously difficult. It went from WAY TOO EASY on Pro to WAY TOO HARD on All-Pro. When I say hard... I threw 6 passes... 5 of them were intercepted. Only 1 of them was one that I knew was intercepted when I threw it.So, I settled on All-Pro and turned down the interception sliders and managed to find my comfort zone. That was wonderful. I like defensive oriented games. Some people may like 51-42 games between the Chiefs and Ravens, but I like that you can adjust it... cause I like realism.The upgraded artificial intelligence is amazing. The amount of time that went into the computer intelligence is mind-blowing... and once you find your comfort zone with the sliders... there is no better football game on the planet.I could care less about the added fluff around the edges... the flyovers, the national anthem, the coach belittling the Offesive lineman when the QB screws up. I don't know what that's about?? What I care about is what happens between the out of bounds lines and that part is spectacular.There's a lot to say about this game and I'm sorry if this is long, but there's a few more things I'd like to add. I like the time runoff on each play... makes gametime more real. I like that LATE HITS and HITS OUT OF BOUNDS are now flagged.As far as I'm concerned, they can get rid of all that fluff on every game and give us a truly ridiculous SUPERBOWL like we get in real life. Aerosmith, No Doubt, Janet Jackson's boob (just kidding)... but just spectacle. Fireworks. A streaker.Ultimately, the low sales on this game have nothing to do with its quality. People are broke.

It's all turn-based, and you can't summon anymore. The cutscenes and transformations look great but the graphics aren't different from FFX. I enjoyed the concerts. The music is nice, but it can get repetitive. I didn't like this game much, and I didn't even want to finish it. I'm not stuck or anything, I'm just not interested. I recommend trying this game, though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2004"}

{"product_name":"B0009WPZMW","description":"Burnout Revenge X360","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Car-Smashing Fun!","reviewText":"Most racing games have you trying to dodge crashes and hitting your opponents. In Burnout Revenge, your entire goal is to create as much mayhem as possible.We have every racing game for the XBox 360 and really love this genre. I have to admit that the first few times playing Burnout Revenge that I found it VERY hard to \"hit\" the cars. I would naturally dodge them. Even when I said to myself \"hit them! hit them!\" my fingers would zoom around them. I finally broke that habit and was able to mash them with great glee.The graphics are really quite amazing. The car model is great of course - they have really gotten that down on the XBox 360. But more than that - your car deforms in a TON of ways. The paint scrapes off. The sides dent in. It all has to do with how you damage yourself. Cars get sheared in half, tires fly off, you name it.There are a number of game types. There are races where you bash as you go. There are crash situations where you launch yourself into traffic and see how much destruction you can make. Other cars on the highway are fair game; bash them and watch them fly. Boost yourself to faster speeds. You develop relationships with other drivers - there will be certain cars that are out for revenge. There are grand prix matches of multi races.Each course has its own distinct feel. These aren't closed tracks - you are driving through the streets of LA, Miami, Tokyo and other areas. You get palm trees and shiny office buildings, all depending on the area you're in. There are helicopters flying overhead and a ton of car models.The music is reaosnably good, a collection of fast-paced modern music. I would have loved it if you could choose from different music styles as well, but you can't have everything.There's a ton of replay value here - you go back to get the top ranking in every course, aiming for those perfect scores. Since you unlock some really cool cars as you go, it can really help out to take one of the later, super cars back to the early tracks.The LIVE feature is really neat, too. Not only can you bash other players online, but you can even record your favorite crashes and load them up. It might be voted one of the top 20 best!If I had any complaints about this game, it would be the \"look back\" the game does every time you slay an enemy. Since your car is still moving very quickly, it's sometimes really tough, if you're about to hit a wall or something, to have that look away and look back happen. Also, I don't like the camera angle in general. It is very low and right against the car. I like an angle that is higher up and further back. I realize some players like both of these features as is, so I wish they would have options for a player to change these 2 items.Still, those are minor complaints in a game that is a ton of fun. Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2006"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Francisco Cortes","summary":"Great game but not a great improvement for Arkham Asylum.","reviewText":"Well, what can I say... Batman is now \"Infamous\". The gameplay of this game is pretty similar to the game Infamous but with a DARKER touch. Arkham City has the excact gameplay as Arkham Asylum with some cool improvements such as going around the city anyway you want (as the game Infamous or Prototype), TONS of extra missions, some new gadgets, some new fighting styles, more villains, more stunts, more stealth, more clues, and more creepyness.But like I said, is not a GREAT improvement for the previous Arkham Asylum. Here are some of my points:* For a game set in a city I was expecting car chases with the Batmobile, chases with the Batjet, or maybe underwater missions.* NO SCARECROW! One of the things that made Arkham Asylum SOOO UNIQUE from other Batman games was the illusions of Scarecrow. It doesn't have to be Scarecrow the one who twist Batman but I REALLY was expecting to play with insanity in Batman's mind!* No scary levels as the Killer Croc stage in Arkham Asylum. Actually, there are scary levels in this game but I don't remember one that is sooo suspenseful and creepy as the Killer Croc level.* You only get to play as Batman in the story mode. I know that in Arkham Asylum you can play as the Joker and in this one you can play as Catwoman, but I was expecting to play as Robin or Catwoman in the main story, not only on extra missions or extra gameplay. In fact, if I only get to play as Batman then the story should focus a little bit on the missions of Robin or Catwoman, not just Batman. I was expecting that improvement.* There isn't too much interactivity with the game. Examples: you don't get on a runaway train to stop the bad guys from crashing it, you don't jump above vehicles to get the bad guy's car, you don't escape from an exploding building, or you don't cover yourself from a burning place. The only part of this game that has much interactivity is when you must examine many flying helicopters. I was expecting a lot more like that.* The Riddler is still a bonus villain. I want to play against his huge cool traps in the main story.* The final fight with the Joker is not that exciting and hard as in Arkham Asylum.Sorry, but this game wasn't a great improvement for me, but at least is a great game. I hope that the next third game will have many of the things that I want.P.S: The Adventures of Batman and Robin (1994) is still the best Batman game ever!!!Adios.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"A content lover's goldmine!","reviewText":"This game has a plethora of extras. It wasn't enough to take an oldschool fighting game and re-vamp it with a fresh look, varied fighting styles, move instructions in the pause menu, a fatality practice mode, etc. No, the creators also went the extra 100 miles of adding a koin system which lets you purchase extra outfits and fatalities, a challenge tower with a MASSIVE amount of challenges, a tag-team battle system that shames the competition, and a story mode that is entertaining, engaging, and really gives you an incentive to learn how to play with every character the game has to offer. This is much more than your run-of-the-mill fighting game. That being said; if you're looking for a simple tower of opponents to take on, the game also delivers that. The game is brutal to say the least. There aren't many games more violent than this one to be found. Whether or not that's a good thing is for you to decide. Personally, I love it. If you liked the old Mortal Kombat games, this will surely feel like the game you've been waiting on since the days of Mortal Kombat 1, 2, & 3.While this is easily a 5 star game, it isn't perfect. There are a few minor things which it's gotten wrong (in my personal opinion, some will certainly disagree). Firstly, this game is one of the online pass games for the PS3. This means that if you buy the game used and someone's already used the online code for the game, you won't be able to play it online without purchasing a new code from Sony. Secondly is the absurdity of the platinum trophy. I expect a challenge, and the platinum delivers that. But only a handful of the trophies which must be obtained pertain to the offline game itself. Most of the trophies are all online based. And it's baffling to consider the amount of trophies they could have added for offline game modes (believe it or not Sony, not every gamer wants to do all of their gaming online at all times). Some of the familiar bosses still feel cheap in their fighting styles. You'll find yourself looking for the easiest way to spam these bosses to death. And it really feels like less of an accomplishment when you make it through one of these battles, not off of the range of your character, but on the lucky uppercut, etc. Another gripe is the x-ray addition. Understand that I LOVE this aspect of the game in most respects. The downfall of these are that your meter takes so long to rebuild, can easily be blocked after all that work went into gaining it, and if you don't win using it in the first round then chances are you'll lose the match altogether. Lastly, I was a bit dismayed by the female characters here. Every one of them have the same pair of gargantuan tits that are on full display. It's a stretch of the imagination for instance to believe that Sonya went to work wearing what she's wearing in this game. I know there's an element of extreme cliche to the Mortal Kombat series. But this just went a little far for me. I will say that I was happy that the female characters were all given different speeds and fighting styles, even if their breasts were all made to look like something from a lineup of Barbie dolls.In short, this is a great game. Perfection escapes it at times. But it is still one of the best fighting games I have ever played. And the sheer amount of content keeps me turning to it for more. Buy it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2011"}

Age of Empires II - The Age of Kings stands the test of time. This is a game that is fun even years after its release.You would think a game created in 1999 would seem blocky and old after only a year or two. Quite the contrary. The gameplay, immersion in detail, and strategic fun in Age of Empires II makes it into a game that I envision will be playable and fun for years to come.The game takes you through a variety of situations. You need to be an efficient hunter-gatherer. You have to know how to manage naval warfare. It's a great test of your ability to think outside the box, as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every pass.I adore history, so it was a treat to be in a scenario with William Wallace and Joan of Arc. You see the real life locations they had to fight through, and you save the day with your own activities. The locations span the globe, keeping things interesting.I realize that some people aren't interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy. However, those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat. The game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle. I happen to love the multiplayer aspect here.Yes, the graphics aren't super high def and up to current standards. That is quite all right by me. The gameplay itself is well done, and really after a few minutes I don't even notice what the details of the various structures look like. I am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses. As long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with, that's all that matters to me.Are there any downsides? I imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters, who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot, probably won't be as keen on the strategy based, long term planning involved here. That is quite fine. There are different types of games for different players.

Their games have always been fun, engaging, exciting, and at the same time a little terrifying which gives you even more of a thrill. This is ID's First New Title Since either Doom or Quake franchises along with sporting ID's new Game Engine ID Tech 5. So when when I saw this title at $12 dollars almost new at a competitor's store (Upon release 8 months ago it was $60) I of course immediately picked it up.Background: The Best way I can describe the game visually is if this game was made into a movie it would look and feel like Mad Max: The Road Warrior with the characters and FPS Feel of the Doom 3 Video Game. The games mechanics and interaction feels like and updated version of a Computer Game that I used to play as a teenager back in the Mid 1980's for the Commodore 64 called AutoDuel (This was also released on the Apple II, Atari 400/800 as well). In the game you play as a post apocalypse character that goes from town to town in a Modified Post Apocalypse vehicle (Similar to Rage) to undertake missions, Races, Gambling and so forth. With the money you earn you can upgrade your vehicle or weapons and sell items back that you may not need. Of course the game did not have the FPS aspect to it but their are a lot of similarities to the other aspects that I mentioned between AutoDuel and RAGE.Plot: In the year 2029 the asteroid 99942 Apophis impacts the earth and wipes out most of humanity (This is an actual asteroid that at one time in 2004 had been predicted to hit the Earth in 2029 but after scientist had gathered more data it is now has been predicted to miss the earth instead, do a Wikipedia Search for \"99942 Apophis\" for more information). However before the Asteroid impacted the earth The World Leaders decided to create several underground safe havens called \"Arks\" so after the impact the people that had been in Frozen Stasis would be able to re-build the earth. 106 years later your character awakes from his stasis tube to find that everybody in his Ark has died (Except himself) and the characters particular Ark was heavily damaged which caused the Computers monitoring the Ark stasis tubes to subsequently malfunction with the exception of your charters (Their is no explanation why other than the obvious it was most likely damaged by the asteroid's impact), On top of that due most likely to the malfunctioning stasis units your character has no memory of who he is and what his objectives are. So Now wondering out of the damaged Ark the Survivor attempts to get his bearing until attacked by the new Residents of the Area, The Survivor is summarily saved by a passersby heading back to his settlement by the name of Dan Hagar (Voiced by John Goodman). On the way back to his settlement Dan explains how after the impact had world has basically turned into a post apocalyptic world in which humanity has been dived up into different territories and the most technically advanced of them being the \"Authority\".Game-play: As mentioned earlier the game play is for the most part a First Person Shooter (FPS) with Third Person aspect on the Driving Mechanics of the Game. You will start off on small nearby missions in which you will earn weapons, money and most importantly reputation with the more missions you complete. Once you have obtained your own vehicle you will begin exploring the other settlements outside Dan's territory. Along the way you will get to gamble, Enter into Races, Be a contestant on a Thunderdome like reality TV Series called Mutant Bash TV and take on side jobs.  You will be able to upgrade your vehicle's parts with \"Racing Certificates\" won in either Races or on the Bounty of the Bandits you take out for the towns local Bar owners (Why you can not use cash to upgrade your vehicle parts is beyond me). Ultimately your adventures will lead to the confrontation with the games antagonist called the Authority.Plus Side of the Game: There are tons of cool things about the game I do not know where to begin with.- The ID Tech 5 game engine is awesome, a vast improvement over the ID Tech 4 engine with the characters being very life like. The Graphics overall are just breath taking. The AI's are a lot more interactive and when facing them in combat are a lot smarter than I had played in previous games.- Great Choice of Weapons that can be either found, brought, or even modified.- I love the racing aspect in the game. If you like running into things and causing damage with your car this is the game to do it with.Minus Side of the Game: There is just one big problem I have with the game and surprisingly enough it not with the game play itself, that is the lack of continuous auto saving.- The Auto Archiving feature on this game will only kick in once a chapter (If your lucky). While it does have a Manuel save option it can be very time consuming to stop playing, go into the menu, and wait about 30 to 60 seconds for the game to \"save\". So if you forget to Manually save at a certain point in your progress if you die without saving manually you can conceivably start back at almost the beginning of the chapter (This is why I primarily gave the game a 4 instead of a 5).- On the minor side the game tends to have long loads times between going to the next chapter.- The Slight on the game itself is that even through it is theoretically \"Open Ended\" , The game still controls certain aspects on what you can backtrack and explore on your own.Update - July 3rd, 2012Special Note: Before accepting the final mission in the RAGE Campaign which is the attack on Capital Prime to upload the awake codes of the other Arks, insure you have completed any side missions, Jobs, Races, or trophies. Once you accept the mission when you have completed the level you will see the story end and the Game Credits after which you will not be allowed to return into the game to complete of the previously mentioned objectives (Unlike \"Infamous\" which will let you to continue on after the actual \"campaign\" of the game has ended to complete the side objectives).Update - July 6th, 2012corrected - July 16th, 2012DLC (Downloadable Content):Anarchy Edition DLC - for only a $1.99 (On the PSN Network)you can download the Anarchy Edition Add-Ons which include the Double Barrel Shot Gun (My Favorite, A nice carry over from the Doom Franchise), The Rat Rod Buggy, The Crimson Elite Armor, and Fists of Rage (You get \"Spiked\" Gloves that go over your Hands if you want to inflict more damage with your fists). Of Course if you already own The Anarchy Edition of the Game itself then this would be Redundant, However for those who have the Standard Edition Of the Game like myself then you can't go wrong, In the long run its cheaper to purchase the standard version of the game and pay the $2 extra to download the content. Just the Double Barrel Shotgun is worth the $2.00.The Sewer Missions DLC - This is an optional 9 side missions broken into 2 parts each that is not accessible in the \"standard\" version of Rage that takes place around just outside of the different territories and settlements (I.E. Wellspring Entrance, Hagar Territory, subway town, etc...) that has you finding and looting the sewers for valuable junk that the mutants collected in the 1st part, then getting paid for going back and exterminating the Mutant Menace from the Sewers in the 2nd part. It's a nice side butt kicking mutant missions that is almost worth the $9.99 I paid for it. Hopefully it will come down a little bit in the future but still worth the purchase. The Sewer Missions is included in the \"Anarchy Edition\" of Rage that has a one time redemption code.Overall: Other than an ambiguous ending that screams SEQUEL and despite the annoyance of the games save feature, A great new entry into the ID Software franchise,  pure fun to play, I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves a good FPS and Racing Death matches. Was well worth the $12 dollars, I'm looking forward to when ID releases the follow up game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.Premium Edition ContentsGAME DVDThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings game DVD.MAKING-OF DVDAll the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.OST CDAudio-CD with in-game music.ETUIBox with all the contents of The Witcher 2 Premium Edition.WORLD MAPA map of the game's world.GAME GUIDEThe Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.GAME MANUALA rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.PAMPHLET AND COINA physical representation of one of the in-game items.PAPERCRAFTSTwo papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.DLCExtra in-game feature for download: The Ultimate Swordsman SuitSystem RequirementsMinimal Requirements:CPU: Dual-Core, 2,2 GHz.RAM: 1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)GPU: nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MBOS: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"Biowho? CDProjekt is poised to take the CRPG throne next to Bethesda","reviewText":"((INTRO))The video game industry has changed drastically since 2007 and has been molded into something many of long time PC gamers cannot stomach with so much focus on casual market, emphasis on easy access to non-FPS genres for the FPS crowds and online components.2007 was also the beginning of the new wave of DRMs outside the traditional disc-based DRM of the past on PC starting with the evil trinity of Spore, Bioshock and Mass Effect with mandatory online activation, installation limit and / or constant Internet connection requirement; vital components that instantly killed the second-hand PC game market.These experimental DRM tinkering ironically consolidated the status of Valve's Steam as the least intrusive DRM among the new DRMs outside the disc-based DRM of the past.  Maybe that was the plan all along to promote one-time only online activation with unlimited installation as the new champion of the customer-friendly DRM, when it is not.If publishers have monetary muscle to bombard ad blitzkrieg via media and indirectly but not so subtly influence the majority of so-called video game journalists (whose livelihood is heavily tied to the ad money from game publishers), game generally crosses the million units sales line.You have to wonder why the video game industry, which had posted record-breaking profits from 2000-2007, has been on the wrong side of the ledger when it comes to profits since 2007.  Coincidence?  Don't bet on it.  They are still blaming the new boogeyman of the industry, the Piratebay.  The whole industry is running on fume; record revenue on record debts with annual net profits of hundreds of millions on the minus side during 2008-2011.CRPG of the past are mostly disappeared except Bethesda's games (albeit multiplatform games), and the new hybrid-RPGs are catered toward console players and non-CRPG players.  Games like Assassin's Creed, Red Dead Redemption, Mass Effect 2 and Borderlands, which I love as a FPS, are heralded as RPGs nowaday.  I guess Modern Warfare 2 is a bigger RPG than Borderlands in that sense with huge online components and tons of customization.It's worth noting that the prequel of the game I am about to review 'The Witcher' came out on PC back in 2007 amidst aforementioned mess by the first-time Polish developer CDProjekt using heavily custom-modified 'Aurora Engine' by Bioware, that was created for the original 'Neverwinter Nights'.  The game is based on a popular Polish fantasy fiction series of the same name by Andrzej Sapkowski.The game was released in the half-broken state with the longest loading time ever graced on the PC game and truckload of bugs with limitation of Aurora Engine sprinkled on top.  Then the unthinkable happened.  They released a massive patch (over 1.3 Gb) to eradicate all the technical mess along with extensive amounts of free bonus items (which are all found on Enhanced Edition) to celebrate 1 million sales.  They even patched out disc-based DRM.CDProjekt also owns 'Good Old Game (gog)', online service that sells old PC games without any type of DRM whatsoever.These are enough reasons for the old school CRPG fans to have been eagerly waiting for the sequel and it is finally here.  Does it deliver?Absolutely!((NEW ENGINE / GRAPHIC))The first game was no saint with many many flaws that made me give up the game at chatper 2.  But when Enhanced Edition came out, I downloaded all the freebees and repurchased the new edition anyway.The Enhanced Edition of the first game eradicated the first two shortcomings (loading time and bugs) and cleaned up the game entirely, but could not fix the shortcoming stemmed from Aurora Engine.This time, CDProjekt created their own proprietary engine, which not only improves the graphic quality but two other shortcomings that stemmed from the awful 'Aurora' engine made by Bioware; loading screen and combat.  The new engine also expands the scope of the game that encompasses three vastly different landscapes with each region bigger instead of the limited scope in one region from the first game.The graphic, with help of the newly-created engine is arguably the best looking CRPG ever with so much details in the gaming world feel alive and real.  Cutscenes are much more cinematic and natural.  Texture and effects are great but facial animations are a little bit lacking and lipsynching is much desired although understandably for multiple languages they had to cater to.Loading is breeze and less than a second.  Overall, this is a fantastic looking game.  Unless Bethesda does one better with 'Skyrim', this is the big dog in the CRPG graphics that can stand proudly next to the best of the best looking video games.((GAME STRUCTURE))The Witcher 2 retains pretty much everything good from the first game and the game is still narrative-focused game that offers 16 different endings depending on the choices you make throughout the game, it is not a massive open world environment like The Elder Scrolls series and the game is divided into prologue, three chapters and epilogue very similar to the first one and the game world is still modular.But within each environment, transition from outdoor to indoor or dungeon environment is a breeze with loading time masked by hidden loading zone so it appears as if most of the time there's no loading screen. Each enrironment is one continuous large environment so the game does feel like a semi-open world game in each chapter. Within each chapter, you have nonlinear freedom of galore of dynamic side quests.You can import your save games from the first to implement the choices you made from the first game.  You have several flashback sequences in 'The Witcher 2' based on the choices you made in the first game.((COMBAT))Combat in the first game was pseudo-real time, timing-based but combat in the sequel is now fully real time that plays like a full-fledged action game that requires some accurate tactics. You have fast light attack and slow strong attack.  You can bring your tactics menu, that slows time but doesn't completely stops the time, to access two different swords (steel and silver), five different magic signs and many items. You can evade, and you now can even block.  Combat is even more fast-paced and dynamic with awesome finishing moves mixed with some QTE.There are plenty of mobs and they generally gang up on you so have to use different magic and item to control some of the crowd while you fight off others. Different enemy requires different stances, weapons and different tactics. You have to find the opening and weakness to successfully land your hits.  Blocking and evading is very important.  While it's real-time, each successful hit get chained with the successive one like the first game so evade, block, use magic and item to control the opponent and hit it when there's opening.The combat, while real-time, is most definitely not clickfest action RPG like Diablo (clickfest usually ends with your quick demise), and thank goodness it is not watered down half-baked attempt to emulate more accessible easier action-oriented games on the market like Assassin's Creed for the sake of mass appeal.  Combat can be quite challenging and depending on your 4 difficulty set, the action can be punishingly difficult and downright torturous.  As you progress on your skilltree and unlock new moves, magic and stats, things get easier.You can use different armor sets finally. Your two swords can be customized with various runes, magic enchantment and items such as oil and coating.  You can meditate anywhere outside the combat now instead of designated area.The biggest problem stems from the in-game camera just like the first one.  While graphics are generally outstanding, camera movement, or rather the position of the camera that is fixed too close to the avatar, especially indoors and dungeons are wonky and quite awkward.  And obstacles constantly get in the way and block your view especially in the tight quarter combat that hinder you from effectively maneuvering your avatar to engage multiple mobs at the same time.  Simple addition of 360 degree free zoomable camera like 'Oblivion' would have easily solved the problem.Prepare to be frustrated with anything other than easy setting and nonstop fluent French.  It takes some practice but overall the combat is very exciting, rousing and heart-pounding if you master it.((STORYTELLING))The scale of the game and storytelling is also bigger than the first.  One of the most refreshing aspect of the first game was the depth of story and choices of dialogues that gives you the 5 multiple endings.  The sequel retains the traits and further expands the story of Geralt that can result in massive 16 endings.As far as story, dialogues and choices go, only Planescape Torment surpasses the sheer volume of the Witcher series.  The story is once again very mature and adult-oriented with some sex and lots of violence thrown in the mix.  The tone is gritty and serious and no heroic saving the world for Geralt but more intricate politics and personal story.The world is full of gray and ambiguity, and choices you have to make are not easy one like most other CRPG.  You have to make choices based solely on your belief, preferences and your own morality, as the world is not consisted of simple good and evil.  While the setting is fantastical medieval, the tone is realistic and very complex.The single playthrough, which lasts about 40 hours, is shorter than the first one, which lasted about 60 hours.  However, the pacing of the story is much tighter and methodical and since you have more different possible outcomes depending on your choices that harbors the first game also, replay values are so much higher.The main plotline is also larger and more focused than the first one.  But there's a drawback to the storyline.  While it is well-written, I feel the story is little too personal and complex without any feeling of grandeur, the first game had the same drawback.The Witcher often feels like a 70s TV series KungFu with David Carridine with Geralt walking the Earth from places to places getting involved with people without grand central storyarc (there is one central with 3 interweaving substorylines but doesn't feel like it).Maybe there is a reason why most of the story in CRPG or videogame RPG in general almost always resort to the corny \"Look!  The world is at peril, save us!\" cliche to grab the attention.  But 'The Witcher' series is not really about the central plotline but journey you embark on and how the world shapes according to your action.  So it is in your best interest to play the first game and transfer the savegame to have better understanding Geralt and the world rather than to jump into the second one.  Imtimate, personal and refreshingly different from the usual RPG story, the journey you embark on is a very special one.((MISC))All the menu, inventory, skill progression, navigation, settings, loading and saving are PC-centric.In-game journal also contains detailed tutorial for your reference.  Keymapping, in-depth graphical settings are only available at the launcher.Music is once again excellent and voiceworks, unlike the first one, are as natural as it should be.  Every dialogue line for NPCs are voiced.  Quality of sound is also outstanding.This is a very clean release that has hardly any bug or crash unlike the first one but really demanding on your gaming rig.  Only the most powerful rigs can run this game with every single options to the max, so beware.((VERSIONS / DRM))The digital download version of the game from Good Old Games (GOG), which is owned by CDProjekt doesn't have any DRM. But you must register at the official site to download any future patches (backhand activation).  It also comes with a full free CRPG of your choice from the catalog and handful of digital bonus items.The retail version, despite CDProjekt's repeated promises to do everything in their power to strike a deal to have the least invasive DRM as possible, is implemented with SecuROM online activation with 5 simultaneous installation limits, which you can revoke, and mandatory registration for the future patch.  They promise (like they promise about the retail DRM?) that they will patch out the DRM in the future.Do yourself a favor and visit gog and get the download version and hope that the Enhanced Edition will come out with no DRM in the future.  If PSN meltdown is any indication, any game with online tie-in is not as secure as the publishers lead you to believe, even critique-proof Steam.  Even on consoles so many game components are only available when connected like DLCs, free upgrades, items and of course online and multi-player portions.((CONCLUSION))Despite the fact there are very scarce amount of PC exclusive games come out these days, they seem to do well if they are indeed PC excluisive; Starcraft II, The Sims 3 expansions, Shogun 2, Civilization V.  Steam is practically a monopoly in the online market and WoW, while its members are steadily decreasing from once 15 million might, still has 10 million strong.Diablo 3 will be a multi-million seller and so will 'The Witcher 2'.  Why developers look at the sales of multiplatform games on PC when absolute majority of them are either console ports or geared toward the console crowds as indication of viability of PC games is beyond me.In this day and age, it is very refreshing to see a PC exclusive CRPG that refuses to compromise what CRPG (Computer Role-playing game on PC) should be like, embraces the tradition, enhances and improves the genre, all without compromising the essence of CRPG; 'Arcania', 'Two Worlds II' and 'Dragon Age II' to name a few recent compromised CRPGs.  It's worth noting that CDProjekt is much smaller developers than Bethesda or Bioware, yet they actually have stronger passion toward CRPG on the personal level like Tood Howard from Bethesda.This game is definitely not meant for the casual gamers because of  heavy thematic setting, complex politics, nudity and violence with lots of things that can be viewed as difficult, boring and tedious to gamers who just want to sink in and enjoy.  There's no hand-holding in 'The Witcher 2', everything you have to work for it.There are many great console-exclusive games out there that fit better on console than PC.  Hopefully, there will be more PC-exclusive games that fit better on PC in the future.  You can put 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' next to the original alongside the likes of 'Vampire The Masquerade Bloodline', 'Dragon Age Origins',  'Gothic Trilogy', 'Morrowind', 'Oblivion', 'Fallout 3' and 'Fallout: New Vegas' as the best 3D CRPGs.If only we can reverse this DRM trend, PC gaming will surely have brighter future.  It is highly unlikely but I can always dream.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

Chang \"Steven Chang\"","summary":"An honest review from an actual owner.","reviewText":"First of all, when you purchase ANY xbox360 system, you should already know that it does NOT come with the HD-DVD drive. It is available separately for ~$200 USD. I think it's wrong for other reviewers to bash the Elite system for not including the HD-DVD drive when you should know its a separate accessory.This is my first xbox system purchase, however I have played many other 360 systems which belong to friends. I can say that the ELITE system is somewhat quieter and runs a little smoother due to the extra cache in the included 120gb hard-drive. \"Smoother\" meaning the dashboard is very fast with no hang-ups or pauses, even during gaming. My 360 Elite unit sits out in the open and the only noise emitted is the DVD drive spinning, which you can barely hear.I highly recommend buying the ELITE version if you do not currently own a xbox 360 console. For the extra $80 dollars, you get a much much larger hard-drive, HDMI, and black color scheme. However, I can't recommend it as an \"upgrade\" to a working xbox360 system. Don't go selling your current working system to trade up to an Elite system unless you just plain want it.I own a 32\" LG HDTV, and the images look amazing! I am running HDMI for the video, and the audio dongle to my Denon receiver for the audio.Xbox live GOLD is fantastic and well worth the $49/yr fee. I am only a casual gamer, but purchased the xbox 360 for all its other capabilities. Mine has ran flawlessly so far (4 days now). I have rented online movies, downloaded TONS of demos and Xbox Live Arcade games.This is a 5 star system all-around! Remember to buy the Microsoft extended warranty for $49 dollars. The form is included in the box and must be mailed out within 10 days of purchase. Peace of mind for 2 years is worth the 50 bucks.Best wishes,Steven","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2007"}

The built in mute is particularly helpful and the sound quality on it is pretty good. the adjustments are good enough to make it comfortable. The cord is just the right length and it easily attaches to the controller. I have found this headset to be durable enough. It does feel a little flimsy in your hand and it wouldn't take much effort to break one but I don't take the greatest care of mine and it has held together for over a year now.The only reason I don't rate this item higher is because there is absolutely no reason to buy it. If you bought any 360 besides the core system you got one with the system. Also if you are looking to get xbox live and do have the core system there are packages, such as the xbox live vision package, which not only get you a year membership but a headset and the vision camera for as the same amount as this item plus the $50 membership.Xbox 360 Live Camera BundleYou only need this headset if you are using xbox live so I would highly recommend the vision package over this.

One thing that hampers these fun parties are cords.  I can't stand them and what inadvertently happens is a web or cords that (sometimes drunk) people have to manuever around.  It's not exactly the best experience at times.  When I heard that Logitech was bringing a cordless mic to the party, I got excited for a couple reasons.  Of course there's the aforementioned cord issue but also that Logitech makes some great (albeit usually expensive) products.  The Wireless Microphone fits right in that same area.Setup is a breeze.  The package comes with two main pieces, the microphone and the holder/USB receiver.  Plugging the USB receiver into the Xbox 360 provides you with the wireless capabilities but also doubles as a place to hold your microphone when not being used.  It takes AA batteries which is good and bad.  I really enjoy products that have a built in rechargable battery, but this also allows quick and easy replacement if you're in the middle of a party and don't have time to recharge.The microphone works very well.  It's more like a full-sized microphone that I'm used to at Karaoke bars and has a nice, heavy heft to it.  It picks up your voice a lot better than the mics that come with either Rock Band or Guitar Hero and the sound quality it picks up is also much clearer.  I even used it on my PC and recorded some voice tracks to test the quality and it works wonderfully.  Ultimately, you get what you pay for and the Logitech microphone excels at both a more maneuverable option and as a great quality microphone.  Very much recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001C4DKG4","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Worth Owning","reviewText":"First things first. The CONS:There's no actual game. You just play against other players on a handful of online maps.It takes some trial and error to understand how to play well and find the kind of rooms you like.This can be frustrating, as you often end up playing with pros at first that kill you over and over.With that out of the way though, this really isn't a bad game. It's actually my favorite online shooter. Most of the bad vibe surrounding this game was due to how much this game sucked when it was released. Patches have been released that make this thing perform light years better than it did. Third person is simply more fun when it comes to playing against real people and not computer AI. And these maps don't really give unfair advantage to anyone. It's hard to set up shop as a sniper and expect that no one will track you down. They'll come at you from all angles.My advice: If you want to like this game (by which I mean kick ass at this game), then get online with one of your ps3 owning friends and create rooms for just the two of you to get a feel for the controllers, the guns and the maps. Because this really is a good game. Like with any online game though; it's fun grows in proportion to the number of people you know and can play against. At the end of the day, there's really nothing like shooting your best friend in the face with a shotgun and you both end up living to laugh about it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

When youre exploring the castle, the awesome graphics and organ heavy music really sets the mood. The main chracter Leon controls smoothly and his whip strikes look and feel powerful. Plus the boss battles are tough but not overly difficult. And the camera doesnt seem to blind me as much as in Devil May Cry.Though Lament of Innocence has plenty of short comings.1) The enemies and level design are reused way too much. Too many of the corridors and enemies look and act exactly the same.2) The magic system is 'dumbed' down. This games magic system is based around your subweapons, much like Harmony of Dissonance. Why they couldnt have implemented the awesome magic of Symphony of the Night or Dawn of Sorrow, i dont know.3) Too many things are overly simplified like the combos and armors. There are no 'secret' armors or combos. You get them all as you gradually progress through the game.In the end this is a great game and i enjoyed it much more than Devil May Cry.

But the Xbox Live service doesn't offer much bang for the buck","reviewText":"Xbox Live 12 Month GoldI will review the game code and provide commentary on the service itself. The only reasons I bought another subscription to Xbox Live Gold was because I had a promotional discount from Amazon towards an online game code for Xbox Live Gold, and because Forza 4 won't allow DLC and rivals without an active Xbox Live Gold subscription. I rarely play multiplayer games. I used to spend tons of hours playing multiplayer online games on the PC and I grew tired of waiting for servers, waiting for other players, or waiting for new matches that I didn't feel the appeal anymore. I did not like the fact that Forza 4 required Xbox Live Gold to perform tasks such as purchasing DLC or receiving gift cars, selling/buying auction cars, etc... Otherwise I really don't have much use for Xbox Live Gold. At best, I feel the service should be free like the Playstation Network or PC online gaming. I know there are people who will disagree, and the cost for Xbox Live Gold isn't that bad and is certainly less expensive than most cable TV or cellphone bills. I just feel there's not a lot of bang for the buck, and now Microsoft is pushing online media through Xbox Live - but I just use a PC dedicated as a media center attached to my TV and run Amazon Instant Video without bothering with Xbox Live at all.Overall for Xbox Live: 3/5, mandatory if you are addicted to online gaming on the Xbox, the prices have fluctuated, and I don't feel there's a lot of bang for the buck. PCs do the same things without a yearly subscription fee.Overall for the Xbox Live Online Game Code: 5/5, this is the only way to subscribe to Xbox Live without being automatically charged by Microsoft every year. This gives you control over when you want to renew. Cancelling your automatic renewal with Microsoft is a pain, so I highly recommend buying the online game code or a card and to just redeem the code.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Christopher R","summary":"Much of the same.","reviewText":"Anyone familiar with the previous Grand Theft Auto games will find much to like about this new title.  Although the gameplay is very similar to that of the last edition, there are many small improvements that add up and contribute greatly to the overall experience of the game.  Whereas the last game was clearly that--a game--this one has a more cinematic feel.  From the opening scene that plays like the opening of a major film, to the amount of detail involved in traveling the city as a pedestrian and motor commuter, you are immersed in the the world of Grand Theft Auto like never before.Rather than simply running around and killing people (although you can do that, too) you walk around, take a cab, take the subway, your character gets drunk, you have to cultivate relationships with other characters, and you are given decisions about which course of action to take as the game progresses.  Although I would not go as far as those reviewers who anticipated a game that would completely transform the industry, this increased amount of user involvement makes GTA IV an instant classic.  And I haven't even tried online play yet!As far as faults go, the only one that I can find so far is that the graphics are not as good as other PS3 games.  There is room for improvement in that respect, but considering all of the other factors involved in creating a dynamic environment that is a probably a compromise many are willing to make.Overall I'd say this is a great title that takes this style of gameplay to a whole new level, but it is not the transformative, world/industry changing title it has been hyped up to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2008"}

Part I, IV, V, VI, and VII for either my NES, SNES, or PSX. Bought all of them at launch. All of those FF games always had top graphics, story, and music for its time. I own over a dozen cd soundtracks of those games cause I loved the music so much. Played all the other console FF games but never finished them due to lack of personal time. When I heard a FF rhythm game was coming out, I was pretty excited. Played through most of the tracks and loving it. Like the backround cinematics even though I can't really stare at them cause it's in the middle of the game. Brought back childhood memories. Just want to comment on 3 things that are NOT complaints or deal breakers. #1 - I've been reading from other gamers that the directional swipe commands don't register very well sometimes. I've had this issue once in a while too. Kind of annoying when I'm trying to get a near perfect score. #2 - When the backround cinemas show text, it's still in Japanese. The text isn't part of game or story line so I'm not worried. It's just a little strange they didn't translate it (costs?). #3 - I wished they would have kept the 8 or 16-bit graphics/pixel characters/backrounds for the older FF themed stuff. Doesn't bother me that much they used the cutesy super deformed stuff but it would have been cool to me. Overall I'm happy about this game, getting this from Amazon when it went on sale for $30, and a FF themed stylus pen w/ matching stickers fore preodering it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2012"}

If you're looking for a game like COD4 with a modern theme, and advanced weapons, this game will might disappoint you. World at War is a great game, but this game is not really a sequel. It is an entirely different game and theme. This is what COD3 should have been. It takes the COD series back to it's WWII roots. It's not perfect though. It has its minor glitches, and the the single player is a little short. But it's a huge improvement to COD3. For those that feel the old WWII theme might bore you, it does have a bonus mode called \"Nacht der Untoten\", or Night of the Undead. You get to fight Nazi zombies. The game features excellent graphics and sound. The gameplay is very good. There are enough modes to keep the game fresh.

However, aside from its aesthetic quality, it seems almost as though this game was rushed out to give the PS3 a killer title at a crucial time.The good: Gorgeous graphics, stunning surround sound, ultra-crisp high-definition, and probably the most gorgeous cutscenes I've ever seen in ANY video game...ever.  Strong voice-acting and decently-developed characters also add to the beauty.  DualShock 3 compatibility (added WAY after the release of the game) is really nice.  They took their time with this aspect!The bad:  Terrible, TERRIBLE frame-rate issues.  When Nariko moves around, the entire screen becomes a choppy mess...from her movements to the scrolling and panning of the background.  When you're hoarded by countless soldiers, it's hard to know what you're doing because the animation is so crappy.  And on that note, the fighting goes on way too long and is way too tedious.  God of War was a button-masher, but it was balanced and executed very well.  Heavenly Sword takes button-mashing to a whole new level...it's just too much!  The enemies just keep on coming, and you can't even see yourself.  You just mash the buttons and impatiently wait for it to end.  The Sixaxis controls are awful, but at least you can turn them off.  I much preferred guiding my arrows and cannonballs with my analog stick.  Finally, the short length of the game is notable.  Definitely not worth $[...], but I got it used for about half that, and it's worth that much.  By the end of the game, I didn't really want it to go on anyway.Overall, this is definitely worth a rent.  The bad gameplay is well worth the cutscenes that follow and the unfolding of the story.  I would like to see a sequel where all the issues are worked out.  I don't regret buying this game, but I'm glad that I didn't pay $[...] for it!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2008"}

How long ago was the last Ghostbusters movie made?  The 1980s?  Out of nowhere comes a game based on that license.  I expected yet another disappointing licensed game, but from the opening credits to the ending credits Ghostbusters sets the bar for the movie-based game genre.  It is just that good.You play the new mute recruit to the Ghostbusters team.  You've started your new job just as another paranormal crisis starts in New York City.  The story ties nicely into the first film and makes a few nods to the second one.  Through the course of the game you re-visit a few familiar locations from the movies.  Yes, this is fan service. The game's script is written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd.  Thankfully, they have crafted the script in such a way that you never fell like you are retreading old ground.  If anything it helps reinforce the feeling that you are playing through the third ghostbusters movie.  If you loved the movies, then you need to play this game.  The story is awesome.All of the original actors from the movies do a great job voicing their respective characters.  The dialogue is spot-on.  It is a nice touch to hear Ray or Egon shouting words of encouragement when you do well.You get to use all of the trademark Ghostbusters' equipment.  Wrangling and trapping ghosts is exactly how it should be.  Using the googles helps you see spooks and hidden secrets.  I enjoyed all of the in-game collectibles and the creative way you find them.  The same PKE meter you use to track down ghosts also helps track down the various collectible paranormal objects which get displayed back in the Ghostbusters headquarters.  You gain several creative \"weapons\" to take down the ghosts.  Most work well.  The only real nod to the second film is the use of the slim gun.  It works for the purpose of the plot, but feels out of place with all the other cool \"weapons\" at your disposal.As much as I hate to say it, I suggest playing this game on the easy level for the best experience.  Higher difficulty levels pump up the health of the various ghosts so far that it takes far too long to wrestle them into a trap.Another downside is how dumb your A.I. teammates are.  You never really die in this game.  You just get knocked out and wait for your teammates to revive you.  Sometimes it works, but there will be other times you will cuss at the screen as all of the other ghostbusters also get knocked out causing a \"game over\" screen.Most of the other game mechanics work, but feel a little generic.  Remember the star of this game is story, not the mechanics.Multiplayer makes an appearance.  It is serviceable, but nothing special.  The standard modes make an appearance and are fun.  They are just nothing special.I rate Ghostbusters at an 8.5 out of 10.  It is a worthwhile addition to anyone's video game library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

That right there should tell you something.It was nice having a racoon Mario again that can actually fly. Super Mario 3D Land may have had Racoon (actually Tanooki) Mario, but he didn't really fly. He just had slow decent. So it's nice to be able to fly again.But I'm afraid other than that, I don't have much to say in favor of this. The main game is only 6 worlds long (with another 2 secret worlds that you have to find canons to get to plus the Star Levels). The levels are really easy. Even more insulting is that it's so easy to get 1ups now with tons of coins all over that I've died many times on a level and still wound up with more lives than I had when I started. The invincibility leaf makes a return after dying too much just to make it even easier.Really, the game is just too easy. I haven't gone through the star levels yet. I don't think I will just because it requires 90 star coins to unlock. I just can't see myself going through the same levels again and again enough to gather that many.The platforming was fun while it lasted. But with the plethora of coins (and therefore no shortage of lives) it's just not very challenging. And like I said at the beginning, except for the Star World, for all intents and purposes, I beat this game in one day.It's fun while it lasts. But it's too short, too easy and doesn't really offer much new. It may be worth a rental.

The unit is a mixed bag - I'm reviewing this after 2 years of use.Here's how they work. You pull out the regular two AA batteries in your WiiRemote. You insert the new \"charge unit\" which is in essence rechargeable batteries into the spot those batteries were in. The back of the charge unit has an exposed metal strip.When the batteries run out of power, you put the entire WiiRemote into the charge unit. The exposed metal strip on the battery part connects with a matching spot on the charge unit. It charges up in about 3 hours, and you are good to go again. The charge unit itself plugs into a regular wall socket.The problem is with the way the Wii remote settles into the charging unit. It just doesn't settle in well. You can get everything lined up and come back later to find it's slid sideways one micron and now it isn't charging any more. When you put a second unit into the charger it sometimes knocks the first unit out.Also it's important to note that these batteries are NOT infinite. Both of our batteries have died now and we need to get new ones.Really, all you are doing is buying \"rechargeable batteries\" and using their nifty Wii-branded technology to recharge them. Again, if the charger worked well that wouldn't be that bad - but the charger isn't as good as many regular battery recharger units out there. That makes sense. Regular battery rechargers (for rechargeable batteries) have been tested by millions of users over the years, in a variety of situations. This Wii-specific system has only been around for a few years and is only used by Wii gamers. It's just not as sturdy.While I appreciate the cute factor of this one, I would definitely recommend getting NORMAL AA rechargeable batteries and a NORMAL battery recharger. Not only will it work more reliably for charging up your Wii remote batteries, but it's not Wii specific! You can use it for ALL batteries in your household, and help save the environment. Instead of throwing batteries out into the trash stream, you will keep reusing the batteries and keep the dumps a bit more non-toxic.So to summarize definitely use SOME sort of rechargeable battery in your Wii. Don't keep throwing out batteries and buying new ones every time. However, I'd go with a regular recharger and use it for other batteries in your house as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2009"}

There will no doubt be comparissons to Rock Band/ Guitar Hero etc, but in the end this game just doesn't measure up.Sure, there are lots of songs, and probably more coming via DLC, but songs alonge do not a great game make.The controls are hit and miss with the different nobs and sliders that the game wants you to hit. I can see this game becoming very frustrating for those who are younger and trying this game out. There are some controls that the game wants you to be very precise with, but in the end the small turntable and awkward control layout make it near impossible to achieve.In the end, I think this game is going to have a very finite appeal and will most likely not be a mass appeal game over the long term.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Tough and Grim","reviewText":"I'm not a wimp or a gaming novice, so its not often I think that a game is too difficult...but this is exactly how I feel about Siren. I was very excited about playing it after seeing advance demos and previews of it, but I was unprepared for the challenge that was ahead of me.The game plays like a cross-breed of Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid, in that your adventure takes place in a nightmare world of derelict locations populated by sub-human zombie type monsters, but, with little or no means of attacking them, your success is largely down to using stealth tactics to sneak your way through the game, or to surprise and attack the enemy from strategic hiding places. Unlike the radar map in MSG, here your characters have the ability to see through the eyes of other people, which helps you plan your safest route, or warns you of attack when you suddenly \"tune in\" to the sight of yourself being run towards from behind! The game's setting is spot on. The many locations are on the small side, but all fully detailed and explorable. The enemies are horrifically realistic, mostly made up of zombified townsfolk who are all bleeding from the eyes and lurching around armed with various weapons and torches to seek you out with. It has been said that survival in this game is tough, and it's true. Be prepared to spend a lot of time watching your characters die as you try to work out the various strategies to passing each stage. The try-die-try again gameplay echoes that of the PS game \"Fear Effect\", so if that drove you crazy, expect more of the same. The playable characters are exceptionally vunerable to attack, and two swipes with a knife or one well-placed bullet will be then end of you, and the zombie enemies are relentless in their pursuit. In addition to this, when you do actually get a weapon with which to attack the zombies, you have to act fast because they always get up again after being knocked out for a minute or so. It adds up to an exceedingly punishing game, but I guess its actually far more realistic than the life bar and instant healing products of other survival horror games.More problematic than actually just surviving, though, is working out what on earth you are supposed to be doing. The game is split between several playable characters, each of whom have separate \"missions\" to complete, and all are played non-chronologically at varying times within the game's 3 day timescale. The levels usually require a very obscure set of conditions to be met before you can accomplish each mission, and sometimes, the same stage will also feature a further, hidden puzzle that needs solving so that different characters can proceed through later missions. The menu for this is a kind of 3 day plan-o-gram with slots for all the characters at different days and times, with coloured lines linking them all up...it's quite a mental feat to piece all this together to work out what is going on. One really annoying aspect of the game is that if the hidden conditions to \"open up\" later missions are not met in the levels you have already completed, you are forced into a loop of replaying the same levels over and over again until you realise that there is a part of the river you did not think to look in (if you went that way), or a spot on the ground that the game prompts you can be dug up (if you happen to be standing in exactly the right place). Many players may suffer immense frustration whilst playing when they find they are never allowed to go anywhere new. I know I did, and it leads me to believe that only a truly dedicated player is going to put in the amount of work needed to make it through to the end.This is a real shame, because the general concept and story behind the game is truly original, and there are some genuinely unsettling scenes to be encountered, which should startle even survival horror veterans. The graphics are amazing, characters look and move like real people, but sadly the obviously authentic Japanese setting has been weakened by the saddling of all the speaking characters with British (sometimes even cockney) accents, which is a terrible mistake. Still, the other design strengths just about manage to make up for it. Characters have recognisable personalities and all play differently. You'll soon find yourself with favourites and don't be surprised if you occasionally find yourself moved to sadness at their plight, or terrified along with them.In conclusion, this is a teeth-grittingly hard game to play. Combining all too easily killed characters with obscure puzzle hunting, in levels where you have no pointers towards what to do or where to go, is a triple whammy that the game struggles to win you over with. Otherwise it is so near to being the most terrifying game on the PS2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2004"}

Make no mistake, though:Final Fantasy Chroniclesmarks the first time this pivotal installment of the cherished game series has ever been available on the PlayStation.

The original game, also on the PlayStation for the first time, was one of the first nonlinear role-playing games.

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"A welcome, but slightly flawed, re-release collection","reviewText":"I love it when companies re-release classic games on newer systems for those of us who grew up with them and like to walk down memory lane, and FF Chronicles collects 2 great games in one. I have many blissful memories of playing FF 4 (2 at the time) when I was much younger and it was newly released. My obsession with Final Fantasy started with number 1, and was established without doubt after playing 2. It is a phenomenal, albeit very dated game. The characters and storyline are among the best in FF history, and the gameplay (though straightforward) remains very fun. The graphics and sound of the game were top notch when released. The graphics remain very colorful and appealing even now, and the music is good if rather \"cheap\" sounding compared to modern games. I sometimes wish they would have spiffed these games up a bit (improving the instrumentation of the music, adding some bonus features, etc.), but I can also respect getting the games in their original form without alteration (except for the CG scenes, of course).That is one area of major disappointment for me, the CG movies they added to FF 4. They exhibit the worst graphics I have ever seen on the PS1. A big disappointment, especially coming from the masters at Square. It looks like someone with no experience just threw them together at the last minute. I would rather they just not added them. Furthermore, I wish they could have maybe spliced them into the game instead of just having them at the beginning and end. That really misled me.Still, a great, faithful remake of a wonderful game from the days of old.I never played Chrono Trigger on the SNES, so it was a new experience for me, and I did wish once playing it that I had played it in my youth, as it is a phenomenal game that, although I enjoyed it, I would have appreciated much more when I was younger. Great graphics for the time, and about the best music I've ever heard in a video game. The story and game play really pull you in, and the world is one, like any great fictional place, where you find yourself wishing you could just become part of it.Also, in contrast to FF 4, I really enjoyed the CG movies they added. They are in the anime style by the guy who did Dragonball Z, are spliced into the game at the appropriate parts,  and are really very good.I am disappointed however, as many others on here have stated, that this game has painfully long load times that really decreased my enjoyment of the game. Every time you get into a battle or bring up the status screen, there is about a 3-5 second wait, which may not seem like a big deal, but believe me, it gets annoying real fast. Still, if you're patient, it is a good game.I find myself wishing that they had released FF 3 on this compilation instead of Chrono Trigger, though. I mean, it is FF Chronicles. If they had put 3 on here, we could have had the entire FF series on the PS. As it is, 3 will likely never be available in a form I'm willing to acquire and play, and thus it will eternally remain a hole in my FF experience. If they had put FF 3 on here, maybe they could have done another 2 disc compilation with Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. Now that would have been awesome.Sadly, I can only give this 4 stars overall, and thats me being realistic as opposed to overly nostalgic. They are both great, classic games, and I'm glad to have them, and I did enjoy them. But, this collection is flawed in several ways that just a little bit more work from Square could have prevented, and made this truly worthy of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2005"}

I had my trusty Wavebird, so it's not like I'd have to deal with being tethered to the console (oh, the horror!) :)Then it happened; Castelvania IV was released for download. It didn't take long to realize I needed something that hearkened back to the feel and control layout of the SNES.The problem comes from the fact that older games were designed without the thought of analog control, and it shows when you try and use it and the direction pad on Gamecube controllers just isn't located in a good enough spot to use either.For NES and TG16 games I just hold the Wiimote on its side, which works well enough. This can work alright for Genesis games too, unless you need to use three buttons, in which case the 'A' button is used. Ten minutes of \"Toe Jam & Earl\" and you'll realize you need something different. You could try a Gamecube controller, but my argument placed for SNES games carries over.Considering the prices of the Wiimote and Nunchuck, a Classic Controller really isn't too bad of a buy. It connects to a Wiimote, so you're still wireless.It should also be noted that the creator of Super Smash Brothers has hinted that the Wii version will NOT use the Wiimote and will be optimized for the Classic Controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2007"}

Online is plagued with problems.","reviewText":"Black Ops is obviously the latest title in the Call Of Duty franchise and as a COD fan, I had high hopes. Sadly, within minutes of starting to play, I was taken back to the slow motion train wreck that was COD:World At War - the last time Treyarch had the reigns.The singleplayer mode is very poor this time around. Even a complete novice could probably finish it in 7 or 8 hours. I was done with it in 5. The storyline shows that they've completely run out of ideas for the COD franchise now - it chops and changes, jumping backwards and forwards in time, in missions that span a couple of decades, that attempt to change established history too. By the halfway point, you won't know where you're supposed to be or who it is you're playing. Did you assassinate Carter or Castro? In the final chapter, you actually end up playing the level twice from two different points of view. Clever, but confusing nonetheless.The graphics are very obviously from Treyarch too. There's a look and feel to them that singles Treyarch games out - too glossy, too colourful, too much aliasing (crawling) in the textures and way the hell too much popup (where things just blink into existence in front of you as you run). In this respect it looks and feels just like COD:World At War and they've obviously used the same graphics engine. It turns out they've likely used the same audio engine too. On a PS3, hooked up to a 5.1 digital surround system, there's so much echo that you end up playing with the sound turned down. World At War had the exact same issue - something which does not affect the Infinity Ward COD titles. Treyarch's audio engine makes every shot sound like a firecracker dropped down a toilet. You can be standing in the middle of an open field and it still echos, and the echo carries over to all the other sound effects too. Run through the sea in the \"Crisis\" online map and it sounds like you're sploshing around in tile-walled toilet.I'll focus the rest of this short review around online play as this is ultimately where you'll end up spending 95% of your time with this game.Or at least you would be if it worked.This title suffers from the worst online play I've ever seen. Every game will drop you out due to a \"connection error\". If you're lucky, the game will come back. If not, you'll be dropped back into the lobby, which will close moments later. About 50% of the time it simply crashes the PS3, resulting in the three little \"reboot me\" beeps, before it shuts down.Before getting dropped from a game, you'll discover that the hit detection in Black Ops is fundamentally flawed. In previous COD games, when playing online, a certain amount of latency was inevitable, but when you watch the killcams in Black Ops, the person who killed you (or got the winning kill) is aiming so far away from you that you'd think it would have classified as a miss.The latency is terrible and I know it's not my setup - I can pop Modern Warfare 2 in my PS3 and play decent online games, then swap back to Black Ops and face the same latency and hit detection problems.Sure the online game modes are all present and correct but some are near impossible to play because of the above problems - capture the flag being the most impossible. The respawn mechanism insists on respawning you in front of an opposing team player and the mandatory 15 second respawn delay is maddening. Free-for-fall, team deathmatch and domination are all relatively playable though which partly redeems the game - at least in the 1 game in 2 that it doesn't throw you out.These are all related to this one game - it's not a function of your PS3 or your network. As I said above - you can drop in Modern Warfare 2 and play a totally normal online game. Go back to Black Ops and all the network problems come back. It's like using a 1990's token-ring network.Treyarch are well aware of all the problems and have been trying to patch the game to fix these issues since the day it came out. On Dec 13th 2010, the second patch came out. Whereas it used to take 5 or 10 seconds to find an open lobby, the patch changed something so it took 1 or 2 minutes instead. The game still crashed the PS3, you still got connection errors and there was still appalling latency.On Dec 16th 2010 the third patch came out. Now it won't find any lobbies. So online play has gone from bad, to worse, to turned off completely. Essentially what you're buying now is a 5 hour, single-player game, and a very poor one at that. This game has been in development for 2 years - its inexcusable that Treyarch let it out with this sort of problem in it, and to \"cure\" it by simply turning off the online modes is what caused me to give up entirely. I've gone back to playing Modern Warfare 2, and you should too.Don't waste your money on this title - the single player mode is too short, and the multiplayer is (at the time of writing) dead - it's been disabled in the latest patch.Hopefully 2011 will see the reigns handed back to Infinity Ward for a Modern Warfare 3. At least they know how to write software.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"From Detroit","summary":"Boring.","reviewText":"I preordered this game and took it back a week after I got it.

{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

Very difficult to do when you have your advisors screaming repetitive information back at you.The music is something in it's own.  It has a wonderful feature that you can access.  That feature is the ability to turn the music off.  The music has been repeated through every Sim City and will most likely be in the next one as well.

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"eightysicks86","summary":"Great new different kind of game, with a hint of GTA","reviewText":"This is my opinion / perspective.First, it's a solid 4 star game.  It Rocks and will keep you busy for a good 100 hours.Now, people, we all knew this game would be over-rated, and it is.  The GTA franchise is a monster now and fanboys will eat up anything Take Two/ Rockstar will throw at them.  This is not a 10 star game Gamespot!Perhaps this game is being treated unfairly because it's being compared to its predecessors and needs to live up to the \"next gen\" spec.  To be appreciated, it shouldn't be judged by either or it will fall short.Landscapes-I feel they took the major landmarks and put them in, although most of them seem to be in the wrong place.  You wouldn't be able to drive down the street you live on for example.  However, the Bronx feels like the Bronx, Manhattan feels like Manhattan, etc. Which is great.  (I live on Long Island).  All in all, the landscape is damn near amazing!Graphics-I feel they did well considering the complexity of the environment.  But to compare graphics to games like Bioshock, COD4, Halo3, GOW, etc.  this game falls short.  It is not quite \"Next-Gen\".  Although the game is smooth, the lights from the buildings and bridge look great in the background, and when it rains (as well as the sun) it looks realistic on the road.  The graphics are great considering the compromise for data and complexity.Voices-  there are no popular ones.  Roman can get annoying, and Niko sounds like Shrek.  Other than that, they are good.  (We had Sam Jackson and James Woods last game, not to mention DTS discreet surround sound in Vice city).Things I liked from San Andreas that are absent in 4:As far as connecting with the characters, you cannot talk to them like in SA (good comment or negative comment)Cannot change physical appearanceClothing stores and apparel much more limited in 4No territory wars in 4No property to buyNo houses to buyNo planes, just a helicopter. (Which also means no air force with 6 stars)The motorcycles are not as plentiful and varied.Weapons! Where are they?  You kinda have to buy em in this game.Nothing to spend your money on.More complex map in 4 but not as big in scale as SAIn SA, when aiming, you could switch targets much easier.  Its clunky in 4.Harder missions.  The missions in 4 seems very easy.You cannot recruit gang members to ride with you.Things I like in 4 that are missing in other versions:NPC's (civilians) are more varied, fat, skinny, homeless, rude, tough, a lot more cursing.  More dynamic.  I watched a man get arrested on the street and after he put his hands up he walked to a cop car that pulled up in the street and the cop put him in the back seat and then drove away.  Much more going on in the city, in the background.Changing clothes is much quicker.The cell phone is a great touch.The story is engaging and the characters are great.The cars are much more realistic, and more modern (Chrysler 300) Although the game still has the glitch were there AI cars depends on the type that you are driving.Rag doll physics (they way people fall when shot)MULTIPLAYER! Free mode is going to be a blast!Blood stains on cars where you hit people.You can take the cabs/Romans taxi anywhere you want\"Street Ladies\" are much more hidden (more realistic)Warning level (identical to \"Scarface\")  1-2 stars is very easy to evade.  3 is tough.  4 or more is near impossible because its hard to outrun a helicopter and:The pay n' Spray wont clear your wanted level if the cops see you entering.Getting drunk.They should have:Included an option to buckle upMade turning in cars easier.Made a 3 star level in free mode the same as a 3 star level in a mission (much harder in a mission)Left out the darts, bowling, pool etc.  Boring.  And stupid.These are just some of the things I can think of.  Overall, this is a great game that I will be playing for a while.  I remember feeling overwhelmed with SA when I started playing it, and not so much with 4.  It seems they got rid of the overhead (fancy actors and DTS, more fun side things) and gave us the basic scraps knowing that this game was gonna be huge no matter what.  And everyone is drinking the Kool-Aid.  While it doesn't quit feel \"Next-gen\" in appearance, consider all the data it takes up for the complexity.  There are a lot of great improvements from the last and does leave you satisfied.  However, these improvements do not overshadow the fact that they left out a lot of fun things from previous versions. I shouldn't want to play SA all over again, but I do.Try to judge it as a distinct game made by Taketwo/Rockstar, not a continuation in the GTA series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}

After having played the Baldur's Gate series and thoroughly enjoying it, I thought that this would be more of the same immersive fantasy-based gaming.  On some levels, this game is successful in creating an interesting world to explore with some fascinating people to meet and things to do.  The story itself is quite intriguing and well-written.  The problem is that the game is slowly paced for the first several hours and is tedious throughout.Gameplay: The controls are fairly simple and should be familiar to anyone who has played Baldur's Gate and similar RPG titles.  Your character is an immortal amnesiac who must find out who he is and how to resolve his curse of immortality.  The character creation options seem flexible at first, but they really aren't.  While you can change classes during the game, you had best learn how to do one thing well, or there will likely be problems later.  Also, your alignment (moral view) may change based on your actions, but many of the game's quests (including the main one) are scripted for \"right\" answers that might force your character to play out of character.  Also, there are some unreasonable limits placed on combat.  In 30 hours of gameplay, I didn't come across one projectile weapon, which meant that all fights were melee skirmishes.  Moreover, you can't tell how wounded your opponents are until they actually kill over.Planescape: Torment is a very text-heavy game, which is both its strength and greatest weakness.  Whoever wrote the dialogue and story is a talented writer, and this would have actually made a decent novel.  However, much of the dialogue gets in the way of the gameplay in ways that are truly annoying.  You'll find yourself running back and forth between people, going through their entire dialogue trees looking for clues (several times).  Sometimes those clues will not be found unless you know exactly who to talk to, when, and about what topic.  Even then you might not get what you are looking for.  Some of the quests are very imaginative, but others are greatly hindered by this ask-everybody-everything-everytime approach.The dialogue issue would not be such a problem if it did not plague the main quest, but it does.  I hate to consult walkthrough guides, but you will probably have to in order to get pass a few of the several places where you simply won't know what to do next, who to talk to, or what item you need.  There is an in-game journal that can be useful, but even it won't point you in the right direction on some occasions (and \"completed\" quests are not always taken out of the \"assigned quests\" category).Actually, this is the first computer RPG that I have played that could not hold my interest until the end.  This was largely due to the tedious nature of the gameplay.  I knew that it was time to quit when I defeated the main boss, just to get a message afterward that said that, in effect, I had not chosen the correct specific dialogue options before defeating this enemy. What???  It was like finally meeting Diablo at the end of Diablo 2, or Dagoth Ur at the end of Morrowind, or Jon Irenicus at the end of Baldur's Gate 2 and winning the fight, just to learn that you had not been nice enough in your dialogue responses before the fight started and thus would have to redo the 30 minutes of dialogue that preceded the encounter.  Very frustrating.Graphics: Visual representation is decent, even by today's standards.  Character models look good, as do environments.  The game does have a certain drabness about it, which is part of the storyline.  But overall, the graphics are fine.Sound: Decent, but nothing memorable.  The weather in the main city of Sigil is always the same, so there are no thunderstorms or other ambient noises.  The voice acting is decent, but quite sparse.  More of it would have made the story even more immersive and less text-driven.  The music was okay, but again not memorable.Replayability/Value: I couldn't bear to get through one complete playing of the game, so I can't recommend it for repeat plays.  If you insist upon playing this game, try to get it cheap ($10 or less).  The story and quests seem too linear to warrant doing them a second time, especially since you are the same basic character during every game.  There are a few interesting party members, such as Morte and Annah, but NPC interaction here does not measure up to the high standard set by the Baldur's Gate games.Overall, I cannot recommend this game to anyone except very patient and/or hardcore roleplaying gamers.  For everyone else, there are many computer RPGs available now that are clearly superior to the gameplay, story line, and graphics of Planescape: Torment.  If you want to play a truely excellent, classic RPG, check out Morrowind, the Baldur's Gate series, Gothic 2, or even the Diablo series.  Though it has a good story, my suspicion is that Planescape: Torment largely appeals to a specific niche of the computer roleplaying market, which does not mind its tedious dialogue system, linear questing, and bizarre story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2004"}

Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games.

The first Sonic Adventure featured 6 characters to play as and you could play them in any order. The difference in this game is that even though it also features 6 charachters to play as, they are all pretty much the same (Sonic/Shadow, Tails/Dr. Eggman and Knuckles/Rouge) and you changed charachters without choosing to because Sega made you.

I'm a casual gamer and saw this advertised around the same time I purchased a new high-end PC.  I figured, \"what better way to break in a new PC\"?  After plunking down my cash, I fired up the game and was treated to a pretty nice intro.  The game play that followed was also enjoyable.  You play a marine named Alcatraz who is sent with a group of other marines to New York City to locate a professor named Gould.  After an alien ambush, Alcatraz ends up alone in a nano suit.  The nano suit is simply amazing and the capabilities it gives you really add to the strategy and fun factor of the game.  It has a stealth mode which gives Alcatraz \"Predator\" type invisibility, armor mode increases the amount of damage that can be absorbed, and power moves enable Alcatraz to perform superhuman feats of strength and agility.  As the game progresses, you find out more about the suit and the capabilities.  The suit is really fun and gratifying when used correctly.  However, just so you won't be invincible and easily bored, the special powers of the suit rapidly drain it of energy.  You must allow the suit to recharge periodically. The nano suit and the fact that you must utilize it correctly to make any real progress prevent this from being just another mindless shooter.  The environments are very detailed.  The game makes great use of lighting and other effects.Now for my gripes.  First, the environment isn't as open as I anticipated.  Sure, you can wander around, interact with items and find (limited) alternate routes, but stray from the primary path and you'll quickly end up at some wall, collapsed building, or Alcatraz will meet an untimely end.  You must take the one and only predetermined exit route to the next checkpoint and yet another confined area to conquer.  So you're basically allowed to explore a ravaged NYC a few blocks at a time.  Second, is the old-school checkpoint save system.  All I can ask is WHY????  I mean, if someone spends a lot of time fighting through enemies only to encounter one really difficult part near the end, why condemn them to start that segment all over again?  That method is so 1986.  Some folks say it keeps the game from being too short, but that's a horrible reason.  I would very much rather play a game and have it seem \"short\" than be forced to repeatedly play an entire level over and over due to one wrong move or difficult obstacle.  Is that supposed to be more fun?  Yet another gripe is the language.  I'm not a prude by any stretch, but the dialogue in Crysis 2 sounds like it was written by a couple of thirteen-year-olds who just discovered the \"art\" of cussing.  Every other word is a four letter S or F word.  Even the presumably well educated Professor Gould can't seem to string three words together without swearing.  It all just seems excessive and unnecessary. If the writers were going for tongue in cheek humor by purposely being over the top, they failed.  It ends up just sounding dumb and juvenile.  Lastly, it starts a little slow.  Once the aliens really enter the fray, it picks up pretty fast but the first half of the game plods along at times.I haven't tried multi-player mode.  Sadly, there are so many cheats and hacks out there, online gaming has lost all appeal for me.  EA has already released a patch to address rampant online cheating in Crysis 2, but cheaters will eventually find a way around that as well.  Overall, I enjoy playing Crysis 2.  The irritating save system, limited environments and juvenile dialogue keep it from being a great game but it's still very fun to play.  I  find myself itching to play constantly.  I never played the original Crysis, so I can't speak for whether it's a downgrade, but as a new player to Crysis 2, it's pretty enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

A total mess? No, but I will show below how that saying applies.WHAT WENT WRONG:For me, the biggest problem with Dead Space is the story. While the gameplay is mostly rock-solid, the plot is full of uninteresting characters and ridiculous mission assignments.For one, your main character doesn't even speak the whole 12-14 hours of gameplay. It's pretty sad when even the monsters you are fighting are more vocal than you are.Then there's Nicole. Supposedly my goal is to find her and save her blah blah blah. But with such poor character development I really didn't care if she lived or not--or any of the other NPC's for that matter.When it comes down to it, almost all games have you do some sort of fetch quest. Go and fetch the golden flute, find the key, get the power module, etc. Role-Playing Games (RPGs) are abundant in fetch quests, but, when done well, go unnoticed because you are also interacting with other colorful characters and getting wrapped up in the story.We've already established that the character development is lacking, which makes the fact that every single mission is the equivalent of \"Fido, Fetch!\" all too apparent.You're on this huge spaceship and every possible subsystem that can be broken, is. The asteroid-defense lasers, the oxygen content, multiple doors and control stations, the shuttle and so on. You have a few comrades-in-arms that keep in touch with you via a spiffy Heads Up Display (HUD), but often (if not all) the time they are staying put in their safe little control room while you're doing all the dirty work.For once I would have liked to see some different mission assignments, like \"Hold this position for X amount of time until help arrives.\" or be the guy in the control room for once helping someone else get through the ship by opening the right doors at the right time.As for bugs/glitches, I found two: The first one I was in a moving elevator and backed up against the wall and somehow fell THROUGH the elevator floor all the way down to the bottom of the shaft and couldn't get out.The second glitch I found was on the last chapter where the entire side of one building had become transparent, exposing the outside of the level.While the first bug hampered gameplay and required loading a prior save, the second did not.WHAT WENT RIGHT:For all that went wrong, there is a LOT that went right with DEAD SPACE. If you were to ask me how to sum up the game in 4 words it would be this:DOOM 3 Done RightThe gameplay (except for those two bugs mentioned above) is pretty solid. Saved games are reliable (unlike FARCRY 2), weapons function as advertised, inventory screens are clean (although text can be small on non-HDTV's) and the controls are pretty good.There is a nice variety in enemies to kill: from fast to slow, from small to behemoth, from short-range attackers to stationary long-range attackers. And all of them have the ability to make you sit on the edge of your seat if you turn the corner at the wrong moment or forget to have your weapon drawn when exiting the elevators.The weapon selection is nice, although I personally only used the Plasma Cutter/ Line Cutter/ Pulse Rifle/ Force Cannon combo for the whole game. I recommend 2-3 fast-firing weapons and 1 or 2 weapons with super-powerful secondary fire modes (Line Cutter/ Force Cannon).What's even nicer is the fact that you can upgrade your weapons to make them deal more damage, hold more ammo, increase speed, or reduce reloading times.Best of all is the realism. For once Outer Space is actually SILENT. Another realistic touch is how this mining ship has mining tools as weapons. The only real weapons I can recall with non-mining applications are the flamethrower and the pulse rifle.The walls are smeared with blood and alien markings. There are also ads and portraits of past commanders of this once-great spaceship.Is the game scary? Not as scary as F.E.A.R., in my opinion, but you'll definitely jump a few times (mostly towards the beginning of the game when you don't know what to expect). This game does create a very believable spaceship-in-outer-space atmosphere.I don't usually play the Survival-Horror genre so hopefully that puts some perspective on how good this game is.Happy hunting and watch your back!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2008"}

The day I got my Playstation 4.  UPS delivered it at like 5 something.  I saw this game got varied reviews.  But it looked so fun to me, so I decided that this would be the first game I played.The game is very simple.  You run, jump, hit and evade.  But it is one of the funniest games I have ever played.  What does it mean then, when a game is so simple, but you get such a special feeling when playing?  It means the game is just plane fun.  There are things you have to think about when you are looking at a game.  Important things.  How are the controls?  What are the graphics like?  How is the voice acting?  How into the entire atmosphere do you get?  Finally, is it enjoyable?  My answer to all of these questions is a 110% yes!  Everything feels so well done.  I can move around easily, jump, hit and just get out of the way of an attack in time.  The voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard.  That goes not just for games.  I set it on hard and many times, I have to do something multiple times to  survive a level.  I realized that I had gotten lost in the game.  I got my first trophy.  That was exciting.  I just started playing this game.  But, I know it will be one of my favorites.  One of the best launch games I have ever played, one of the funniest, thought stealing games I have ever played.  I am so lucky to have picked this game up.  Ignore the bad reviews, do yourself a favor and pick this game up.Some other cool stuff about this game are, one is the slow motion.  At times, when you are fighting, everything will slow down and you will see yourself hit the enemy.  It is really cool.  Second, when you get stuff and build up your character, it actually makes you feel more powerful.  I bulked myself out a bit and sat there super happy that my character was stronger.  Then I knocked the heck out of some enemies.  When I saw the cut scenes and played the game, (I know there may be some interesting things said about this) I felt like I was playing an iPad game.  Lately, I have gotten so into games on that device.  Everything looks so clean and neat.  That is how this game looks.  It looks fantastic.  I was playing over my grandparents and everything disappeared.  That means the game took me away from everything else.  Great game.I forgot to mention something.  Collectables!  In each level, there are collectables.  Some are easy to see.  You can see the door that will lead you to them.  But others are harder.  Some levels, when you first start, you have to run backwards and you enter another area.  Sometimes you have to go around hitting the walls.  Maybe one will crumble and treasure will be inside.Something else I just found out I can do.  You can pick stuff up and throw it at enemies.  Right now, the only thing I have picked up has been these tank enemies.  You hit them until they die, hit square and throw them at the other enemies.  Also, one you get enough power, you can use what I guess is magic.  You can hit a button to power up, then hit it again and take out one or more enemies.  All this happens without slowing anything down.New stuff to say.  OK, something that some may get annoyed at is this.  When going through a level, if you die at the end, you will restart back at the very beginning of the level.  Some of the treasure is gone since you already got it, while the stuff that give you more power is still there.  But this is one of those games.  You can learn by restarting.  I learn which enemy to take down first, or how to survive and enemy by learning it's pattern.  Another cool thing about the restarting at the beginning is this, whatever energy you get while going through the level, stays with you.  So, say you are having a though time with a group of enemies.  Well, the more time you die, the more your energy will go up.  Thus allowing you to eventually use an attack that can take them all down at once.  It has helped me more than once.  Another cool this is using your elements.  I guess that is what I will call them.  You get a different one every now and then.  I got wood.  So, you break the wood piles and it goes to your body making you bigger and stronger.  There was a part I could not get it.  It had wood in front of it.  Then, my body caught on fire.  It burned like a fire place.  Well, I went back to the wood that was blocking the treasure and it caught on fire!!!!  Thus opening the door and allowing me to get to the one blocked treasure.Super fun.  When I am playing and finished playing this game, I feel like I did when I got my Playstation way back when.  This is the first time I have felt like that.  Like I have never played a game before.  Damn it's fun!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

Deadlocked is NOT an adventure game like the others - it's a gladiator combat game. You don't even have Clank with you for most of the game.It's not that this game is \"bad\" - but it's different. I really did like the whole exploring-worlds theme of the previous games. The gladiator matches in those were interesting diversions but I was always happy when they were over. In this game, that's all that you get. You go from arena to arena, mindlessly bashing away at enemies and trying to stay alive.There are all sorts of mini-games that you unlock along the way - hoverbike races involving traditional follow-the-circles, shooting games, flying games, and much more. The humor is still quite fun, although it's now a very odd mix of very adult humor and very kiddy humor. The game is rated Teen so the adult humor is reasonably OK I suppose, depending on how protective you are of younger teens.The weapons upgrades are as usual amazingly fun - and you get to have \"mods\" to your weapons like acid and napalm to customise them to your liking. You can do all sorts of mixes and matches to get just the feel that you want.The graphics are of good quality - I've always enjoyed the graphic style of the Ratchet and Clank games so this provides more of the same. The sound is reasonably good, although we do find some really repetitive, annoying tracks in there. We also had the game completely freeze up on us a few times. Maybe it needed just a little more QA before it was released.The multiplayer modes are a really nice extension of the game. I really enjoy playing a game with a friend, so anything with co-op in it is great.I suppose on the up side that if this had not come out, we would have just been sitting here twiddling our thumbs until the next \"real\" release of Ratchet and Clank came out. So in that sense, I'm really happy to have this out as filler, to keep us busy until then. We definitely ran out to grab this as soon as it was released, even though it wasn't (as far as we were concerned) a fully fledged Ratchet and Clank game to plow through.Well Recommended!Rating? 4/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2005"}

{"product_name":"B005DVAB0A","description":"","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Despite the different feel and design, this ninja's blade is still sharp","reviewText":"Based on all the flak this game has received from pretty much every reviewer, professional and non-professional, I was expecting Ninja Gaiden 3 to be very slow-paced, boring, underdeveloped, and filled with glitches. Fortunately, none of those problems plague this game. I'm clearly in the minority here, but throughout most of my playthrough for this game I found that I couldn't help but ask myself this one question: \"Am I playing the same game all those other guys were complaining about?\" While the first few levels of Ninja Gaiden 3 were somewhat underwhelming, it really picked up before the halfway point, and by the last couple of levels I was actually putting in a fair amount of effort towards defeating some challenging enemies and trying hard not to get killed too much. Let us begin by going into the much more involved and actually decent story showcased in Ninja Gaiden 3. The first two games barely had any stories to speak of, with the focus on gameplay taking precedence over everything else. There's really nothing wrong with that, but I'm glad they decided to focus more on the narrative aspect for once with this game instead of sticking to the exact same formula of straight-up action and minimal story. This game opens with Ryu Hayabusa being asked by agents of the JSDF (Japanese Self-Defense Forces) to help them deal with some terrorists who have taken innocent people hostage in London and are demanding the presence of Ryu himself. Agreeing to help them, Ryu goes in and begins effectively slaughtering every terrorist he comes across, that is until he encounters the terrorist leader known as the Regent of the Mask. After a vicious sword battle, the Regent places a curse on Ryu known as the Grip of Murder, which causes the Dragon Sword to be absorbed into his arm and infects him with the combined malice and hatred of the countless people Ryu has slain over the years with the fabled blade. The flesh-rotting curse will eventually spread and kill Ryu, giving him no choice but to finish the job of finding out who these terrorists are and stop their plans, while hopefully finding a way to remove the curse as well. The story behind Ninja Gaiden 3 is definitely more involved and meaty compared to the rather anorexic plots of the previous two games, and while the story here is nothing out of this world or altogether original, it is still entertaining and I actually cared about some of the characters that Ryu meets up with. There are even a couple of plot twists thrown in there for good measure. I also appreciate how we get a closer look at Ryu's personality (and unmasked face) and see that he is indeed capable of experiencing emotions such as anger, regret, and compassion. Fortunately, this attempt to humanize Ryu does not feel forced or contrived, and it also doesn't change the fact that he's still a stone cold killer who slaughters evildoers without mercy. Speaking of slaughter, Ryu is still quite capable of slicing and dicing every enemy he comes across in pretty much the same fast-paced and fluid manner as in the previous games.First and foremost, his collection of different weaponry is smaller than what most gamers are accustomed to. Aside from his classic shurikens and a bow and arrow (which eventually shoots explosive arrows), Ryu begins the game with one sword and then switches to a couple of other progressively stronger ones as the story progresses, very much like what was done in the original PS2 Prince of Persia games. We no longer have the large selection of upgradeable weapons from the days of yore. I would have preferred more available weapons from the get go, but I also didn't find this to be the unforgivable transgression that most other gamers did. However, new copies of Ninja Gaiden 3 come with a voucher code that gives you access to the Eclipse Scythe and Falcon's Talons from Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, as well as some online ninja trial stuff. These extra weapons really do increase this game's fun factor. Given that this game is now being sold at roughly half its original retail price, buying it new to get these extra weapons for free is worth it, as opposed to buying the weapons as DLC off PSN for an extra $20...yikes. Any future sequels should make sure to include more than one weapon type right off the bat and not rely on DLC. The smaller number of weapons also inherently lowers the different number of combos Ryu can perform in battle, but not as much as you may think. Thankfully, he can still perform the classic Izuna Drop on his enemies, however I do wish he could still do the Guillotine Throw, or at least another type of throw move. Another change to the combat is how Ryu no longer uses essence or special items to regain health and ninpo. Instead, Ryu's ninpo meter gradually fills up as he damages enemies. Once the ninpo meter is full, he is capable of casting a spell that turns him into a fire dragon, where he then gobbles up all surrounding enemies and feasts on them, restoring any health he may have previously lost. If the player chooses not to cast the fire dragon spell and instead kills all enemies with Ryu's physical attacks, then any accumulated ninpo will be used up at the end of the battle to restore Ryu's health. This change in gameplay may not have been necessary, but in my opinion it was a refreshing change nonetheless. Ultimate Techniques have changed somewhat as well. Ryu can no longer perform Ultimate Techniques at will, but after killing a certain number of enemies, his cursed arm will begin to glow red. At that point, Ryu can perform an Ultimate Technique that allows him to home in on up to 6 enemies or so and kill them one at a time in rapid succession (this works differently with the Eclipse Scythe). Since this game throws a larger number of enemies at you simultaneously, this new version of Ultimate Techniques proves to be quite useful in quickly lowering the number of enemy forces, but it also makes it a bit more challenging for Ryu to survive against a group of tougher enemies. If Ryu is surrounded by tougher enemies that take longer to kill, he has to fight cautiously and make enough kills to build up his Ultimate Technique energy in order to unleash it on his enemies, which can be hard to do if he's low on health and ninpo. I find this set-up adds an extra layer of challenge to an otherwise simple game.Also worth mentioning are the combat oriented button prompts that pop up randomly as Ryu is slicing into his opponents. His blade will be thrust deep into his opponent and the player will be prompted to press the light or heavy attack button to make Ryu literally cut all the way through his opponent and mortally wound them to take them out of the battle (tougher enemies will try to counter this move). If any other enemies are close enough, Ryu will be able to do more of these one-hit kill slices and effectively take out a small group of enemies in seconds. Other players thought these button prompt kills were annoying and claimed that it got in the way of the fast-paced combat, but I found it to be brutally satisfying. One flaw this game has that was actually carried over from Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is how incredibly straightforward the gameplay is. There are no puzzles whatsoever and there is only one set path to follow; no possibility of exploration. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 had a few extra paths to take here and there that usually led to an extra health item or some other trinket, but Ninja Gaiden 3 has no collectibles to speak of, and therefore has no extra paths to find them in. But, it does mostly make up for this with the inclusion of quick time events reminiscent of God of War, specifically Ghost of Sparta. That game had no puzzles either, but it broke up the action with special adventure sequences where Kratos would slide down these cliffs and time a jump to another cliff or boss enemy. Ryu has similar cliff sliding moments that lead to him gliding across the air to reach solid ground. Many of these gliding set-pieces involve the player responding to button prompts that have Ryu either dodging deadly projectiles or slicing through enemies big and small. These same button prompts come into action with some of the game's boss battles against some really big enemies. Then there's the Kunai Climb, where Ryu will basically thrust two kunai into a wall and use the kunai to climb up the wall until he reaches the top. The player must hold down the L1 and R1 buttons and then alternate between releasing and pressing both buttons one at a time to \"act out\" Ryu's climbing. This takes a little getting used to, but in time you'll be climbing up these walls with little problem. Aside from simply climbing up a wall to reach the top, Ryu will also go through Kunai Climb sequences when facing off against several larger bosses, as well as climbing up the side of a collapsing wall of ice or a broken bridge that is steadily falling apart, all while occasionally avoiding falling debris or gunfire.One thing that I feel should have been added was a larger variety of enemies, especially for the first half of the game where Ryu mostly fights regular soldiers and some tougher soldiers with dual blades. More enemies are brought in later on such as soldiers equipped with stealth suits, attack dogs, alchemists who use strange and powerful sorcery, Black Spider Ninjas (one mission only), and some Fiends. Most of these enemies provide an average challenge, although the last few missions throw tougher versions of the same types of enemies at you that will prove more difficult to defeat. Still, I would have liked to see a few other enemy types, mostly a larger number of Fiends. Much like the regular enemies, the boss fights range from average to slightly above average in difficulty, with the rare exception or two. To me, this game had just the right combination of less frustrating challenge and simple fun without getting boring. If you should happen to die, which won't likely happen much at all until the last few missions, there are enough save points dispersed throughout the levels that let you restart not too far off from wherever you may have been killed. Save points also replenish your health, although it hardly seems necessary since Ryu regains his health after every battle anyway. Final thoughts: I can see why some of the changes they made in this game did not appeal to fans of the series, especially the diehard \"masochistic\" fans who only have fun when they're getting murdered time after time by insanely cheap enemies. This game is not for those old school Ninja Gaiden fans. Even if they play on higher difficulty levels, the changes made to the combat, specifically the smaller number of weapons, removal of upgrades and items, less challenging enemies, and the different versions of ninpo and Ultimate Techniques, appear to be too much for their delicate sensibilities to handle. Still, I don't believe Ninja Gaiden 3 deserves the large number of 1 and 2 star scores it has received on this site, not to mention the low scores it has received on certain professional gaming sites (3 out of 10 on IGN? Gimme a break). As much as I liked the first two Ninja Gaiden games, I found Ninja Gaiden 3 to be plenty of fun by its own right, even with all the changes to the formula. This game is at least worth a rental for any gamer who enjoys some good old fashioned, straight-up ninja action with few bells and whistles. It's not perfect, but it plays well, has a pretty good story, controls fine, and has very nice graphics. It's true what other gamers have said: if this game had a different title, its critical reception would have likely been more favorable overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2012"}

After achieving worldwide sales success and awards for both the originalMetal Gear SolidandMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons Of Liberty, series creator, Hideo Kojima combines the essence of both games into one unique experience.","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Bought it a few hours ago; Good and Bad, Mostly Good","reviewText":"The original metal gear solid was great. This remake is great too. It features completely new graphics, new stealth tactics, but the same story. Still, the story was great so why change it? Well, this game is basically the original metal gear, with MGS2 graphics and MGS2 gameplayI knew there would be a few problems. The main problem is voice acting. The voice actors are different for Mei Ling, Naomi, Kenneth Baker, and the ninja. They changed the ninja's voice. What is that? The ninja(i know his name just don't wanna spoil it) gave a very good speech at the end of Metal Gear Solid about his life. It was moving. This new ninja's voice is kind of younger, and doesn't have the same effect. Mei Ling has a completely different voice actor. Occasionaly when you open the save menu you will hear the old voice saying \"wanna save snake?\", but that is it. In terms of Naomi, her new voice actor is okay, but it doesn't have the same british accent going. Kenneth Baker has a new voice actor, but it really doesn't matter. They should of used the original ninja voice...The controls are also a problem at times. I mean, the original metal gear had some camera problems during certian fights. This one lets you go in first person, but holding the z button gets tiring, especially when you have big hands. On top of that, the gun takes forever to get use to. To put it down, you hit \"Y\". Okay, but this is simply obnoxious(you will understand what I mean the moment you start to use the gun). If this game goes to PS2 I will probably trade this in for that. Pressure sensitive keys are one million times easier. You will probably accidentaly fire your gun alot, and it will become annoying till you get the hang of it.As for other changes? Well, take MGS2 and think in terms of that for gameplay. Lockers, holding up badguys, hanging from ledges, dropping down like Arnold, and so on.The new scenes in the game are spread out, but they are worth it. There are a lot of new \"matrix\" moves. Snake dodges bullets like crazy. Also, there is probably one of the coolest scenes ever between the ninja and Snake after Revolver Ocelot. You basically get to see the ninja pull out that sword stuff. It rocks. Watch the intro to see some new stuff. Also watch those breifings that you probably didn't care about in the first MGS. They are in 3d instead of 2d. More interesting basically.The graphics are better than MGS2 in certain places. The gun models are fantastic, and they included the M9(tranquilizer), which is a fun gun.For 40 dollars, this game is worth it. The same story is there, and the gameplay will get much funner once you learn to use guns properly. Well, it is extremely fun because you get to use Snake so much in better sneaking environments. The tanker was alright, but it was too short. There is also plenty of blood for the action fans(booya) and that is a big plus. Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2004"}

Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

In addition, the sharp shooter has incorporated a firing mode selector, pump-action grip and reload button that allow for new ways of engagement*. The sharp shooter is perfect for PlayStation Move owners who want to experience the most realistic action possible.","reviewerName":"B. Cooper","summary":"Great Quality and Button Placement IF You Already Like Motion Control","reviewText":"I've been playing Dead Space: Extraction and Killzone 3 with the Sharpshooter for a while and feel I can finally give some input about its overall value.  The plastic is much higher quality than other brands (I would say it's closest in plastic quality to the Wii Zapper), and everything looks and feels well engineered.  The Sharpshooter currently costs $40, which I would say is about $10 over what the MSRP should be considering a Move controller is $50.  When all is said and done this Motion Control Gunplay Experience will cost you $150 for the package ($50 Move, $40 Sharpshooter, $30 Navigator, $30 Camera).  If you don't already have a Move, and were not planning on getting one before seeing this peripheral then I would say save your money. Using the Sharpshooter is not worth $150 to change the gameplay experience.  I doubt many people online will be using it competitively either since it has quite a large learning curve.  However, if you already like playing shooting games with your move or would like to change the experience, then this is a MUST BUY.The button scheme is excellent for both right handed and left handed players since it places smaller buttons on both sides of the unit.  The pump grip maps as a reload button.  Both the Move and Navigator Controllers are held in place by a cover piece that snaps down. However, as other reviewers have stated, the Navigator WILL be be slightly loose when it is (funny enough) correctly inserted.  You have to push the Navigator section down into the handle so that (like the Wii zapper) plastic tabs fit into the screw holes.  Once they are fully inserted it will allow you to close the plastic hinge on top of the Navigator's base so that it sits flat against the plastic.  The Navigator will not roll sideways or move out of place, but the rattle is slightly annoying.  I can guarantee you that this is NOT just my unit either.  The variation between plastic molds would not vary enough so that this would only happen to a few people and not others.  If your unit doesn't rattle, then the tabs are probably not fully inserted into the screw holes and the hinge is probably not closed all the way. This small annoyance doesn't hinder gameplay or using the controller though.  The trigger button has a great feel to it, and the move button is located right below the trigger.  There is also a lock selector in case you are playing a game where you do not want to accidentally press the move button.  The adjustable stock works very well and I found it definitely helps you stay on target when turning in the game (to keep the cursor from wandering).Like someone else also said, the move needs to be calibrated while in the sharpshooter so that the angle will be adjusted onscreen. I would also recommend turning down the sensitivity.  As a peripheral I would say the Sharp Shooter is absolutely worth buying for $30, and probably worth the full $40 if you're really into Motion Control gaming.  If you haven't tried using the Wii or Move for shooting games then the experience will probably come as a shock to you.  It can be extremely disorienting to get used to, and is much much harder to be accurate (especially for longer periods of time where you cannot sit the controller on your lap).Overall, compared to other gun housings for the Move you definitely get what you pay for.  5/5 for durability, button placement, functionality and aesthetics.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}

They loved swimming like a salmon, throwing your snot, dodging spotlights and riding a pretend blow up horse.  There are so many different games that keep this game from getting boring.  I did have some problems playing some of the games but I think it was more due to my lighting in the room than the game itself.  Overall a great game for a group.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Borg","summary":"The best one yet..","reviewText":"To me finishing ME3 is a bitter-sweet moment. On one side I wanted to see the finale of this saga but on the other hand I feel sad that Commander Shepard story is now over. I for once will miss this series a lot. Sci-fi rpg's are a rare category and to get to play one as well done as the Mass Effect universe was truly one of my finest gaming experience.I think a lot has been said and done about this game. Some hate the ending, some like them but both sides have raised good points. I for one liked the ending (and I did not play with the extended-cut DLC) and found it to be very cinematic. The games fps play-thorough ends 10-15 minutes earlier and than you have about 10 minutes or so of interactive cut-scenes where you will decide how the story wraps up. Without trying to spoil it but sometimes in life especially in the world of books/movies you are up against hopeless odds and a sacrifice has to be made for the greater good. This aspect is what Bioware had tried to capture in the finale of the game and I think they succeeded. If you are expecting a grand FPS confrontation with the final boss in which everyone walks happily after downing the boss well than you might be disappointed but if you want to experience being against a impossible scenario and feeling truly hopeless than you might get to appreciate the way Bioware decided to end the game.Other than the endings this is a true Mass Effect game. You have a great sci-fi fps shooter/rpg where the story is the central focus not just mowing down mobs and picking up bigger & badder weapons. The gameplay is seamlessly combined with interactive cut-scenes which truly gives this game that interactive movie feel which had been the hallmark of the Mass Effect universe. Also the game brings closure to many of the sub-plots and to some major characters and in my view this aspect of the game was very well-handled. Multiple times through the game I thought real hard as to who I will side with or which decision I should make because of the emotional attachment I developed to those characters or sub-plots etc.I will highly recommend the game and will truly miss this great series. I will also advise that you get the extended cut dlc which is a free download as I have heard it greatly improves & clarifies the endings which is the only real negative this game has. In all I had lots of fun playing ME3 and ME2 & ME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

This is an incredibly well made machine and the operating system, while reminiscent of the xBox 360 is a step forward. The machine, Kinect, and controller, reek of quality construction, and while looks are subjective, the thing looks nice under my TV. I tried out using the machine to watch TV (I use a Tivo), and while impressed with using voice to control my TV (&#34;xBox, what's on Comedy Central?&#34;), for some reason, I don't quite feel ready to take that step yet, especially, as it seems to me that the console has to be switched on in order to watch TV (if someone can correct me on that, please do).There are not a huge amount of games yet, but I've been impressed by the quality (Dead Rising 3 is amazing and shows off the console quality and power, just see the scene where you come out of a tunnel and there are at least 500 zombies all waiting to eat you up!).I don't like that you have to install store bought games, and this can take a long time (though some games let you start playing before the install finishes). I do like that installs carry on even when the console is off.I find myself thinking this is a great console, however, I think it will be greater and I know that updates are already on the way.

{"product_name":"B003O6G6G4","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Mulligan \"Joker\"","summary":"Excellent Game","reviewText":"I hadn't played a very good RPG in quite some time when I played Dragon's Dogma, and boy this was refreshing. This game does many things right and a few beyond right.The story is rather absent in the game, as you'll find yourself doing mostly side missions, the story has something to do with a dragon trying to obliterate everything and you have to stop it somehow with the help of creatures known as Pawns. This dragon also has stolen your heart, yep STOLEN your HEART, and you must kill it to get it back.You can command them (or 3 at a time) and they help you to complete this task. You get to create your very own Pawn near the start of the game and if hooked up to Xbox LIVE, can recruit others (in a rare move, no Xbox LIVE Gold is needed!!!!). Your Pawn levels up and can be given new armor and weapons, so it's almost like playing with two characters. You can also rate others Pawns, and in turn, they yours. Your Pawn will also bring back items from their trip.Skills are unlocked by purchasing them with points earned by leveling, fairly simple. The moves upgrade as you level, but again, you must buy them. These skills can then be allocated to one of the slots (or buttons) and used with ease. Depnding on your class (and there are many, the basics and then the hybrids) you can have various passive and attacks skills. Sometimes, when timed correctly, you can link various skills with your Pawns.Controls are amazingly smooth, I still am impressed with how fluid the combat seems to be, even when jumping around, rolling and casting spells. Movement is also insanely well done, wether it be simple walking, running, falling, breaking ones legs from said fall, this game does it right in every single way imaginable.Once you've 'beaten' the game, you get to fight against the Ur-Dragon, a very tough dragon boss who has MASSIVE health (several millions, if not billions at this point). If playing offline, he's rather easy, but if played against online.... His health increases with every defeat (online) and the catch is, his health is altered depending on how many players are fighting him. His health is widdled away by all the players so if there are many players fighting him, this is good as it means each person's Ur-Dragon is easier, but it also means that the reward is harder to obtain as you get items based on how much damage you do, and if you kill him you get a special set of armor.So, if you're an RPG fan, a fan of wierd twists or just love dragons, I suggest getting this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

Since I played it for the first time, all i can think about is getting back to it.First, I have never played a Metal Gear Solid game before.  Therefore, I was very skeptical about picking this one up.  After all the hype, I couldn't resist.After the game installed, my jaw immediately dropped at the first scene.  The presentation is impeccable.  I felt like I was in a movie.  The story is masterful and the acting is engrossing.  What can I say about the graphics and the sound other than they are the best I have ever seen and heard, and I have a 360 and a PS3 and have played gems such as Gears of War and Uncharted: Drake's Fortune (Have a Wii too, but lets try to keep this serious :)Pro's:1.  Great AI2.  Amazing Gameplay3.  Engrossing Story that is very complex and serious4.  Endless Customization of Weapons5.  Ingenious game elements (I love the cardboard box!)6.  Tons of Extra's (SNAKE HAS AN IPOD THAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO MGSPODCASTS AND MUSIC FROM PREVIOUS GAMES ON WHILE YOUR SNEAKINGAROUND LEVELS).Con's1.  Some may say that the long cut scenes are a con, but they are all extremely interesting and advance the plot.  I love them, but I have to mention them because some people may not like that.2.  Mandatory Install:  There is an 8 minutes install before you can play the game and two more two minute installs before chapters.  Hardly a pain, but need mention none the less.  They are funny though, as Kojima gives you lots of hints and little information during the install.As I have tried to convey before, this game is a masterpiece and sets the standard for games of this generation.  It has been a while since I have been glued to the screen like this.  It should not be missed by ANYONE, even those who haven't played the series before like me!10/10 (or 5/5 for Amazon's sake) for being the defining title of this generation of gaming (to date).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2008"}

And after Red Dead Redemption, which was basically GTA with horses, I had enough of Rockstar. But last year when my PS3 broke down on me, I needed to pick up a new one. When I went to the store they had 2 different PS3's for sale, 1 256 gig PS3 by itself, and 1 500 gig PS3 with GTA 5 packaged inside it. So I picked that one up, and never touched GTA 5 for a long time, figuring it was gonna be just like all the rest, so why bother. But after a long time of it sitting on my shelf, I found myself bored one night and figure I'd see what changes were made to the series. I am really glad I did. This game is unbelievably good. They literally changed EVERYTHING I couldn't stand about the GTA series on the whole. This game has a very solid feel to it. The graphics are amazing, the voice acting is very solid and the music selection is great. I've already beaten the game, and am just going around looking for small crap to do because I'm not ready to stop playing.

{"product_name":"B000085AHJ","description":"In the open-ended space action/adventure gameFreelanceryou play a ne'er-do-well with a lucky streak, one of two survivors of a space disaster. Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"Amazing game","reviewText":"Rock star may be the king of open world games, but if they make a linear shooter it's going to ooze even more detail and personality in the more linear levels than their regular open world ones. Let me get this out of the way first: This game is beautiful. Not only graphically, which it excels in, but in gameplay, and story. The gameplay is rather basic but infinitely satisfying. The gunplay is very solid, and with great additions like bullet dodge (dive to the side into midair and shoot in slow motion while doing it), and bullet cameras (get a good kill and it will show the bullet leaving your barrel in slow motion and blasting itself into the person you killed) and bullet time, Max Payne 3 is a solid shooter. It does have a few extremely brief moments were you're fooled into thinking you can take a stealth approach, but these are quickly returned to the game's standard action: All out carnage.The levels are each great and variant as well. You'll be gunning your way through a favela all the way to an airport. (But no massacres, this isn't Modern Warfare 2). The game brilliantly deals with its extremely cinematic cut-scenes by using them as cover ups for the loading times. It may feel like control is being taken from you too much, (for instance, upon entering many doors, there's a cut scene) but these are very cinematic and in several cases push the story forward. The levels are well laid out, and also have hidden golden gun parts and clues to collect to make your experience better. I found all of them, and granted you get achievements for it, the experience of it makes it much more worth it.The story in this game is brilliant. The cinematic cutscenes are high budget movie quality, and they never leave you bored. Since Max Payne has a huge drug problem, there are several flashes at times, but this is only to push the game's personality forward and to give you a gritty feeling the game wants you to have.In case you didn't get it already, this game is very detailed. In everything. Graphics, story, gameplay.. Casings pop out of your gun, even upon reloading, which isn't common for most games to do that. Even when the character is handling other objects, it's not rather glitchy like in most games with the hand kind of floating above the object. No! In great detail, even the way Max Payne holds guns, puts his gun in his holster, it's very accurate and doesn't just leave any detail out! When you have a pistol and a rifle, he may put the pistol in his holster and hold the rifle, or hold the pistol in one hand carry the rifle in the other. It doesn't just disappear or magically appear from his pocket like most games! Small detail is what makes Max Panye 3 great.But keep in mind, this is a very mature game! Not only is the story rather detailed and has some twists to it, as well as some very brutal moments, this game does not shy up when it comes to gore and such! Bullets fly in slow motion and show them hit someone in the face with all the blood pouring out, during melees you will brutally smash them back before sending a bullet into them.But overall, this game is great. The game lasts 10-12 hours, but there are challenging arcade modes too. The multiplayer.. Is not so great. It's your average run and gun. It has some cool singleplayer features in it like bullet dodging, but overall it's stale point and shoot. Get this game for the excellent singleplayer, not multiplayer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Peter","summary":"The Only PC Game That Made Me Jump Out of My Seat!","reviewText":"Not a fan of the horror genre, I've never read Clive Barker's books but I have to tell you that Undying gave me the same spooky feeling I had when I was a kid watching midnight horror movies. To fans of the horror scene, Cliver Barker is considered a &quot;master of the macabre&quot; and I'd say that the programmers of this game couldn't have given the author a better conversion to the PC.From the great music and sound effects that set the mood to the constantly changing murky or gloomy settings, this game has an atmosphere to it that I haven't seen with many PC games. Even the gameplay has elements of fright. An example is the (grim reaper's) scythe as a weapon and the magic ability to foresee the future that turns everyday objects into bloody projections.It seems that not many FPS (first-person shooter) games come up with original concepts these days but Undying has managed to invent a new concept for first-person shooters.  Even better, the abilities of the character are configured in a control system that makes perfect sense.  If you own a mouse with a scroll and more than 2 buttons, you won't need to use the keyboard much.If you don't enjoy FPS games, you might want to give this one a try.  A demo is available on various websites that you will give you a feel for the game.  I hadn't given first-person shooters much attention in the last few years but Undying renewed my interest for these types of games.  Duke Nuke 'Em, Rainbow 6, The Operative, Quake - some of the first-person shooters that set precedents for the market and I'd add Clive Barker's Undying on the same list. The entire horror concept of this game deserves mention as it does one of the best jobs in PC gaming history of projecting it to the audience.Some of the negatives include: 1) no online multiplayer mode provided, 2) the game can be completed perhaps too quickly if you don't adjust it to a difficult level, and 3) while the horror scene impresses the heck out of you at the beginning it dies down near the end of the game.(Disclaimer - The game says that the following 16MB video cards are not suggested for this game: 3dfx Voodoo BANSHEE cards, PowerVR Neon 250 cards, S3 Savage 2000 cards, SC Savage 4 cards, SIS 300 cards)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2001"}

If you played Tales of Vesperia before, you would even feel frustrated, because you have to constantly change characters and familiars, and you have to select commands from menus.(2) The characters.  Maybe it is just me.  I don't really like little kids drawn in Ni No Kuni's graphic style.(3) The sprites look too small on the field map.(4) The familiar growth system.

The plot is pretty good, and told quite well through flashback cinemas, and present time ones, too.  But the story isn't where it's at with this game, oh no, this game is all about the killin'.  And trust me, you'll be doin' lots of it, in the coolest ways possible.  Ripping people's heads off, tearing them in half, breaking their backs, gouging their eyes out, ramming your Blades of Chaos down their gullets...the list goes on and on.The graphics in God of War are flat out amazing.  from the highly details character models (even the regular enemies look amazing), to the awe-inspiring backgrounds that are almost always filled with fighting and some type of storm (sand, rain, lots of buildings on fire), and the first time you see Ares just marchin' around town (and you being about the size of one of his huge hands), you will crap yourself.  you obtain different god powers throughout your quest of vengeance (and sadism...), such as Medusa's Gaze, which temporarily petrifies enemies in a stone casing, Poseidon's Rage, which is a large electrical blast to surrounding foes, Artemis' Blade, a massive, razor-sharp weapon that helps you just plain smack the crap out of enemies, and there are others, but i won't ruin all the fun for everyone.  the bosses look amazing, too.  from the Hydra to Ares, you'll be half kicking ass, and half admiring the graphics with which you are doing so.the game isn't terribly hard, and i think i beat it in just under ten hours...i think.  i could be wrong.  that might sound relatively short, but trust me, it's just the right amount of time for a game like this.  Sure, the developers could have tacked on a bunch of half-assed side-quests or backtracking missions to lengthen your adventure, but then the game would just feel...i don't know...tainted, somehow.  like it was perfect, but then they had to get greedy and try to throw in some cheap crap to boost the number of hours it takes to complete the game.  i'm glad they didn't though, because as it is, the game is flat out amazing.  and you'll be playing it for a long time anyway, just for the action.  but anyway, when you beat it, you unlock a harder mode, which i haven't touched yet, and you also can unlock a ton of other goodies that will keep you playing, if you aren't already hooked on beating the pants off every enemy and trying to rack up a huge chain of hits while you do it.  I do like how the game flows, though.  There isn't really any traditional level design, everything just goes right from one stage to the next, with little to no loading time, which is always a plus.  but i don't even think an irritating loading time could harm this game's greatness.  it is by far the best game of the year, already, and will probably stand as one of the best action/adventure games of all time...until God of War II comes out, anyway....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2005"}

I played it for about 6 straight hours one night.  It honestly blows Gears 3 out of the water in my opinion. The basic story is that robotic augmentations have been made available for use by humans as sort of an accessory - to make you smarter or more easily able to influence another person's decisions or in physical terms, they can make you stronger or a faster runner,etc.  Our hero, Jensen, is almost murdered by a group that kidnaps one of the foremost augmentation scientists, who also happens to be his ex-girlfriend, along with several of her colleagues.  After the attempt on his life, Jensen, rather like the Six Million Dollar Man of 80's TV fame, gets an upgrade.  He has all the latest \"augs\" added not only to keep him alive but to make him more useful to his employer in finding out what happened to the kidnapped scientists.  There are also groups who protest the use of these upgrades as unethical and inhumane which adds even more depth to the overall plot of the game.  It's basically a quest or mission based game rather like Mass Effect.  You have a main mission and then story characters give you alternate missions to accomplish which net you extra credits or upgrades upon completion.  There are so many different facets to the gameplay that you never get bored.  You have action, stealth, puzzle solving (in the form of hacking computer nodes), finding alternate paths to reach your destination and talking to all manner of characters.  The graphics are amazing and quite varied from a Chinese slum to a New York city police station and even to a futuristic laboratory in the middle of the Arctic ocean.  There is one fight scene near the end of the game which involves Jensen fighting another \"aug\" human in a room of moving \"statues\" which was especially amazing.  I was completely blown away by the ingenuity and originality of the whole game.  My thing is playing a game that has a great story behind it and Deus Ex does that so very well.  This game is rated M for a reason. There is violence, language and even sexual themes so it's definitely not for everyone.  That said, however, I would highly recommend it to fans of Mass Effect, Borderlands and other similar titles.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2011"}

As cool as the rest of the system is, a battery life that tops out at 3 hours is a huge limitation for any portable. Fortunately, quite a few smart peripheral manufacturers have realized this, and this is one result. Note that this is a replacement battery, not a plug-in add-on like some other third party products. You remove the 3DS rear panel and original battery, and this pack takes the place of both. It's screwed on and doesn't stick in too well without being secured in this fashion, so you can't easily swap it out. Fortunately, it lasts long enough that you probably won't need to. The battery comes with extra screws and a mini screwdriver.Pro:Inexpensive.The rubberized surface is great; it actually makes the 3DS easier to hold.Lasts way longer than the lame original battery. While it still won't get the 3DS up to quite the same run time as the DS Lite, it's at least tolerable now.Seems to charge pretty quickly.Easy to install. Took all of half a minute.Con:As you can probably tell by looking at the pictures, the original 3DS charge dock won't work with this product. There's one sold by Nyko if you care that much for it.The added bulk might make the unit unable to fit in some cases or protectors. I use the pouch made by ICON and it fits, but is a bit tight.It does make the 3DS heavier. No way around that...This is the best current solution to the infamous 3DS battery life problem. I'd previously thought of buying extra stock batteries and swapping them out, but it's just too much of a hassle.On a side note, having seen the original battery it's no wonder it doesn't last long.

Malone","summary":"Can't recommend this one","reviewText":"First off: The Gamecube ports of RE2, RE3 and RE Code Veronica are not meant for vets who played them already on Playstation or Dreamcast. These are for newcomers to the series, Gamecube owners who started off with the REmake and RE0. Ignorant vets will be disappointed at the lack of new content.I became an RE fan in the spring of 1996 when the first game in the series was new. I loved it and I couldn't wait for the sequel. When RE2 was finally announced, many fans were disappointed that it had two entirely new characters instead of reusing the characters from the first game. The director explained that every RE game had to have new characters, because the previous characters had already been through their share of horrors and were now hardened by them. I agreed with him 100%. So later when RE3 was announced and Jill from RE1 was the main character, that seeded my disdain for the game. It disappointed me that the creator didn't have the balls to stick to his guns, because he was right. Later I came to accept the rehashing of previous characters in RE games, but this was the first one to do it, and it annoyed me.Eventually the game came out and I bought it. Another irking detail niggled me right out the gate; RE3 has no \"normal\" difficulty setting, which is what I always play my games on when given the choice. In this game, you have to choose between easy or hard. Easy is insultingly easy and hard is harder than I like. However, RE3 does have some great gameplay innovations such as the gunpowder based ammo creation system, and the defensive dodge move, which I really wished they'd put into all following games in the series. There are also several points where you have to choose between two possible actions, and the choice you make does have an effect on what happens next. The puzzles are fairly standard for an RE game.RE3 does nothing to further the storyline. It's a complete sidetrack. I've always personally considered Code Veronica to be the true sequel to RE2, and RE3 to be a 'gaiden' (sidestory). Recently it's come out that this is the official truth, and the only reason Code Veronica wasn't given the title RE3 was because of the business relationship (or perhaps even actual contractual obligations) between Capcom and Sony. In some cases I would argue that if the gameplay itself is good, the story doesn't matter. But the fact is, RE1 set up Umbrella as the ultimate evil jerks who needed to be taken out, and RE2 did precious little to bring us closer to that goal. By the end of RE3, you're in exactly the same place RE2 left you, no closer to taking down the bad guys. Code Veronica, on the other hand, does indeed finally take the fight directly to Umbrella. And while I'm on the subject, I really have to question the wisdom of having RE4 take place in a world where Umbrella has already been taken out completely. That's one pleasure that DEFINITELY should have been given to the player.To sum up: I'm an RE vet of eight years and I don't recommend RE3.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2004"}

For one thing, Allied Assault is the most realistic game ever created in terms of plot and storyline. Of course, it follows WWII and many important events during the war. For some, it may seem like a history lesson for the gaming world. In some ways, it is, but it also brings an enormous amount of enjoyment along with it. Who could not like playing the D-Day level over, and over, and over again, honestly? That is the most fun I have ever had while playing a PC game! That brings me to my next point, which is that the level design is incredible! On the D-Day mission, U-Boats flood the shoreline, gunfire flies everywhere, and soldiers are running along the beach, fighting for their life as explosions occur right on their tail. This is the most incredible portrayal of real life in any game, just like in MOH Frontline for consoles. The other levels are very fun, and some are quite hard, even on the easy setting, such as in the sniper level. They hide in homes and lean out of windows. You are being shot, and not knowing where it came from. That is another incredible feature of the game. The controls are very smooth, and although they follow the same basic scheme as all other FPSs, they are much easier because they flow better. For any Castle Wolfenstein junkies out there, yes, that game is fun and we all know it, but this game is much better. Who thought up the idea of zombie Nazis anyway? Probably a pothead or a very sick and violent person. Allied Assault is the best game in the MOH series, and while it may not have the flair of Frontline, it still is a must game to buy for FPS lovers, or any fan of action-packed gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00009ZVHU","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"A Playable Dream","reviewText":"Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was not a game I was looking foreward to. Like a lot of folks in this generation who grew up with video games, I had very fond memories of the original Prince of Persia for PC, an incredibly animated, original, and difficult title that wowed you with it's remarkably efficient simplicity. Even the Gameboy and SNES version were fantastic, all adhering to the similar formula but expounding on them just enough to be new without betraying the roots of the game.When the poor 3D version debuted for PC a few years back, nobody was really surprised that it was poor; from the earliest preview screens, the game reeked of a formulaic approach to try to &quot;update&quot; a game that had no need of updating. The result was, well, expected.When Sands of Time was announced, I barely let it register. Oh, great, I thought, another Prince of Persia game. Didn't they already try that? Why not just try updating Asteroids again? It would be cheaper to fail at that.Well, my foot's in my mouth pretty deep right now. Really deep, in fact.The new Prince of Persia is among the best games I have ever played in my life. It falls just a teeny bit short of legendary status - It's not quite the legendary, genre-defining stuff of Mario 3 or Half-Life - but it's very, very close, and it easily ranks as my favorite game out right now.What sets this game apart is apparent from the instant you start playing it. Gone is the feeling that this is a rehash - everything is new while maintaining the spirit of the original games, from the Prince's ninja-like acrobatics to the music to the storyline. It all comes down to this, possibly the highest compliment I can pay this game:If the original Prince of Persia had been made in 2003, this would be it.It's obvious that the developers had an excellent idea of what the player will find fun, as opposed to what they think the player will find fun - a huge difference. It boils down to a confidence issue concerning the programming team. Do we go with what people are expecting, or do we take the chance to make our own thing and see if people will accept that? It's not easy to go the latter route - see Sega's Gunvalkyrie for an example of what NOT to do when trying your own thing. Innovation is key, but it has to be something that will make you actually want to play the game, not make you want to play something else.Speaking of controls, this game controls like magic, with ultra-responsive and quite forgiving moves that interpret what the player is trying to do without requiring absolute precision, a Godsend in 3D games like this. This carries over from the acrobatics involved in the game to the excellent combat engine, both of which are integral to the experience.Most of the game has the player navigating one trap-filled room to find the next - strong shades of Sony's ICO here, which should be seen as a good thing - and at various points the player becomes involved in a pitched battle against a set number of spawning enemies - ICO again - which he must defeat to move on. What's remarkable is how cohesive everthing is. There's no feeling of disjointed challenges being thrown at the player, but rather the impression that all this stuff really is the same castle, and could, if you squint, be believable. The game has it's own logic that it adheres to, which really is the mark of a game that's been developed properly.In addition, the design team made an interesting choice concerning the difficulty. Instead of making the game seriously hard, they make it &quot;tricky&quot;. It's not an easy game, but it still makes sense as to what to do, and it's this key element that determines the difference between &quot;frustrating&quot; and &quot;challenging.&quot; In other words, if the sole reason the game is difficult is because the game makes it hard for the player to do what they want (again, see Gunvalkyrie) then the fun of the game is lost, and the challenge becomes irritating as opposed to engaging. In Prince of Persia, the controls are so fluid that you always feel fully in control, and any screw-ups are your own fault, not because something didn't work like it was supposed to.This concept, which seems so difficult to nail down, is present here in perfect display. The only game I know of that is a better example of this is Treasure's Ikaruga, a masterpeice in it's own right.If it seems like I'm making a lot of comparisons, there's a reason. Prince of Persia can be looked at like a Quentin Tarantino movie in a way. It takes lots of elements from other works in the medium and mashes them all together, but in the process actually improves upon them and makes something unique. If I were to break the new Prince into it's components, it might look something like this:Take 2 parts Ico, 1 part Soul Reaver, add a touch of Blix, bake it in the Splinter Cell engine until perfect and voila! Sands of Time, unlike anything you've ever had before.Don't miss this game, whatever you do.(As an aside, this review is for the Xbox version, but word from the front is that the differences between versions are slight; for the record, the Gamecube version, surprisingly, has the best graphics, the Xbox version has the best load times and comes with the full version of the Prince of Persia 2 PC game, and the PS2 version is the one you get if you don't have either of the other two consoles - the game was designed to run on the PS2, so it's not like you'll be missing much. Any way you go, you're in good hands, so it boils down to a matter of convenience.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2003"}

Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility.  And in my opinion, the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games (kazooie & tooie) on Nintendo 64.  Kazooie, to me, defines the N64 3-D platformer.  While many will say Mario 64, which is a near perfect game.  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was.  Back in '98 rare was on a roll.  This game was yet another grandslam.  A brand new franchise, cut from scratch.  And it's absolutely amazing.  I won't go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear.  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late 90's.  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately.  My only question is WHAT the **** happened to rare?!!  They were so amazing with Nintendo, then dropped bomb after bomb for the X-Box consoles.  I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there.  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles.  The 1998 game will always be the best.  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous \"Banjo Threeie\" to life on any console!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Anthony J Sasso","summary":"As good as the first, but more realized.","reviewText":"Amazing game. That's the easiest and most accurate way to put it. Out of all my friends, I was the first to get HL2 and beat it.  Having played all the way through, I must say this is one of the most amazing FPS ever created. When the Doom 3 hype storm hit last summer, I was at the fore-front of the salivating D3 mob.  But as we all know, Doom 3 fell on its face.  Half life 2 rode in on a similar hype tide, but delivers in every way imaginable. This is the game of the year.  Bar none.  Having played a lot of FPS, I'm a pretty harsh judge when it comes to rating a game's overall playability.  But with Half life 2, there is no need to second guess or make excuses. - This game is as good as it gets.You resume the roll of Gordon Freeman; our beloved crowbar wielding warrior scientist.  HL2 continues the story of its predecessor, but in much better scope and detail as Valve's vision is fully realized with modern graphics and superb gameplay.  The graphics in this game are breathtaking.  Despite the Source engine's noticeably detrimental 'stutter,' Half life 2 is flawless in presentation.  And also, the real world physics in HL2 are unprecedented.  The actual gameplay, from solving puzzles to killing Combine forces, revolves very much around the realistic physical world that Valve has created here. And also, you get a nice long fulfilling story for your buck.  Unlike the premature endings of supposed breakthrough shooters like Halo 2, Half life 2 plays its story out to its fullest. - Making this sequel's wait well warranted.Half life 2 advances the HL universe with its awesome, thought churning storyline.  Many of the foggier parts of the first game come into focus here, and the HL franchise is set up for many more satisfying sequels.  When it comes to negative things to say about HL2, I'm kinda at a loss.  HL2 will meet your every expectation and surpass it.  This game is indeed forerunning any of the great FPS to come.  Half life 2 has set a new bar for FPSs to reach.  With a great story, superb gameplay, unprecedented realism in graphics, and all around FPS fun, HL2 has claimed a place at the top of all FPS titles. This is a game that should not be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Hard to believe it is a game! *Read this review for INFO*","reviewText":"There was nothing new much in the Half-Life game engine which was essentially just a modern hack of the Quake game engine, so how could a game that based itself on software that others developed succeed in becoming the biggest selling game of all time? When Half-Life first came out it did a couple of things right that most other first person shooters failed to do at the time. (1)Story, (2)Story, (3)Story. Valve created Half-Life in a period of our lives when Area 51 was a hot topic among UFO researchers and the X-Files was beginning to become mainstream viewing. Alien based entertainment media was then a craze in the mid and late 1990's that was unprecedented since the 1950s. Smack in the middle of what could be considered the most influential era for UFO enthusiasts came HALF-LIFE where YOU get to play as Gordon Freeman, a physics researchers who witnesses a freak accident in an Area 51 type facility. All hell breaks loose and YOU have to survive. No cut scenes. No initial story. No explanation. You where just there and you had to escape. Cue interactive characters that could follow you around, say a few things and shoot monsters - maps rich in objects that you could break.The GOOD NEWS is that Half-Life 2 is another world beyond HL1 and is like nothing you have ever played before! This IS the first person shooter 'Game of games', hands down, period. As a stand alone game, HL2 is 100% pure adrenaline, no holds bard, from start to finish. If you own a PC then own HL2 because the world will never be the same again. Half-Life 2 WILL destroy lives, educations and marriages and......IT IS NOT A GAME!... or at least that is the net result. This thing was real. Forget Doom 3, FarCry or any of the best pixel pushers out there - HL2 just mashes `em into the ground and then sets off an amazing fireworks display to welcome you back. How many games within the first two levels have you literally calling friends, family and neighbours to have a look at it? You must LIVE this game.Okay so at 9:02 I unlocked HL2 and got playing. I have simply not stopped except to write this. Maybe Farcry has the edge on jungle texture, but nowhere else will you see anything as amazing as City 17. The game starts right where the previous one left off, as you are dumped into this futuristic eastern European city like something out of 1984 following a brief meeting with the GMAN. 100% Orwell. Basically you learn that citizens are slowly going missing from City 17 and you must meet up with old friends (scientists from the first game including security guard Barney) and as soon as your teleporter goes wonky you are landed right in on the action as soldiers storm apartments looking for you. On the run you manage to land a hovercraft and go on to tear through flood channels ramping over things and seeing full scale battlecraft fly overhead... and when you hit them, bits break off and explode... slowly... so you give `em more heat... and more bits break off... and then they crash and burn with a roaaaaarrr! The gem of the game though is when you play with DOG (wait till you see this thing) and learn a neat trick with a new weapon called the Gravity gun. Now this thing is unreal because you can lift anything and send it flying in the direction of some bad guy. Not to spoil to fun but let a few disc saws whirl and watch what happens to the bad guys or even throw a petrol canister into a group of zombies and hear them scream. The animation is hyper-realistic and your fps will match your heartbeat. This is THE REAL DEAL.The characters all have their own unique personality and walk, talk and act differently. The cut scenes all look great and are done in 1st person as you walk around the event. Like its predecessor, each level is designed with plenty of tasks to do, puzzles to solve and bad guys to mow down. There is also team play in this one like in HL1 but is more organized with much more firepower. Anyway I will not spoil the story for you (basically join the resistance in City 17 and win the war) but like I said if you have a thing for 1984, conspiracy theory or the New World Order, then HL2 has it all! HL2 also borrows HUGELY from other games and films you have seen, but that just makes it all the better because it seems somewhat familiar, yet ABSOLUTELY NEW.The bottom line is that is, hands down, the best 1st person shooter probably for the next 4 years or so. I seriously doubt anything, ANYTHING, in the next 24 months is going to be patch on this experience.Pros:- It does not feel like a game. It feels real.- Totally immersion in a film-like environment.- Truly massive maps with PLENTY to do.- Action, action, action, non-stop.- Lots and lots of variation in the gameplay.- GRAVITY GUN!- A real interesting futuristic story- The best 1st person shooter (maybe game) ever.- Counter-Strike: Source comes with it.Cons:(Benchmark on a 3ghz P4, 1GB RAM, RADEON 9800Pro 256mb)- Sometimes you will wait more than 60 seconds between load times.- Most load times are greater than 15 seconds.- Even a high-end machine gets challenged by this game.- Valve and Vivendi really botched the marketing but that aside HL2 is EVERYTHING YOU COULD EXPECT AND A LOT LOT MORE.NOTE : You need an internet connection to validate it. You need to download and install STEAM to do this. IT IS FREE apart from the internet costs. The GAME was not pirated before release! It worked!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2004"}
{"product_name":"B008GFZV6Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Kirby's Escapades","reviewText":"It is hard to believe that it has been 20 years since Nintendo first unveiled Kirby for the original Game Boy with Kirby's Dream Land. The game then definitely welcomed a unsung hero and fun character for Nintendo to play with that ranks among the highs of the Mario games and The Legend Of Zelda series. While so many people haven't given Kirby the credit, the games have withstood the test of time, and because of the cuteness that Kirby has shown since his debut in 1992 on the original Game Boy. While the games haven't been as well known unlike recent titles like Kirby's Epic Yarn and Return To Dream Land for the Nintendo Wii, it definitely is fun to take a look back at one of Nintendo's unsung characters that love it and hate it has had some really entertaining games that are worth trying out all over again.Kirby's Dream Collection for the Nintendo Wii takes a look back at 20 years of the fun loving and adorable puff that could eat anything his foes throw at him. The game includes 6 previous titles from Nintendo's past from the original NES, the Game Boy as well as the Nintendo 64 with Kirby. It definitely is a great thrill reliving the games Kirby's Dream Land, Kirby's Adventure and Kirby 64, which may not have been well known as much for their systems when they came out at the time. But they are definitely are worth taking another look at. The graphics are nicely remastered from the classic games, yet I do honestly wish though they could've put the colored graphics for the Nintendo Game Boy games in the game compilation, considering they were re-designed for the Nintendo Game Boy Color in the 90's. Nevertheless, like Super Mario All-Stars when it was re-released awhile ago for the Nintendo Wii there is also a soundtrack and booklet as well featuring Kirby's history as well in music and games. The control remains just as tight and simple in the original games and with the new challenge games for those who've mastered Kirby's Return To Dream Land and Kirby's Epic Yarn for the Wii are fun to play and offer a bit of challenge to the game for die hard Kirby gamers. Nevertheless, there could've been a bit more though in some of the alternative games as well that could've been added like Kirby's Pinball Land and Kirby's Block Ball from the Game Boy era.All in all, I do think it is surprising they have made a Kirby compilation for the Nintendo Wii. But nevertheless, Kirby's Dream Collection actually fairs as a good buy for die hard Nintendo fans, but overall many will consider passing this one up and anxiously await for the Nintendo Wii U to come out soon. I do like the game, because I myself, like so many haven't played many of these games before from the original days they came out on their respected Nintendo systems. The compilation is a great buy in the final days of the original Nintendo Wii, and will definitely give Kirby a new look now that he has been one standout in fun games.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B-Overall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}

The demo was fun, but nothing in it really \"wowed\" me to the point that I wanted to purchase the game. However, after playing several demos including \"End War\", \"Fracture\" and \"Resistance: Fall of Man\" I decided that Haze was the funnest and was the most visually appealing of them, and the price was right so I decided to pick it up. After reading a lot of negative & mediocre reviews of the game on Amazon and other places, I had pretty low expectations heading into game-play. But I was nothing but pleasantly surprised with this game! This is a diamond in the rough in my opinion.(**spoiler alert**)The single player campaign was about 10 hours of play time for me, though I think you could probably finish the game in about half that time. Though others I think thought the \"nectar\" idea was gimmicky I personally found it interesting & compelling. I like the story concept of futuristic corporate America having a privatized military, and I suspect some of the negative criticisms surrounding the game might be disappointment that in this game \"Mantel\" (corporate America) is not the good guys! This was a Japanese made game and I'm sure this wasn't lost on some reviewers that didn't like that story angle, particularly as America is involved in wars in Iraq & Afghanistan at the time of this game's release. Of course there is the other factor that this game was supposed to be released on Xbox as well, but became a PS3 exclusive. Some reviews I read talked about how glitchy this game was, which I find ironic as I didn't notice ANY significant glitches during game-play, which is typical of a Japanese made game. However, there was an update to the software, so perhaps there were some glitches previously, though in the version I played, it was glitch free.The opening music score at the start-up screen is cool, and I thought I recognized one of the tracks during early game-play as being very similar to a track from SOCOM: Confrontation! But otherwise the sound track is lacking in impressiveness and sometimes the audio/sound effects does seem a bit off, like you hear an explosion well after the grenade goes off, the sound effects for some of the vehicles seems odd as well. For example, in one stage you are driving a dune buggy on a beach, when you turn sharply the dune buggy will make tire screeching noises. On a beach?! But it's a minor criticism of course. Many reviewers talked about the cheesy dialogue. The dialogue in the demo (which is the start of the game) was very bad, but it gets better as the game goes along, which leads me to believe that a lot of people on here reviewed the demo, and didn't actually play the game. However, I have to agree that the voice acting for the main character, Shane Carpenter, was really winy & annoying! But the game-play is so fun, you just tune it out!One of the coolest parts of the game is during the plot twist and you join \"the enemy\" forces, you get to kill your former teammates. This was awesome considering how annoying those fools were in the 1st half of the game! The nectar grenades that you use against Mantel forces are also pretty sweet! The choice of weapons is typical with the addition of a flame thrower which was also pretty cool. I was disappointed with the melee attacks, however. On the plus side, the AI works very well - your teammates actually kill people for you!Another high point of the game are the mechanics. Everything works well! The drive mechanics on the vehicles is very good, the shooting mechanics are good, action keys are presented well, everything works flawlessly! Graphics I found to be good on most stages though not particularly striking in any way, but certainly they are above average. There isn't a lot of detail per say, but the use of colors and vividness is well done in many environments.Overall, this was a fun game to play, it's clean & mechanically sound. Some improvements to the voice work & dialogue as well as polishing up the graphics & audio would have made this a VERY impressive game.Final grade: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2010"}

Having enjoyed and still continue to enjoy Call of Duty Black Ops II and Black Ops, I was looking for the next step for the Call of Duty type of online multiplayer.What really reeks in this game is the fact that the bots (non-human controlled players) are easy to take out. It is like having them handed to you on a platter. It's like going fishing but the fish have all been caught for you and placed in a small pool for you to fish in). Then there are the other players that play oblivious of their full capabilities.Don't get me wrong, it can sometimes be fun for short spurts as you execute moves and work with your team. It can be downright sad, too, to watch and hear as you take down the big behemoths. The roaring sound may give some satisfaction but for me it was sad to watch as these big mechanical monsters go down. After all, you, too get to commandeer a machine to do your bidding. You can set it to protect an area as you do your own thing or you can be in control of it. That aspect of the game was fun.This game is not meant to be played in a long time span. This is, after all, an online multiplayer through and through. It just sorely lacks a single player campaign to flesh out the story and give you a good background and feel for the story. It is kind of disturbing to me that given the time that the producers had that they could not come up with a single player campaign. I had read that the staffing for this production was smaller than a typical blockbuster production. And it shows. It is disturbing to think that this could be a trend for producing half games for full price. This is definitely NOT a killer app that some professional reviewers have anointed it to be. And it just confirms to me what others who have both systems, the Xbox One and PS4, have told me. The Xbox One is not all that it is cracked up to be. I think that I will be sticking with PS4 games in the future. I feel ripped off by this half game being packaged as a full game.Pros:1. Nice graphics2. Great controls3. AI for Titans are good4. Parkour5. Constant actionCons:1. Only half a game2. AI for bots are bad3. No single player campaign to flesh out a story4. Full price for a game that should be added to a full campaign5. Getting on a game can be a chore when linking up with Xbox Live6. Gets old after doing the same thing over and over againAll in all, I would give this game a C minus. Had they included a 15-hour long single player, this game might have been the game to take the Call of Duty idea to the next level. It does feel next-gen. It just does not feel like a must-have game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

Immediately, drawing the player in is the stunning visuals.  It kind of reminds me of some Philadelphia neighborhoods except minus the trash and it has that beauty of rustic environments and also each scenary is a visual delight.  There is also some cool sexy alone time of Madison and Ethan definitely rated M.  Once again kudos to the graphics.  Now that we got the perfect HD visuals out the way is the game play and storyline.  The audio is superb in music, ambience and also voice of the characters.There are about 52 Chapters (currently on Chap. 34).  Each chapter is a masterpiece of suspense and leading up to clues and development.  All I can say is each chapter makes you come back for the next.  The gameplay is sometimes frustrating because you're not sure if you should shake the controller or wiggle left or right.  But it does leads to some intense suspense (especially when you're tied up &lt;wink>).Overall, I would highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"Chitown Lurker","summary":"(Almost) Everything I Expected","reviewText":"I won't spend much time getting into the gameplay of this title. If you've played Demon's Souls or Dark Souls, you know what to expect here. If you haven't, go read the reviews of either of those other games and you'll get a great idea of what this game is like. The fundamental gameplay and atmosphere is the same. Same you-do-something-stupid-and-you-die experience, same hilarious lack of a pause button even when you're offline, same sense that the game is secretly laughing at your misfortune.Instead I'll focus on the differences. This one has crisper graphics, there is a max health penalty each time you die hollow (I laugh every time I think about that), and perhaps most importantly: the online matchmaking which was so inexplicably painful and awkward in Dark Souls is fixed. No more waiting for 10 minutes to finally join someone's game, or worse, waiting all that time just to find out it failed. Everything is much faster now, and more often than not if there's a connection failure you'll know within seconds. Not only is it back on par with how smoothly everything worked in Demon's Souls, it's even better. I've had zero problems summoning/being summoned by other players so far. Knock on wood...One other big change: there is now a menu option to enable voice chat. I haven't tried it as I feel that chat kind of kills the intended solitary atmosphere of the game. Players who invade or summon are supposed to be an extension of the game's environment. I feel that having voice chat was a bit of a cop-out by the designers. In any event, I left it off, so I can't speak to whether or not it works well.There are of course other differences...new covenants, new effects, etc...but it's best to figure that stuff out on your own. Major bit of advice: don't look at strategy guides online or otherwise. Half the fun of these games is getting lost in them and figuring the mysteries out on your own.EDIT: I am docking this game 1 star. Why, you ask? Because while the graphics are sharper for the main character and in some areas, they are noticeably muddier than this game's predecessors in some other areas as I progress through the game. Further, I'm noticing a troubling trend of somewhat unimaginative/lazy map design in places, that remind me of some of the lesser Dark Souls 1 maps...only this issue seems more common this time around. I've seen way too many completely barren, empty rooms with no purpose to them...nothing to even look at. Other rooms look like the designers just quickly dropped a bunch of objects (often of the same type) in them haphazardly and called it a day. Finally, at some point between the day I bought it and the last few days, they made some change on the servers so that you no longer regain humanity for assisting other players with bosses...a decision I find incomprehensible. It's still a fantastic game and better than so much else out there...but standards are high for this series. Pardon the pun, but this game is missing a little bit of the soul of the originals.EDIT 2: They fixed the humanity issue, so you now regain it consistently after successfully assisting with a boss. So, half a star back..which rounds us back up to 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Some tedious missions, but so worth the purchase for the amazing story","reviewText":"I was really looking forward to plaything through this game since I like the Roxas character. We learn a lot about the year that was lost between Chain of Memories and 2, while giving us a story that is both awesome and really sad at the same time.Story:The story progresses through the 358 days, getting snippets of the major plot along the way. It's focused on the events that happen after Chain of Memories mostly, with Axel, Roxas and Xion as the main characters. We get to learn a ton about these characters throughout the story, while making you want their story to last and not the investable conclusion that's speeding up on them.Along with the major plot, we get to see what happens on some of the worlds you visited in the year lapse that you don't get to visit them. It also fits right into cannon; due to the fact the Organization works in the shadows and is not seen. Roxas also keeps a diary throughout the game which gives you insight into the mind of him.Gameplay:The way your character levels up is like any other game in regards to earning experience, but when you level you actually have to set up that level in one of the limited panels you get (Later in the game you get double/triple your level in giant panel sections). Skills, key-blades, magic, items along with levels have to all be set up in a tetris/grid like fashion.The amount of magic you set in the grids gives you that many charges you can use per missions (i.e. 4 fire's and 3 cure's set up into the grid gives you that many casts for each mission you go on, and RTC'ing recharges the magic). Blocking, rolling, dashing etc are use sets as well, but you can use those unlimited on the missions you partake.Throughout the game you rank up, and with higher ranks you can buy more items with Heart points you earn (Killing Heartless mobs and bosses gives you this), and better items to synthesis. All the monsters drop items you can use to make spells, potions, Key-Blades, rings, and so much more. This is all done through the moogle shop you unlock after a few days, and the shop menu in the multiplayer menu. Munny is just used with synthesis and I found I had an overabundance of it throughout the game, and didn't need to sell anything.Singleplayer:The game has a single player story mode that is multiple sets of missions during 358 days. Most of the those missions have medals that you collect for the Challenge mode (Single player only) and mission mode (Multiplayer) to unlock the mission your on for those specific modes. You can also find a bunch of treasure chests in most of the missions, and you can get a ton of items towards the end of the game.The missions are mostly fun, while some are grindy. The ones that could get tedious are just set up as side-missions, so if you don't like killing X enemy over and over you can skip those (though you may need the exp). The story missions are pretty cool, and you get to play though a lot of familiar locations. When day's progress sometimes the members have you do minor things (like get all treasure in X mission) that either rewards you with an item or another mission.Challenge missions are harder versions of the missions you do, and can range from killing everything to speed-running the level. Completing the missions earns you up to 3 signets per mission which is used to earn rewards like slot panels to really powerful spell/key-blades.Multiplayer:This is sort-of like the challenge mode section, where you play harder versions of missions you have completed so far, but you can use any of the Organization 13 members to do them with. The gear slots you use (Which are key-blades for Roxas) actually change their weapon looks and will give each member a different amount magic and strength for each one. You also unlock more people to use later on in the story as well.I only played the Solo version of it, since its only local multiplayer (no wi-fi version) and the missions are the same difficulty as the multiplayer version of it, and you can't use AI partners. While the AI team-mates make Shiva look smart, I still would have liked to have them instead of no one. Just like challenge missions, you earn crown medals (Multiplayer only medals) that can be redeemed for more slots, random items, or powerful spells/Key-blades.Soundtrack:The sound track has the same tracks of the worlds in the other Kingdom Hearts games, but they are all Midi files. I can understand why they did this (DS cards don't have much space on them) and it is a bit distracting at first, but you get used to it. The soundtrack still sounds great, even in Midi form and I love hearing the main theme again in important scenes.Only a few scenes have voiced over dialogue (The really important ones), while the rest of the game has text boxes for the scenes. Again I can understand this due to the DS cartridge size and I didn't mind reading the text boxes that much. All the characters have battles grunts, which add to the battles. All the spells/attacks sound just fine and didn't notice the lack of quality with them being Midi files.Graphics:For being a DS game, the graphics are pretty well made. Some parts are a bit pixilated, but I never really noticed it. The important scenes have black bars at the top and bottom in a widescreen fashion and it looks pretty nice on the DS. Movies are not split up on the top and bottom screen so you won't have half of the scene on each screen (Stuff still plays on the bottom, but it's a separate scene).The weapons and spells look really nice, and the animations of them are really cool on the DS screen. The action and exploring takes place on the top screen, while the map and the objectives show on the bottom screen.Verdict:I really enjoyed the story of this game and I have always liked Roxas as a character, so being able to finally get the back story on him was pretty awesome. The gameplay was pretty fun, but it did get tedious at times when you have the same mission type for the 20th time. I say definitely buy this game if you have a DS (If you don't you should pick up a 3DS to play KH: Dream Drop Distance) for the story, and I'm around 35 hours and I still have a ton of challenges and missions left to do, so it has tons of lasting value.~ Written: 04-12Positive:* Awesome story that fills in the giant gap in-between Chain of Memories  and Kingdom Hearts 2* Doing missions with all the organization 13 members* Extremely fast load times* Top and bottom screen is set up well with action being on the top, and map on the bottomNegative:* Some tedious missions* Teammate's AI is pretty bad at times* Multiplayer is local only","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","summary":"A redesigned system that everyone has grown to love","reviewText":"The Good: Slim design, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Blu-Ray, great menu, works fully with the PSP, plays PS1 games, backing up saves is a life saver, true 1080p supportThe Bad: No PS2 emulation, no memory card slotsThe first thing you will notice when you open the white box is how light and compact the console is. Being heavier than the Wii, but lighter than the Xbox it is completely square and just slightly rounded in the middle. The back actually reminded of the ridging from the fat PS2, so for nostalgia's sake it made me smile. The console now has a smooth matte finish instead of the horrible gloss sheen that welcomes fingerprints. Gone is the horrible Spider-Man font, but replaced with the original PlayStation font, and a simple PS3 engraved right on the front. Gone is the horrible fully spelled out name and the huge dome that made it look like a George Foreman grill.Now since I have seen the older PS3 for so long then comparing it to the new one I was disappointed in hardware features. If anyone remembers the revealing of the PS3 at E3 in '05 they promised 6 USB ports, 3 ethernet connections so it could be used as a router, two HDMI ports, and the external memory slot, plus PS2/PS1 backwards compatibility, yet the final console hardly offered half of this. Now 3 years later the console is stripped of almost all those features. Sporting only two USB slots, one HDMI port, no PS2 emulation, and no external media storage it makes you really wish you got more bang for your buck. Aesthetically the console has improved, but in terms of holes to plug stuff into it is lacking. It does, however, have a regular power cable with surprisingly no brick, and consumes less power thanks to its 45 nanometer processor compared to the older model's 90 nanometer processor. The RSX graphics chip has been upgraded to consume less power and process better with less lag.Once you get the thing hooked up the console has impressively placed the power and eject buttons right there below the disc slot (no tray like the Xbox thank god). The console's controller is reminiscent of the classic PlayStation controller we have grown to love, but with some additional features: It's lighter than either of the Xbox or Wii controllers with Six Axis motion sensing, wireless Bluetooth, a mini USB slot, and R2 and L2 are now triggers. All of this was added with subtracting weight, and keeping the classic feel. Good job Sony you know how to do controllers right! It feels great in your hands, but people who like the heavy weight of the Xbox or Wii controllers may nay say.When you boot the console up you are greeted with something familiar: An XMB. PSP users will recognize this right away, and I feel this was a smart move on Sony so all of their devices have similar menus without confusing consumers. However once you get a lot of stuff on your HDD the XMB becomes cluttered and doesn't have that nice organized feeling like the Xbox has. I will admit that the PS3 is the least user friendly console on the market, and this is clear by the dozens upon dozens of settings. There are settings for setting everything including hooking up a printer! The PS3 seems more HD ready than any of the other two consoles with its Blu-Ray drive and the onslaught of HD settings. You can have the PS3 prioritize for what cable you are using for audio and video, dozens of other misc settings for everything and I love this control. Hooking up to the internet is easy compared to the PS2 since it is the only other console besides the Wii that connects wirelessly without external adapters.While the PSN store isn't as streamlined as the Xbox LIVE Marketplace is does react to commands faster and load times between pages are quicker. It is the nicest and flashiest looking marketplace of the three consoles, so it makes online shoppers feel right at home like you are on a website. Downloading and purchasing items is another nightmare since you can only do increments of money that is added to your \"wallet\". Downloading games is a real hassle since you have to add the item to your cart, then checkout, then download the item, then install it. Yeah install it? Seriously? This isn't a computer so why do you have to install it? The install time also takes forever especially for games over 1GB so switch to regular TV for awhile or get on the computer. Now you can download in the background, but you can't download while in sleep mode like the Xbox which is a real disappointment which means leaving the console on. You can download while playing games, and while in remote play so this sort of makes up for it, but you can't download while watching Blu-Ray movies...real weird I know.Let's talk about something real important here: Backups. Sony is the only company that has even thought of this idea and Microsoft is the worst with all the registering consoles and profiles connected to saves and content and whatnot. The Wii's items can be backed up to an SD card, but the PS3 actually lets you put your stuff on anything! Speaking of the HDD Sony has added a feature that Microsoft still won't do and that is being able to copy anything from your computer to your PS3 HDD. Amazing isn't it? Yeah, it's like a damn angel is so sweet.Let's talk remote play. What is this? Well it allows you to connect to your PS3 wirelessly to your PSP either directly or over the internet. Yeah, this really shows how dedicated Nintendo is to the DS. You can actually go to a Wi-FI spot in Amsterdam and connect to your PS3 from your house, and this includes the store, web browser, and crap on your computer. The biggest downside, and the biggest request, is being able to play PS3 games from your PSP and vice versa. Currently Lair is the only game that does this, but Sony said they would look into implanting this permanently. Another downside would be the fact that you can't play PSP games on the PS3, but you can download them and transfer them remotely, yeah sort of retarded.Well, what about the games? I purchased my chunk of glory for the exclusives mainly such as Heavenly Sword, Killzone 2, Resistance, Ratchet & Clank, Metal Gear Solid, Uncharted, and many more franchises. From just popping in that disc to startup the console is silent. You barely hear a whistle and is almost as quiet as the Wii if not quieter unlike the Xbox which has that God awful tray that slides and clanks, and you can hear the laser clicking and the disc spinning up and down, and the processor fans kicking in. It sounds like you're in the cockpit of a jet!I know I talked about the controller, but man does it feel good in your hands! A tad small, but it feels right. The Sixaxis motion sensing is responsive and is just enough motion sensing to not feel like a complete gimmick *cough Wii cough*, but enough to add to game play, and just enough to draw you in more, but still have a traditional controller in your hand. I think Sony had the best controller layout, and you don't even need a retarded sensor bar!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I just love the atmosphere and the world this game creates- the way they use rain for example, is just very cool.

It tells a tale that is so epic, moving, and mind-bending that from a narrative perspective, it puts almost every other game this generation to shame.  It's a game that is bursting at the seams with heart.  It tells a tale of a father and daughter living together in a dying version of Earth, 1300 years in the future.  The daughter is ill with a mysterious sickness, and the father heads out on an epic quest into find a cure.  Every detail of this tale, from the small, personal stories of the characters you meet along the way, to the perseverance of the desperate father, all the way to the jaw-dropping truths of what is really happening in the world, will grab hold of your consciousness and make sure that this is something that you'll always remember.  For those of you gamers who loved the memorable and emotional stories of the classic Square games of days past, you'll feel right at home here, thrust into the middle of one of the best stories that the medium of video games has ever produced.The flipside to all this, unfortunately, is that this grand story is supported by a game that only provides a mediocre gameplay experience.  The combat system, so critical to action RPGs like these, while serviceable, becomes repetitive too soon due to a lack of depth and controls that feel a tad bit archaic in the face of current generation action games.  Side quests, which thankfully are completely optional and not necessary to advance the plot forward, are repetitive, tedious, and not very much fun.  Enemy types are not greatly varied, adding to the overall \"sameness\" that can start to wear on the player as things progress and the same locations need to be revisited time and time again.  It's not bad at all, but just could have, and should have, been better.  Nier deserves better.There are redeeming qualities here though, apart from the story.  The arsenal of magic attacks you get are really fun and do help to break up the monotony of the melee-based combat to a degree.  The boss fights are huge and climactic.  A neat trick Nier successfully implements are changes in the style of gameplay that, while saying too much would give away too many fun secrets, completely change the genre of the game for several sequences throughout.  These are some of the most enjoyable parts of the experience and are quite a pleasant surprise when they come along.  And most of all is the absolutely perfect soundtrack.  Nier boasts the best soundtrack of any game released in the last decade.  Not only are the compositions absolutely incredible, but the way that they're altered in ways that reflect the goings-on on the screen is simply astounding.  Keiichi Okabe and his collaborators deserve all the praise that has been bestowed upon them for this work of genius.In the end, Nier isn't a game for everybody.  Your experience with the game will ultimately depend on whether you connect with the story and are willing to endure the somewhat average gameplay in order to see what happens next.  For me, there was no contest at all.  Nier sank its hooks into me immediately and even if the gameplay had been significantly worse than what it is, I would have still stayed for the ride, because to me, it was absolutely worth it.  I'm glad that Nier has become something of a cult classic, because it is one of those games that if it reaches the right gamer, it can really provide a wonderful experience that is really affecting.  If you're curious about this game, I encourage you to give it a try.  I held out for a long time, but I'm glad I finally gave in, as Nier ended up becoming one of the biggest, and best, surprises I've had as a gamer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001HB7K6I","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"Finally, a game for gamers who own a Wii","reviewText":"Let's get it out of the way; Muramasa: The Demon Blade is the game that finally made my purchase of the Wii worthwhile.Muramasa is in some ways similar to Super Metroid in that you progress around the game by moving from screen to screen, with enemy battles occuring randomly, as you move towards the act's boss. Many paths are locked, only becoming accessible after you defeated set bosses, leading to some level of back-and-forth (especially for the male character Kisuke). Enemy lairs can also be unlocked in the same way, allowing your character to fight in multi-stage battles against set enemies.All-in-all, this results in an linear path from boss to boss, as each act takes place, with the random battles and (typically) multiple paths to objectives adding in a good level of diversity. Normal enemies level with you, so outside of mastering combat, no battle will seem boring.Featuring two characters, each with their own story line and bosses, you can play the game from each character's perspective in any way you want, adding another layer of diversity to the game.The game also features a robust weapon crafting system, with a total of 108 weapons (all swords) that can be unlocked, but which feature level-based requirements. For those that don't want this experience, however, each boss unlocks a weapon (again, unique for each character), allowing players to switch to these new weapons as the game progresses.Typical to games of this genre, a leveling component increases character health, strength, and vitality, which impacts what blades you can equip.Based solely on my own gameplay, each character's story lasts around 9 hours, allowing for a fair amount of exploration and forging of new blades. For the most part, grinding for levels is unnecessary, especially considering that dying carries almost no penalty at all, during boss and lair fights.The post-game allows you to unlock the remaining blades, as a handful of these can only be acquired after you have beaten the game with each character. Additional, alternate, endings are also available, again for each character. In total, this resulted in over 25 hours of gameplay.The biggest draw of the game, coming up in almost any discussion, and which I've therefore left for the last, is the art and story style. The art of the game is simply beautiful, with the power of the Wii stretch to the breaking point. It would have been something to see this game on the Xbox 360 or Playstation 3, where areas would have loaded faster the pixel borders would have been near-invisible.The spoken language throughout the game is Japanese, with English subtitles, and no way to each either of these. While this may distract some, it leads to a much more 'real' experience.Overall, I must give this game a full 5 stars. There are few drawbacks to the game, with the only semi-semi-major ones being from what I believe to be hardware-related issues (the few second loading from screen to screen and the visibly square pixels), and the art, music, and forging element adding considerable value.I believe that the fast nature of battles (many standard battles will last seconds, while some boss battles may last dozens of minutes or more) allows for a very high level of replayability.If you consider yourself a gamer and your Wii has a coat of dust, go check out some gameplay videos. If it looks good, go buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00GG4BBUM","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Excels visually over PS3 version but introduces even longer loading times","reviewText":"MLB 14: The Show on the PlayStation 3 didn't end up being the complete product that was MLB 13. Not surprisingly the game received less than the typical publicity at the time since many were waiting on the PS4 version for this year with higher hopes considering the capabilities of the new system. While it has retained all the same features, promises were really never made that it would do anything more than improve on the graphics of the earlier version.In that regard the game has succeeded and it's easy to recommend for those who didn't already buy the PS3 version or who haven't played the series in a number of years. However it also carries with it the same issues and deficiencies plus considerably longer load times. Continue on for a look at where MLB 14: The Show on the PS4 has succeeded and where it has faltered in this Hits and Misses review.POSITIVESGameplay and Authenticity : Every year these two areas top the merit list and that remains the case here. There are some lapses - on the PS4 the strikezone may be misaligned, SCEA did not implement rules changes like the reviews and manager challenges, and the commentary desperately needs to be redone - but otherwise it's an exceptionally realistic experience to play. The Dynamic Camera adds some suspense and satisfaction to hitting and the new Dynamic Difficulty is worth considering and growing with. Touches like occasionally seen new animations, ball boys, and the crowd are somewhat notable in differentiating from the PS3.Visuals: Essentially the only major positive difference in moving up from the PS3 version of MLB 14 comes with the visuals. Everything is sharper and better defined, the daytime lighting is significantly enhanced, and the crowd plays a bigger role with greater diversity. Player models do need more variety, there continues to be a lack of collision detection, the lighting at night has an issue with pitch dark backdrops outside the stadium, and some framerate drops occur during scenes. Still it's a fantastic looking game as a whole and has to be considered along with NBA 2K14 as the best sports games graphically in their first attempts with the new generation of systems.Player Lock: Somewhat overshadowed by another time-saving feature, Player Lock has proven to be a great addition to the series. Player Lock allows for taking control of a single player during a game and simulating the rest. It has proven most valuable for Franchise or Season modes where it provides some influence on the games while dramatically reducing the necessary time invested in them. That is much better than just simming through a chunk of the schedule.The number of options is what makes Player Lock so great. Users can switch who they're controlling at any point in a game - going from one player to another or even taking over the full team in the traditional manner. It's a little confusing though how to take advantage of all the options and most people probably don't even know they exist. Player Lock may not be a feature that would suit other sports games but it fits perfectly for baseball.Road to the Show: The best pure Career mode in sports gaming has been improved upon again. Road to the Show is more enjoyable due to the removal of &#34;goals&#34; with production being what matters instead. The training games have also been adjusted to be more fair and elements like the ability to see standing within an organization are great to follow and assess.Load times are still especially detrimental in RTTS. As a relief pitcher it seems often that more time is spent loading into games than actually playing them. The ability to migrate saves to MLB 15 will reap rewards next year, though that feature may create concern over whether a mode many are starting to find stale will ever be able to evolve properly because of it.Community Challenges: The new Community Challenges represent a fun and unique diversion from the other main modes in the game. Users create their own scenarios for others to attempt and complete. Many of them are just a single play which makes the feature something that can be messed around with when time is limited. There's even a wagering aspect to it utilizing the &#34;Stubs&#34; currency that adds even more of an addictive nature to them. It's a neat experience to go through and play but the loading times between each attempt again stand out and are amplified considerably on the PS4.NEGATIVESOnline Play/Online Franchise: The Show has always been among the worst online experiences in sports gaming. MLB 13 was far from perfect but it showed dramatic improvement yet MLB 14 on the PS3 was nothing short of a disaster. There disconnects and lag have been prevalent in online games and visual oddities have not only taken away from enjoyment but made it even more difficult to make adjustments that may have been possible in the past. Online Co-Op was even removed without telling anyone prior to release.The online for the PS4 version is better but still far from being adequate. Games are at least being completed, and the lag isn't cripping, so there is some level of satisfaction. It's an awfully low bar being cleared here though. Batting averages are anemic and strikeouts abnormally high. That can be primarily attributed to the visual inconsistencies and Quick Counts being used by some.Online Franchise was promoted as one of the big additions for the year but it's best not even considered among the features of the game. Some good design decisions were made but it's completely unreliable and ends up simply being a waste of time. Games against other users may not be completed and games against the CPU are often &#34;not processed correctly&#34; meaning the results are never reported and it's as though the hour spent playing never happened. Fantasy Drafts are the same way - hours are being spent on those only for them to never advance successfully. It's too much of a risk for anyone to attempt investing time in the mode and those that do will justifiably avoid it after getting burned once or twice.Loading Times: As shown in the earlier testing, not only has the anticipated reduction in loading times not been realized, but they are much worse than the already lethargic PS3 version. In some cases it takes three to four times as long to load into a game. Server slowdown also hampers modes like Online Franchise and Diamond Dynasty causing simple actions to drag considerably.Quick Counts: As opposed to Player Lock the new Quick Counts feature doesn't deliver on its promises. Producing counts that more often than not seem to place two strikes on batters and three balls on pitchers, too much of the strategy and situational decision-making inherent in baseball is removed and it teaches poor habits to those just learning how to play a simulation baseball game. The feature might still be worth considering if it saved a significant amount of time like it was promoted as doing. However it really doesn't - taking what might be an hour played traditionally down an average of only 12 minutes after having completed multiple tests that featured comparable circumstances.SUMMARYIsolated on its own, MLB 14: The Show on PS4 is best evaluated as an excellent offline game that delivers on what the series has always been known for. The online play, and heavily promoted online-related features that essentially don't function, remain a concern for those who place value in it while the presentation package and commentary in particular desperately need new life.Consumers that own the PS3 version will find little reason to upgrade, and for anyone uncertain about having the desire to play a baseball game this might not be the best entry point. There are so many features and options that even the grizzled veterans of the series struggle to know where they all are or how they work.Everyone else will again find an excellent representation of baseball that is rich in content from Road to the Show, to Franchise, to the various mini-games all benefiting from the improved graphics. And while it might not seem to matter now, next year the progress being made with MLB 14 won't have to be all thrown away due to the ability to migrate saves to future editions.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2014"}

I've had this game for about 3 months and i still haven't unlocked everything.  The gameplay is very diverse with each character having 2 different fighting styles and their own unique weapons ranging from daggers sculpted from ice to metal sticks attached to the forearms.  Every character has different endings when you beat the game and, if you pay attention, most of them intertwine in some way.  I only have a few complaints about this game. #1. The combos, while incredibly cool, are very long and impractical, seeing as how you have to remember a button combination that can sometimes be over 10 hits long while you are being wailed on by the CPU.  Also, they often times don't even succeed, leaving you wide open to be attacked.  #2.  The CPU has abilities that you don't.  This sounds like a really stupid complaint, but wait until you play this game and the CPU player blocks in the middle of your combo then retaliates with one of their own.  You try to block in the middle of their combo, but absolutely nothing happens and soon they've taken down half your life in one combo.  #3. The difficulty levels are horribly uneven.  Easy is normal, normal is frickin hard, and hard is simply not possible.  And finally, #4. Moloch.  If you haven't played the game, this won't make much sense, but if you have you should know exactly what i'm talking about.  The big guy who's the 3rd from last boss who will kill you about 50 times in the span of 3 minutes.  This guy is harder than every other character in the game.  These faults aside, once you adapt, it's a very fun game.

I just finished the game in (3)days and I can already say its only worth renting...here we go...Games Graphics: Top notch 360 hardware to its maximum, surpasses halo 3 and maybe even gears of war.Gameplay: Bioshock was an \"ok\" game...it wasnt the best game it was one of the most overhyped game, as all the major titles are like halo3 and gears of war assasins creed, cod4.Its a first person shooter, which has you do more than just shooting, such as hacking machines, buying powers, and collecting \"diaries\" which can be annoying.Reasons for renting:No replay value/no multiplayer/one time is enough/cheaper to rentPros: the game does have its unique settings of aquatic life which i enjoyed. The posters on the wall of the WWII era were awesome and made the game have some style.I do like the choice of weapons that were used such as the revolver,rocket launcher, insinerator,wrench.(although the wrench is really the best one). The a.i. can be scary but not near as scary as the silent hill series. This game is really unqiue in every way which is why i can see its a top seller. The music is great classical music twist with suspense. The texture on everything is clear and crisp. The game is some what of a thrill seeker.Cons: the whole game is all about experiancing the powers that you get which are only collected by \"harvesting\" an evil child known as \"adam.\" You have a choice of rescue or harvest when you approach the adam. For me i have no simpathy; usually in video games i have a softer heart, but this is just ridiculous and pointless to try and convince a gamer that saving a child versus harvesting its power would be your conclusion to the game. Simply put its not fun if you dont harvest, but i learned the hard way as in the end i get the \"evil ending cinematic\" where the german girl blames me because i harvested all the power and secrets in the game from the little girls and had no heart to rescue any of them; and this leaves the player feeling like they failed throughout 76 hrs worth of gameplay. Depressing. So if you want a non-depressing ending dont harvest, but if you want overall fun...harvest. This is where bioshock failed in my eyes is trying to make you feel sorry for the adams' and you dont, this is not real life so i treated it like a game and i guess the game in return treated me in real life with depression because i didnt finish the game correctly.Its one of those games where you start out loving it and doing all the features such as \"harvesting\" but then it just gets repetitive and the levels themselves have the same contrast in colors that it feels like you are walking through several of the same rooms over and over. The a.i. can be scary at times and it may be fun to bash them a bit, but this doesnt really do it for me, there is no interaction at all between the main character and the narrator;the main character is one of the those lifeless people like master cheif who never says anything in the halo series; it gets old when the narrator is telling you what to do over and over again. Where can we have a game where there isnt a narrator telling you what to do!! Also there isnt any replay value, once you play this game your done, there is no fun or fullfillment in playing the game over especially if you played it on the hardest difficulty setting like me.I cant say anymore, too many average gamers buy there games before renting which is stupid, rent this game for $8.50 at your nearest blockbuster and dont waste your cash until after you have played it.End result: ok game/worth renting","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2008"}

C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"What an Experience","reviewText":"I was a little skeptical this game would live up to the hype. Then some diminished reviews came around and I was already feeling a let down. Where could they go wrong? Was my thoughts. Well that didn't stop me from purchasing this game. After 30 minutes I was blown away. All skepticism was gone and I was in Gamer Heaven.Let me start off from the beginning. Yes there is a plot twist and it's pretty bizarre. Just think that your watching a Michael Crichton movie and it will make sense. Playing in the Middle East several hundred years ago is a different idea. It's hard to say what you could expect with this concept.So what makes this game amazing. Lets start off with the landscape. It's brilliant and beautiful...Really majestic. You don't understand the scope of this game until you start playing. The world is surrounded by several small villages and three large cities. The only way to travese this open terrain with a horse. Fortunately they are about as easy to find as a car in todays society.What also sets this game apart is the ability to do what you want when you want. There is no clock on you and your not stuck going into a mission. Everything is open based. The character is amazingly fun to control you can scale tall buildings and make amazing leaps of faith. Climbing up a building that is several stories and then leaping to certain doom is breathtaking excitement. This is what games should be about.Beyond that is a mission based game. Similiar to Grand Theft Auto in style. You can accept simple missions like pickpocketing and protecting citizens to the more main based assasin missions. You can battle soldiers if you want as you have many enemies but it's not really advised. Following the assasin missions can be complex and involve several steps that make the story very intresting. Obviously a lot of time was put into making this top notch.For anyone who likes open based games with large environments then Assassins Creed is for you. From the majestic peaks to the clustered cities. This is trully a next gen experience. The storyline and incentive program will keep you playing for many hours. Definately a worthwhile gameplay experience. If you want something to keep you busy that doesn't involve guns go out and get Assasins Creed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0002Y2XXQ","reviewerName":"ooocarl06","summary":"unexpectedly refreshing","reviewText":"With a name like Katamari Damacy, it can only be from one place. Japan. Now i had heard a lot about this game, mostly on its...odd to say the least nature. Few games can produce a genuine what the F@!* from your average gamers mouth after just seeing the intro. Suffice to say dancing pandas and singing ducks are some of the most ordinary elements.While there isn't much to the storyline, the basic idea is that your father, \"the king of all cosmos\" goes out one night, and in what can only be described as a drunken stooper, smashes all the stars, not to mention the moon out of the night sky. It is your job as \"the prince of all cosmos\" or the son of the king, to put all the stars and the moon back in the sky. This includes all the constellations, and about 10 misc. stars to construct, in addition to the moon. Of course the only logical way to put all the stars, constellations, not mention the moon back in the sky is to go down to earth and collect as much junk as you can, then your dad will turn it into a star! makes sense right?As for the gameplay, it is one of the simplest, yet best executed games in years.taking the roll of the prince who is a tee-ninesy little green dude, you push around a ball varying in size called a Katamari. As you push your Katamari over various objects, they stick and as time goes on you work your way up from rolling up thumbtacks and coins to rolling up skyscrapers, cruise liners, and even a volcano! The game ups the diffaculty at a nice pace which makes it very enjoyable from beginning to end, and you never get the feeling that your overwhelmed.Yet another thing that is, yes you guessed it, wierd about this game, is the soundtrack. This is in no way a bad thing, but it definately isn't something you've heard in any other game. With a sort of lounge/techno mixture, its quite the unexpected treat. Certain song will be stuck in your head for weeks, which shows the music coordinators did their job.The controls, as well as the rest of the game, are a bit abnormal at first. Using the analog sticks, you push both simultaneously in the direction you wish to roll your katamari. In addition to the analog sticks, there are shoulder button functions, one that allows you to get an overhead view of your immeadiate surroundings, and one that give you a first person point of view. Even though these shoulder controls were at my disposal, i found no real reason to utilize them throughout the entire game.My favorite aspect of this game is that there is an unbelieve amount of things that you can pick up. With over a thousand different objects, you have your variety in every shape and form. All of the things you pick up in the world are recorded in an easy to navigate archive, where you can look at all the objects you've picked up, as well as see if any of your collected objects are rare. as for the objects themselves, they are just about anything. You start your journey picking up thumbtacks, batteries, and erasers. After that you slowly build to picking up people, yes people, then trees, then houses, and finally on to entire pieces of land that you pull straight off of the earth. Some of the more unique objects include a football and baseball field, a ferris wheel, and even the thunder god sitting up high on a cloud. Through all of the picking, the camera always finds its way to a good position, so while it isn't perfect, you very rarely find yourself cursing the camera angles.the game does feature a multiplayer mode, but in a whole, it could use some improvements. You get your choice of many colorful characters that resemble the prince, but instead have clever costumes, such as a strawberry, army camo, and even disco lights! After me and a friend of mine picked characters, we expected to end up at a menu that allowed us to set all the specifics of the round, such as time, size, level, etc. but instead we were dissapointed to find that there are only a select few levels, the time is always three minutes, and your Katamari never gets past picking up hats. Had this particular element had more customization to it, this would have definately been a five star game, since once you play for about an hour, you realize how great a multiplayer expieience this game could be.In conclusion, this is definately something that anyone who has ever appreciated genuine wierdness, videogames, Japan culture, or any combination of the three should check out. With a level design that is easy to complete, but next to impossible to fully master, this game will have even the best gamers repeating levels.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2005"}

This network not only connects friends for epic head-to head pursuits and races, but also enables players to compare performances and stats, thereby setting the stage for the ultimate in friendly competition.","reviewerName":"Chevy","summary":"This Game Is A Blast","reviewText":"Hot Pursuit is a fun, intense and satisfying arcade racer. It offers single player and online multiplayer experiences (no split-screen), has nice presentation throughout and has beautifully rendered cars and scenery.Autolog is the first thing to load. It even has a visual and narrated tutorial explaining its features. Autolog has seven categories. \"Photos\" is where you view captured images of in game or showroom. \"Wall\" shows things about you and your friend's game progress, for instance, if you beat their time on a course or vice-versa. It also allows you to view posted images you and your friends capture. In order for friends to see your pics you need to add a comment to them. If you don't add a comment to the pic then it will only be visible on your wall. \"HotPursuit Online\" takes you to online multiplayer events. \"Career\" is your single player mode. \"Autolog Recommends\" does an analysis and recommends players you may want to add as friends. It even informs you if the recommendation is a friend of a friend. It will also post suggestions to beat your friend's time on a course. \"NFS News\" tells you about NFS related news from various NFS titles, not just Hot Pursuit. \"NFS Store\" shows you DLC available for purchase.Selecting \"Career\" will open a topographical mapwith icons to choose from. Playing as a racer or a cop, you earn bounty points for events that are used as the scale for ranking up to level 20 at the maximum. You rank up separately as racer and cop. Race and Cop event icons are easily distinguishable. Selecting an icon brings up a list of events. Earning at least a bronze medal will unlock more events.Once you select your event you are taken to the showroom for car selection. Many cars require you to achieve a certain number of bounty points to unlock them and the required bounty points for each car is displayed. After selecting your car, a brief historical description of thevehicle is narrated by a pleasant female voice. You can take pics of cars in the showroom.Every car has unique engine sound and handling. Manual transmission is not an option. The only customization available is to change the car's color from a limited palette.Once you begin an event there is a 30 - 40 second load time. Rather than load directly to into the event, it loads to an information screenthat requires you to press a button to actually start. Once you do this, an optional video segues nicely to player control. Cars will show visible damage, but this does not affect performance and you can never bust out your headlights so you won't have to drive blind during night events.There are three views available while driving. You have bumper cam, over the hood cam and 3rd person cam available. Thre is no cockpit view cam.Equipment is not only for the police of Seacrest County. Racers have equipment available for many events. Cops have Spike Strips, EMP, Road Block and Helicopter. In addition to nitros, Racers have Turbo, EMP, Spike Strips and Jammer. The EMP allows you to target a vehicle with the touch of a button and as long as you keep a line of sight and close enough range it will auto-lock and temporarily disable the target's vehicle. The Jammer allows a racer to disrupt all police communications, hardware and maps. Equipment will upgrade the more you use it and a nice presentation is shown for every equipment upgrade and each time you level up or earn a new vehicle. The main effect of the equipment is to slow you down. You only get busted if your car gets totaled. A health bar displays briefly above your carwhen you take damage. This does not hold true in multiplayer. A skillful cop can pin you and you'll get busted even if your car isn't totaled.Even though you want gold medals for events, the fun part is trying to beat your friend's times. The further you progress the more difficult things become and constantly going for gold can seem like a futile effort. If a particular event gets too frustrating, move on and come back to it later.One missing element is the ability to set day/night/weather cycle. Replays are absent. In career mode the only race result you get isThe scenery is beautiful with day/night/weather cycles and the wet pavement is slippery and harder to navigate. There are also various spots to go off course and not all of them are short cuts. A variety of coastal, desert, woodland, mountain and freeway races are in the mix. About all that is missing is an occasional deer hopping across the road at an inopportune time. Now that would have spiced things up a bit.your own. Personally, I would like to see the full results even if my opponents are A. I. There are no jumps. There is no sensitivity adjustment for steering and it's badly needed. No instant restarts. Hopefully in the future they will offer a hard drive install of the game so we can have instant replays and instant restarts along with faster load times for events.Criterion reports that steering wheels are supported. You should be able to find this info at Criterion's or the Need For Speed websites.Controls can be mapped. If playing with a game pad you'll find the steering is very sensitive and may take some practice. Fortunately free roam is available and has no effect on your stats. Since drifting is anecessity in this game and because the steering is so sensitive, free roam offers a way to practice.The music selection is decent. The big plus is that you can put your own play lists on your hard drive and play your own music in the game. You may need to adjust the audio volumes in the menu, but it's worth it for this option.As much fun as this game is, it is not without flaws and it's only fair that I share my experiences in this regard. In the later stages of the game it does become more difficult, but this is not the problem. The problem is the manner this difficulty is presented which happens to be in the form of A. I. cheating. There is blatant A. I. cheating in this game and you will likely notice things I don't mention here.You can be racing side-by-side and an A. I. car crashes. It will reset almost instantly and if you watch your map you'll see it coming up to you at unreal speeds. The drawback is that when you crash you have no reset button. You're shown a crash cam, i.e. Burnout Paradise style, and the seconds tick away. You can be on a straightway in the same scenario and hit your nitros, but the A. I. car will take off in front of you without using nitros. A. I. cars will take hairpin turns as if glued to the road, meanwhile you must drift around them and watch them go by. Sometimes a nuisance A. I. car's purpose is to do nothing but crash into you, allowing the other A. I. racers to increase their lead. A. I. cars don't slow down when going off road, but your car slows substantially. Turbo for a racer is like having a jet engine for a short time. When you use it all cops should be left in the dust. This is not always the case. I had full turbo a number of times and the pursuing cop stayed right behind me, even catching me once and making me spin out. These things don't happen constantly, but they do happen. Eliminating cop A. I. cheating would have been easy. They could have cops randomly driving on patrol, see you speeding by them, then turn around to pursue, but there are no patrolling cops. They all are sitting around parked until you go by then catch up to you at unbelievable speeds.There must be a better way to increase difficulty without having so much blatant A. I. cheating. It is very noticeable. It's a cheap way of doing things. This programming practice goes back to the mid 90's and it's time to develop a new way of doing this. The game is so amazing and fun and seeing this puts a damper on things. Next time I want dinner and a movie first.I'll cut Criterion a break this time, but in the future they need to fix how they increase difficulty so it flows with the game. Even with all the later A. I. cheating and missing elements, I couldn't stop playing because this game is just so much fun. If you like the other NFS Hot Pursuit, Most Wanted, Carbon or High Stakes titles then you're bound to get tons of fun and enjoyment from Criterion's version. It is absolutely beautiful and a blast to play. It will have it's frustrating moments, mainly from what I mentioned above, but rather than give up, go to a different event or play online to take a break from the bad so you can experience all the goodness this game has to offer. It's really worth playing for the experience and is extremely fun.Have fun everyone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}

Couse \"darkman1969\"","summary":"Initial review from an original YSFE owner:  They might be on to something here.","reviewText":"As an owner of the original Kinect game, and a player of many other workout games since (UFC, Biggest Loser, etc) I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with this new version.As the original one did, the game gives you a body scan when you originally sign in.  That image is then what is used to play games.  Oddly enough though, I've yet to find anywhere in the game where I can modify anything it measured.  It also didn't ask me for my weight so I have no idea where to input that or update it. It did recognize that I was a previous player and carried over my calorie burn count which I thought was great.  After that, a ton of achievements were unlocked, which I also didn't mind :)Gone are the days of the dreaded menu system from the past.  Now, your hands are used in a push and hold motion to activate what you want to do.  This is much improved over the old hold the arm out with hand extended to touch a dot for 4 seconds to activate.  I always had problems with that one.The main menu is broken down into 4 sections:  My Zone (your settings, goals etc...btw, be sure to go in and change the measurement system to Imperial for those in the US since it is defaulted to metric), Activities, Workouts and Classes.  Once I told the game what I wanted to achieve (with several options to choose from) it created a routine for me to follow and there are several to choose from:Classes include African Rhythms, Boot Camp, Hip Hop, Bollywood, Cardio Boxing, Yoga, Latin Dance and Zen Energy.Activities include Warm Up, Stack Up, Stomp It, Run the World, Wallbreaker and Jump Rope.  Run the World here is amazing...more about that later.Workouts include Cardio, Arms, Abs, Toning, Back, Sports Prep, Glutes, Health and LegsI jumped right into the Run the World and have to say this is fantastic!  You run in place in various cities around the world and jog by landmarks.  To keep the run interesting, you are monitored for speed (how quickly your knees are moving) and given challenges throughout the run including \"high knees\" and speed challenges.  Along the way, you pass makers regarding the landmarks and a color photo pops up with the training giving you a brief history lesson or fact about it.  Very cool.The recognition on sit-ups went very well, with push-ups still a little off for me.  I may have been doing something wrong, but it is the by far the best recognition of push-ups for me of any game I've used before.  During your training the background will change and spice it up which was also a nice feature.One final item that didn't change that seemed to bother a lot of previous players was that there is really no defined way to exit the game or button to push.  You still have to get to the pause menu or use your controller to go to the dashboard.  If someone can figure out where to input/update the current weight and pass that along, I would greatly appreciate it.All in all, I have to say that I'm very impressed with the new version as I believe they've really worked on making it a great workout game that is much improved from the first one.**Later in the day edit**I think they have hit a home run with this game.  The jump rope section is like crack!  It's guitar hero, except with your feet.  An absolute blast and fun for the whole family! (without getting them addicted to crack, of course)  :)I also did the Boot Camp initial workout and was pretty dang tired after doing it, and I'm really no slouch.  The only issue with that was the trainer just started going into movements so you miss a few the first time.  But seriously, the background changes through a military theme throughout.LOVING IT!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0H8FK","description":"","reviewerName":"Patrick H. Nguyen","summary":"Must own game to show off your Kinect (still great w/o Kinect)","reviewText":"Child of Eden - The good- Beautiful graphics and audio soundtrack- Immersive Kinect controls- Use of up to 4 controllers as vibrating force feedback- Well-designed shmup (shoot'em up) with intricate gameplay-scoring mechanicsChild of Eden - The not so good- Shmups tend to be shorter games than other genres- Menu navigation can be confusing because it sometimes switches between Kinect and controller- sitting position does not control as well as standing (higher Kinect sensor placement preferred as well)Menu navigation can be with either the Kinect of the game controller.  Menu navigation is a little confusing because it doesn't seem you can go completely controller-free to navigation.  It appears you can but often the game seems to switch to controller mode and you have to press a button on the controller to switch back to Kinect menu control.  In general, the menus are a little confusing in terms of selecting missions.The game is definitely meant to be played with Kinect controls rather than the standard 360 game controller.  Combined with the controllers for force feedback, controlling with the Kinect is the most immersive experience where you just forget the interface and become one with the game.If you place your Kinect at waist level, the game control appears to suffer a slight bit.  The game appears to control better with the Kinect higher up, especially when targeting near the bottom of the TV.  It's not a major difference but if you can, put the Kinect above the TV.  The logic also applies to sitting down.  Child of Eden does allow you to play in the sitting position but when sitting down, targeting objects near the bottom of the screen can be hard because if the Kinect is placed low and you're sitting down, when you move your hand to crotch level to target low objects, the cursor will spaz while the Kinect is figuring out where your hand is.  The game controls better in the standing position as well.  I played a large chunk of the game with the Kinect at waist level and it played fine.The game uniquely allows you to use up to 4 controllers as vibrating devices so if you wear baggy pants or shorts with pockets, it's an awesome experience.  I thought it would be a gimmick, but it just feels awesome.  It's not just generic vibrations.  Different explosions produce different effects.  The vibrations also appear to be spatial and positional as well.  There's also some pulsations due to the various music beats.  You have to experience this pants vibration to understand how good it feels.  I only have 3 wireless 360 controllers so I didn't have the full 4 controller experience but it felt great nonetheless.  I also tried 2 controllers in the front pockets of my shorts and it worked great.  It really recreates the atmosphere of being in a game machine at the local arcade.The game starts with an introductory movie in high definition that looks like something out of the mind of Tim Burton.  You see a real actress model playing Yumi where she's walking through a surreal forest scene with augmented CGI.  Her images will intersperse throughout the game.  The actual in-game graphics are very good.  Personally, the art direction is merely good for me since the artwork is somewhat abstract and there's not as much artistic license as I would've liked, but my lack of enthusiasm is merely personal preference.  The framerate is extremely solid and shows no obvious moments of slowdown.The first mission is the tutorial level where they teach you the game mechanics.  The right hand is used to paint the various enemies on-screen.  You just move your hand over the enemies which locks onto them.  Once they are locked you do a simple wrist flick to unleash the explosions.  You don't have to do a dramatic motion to unleash your weaponry like you may have seen in various hands-on gameplay videos, just a quick flick of the wrist.  The left hand controls your tracer weapon which is like a machine gun.  There is no locking of targets.  You simply maneuver the onscreen cursor with your hand which autofires.The trick is figuring out which weapon to use on which enemies so you'll be switching back and forth between the weapons constantly.  As part of the game mechanics, the game doesn't allow you to use both weapons simultaneously.  They designed the game to force you to switch hands thru the different types of enemies so weapon choice is not merely preference.  For example, in order to destroy enemy bullets, you need to use the tracer gun (machine gun) instead of the standard weapon.  Raising both arms (a la an orchestral conductor) will unleash your smart bomb which clears the screen of bad guys.  General movement of the screen is on-rails like most shmups.  However, you can shift the view in a direction by moving the cursor to the edge of the screen.  During the frantic scenes where enemies are filling the screen, you'll often be waving your right hand as if you're erasing a chalkboard in order to paint enemies and launch explosions quickly.Targeting via your hands is wonderfully done as you never feel like you're fighting the controls.  You'll feel part Mickey Mouse in The Sorcerer's Apprenctice, part Tom Cruise in The Minority Report.  I've never liked the Rez controls whether it was on the Sega Dreamcast, Sony Playstation 2 or Xbox 360.  Every tiem I played Rez, I kept wishing the game used a mouse.  I hated the subtle autoaiming in Rez to compensate for a game controller.  But in Kinect, it feels amazing and accurate with your hand.  You rarely overshoot the cursor like with a game controller.Game mechanics-wise, there are multiple ways to play Child of Eden like most shmups (shoot-em-up games).  If you simply want to kill enemies and finish the game, you can play frantically and move your hands rapidly.  If you want to score higher and increase your multiplier, you have to play more precisely and deliberately.  For example, you should target more enemies before launching exposions.  Also, the more you launch missiles to the beat of the music, the higher your multiplier score will be.  This sounds easier than it actually is.  It's hard to build a high multiplier because you have to switch to your tracer weapon in order to shoot down enemy bullets.  There are lots of little nuances to the scoring mechanics that I haven't figured out yet.  I'll adjust the review if as I find them.Like other shmups, the screen can become quite hectic where it's hard to distinguish between debris, enemy bullets, or enemies themselves so it requires constant attention to quickly identify the various elements.  If you love shmups, you'll love Child of Eden.Of course people will note Child of Eden's lineage to Rez because Tetsuya Mizuguchi was basically the father of both games.  But for people that don't know Rez, Child of Eden is like playing your typical shmup such as Raiden or Ikaruga or Torus Trooper or even more old school, games like Galaga or After Burner.  The only difference is Child of Eden plays from a first person perspective rather than third person.I cannot comment on the length of Child of Eden as I have not yet finished the game.  However, from reading other reviews, it appears the game is short.  Shmups tend to be short so this is more a negative on the genre than on child of Eden (I finished Raiden IV rather quickly).  So replayability, such as with Pac-Man Championship Edition and other such games, comes from trying to achieve higher scores.  There are a number of things to unlock which lengthens the game somewhat.  Length is mostly likely the greatest weakness in this fine game.There are no multiplayer game modes.  Xbox Live support is restricted on online leaderboards.  It's unclear if there will be any DLC levels in the future.Bottom line:  Child of Eden is a must-own Kinect game.  There are now 3 games that people universally use to show off the Kinect:  Dance Central, Kinect sports, and now Child of Eden.  This game is defined by the Kinect controls and the amazing music.  The music is so well integrated into the gameplay and is not just background noise.  Most age groups will enjoy playing Child of Eden except for young children whose dexterity might not be high enough to subtly control the cursor.  If you don't have a Kinect, it's still a great game, but you feel a bit disconnected.  If you do have a Kinect, it becomes a phenomenal game.  If you've never like shmups, Child of Eden may make you a convert.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2011"}

The story was bad, the characters were dull, and you honestly stop caring about an hour into it. I was skipping all of the cut scenes, because they had no impact on how I played the game whatsoever. If this were just a single player game, it would probably get 2 stars.The multiplayer though is phenominal. It's a delicate and well thought out balance between a level-up shooter, a space western, and a futuristic RTS. The game structures are very similar to every other shooter on the market (CTF, Deathmatch, Zone protect), but the execution makes it a whole different ball game.You can play the game however you want, and your role fits into your team concept. That's why I love modes like capture the flag in this game. It allows you to take your role you are best at and utilize it toward a team goal. You can play the game a million different ways: as a quick draw offensive player using a sidewinder and your equipped gun, driving a tank right into the enemy base and shelling from afar, flying  a hawk and bombing from above, or my personal favorite, as a defender fortifying your base.Most FPS multiplayer rely on kills and headshots to give XP. Luckily Starhawk utilizes an XP system that also rewards defensive players who build structures and defend the base. You don't need to be a great FPS player to be great at this game. I personally like to defend my bases, so many of my XP come from auto turrets and building points.Overall it s a fantastic multiplayer game. Probably the most fun and chaotic I've ever played. I have had some crashing/freezing issues during long multiplayer sessions, but other than that the multiplayer gets a resounding 5 star rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNY","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"It takes two to","reviewText":"Speaking theatrically for a moment, there's an important, and oft confused distinction between the terms 'realistic' and 'naturalistic'. Naturalism seeks to show its audience a slice of sensory reality; that is, something that looks, sounds, even smells like real life.  Realism, on the other hand tries to show the real truth about life - not the costumes or lights of the stage, but the relationships, tension and drama of the world.Raven Shield, the latest in the Rainbow Six series, is a healthy helping of both.  As such, it's not really fair to describe this title as a totally 'Realistic' action game.  There's no such thing.  What you do get is a highly charged and tension wracked experience that features a great many lifelike moments, packed with guns and gadgets and hours of enthralling gameplay.As part of the elite Special Forces organization 'Rainbow', it's your job to lead a team of highly trained soldiers to thwart the machinations of evil, gun-toting baddies.  You get to equip your team, plan your attack, and lead your troops in the 1st Person, much the same as previous titles in the series.  There's a lot in common with the game's predecessors - an emphasis on stealth, team tactics and accurate shooting, especially when there are hostages involved.  The game world is lovingly created, from the mission planning stage where you kit out your agents, to the huge interactive environments you'll be stalking through.  Ubisoft has positively crammed detail into this game, and visually it's by far the most striking of the series.  If your video card is up to the job you'll be treated to lush, high-res graphics with plenty of environmental effects, such as swaying trees, billowing smoke, fluffy snowflakes and more.  All the weapon models and animations look fabulous, and you can see each weapon and grenade dangling from the belts of your troops as you lead them into action.Equally the sound is top notch, with bullets that positively sizzle past your head, and convincing speech from your team...nothing beats hearing 'tango's down' crackling over your headset.  There's plenty of ambient sound to enjoy as well, and the game rewards players who pay attention to subtleties like footsteps, or doors creaking open.The game AI is robust and versatile, though its here that many players tend to throw around the word 'realistic' in disparaging tones.  Sure, there's room for improvement - your team occasionally gets disoriented when traversing doors or ladders, and the enemy intelligence will sometimes ignore your gunfire, or the death of a nearby colleague.  Still, these occasions are infrequent, and on the whole the game puts on a good show, considering it's responsible for up to 7 computer controlled commandos and dozens of terrorists in one level.Coupled with a robust and enjoyable multiplayer mode, Raven Shield has almost all the bases covered for a tactical shooter.  My expectations in the realism department are catered for, and then some, with tons of options and weapons to play with (over 50), all based on their real life counterparts.  'Based on' is a good way to describe how true to life this game is...if you want something more convincing I suggest you uninstall and never again play this game after you first die - hey, no second chances in the wet-works department.  For everyone else in search of a thoughtful and highly atmospheric shooter, this latest adventure should sneak its way into your collection; and then flash-bang the pants off it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit.

This is a game with a well developed story line that centers on two 17 year olds.  One is Jaster Rogue, raised by a priest on the planet Rosa and hungry for a life among the stars - something almost impossible in the political clime of that part of the universe.  The other is Kisala, been raised as the daughter of a space pirate who is seeking some of known space's most important treasures.  Neither, of course, is what they seem.  When a unexpected series of events catapults Jaster in with the pirates, the two are off on a wild adventure that involves 5 worlds, countless secrets and the discovery of who each of them really is.  With them is a series of companions, each with their own characters and history.  While dialog is never the strength of a console game, one of Rogue Galaxy's strengths is the quality of its character development.The worlds the game takes place in are well-defined desert, jungle, industrial and technological worlds filled with many NPC's and the usual cast of Johnny one liners.  Graphics are neatly done without too much dependence on CGI (which means that there's plenty of room on the DVD for voice and story).  Clues and treasures abound.  Movement is three dimensional so there are both story line  and battle athletics (jump on the roof of a trolley and ride it to a treasure box sort of thing).  Artistic design is a strong element in the game - another important factor in its attractiveness to a player.  In short, the worlds of Rogue Galaxy are worlds that you will want to adventure in.  And take a bit of time looking around, as well.The battle system is fairly simple - run around a `dungeon', get discovered by monsters, and beat them senseless.  Many of the monsters require jumping on them, shooting them with a special weapon, or using a special technique.  There is nothing that can't be managed with careful leveling up and RPG ingenuity.  Often you will have the option of avoiding a fight.  In fact you should pace yourself carefully or you may cause yourself more difficulties than you would expect.This doesn't mean that you can get through without a lot of slaughter, but that, if you really don't care about having Kisala's bathing suit you can limit yourself to needful violence.  Needless to say I'm a compulsive, so that by the end of the game I was more than a little sword slap happy.  In fact, this is one of the game's defects - the battle system isn't rich enough to support long killing for stats runs.  The after games extras are weak dungeon deep dives.  I hate to admit it, but Kisala's bathing suit wasn't worth the effort.On the other hand the weapon system, which involves combining different weapons to get new ones is fun, although the results are a bit less predictable than you might want.  In addition there is a whole system involving laying out the pieces of a factory and running raw materials down assembly lines.  To get all kinds of goodies.  This really is a compulsive's delight.  Thus, items and weapons are an active part of the game.  Yet another plus for Rogue Galaxy.If you are compulsive, expect several hundred hours of play.  Or expect to play through the game several times to get all the twists and turns.  Yes, a good strategy guide is a necessity, and maybe a couple visits to online resources.  This has been a good year for RPG's that Rogue Galaxy is one of the outstanding ones.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2007"}

I was definitely looking forward to a new adventure with Samus.  Sad to say, The Other M did not live up to expectations.  If this were  an anime movie, it might appeal to fans but as a game, it is simply a dud.  I was very disappointed with the third person viewpoint for the majority of play.  It's confusing to switch back and forth from that to first person only for shooting/attacking.  Why they wanted to change it from the great first person shooter perspective of the previous games is beyond me.  The graphics were more colorful but other than the \"movies\" weren't really much more impressive than Metroid 3.  There was just too much drama and not enough action.  Metroid fans aren't in it for the story of lost loves or past life tragedies.  We want a challenge to face, a puzzle to solve, a creature to kill.  That is what has made the Metroid franchise so great.  It keeps you on your toes until the last boss is killed.  The Other M is long and boring with too many cuts for the movie sequences.  I want the old Samus back and I'll stick to the old games until something better than The Other M comes out.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

I tried really hard to like this game, its Metroid after all and who is cooler than Samus? Unfortunately, for me this title was a definite miss and I got the sinking feeling that I would dislike the game as soon as I started playing it.What is good about this game:* Graphics look great for a Wii game* I used an amazon coupon so I only paid $30 for this titleWhat is bad about this game:* All too easy. If you ever want to know how to ruin a challenging series follow this formula: use generous auto-aiming so you can spam the attack button, use auto-dodging so you don't get hit, use frequent save stations (literally every 3 or 4 rooms) so that you always have full life and ammo, use auto-checkpoints so that in the rare event you actually die you don't even have to go back to the last save station, use a stupid concentration system that allows you to infinitely regain health and ammo so you never die, remove all puzzle elements from the game (instead replaced with find the morphball track in each room), still hide powerups but show them as brightly glowing dots on the map so there's no need to go hunting for them, replace intricate boss battles with simplified pattern matching, shorten the story campaign to roughly 8 hours, the list goes on...* No music. This one hurt, previous titles have had such good foreground music and all we get with Other M is low key ambiance that pipes up during boss battles.* Destruction of Samus' character. Samus, the lone bounty hunter that saved the galaxy from peril, defeating waves of lethal aliens, all on her own apparently has daddy issues, and struggles being a woman in a man's military world. Wow, how long did it take you to come up with that one? No complexity, no ferocity and ambition. Just a chick dealing with sexism in the world and struggling to not be controlled by her emotions. Sigh. Yes, Samus is human and feels emotions and has issues. It doesn't mean that she should have daddy issues like every other fictional character (we've had enough of this with every character on lost having these issues), and it certainly doesn't mean that Samus should be dominated by her emotions. If you don't believe me, just wait for one of the battles. It made me sad to see what they've reduced Samus's character to.* Long, boring CGI sequences. So many games are going this route and its sad to see the Metroid series fall to this pattern. Instead of developing an interesting and engrossing method of telling a story, we're instead presented with long, beautifully rendered videos revealing the Final Fantas... I mean Metroid story. Samus narrates the entire time. And yes, the voice acting is terrible. Just watch a trailer to find out. Its like that the whole time. They tried to convey detached interest and instead came across like a robot for Samus's voice. After playing this game, I feel like more work was put on developing visually pleasing cut-scenes (that you can't skip/pause) than on the actual gameplay. And for a series like Metroid, that is most disappointing.I won't talk about how unbelievably science fiction cliche the story ended up being because I don't want to risk spoilers, but I will say I hard a hard time tolerating the story. If you combine that with all the game play elements that seemed to dumb down this game and that the series trademarks (such as exploration, music, puzzle solving) are completely missing from this game, I don't understand why this is even a Metroid game.Listen to the negative reviews, particularly if you are a fan of the series, because they are all accurate. This is by the most disappointing title I've played in years.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

Not original.This game is a port from the old Dreamcast console, and already well-loved amongst DC owners. Sega renamed it \"Legends\" to signify that it's been upgraded: The Cube verson has improved graphics & also fewer random battles (thank you), plus extra sidequests.The story is basically the same as previous RPGs. A good guy (you) gathers a team of people, explores the world, and decides to defeat the evil empire. What makes Skies different is the \"pirate style\" to the game, that gives the player a great sense of exploration, and also allows a new kind of battle - ship vs. ship - lining up broadsides & firing the cannon! On top of that is Sega's usual polishing - interesting/lively characters, good graphics (even at 5 years old, they still shine), and great music to make you tap your feet.This is actually my *second* copy of the game. I bought it new when it was first released..... played it..... sold it..... and now I bought it back for half-price. If I had been smart, I would have kept it, but I didn't realize at the time how superior Skies of Arcadia is to other RPGs.Bottom Line - Buy it. You'll love it. :-)troy","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2005"}

You take control of a four person squad guiding them through stealth missions, search and rescue missions, or just search and destroy missions from all around the world such as Poland and (?) Africa. The single player mode is good, but the online is where the good stuff is. Here is my review.PRO's:-Well worth the wait.-16-on-16 maximum players in a game instead of 8-on-8-New guns.-New maps.-Great online community; better than ever.-More rankings.-Solid single player.-Unlockables.-Ability to \"crosstalk\" with Fireteam Bravo for the PSP.-Vehicles.-Ability to choose large or small maps.CON's:-Still are those online rank-ups.-Ranking system is screwy.-Still lag ( since it's online. )-Extreme racism and swearing online.-Just not as good as SOCOM 2.Graphics: 8.5/10. The graphics in this game are good and bad. They seem to look worse than SOCOM 2 in the graphical category, but in another way, they look better. The levels look nice and the shadowing is great, but the characters seem to look different and move differently than in SOCOM 2. Really, there isn't too big of a graphical improvement.Sound: 9/10. The single player chit-chat is very well done, and the guns sound great; just like SOCOM 1 and 2 did. The sound in this series is just amazing and this game is no different; top notch.Control: 9/10. Best controls yet. Why? You can now somewhat customize your controls, such as \"Frogman\" controls, which you use L2 to talk instead of O, which is very convenient when you are in the line of fire and need an easier button to press when shooting (R1). You use the right analog stick to move forward, backward, left, and right, and use the right to look around.Fun: 9/10. \"Crosstalk\" with your PSP to get weapons the easy way ( beating the game on ensign or higher with the PSP ) or get the weapons the easy way ( do the same thing. ) The online play will last a long time and hold every fan over until SOCOM 4 comes out, and if it does.8.6/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2005"}

The WORST Multiplayer","reviewText":"Call of Duty Black Ops is a HIT and MISS game.THE HIT.The campaign one of the best experience's I had with first person shooters, every character tied into the story one way or another and it worked.  Graphics are amazing and COD version of the Cold War wants me to learn everything about it.I felt very involved with every aspect of the campaign and it always kept me at the edge of my seat.A few obvious flaws exist-Constant respawning of the same enemies untill you reach your destination.  You kill one and about 8 seconds later another one come at you from the same spot. Your support is not worth too much, most of the time they shoot at absolutly nothing.-Some temporary indestructible enemies.Biggst one I took notice on was in the vietnamese raid.  There was a vietnam soldier that ran right in front of me with an RPG and I could not kill him with anything I had (M60&AK47;) untill he set himself up and shot his RPG, then I shot him once and he was able to die.So untill certain enemies play their full roll, they will not die. Happens a lot throughout the campaignTHE MISSThe words I have can only express a little of how dissapointed I was when I wanted to shoot this disk till there was no existance of it left.After 1 year of modern warfare 2's relesase and having the best online multiplayer out of any FPS in existance and keeping me hooked to play it over and over again, THIS someone must have been smoking crack when they put BLACK OPS multiplayer together.Multiplayer looks like a cartoon(players-maps-weapons), very sluggish, and it takes forever to get conntected to matches.  MW2 I got conntected in no time.I dont mind going old school with anything from weapons to places to clothes, BUT THIS IS WRONG.Zombie Mode?If you want to go around and shoot zombies get wolfenstien, dead rising, resident evil, etc. instead.  In COD you rack up points and use those points to rebuild barriers to help keep zombies from breaking trough.  The zombies are tough too, but after you eventually get killed and see how many rounds of zombies you lasted through, you would start from scratch all over again.  No leveling up, unlocking weapons no nothing.  It goes nowhere.WARNINGIf you love MW2 Multiplayer, you will not like Black Ops multiplayer one bit.  You will pretty much hate it and go back to MW2 for multiplayer.BLACK OPS IS ALL ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

Squires \"theDrizzle\"","summary":"You've played the rest, now try the best","reviewText":"I'm not going to go into too much detail since I've seen that other reviews have already covered a lot, but so far the game seems to be a huge improvement over MW2. Part of the reason might be just because I got bored of MW2, but I do believe that this game makes improvements.I've seen people posting that it's the same game as MW. Well first of all, it's a completely different game: different maps, characters, story, weapons, perks, challenges, killstreaks...etc. I don't know how that's the same game as MW, but let's just say that it is the same game...is that a bad thing? MW is one of the best games in the genre and looking like MW and playing like MW isn't a bad thing. To say that Treyarch didn't make something unique is just stupid.They've kept similar core concepts to the game with a few exceptions:1) They've balanced the weapons more fairly2) They've made the killstreaks a little less devestating. They're still cool, but they don't allow you to completely dominate the other team as easily as in MW23) They added cool new perks; camera you can leave is really cool ideaThe graphics are could be considered inferior to MW, but I actually think that in some ways they're better. The framerate and some of the smooth textures seem to be lacking, but the level of details and the overall look of the maps is really intricate and just awesome I think. If you played WAW then you know that Treyarch has a different way of doing the visuals, but they're still pretty sweet. So, I'd say that they're different but not necessarily inferior to IWs visuals.I haven't played enough of this game to say that it's the game of the year yet, but my first impressions are that it's an improvement on MW2 and it's definatly the game I've been waiting for. If you read the one star reviews and decide not to pick this up then you're really missing out on a fun time. If you loved the other COD games and you like the old Vietnam error weapons and themes, then this game should be a lot of fun for youUPDATE:I've played a lot more of the multiplayer now so I'd like to make a few comments:1) The contract system is really cool. You'll have to stay on top of your contracts to maximize your potential for earning upgrades, but it really makes the matches a lot more fun. I've always got three different contracts going on, so I can earn extra points towards weapon and perk upgrades. (contracts are a way of gambling to complete tasks with your virtual currency and you can make extra cash if you complete the challenges in a set amount of game time.)2) I'd like to touch on the graphics again. Most of the levels are just stunning to me. If anything, I think they look and feel better than previous MW games. The level of detail and lighting effects are fantastic. There's also a lot of interactive things happening in the maps that can cause enemies to die or give you advantages. In one of the stages, a rocket launches...pretty fun to watch if your enemies aren't giving you too much of a challenge.3) Being able to upgrade your weapons and choose your perks is awesome. I've made my SMG and assault rifle really sweet now using the virtual currency and it's great to earn extra doing contracts.4) They have a world map similar to the one that was in Halo that shows you all the lights on the globe where people are playing...there's no one playing in Madagascar...that's too badCons:Matchmaking is severely broken as of now. I'm sure they'll fix it as soon as possible, but right now if you have a party bigger than three people, you'll probably have trouble joining games. Some of these issues may be related to moderate or strict NATs, but since it doesn't tell you what your NAT settings are in the game, we weren't 100% on that. You can always check through the Xbox network settings and if your NAT settings are not open, you may need to enable DMZ or port forward...just do a google search.Also, connections are showing up 3 or 4 green bars, but there still seems to be significant lag in some of the levels. This varies from match to match and I'm confident that they should be resolving it soon.The more I play this game, the more I love it. I'm really shocked to see so many negative reviews. I guess expectations were really high for this and there's a lot of haters out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
