{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"NeuroSplicer","summary":"PURE VISUAL MAGIC!","reviewText":"This is the most awaited fantasy cRPG in the past 2 years. For most part, IT DELIVERS!THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL cRPG GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED!The environments are detailed, realistic, and can be experienced from up close. Grass, flowers and tree branches moved in both FABLE and TITAN QUEST as well; these, however, seem so true I caught myself reaching for my...antihistamines! Weather affects and day-night alterations (you have to see the elongating shadows to believe them!) are just gorgeous! More importantly, these are not just eye-candy: certain NPCs and monsters appear only when the correct combination of time-of-day and weather coincide...The horizon is far and the clouds move in endless variations. It reminded me of the sky of the original UNREAL, another visually ground-breaking game at its time. PURE VISUAL MAGIC!The character (Geralt) can master both sword-fighting and magic spells (what is known as a Warlock). To some die-hard RPG fans this may seem like heresy, nevertheless, keep in mind that multi-classing is not unheard off. The movement repertoire for both practices are impressively designed. Especially the sword-fighting, it is at par to any console action game. And the spells (both offensive and defensive ones) are not less impressive.Free roaming? Yes and no. One can decide which parts of the map he will visit but loading is still needed to travel even annoyingly short distances. And since quests and side-quest still have to be completed, yes, eventually a subtle, yet ever present, directionality is present.Looting and bartering? Aaah...yes, sort of. You practically never change the sword you start off with (although you do get to improve its abilities), whereas good armor is only a little easier to come by compared to PLANESCAPE. On the upside, you get to gamble, have romantic relationships (FABLE was full of great ideas after all!) and bribe for information, so trinkets have other uses as well.Detailed character modifiers? Nothing like the AD&D; rules. You gain talents (gold, silver & bronze) which you can spend to improve your fighting or magical abilities. Pretty much like the DIABLO or the TITAN QUEST abilities systems.So, apart for the slight action-cRPG handicap, I have only two other objections. First, the...camera placement. Once more (remember NWN2...) auto-placement can get on your nerves as it targets your character even if that is not the most logical option. Second, the controls. They need getting used to as the fighting combos are easily ruined by clicking out of sync. You do eventually get the hold of it, however it keeps glitching.Whereas the BALDUR's GATES saga was story-heavy but (by today standards) visually lacking and the NEVERWINTER NIGHTS series was found, well, wanting in both aspects, THE WITCHER is the dream cRPG that BIOWARE was supposed to be capable of releasing all along. Finally it is here.RECOMMENDED!PS:It has come up in the readers' comments, so I feel I should warn that this is the CENSORED version (the original version has some nudity and more...realistic language). Obviously, once more, ATARI believes America to be violence-insatiable yet sexually-immature.I understand that these issues are important to many parents and they do have the right to raise their children as they see fit. Nevertheless, I would rather BOTH versions were available to chose from.The uncensored version is available in Europe (you could try amazon.uk).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2007"}

Those are the games that I play.  But this game is just so ridiculous that I can't give it good marks.  Can someone please tell me why Japanese developers have such a hard time putting together a coherent narrative?  From the very get-go, the story in this game makes no sense.  It's like starting a movie from the middle, a movie in which the dialogue is really stupid and the film won't spin right in the projector. The game throws characters and situations at the player with no explanation for what is going on.  The action sequences get so chaotic that it is often difficult to see what is going on, let alone kick some serious butt.  Some of the action sequences are timed--that is, you defeat all enemies before a certain thing happens or you die.  I can't stand timed combat; it just makes it frustrating and un-fun.  The combo list is absolutely ginormous, so large that it would be pretty much impossible to memorize them all, and I've never liked it when action games do that.  There's no way in hell I'm going to remember that many combos and I hate having to look them up while I'm playing the game.  Another thing that irks me is the low polygon count on Bayonetta's breasts.  You can actually see the polygon lines, which takes the sexual appeal out of it.  I would much rather recommend Darksiders or Dante's Inferno.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2010"}

Fueled by the next-generation power and fidelity of Frostbite 3,Battlefield 4provides a visceral, dramatic experience unlike any other.Only in Battlefield can you demolish the buildings shielding your enemy.

Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield.","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"The look, sound, and feel of a real Battlefield","reviewText":"After two years, and many trailers and previews, later, BF4 is finally back. Many BF3 players may have been wondering if this new installment of the series will be better than its predecessor or just another failed sequel.CAMPAIGN/STORY:  The story revolves around a civil war that is going on in China. In addition, antagonist Admiral Chang is trying to take over the government of China, which is led by Jin Jiu. Meanwhile, the United States still has tensions with the Russians. Therefore, if China's government is overthrown by Admiral Chang, Russia will support them and team up to go into a full-fledged war with the United States. Therefore, a Special Ops force called \"Tombstone\" is out to stop them. The force is led by Recker, Dunn, Graves aka \"Irish\", Pac, and Chinese Secret Service Agent, \"Hannah\". Players will play as Recker. Unlike BF3, the story is a lot more linear because it is played by the same characters, throughout the campaign. In my opinion, it gives the player more of a feel for each character. The main character that stands out is Irish. He IS a character. LolGAMEPLAY: The gameplay is similar to BF3. However, there are some new features in the game. On the campaign for example, BF4 now gives the player the ability to have more freedom and be more tactical. Players can now mark enemies in the map. Use this type of engagement very carefully! Once the player hits the R2 button, three enemies are randomly marked and the team will fire on them. Even if the enemy is behind cover, the team will continue to suppress the enemy with gunfire. Use the target markings on the enemies as a tactic and flank them. For a more tactical approach, the player can use a newly added proximity scanner. This device is used to detect all nearby enemies, vehicles or armor in the area. Each detected enemy, vehicle or armor will be marked until they are taken out.The campaign has the essence of multiplayer. For example, whenever a kill is made, the same message will pop up, such as \"enemy down\" and \"headshot\". Points are gained, when those actions are performed. If one of the teammates make a kill, a message of \"squad kill\" will pop up on the screen. Also, new weapons can be obtained, if a certain amount of points are gained, while playing on a level. Of course, if a weapon is taken away from an enemy, it will be saved and can be accessed in a weapon crate.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The game has a maximum 1080p output. Of course, this output can primarily be seen in the campaign. The graphics are not QUITE as good in multiplayer. Of course, that is just MY opinion. Overall, the animations are very similar to BF3, but a little better. This also goes for the infamous knife/melee animations. All in all, this game just has an authenticity that just cannot be found in a FPS. Period.MULTIPLAYER: For all of you Battlefield gamers, who said they wished their multiplayer moved as fast as COD's multiplayer, your wish has finally came true. BF4 moves at 60fps. The movements are much smoother. Aiming down the sights and getting kills feel much better. Of course, getting kills on the game is an accomplishment on its own. On BF3, everything felt so slow and I felt hindered in smaller maps. I also noticed new interactions and animations in many the maps, while playing. I walked up on a trailer and had an option to open the door. Of course, this can lead to paths to flank an enemy. While playing on one of the maps, it started to storm. Trees were blowing by strong winds. The rain was starting to poor down, very heavily. My character was also affected by the storm. I played on one map with snowy terrain. I aimed down the sights, and frost covered my optics, which altered my vision. That's very good detail. There are several new modes. Many complained that the maps are too big. Well, there are various game modes that allow more close-quarters and mid-range fighting.The customizations of the weapons are a lot more intimate. In other words, the player can actually see the weapon and see the changes of the weapon, according to the modifications that is chosen. The weapon's camo can also be changed. There are so MANY new weapons on the game. Many I have never even seen or heard of.The addition of the new Test Range gives players the opportunity to not only test out weapons, but to test out vehicles. This is a plus for casual gamers, as well as players, who just aren't familiar with using vehicles in Battlefield. No more trying to learn, while on the Battlefield! Also, the range gives you targets to shoot at, while in the vehicles. For example, I was in a helicopter and they had planes flying in the air that I could actually shoot at.SOUND: I would have to say that this is the most special feature of Battlefield. Of course, this is feature is one of the reasons why I gave my review its title. I can't get enough of hearing the echo of gunfire, explosions, or the sounds of buildings and structures falling. It is music to my ears. It is TOO close to the real thing. I saw a video of the devs go out with their big microphones and record the various sounds that are heard in Battlefield. It's hard work, but it's so worth it. Games should not have such real sound like this, but it does. Thanks, devs!!!!VERDICT: With a new engine, along with a much faster multiplayer, the game is definitely worth owning. Though the campaign is not bad, it is not necessarily anything to write home about. However, the game's new engine, along with much faster multiplayer gameplay make's this game a must own. I only gave it a four rating because I wished the campaign was just a little longer and better. I will say that the campaign is better than BF3's, however.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

I'm actually halfway through this adventure and once I actually do pick my Gameboy SP up, I don't want to put it down! There is just so much magic and pure vision to be experienced in such a little cartridge that I'm in shock. I can tell Flagship poured their heart, soul, hard work and love into it all!  Though I'm super-late in trying to seriously get through this masterpiece, I can safely say that it was well worth the wait! This is my absolute first Zelda game that I intend to beat and it feels like it stays true to the main series for the most part. I'm no Zelda head or anything, but a lot of the items are in some of the other ones so I'm just assuming that Flagship really nailed it!The story, more or less is basic and tried-and-true, but at times still touching. You start off in a quaint little place called Lynna City. From there your adventure begins. You get a chance to look around, meet the townspeople and simply explore the place. Eventually, you meet the Oracle of Ages and songstress, Nayru, who has all of the forest animals in a trance of purity with her gift of song. Eventually though, something terribly wrong is bound to happen right? Right! She becomes possessed by a wicked being, starts spreading chaos and must be recovered and kept safe from harm! I bet you can guess who's the one to do it. That's right--our buddy, Link!The heart of this fantasy you find out though, is actually the gameplay. You'll eventually learn to attack with your sword, swim, float on water, use seeds and seed guns, blow things up with your trusty bombs, set things ablaze, play songs with a harp to go between the present and past as well as numerous other things I'm sure I have yet to uncover! You really feel like a true warrior battling enemies, mini-bosses and final bosses (the latter two of which can only be found in dungeons).Speaking of dungeons (as well as some parts in the game in general), they are part of the reason the score isn't perfect. I feel that unless you are a seasoned veteran in the Legend of Zelda series, then you will most undoubtedly need a guide or FAQ of some kind to make it through this game many a time. Why? Well, for all the fun to be had in this adventure, there are almost equal part confusion, frustration and just down right \"impossible\" ways the game sets on you. I could go on and on about having to go into certain spaces through a certain pathway only to leave another a certain way and to come out another, many times, in order, to accomplish something already frustrating. Yes, it's a challenge but I feel it's more or less an unnecessary one and pops up more than need be in this game. Otherwise, the game is full of life, amazing puzzles and forces you to use your noggin' over repeatedly to conquer the task at hand.The graphics are very colorful, pleasant and get the job done. For the most part, there is nothing fancy to be seen here, but like I said, this game is still full of so much life in such a little space!The sounds, like the graphics are very pleasant. You will hear the original Zelda tune from the NES title, in an almost untainted way as well as a plethora of new compositions (to the best of my knowledge they're new anyway). Once in a great while, you'll get a tune like the one in the Fairie's Woods and you'll probably want to blow your head off after a while. But thankfully, in all of my 20+ hours of playing, I have only went there twice. Sound is overall, pretty good for a Gameboy Color game.Pros.+Delightful gameplay+Pleasant music+Cute, 2D sprites and colorful graphics invade the screen+Array of side quests waiting to be discovered+Easy to pick up and play anywhere, for as long as you want+Not a cakewalk by any meansCons.-Higher difficulty pans the fun sometimes and results in struggling or often referring to FAQs-Repetitive \"go up then down then left then right then left again\" scenarios get tiresome-The adventure sadly has to end someday (I knocked no points for this one, just sayin'.)A classic in its own right, Oracle of Ages meets and surpasses my wildest expectations of a Zelda game and will only inspire me to become a loyal fan. Though I believe I'll be hard pressed to play another game as fantastic as this one in the series (that includes you, Ocarina of Time!), I'm sure I can still look forward to experiencing some wonderful games.4.75 stars (or a 9.5/10).end note: HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

The microphone is removable, so you can use it just as a headset if you are not going to chat.  I like this feature quite a bit, but it could be a problem for kids, as they are prone to losing things.This headset has additional connection cables for the Xbox 360, so it is a multi-system, multi-function device that will work with both consoles, and with mobile devices.The sound quality is really good and doesn&#8217;t seem terribly bass heavy in presentation, so you can hear everything that is going on around you.  A great feature of these headphones is the ability to use them as regular headphones, as you can plug the standard mini plug into your iPod, phone, tablet, etc. and use them.  This is great, as it makes them a multi-purpose purchase instead of something that is simply for gaming.  The sound is certainly not as good as Grado or Sony MDR-7506 for music, but they are not bad at all and should be great for most people, especially those who will use them for multiple purposes.  The headset is capable of producing a very loud volume, so please be careful and protect your hearing.The headset comes with the adapter necessary to use the headphones with the new XBOX One controller, but you must update your controller before they will work.  This is a simple process that can be done in a couple of minutes:Connect your controller to your Xbox One console with a USB cable.Open the Settings application.Select System.Select Update Controller.The controller will be updated after this process is completed, but I was prompted for another update when the headset was actually plugged into the controller.

It's not particularly compelling as a game, but it consists of a generally good set of minigames that provide a tech demo of what the PlayStation Move system can do.The biggest issue any reviewer faces with this game is that while there is somewhat of a consensus of which games are better than which within the collection of sports offered, I have found that many people simply have different interests.  I've told people my opinions before: Table Tennis is the best game; Bocce, Disc Golf, and Gladiator are a lot of fun, if not perfect; Archery is decent but not great; Volleyball falls short of the mark.

I can play it, but it's not a game I particularly enjoy except as an occasional break from the games I like better.Each game could have its own review, but none are deep enough to warrant it.  (I'll come back to that point later.)Table tennis seems the most accurate, to me.  The paddle on screen moves accurately to represent how you manipulate the Move controller.  Spin your Move, and the on-screen paddle spins.  Lean it forward, the paddle moves toward the net.  Pull the Move away from the Eye, and you take a step back from the table in-game.  With some level of accuracy, you can spin the ball as you swing your paddle, much like you would in real life.  It's not exactly force-accurate, but swinging the paddle hard causes a hard shot, and lightly tapping the ball means you might not make it over the net.Disc golf is similar.  Angling your hand as you throw angles the disc, allowing you to curve shots appropriately.  You need to follow through and release at the right point, just as you would with a real frisbee.  The courses aren't particularly inspired, but they're sufficient to play a game with a friend, or championship mode by yourself.Bocce can be a tricky one, but winds up being a lot of fun if you learn to play it.  It controls sort of like how you'd expect to play a bowling game.  You can throw the ball or roll it, add sidespin or keep it going straight.  Follow through and release at the right point, and you will see pretty close results to what you'd expect.Volleyball is not as entertaining, to me.  You do not control your player's positioning--your player moves on his own.  You serve, bump, set, spike, and block using gestures and real movements.  I do not play much volleyball, but I have before; I simply found it difficult to perfect the timing used in the game.  I also don't enjoy games where I cannot control my character's position, so that's another point against volleyball.  Still, many have said they love this game, and I can't say it's without any merit.  Two move controllers can be used for this game, but I do not see a huge benefit from doing this, as most of the controls seem more like gestures than 1:1 representations of your hands.Gladiator duel is a bit more fun, to me.  However, it is more fun when played with 2 Move controllers, which not everyone will have.  Blocking is done with one Move controller, and attacking is done with the other.  You swing your weapon at the enemy and can thrust, slice, or bludgeon as you see fit.  Your weapons will closely match your real movements, within reason.  With only one controller, a button is used to block, which means you have less complete control over your limbs indepentently.  You may just wind up breaking a sweat playing this one, if you get too into it.Finally, Archery.  You can also optionally use two Move controllers for archery.  I actually do enjoy it with 2 controllers more, but I'm not sure why.  It feels essentially the same, but with an extra arm involved.  It's entertaining to do some target shooting and play some of the varied modes. (tic tac toe, moving targets, \"tug of war\", etc.)  Archery has more variety than the other minigames.  However, it is not among my favorites, because my arm does get tired from holding it up to fire arrows so much.  You have to draw an arrow from your \"quiver\" (over your shoulder) and hold it up to fire.  Fun and innovative, but I'm sure there will be many people with some tired arms.  Maybe take a break for some Bocce or Disc Golf between rounds?Each of these games has a difficulty setting, which generally modifies the enemy AI as well as the assistance the game will provide you.  (For instance, a table tennis shot on \"gold\" may overshoot the table, but on bronze it may land on it due to auto-assist)  It's helpful to ramp up the difficulty while you learn the proper motions to play the game.  I recommend two Move controllers, if you have them available.  If not, you will still get a lot of enjoyment from most of the games.  Gladiator is the only one I would say is a lesser game without a second Move controller.The one thing that disrupts gameplay, in my opinion, is the unnecessarily long load times.  The environments are relatively simple, all things considered, and starting a match should not take as long as it does.  Having to recalibrate the Move often doesn't help, but it's not as terrible as the load times.  I was hoping this would be patched, but it never was.  So, be prepared to take a breather--you might appreciate it if playing an exerting game, but for the most part the load times are unwelcome.At the current price, even though this is an older Move title, this should be in every Move owner's collection of games.  It's not a full game with story and depth, but it is an entertaining if shallow experience.  Playing with friends makes it even more entertaining.  If you're not familiar with a sport, that's okay--there are tutorials to provide information on the rules of each game, including tips for how far to stand from the TV, and other advice.  Sports Champions offers a good tech demo of what the Move is capable of.  Hopefully we'll see more titles that use the controller as well as this game does, but I haven't seen many yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00434FED2","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"What an experience!","reviewText":"A Michael Jackson videogame? It's been done before (Moonwalker) but certainly not THIS way! Michael Jackson The Experience is just that, an experience. It actually feels as if you are Michael; it's the closest thing anyway. The Nintendo Wii's technology allows the player to perform MJ's dance moves and feel a part of it all. The Wii version of the game is already out and there are DS and PSP portable versions available as well, and the game will be released on PS3 and XBOX 360 in the near future.The beauty of Michael Jackson The Experience is that you really feel it, you're into it and dancing along to Michael's moves which is amazing. Anyone can start playing right away and get into it right from the first play; of course it's harder when beginning but the player will pick it up pretty fast. I was slightly disappointed that you unlock the tutorial videos as you play and that they were not available from the start but it's not like it ruins the experience. The idea of the game is simple, you're either Michael or one of the backup dancers and the icon on the top left corner of the screen shows you what you're supposed to do, it shows the move. There are also golden moves that give you more points, with points you get a rating from 1-5 stars. 26 songs can be played and if you buy the game at Wal-mart or HMV you get the bonus song \"Another Part of Me\" me from Bad.Personally I don't play The Experience for rating I play it for fun and for exercise. Careful, it's harder than it looks!  It can be hard to match perfectly the moves in question as the responsiveness is not always 100% accurate. Oh and you will need space to play this game. I was a little surprised with the songs included because yes, the hits are there, but there are some songs I would never have had expected to be on it like Ghosts! I'm hoping to lose a few pounds as well; this game is an excellent way to exercise, and if you don't believe me try it! I bet that after a few songs you will be sweating as much as I was! I think the exercise factor is important here because whether you want to exercise or not this game is fun and is a great way to stay in shape. This can only enhance an already stellar game.I'm just glad that with everyone trying to make some money off MJ's death that this game is truly worth it. Fans young and old will no doubt enjoy this game and dancing along with the King of Pop, I just wish Michael would be alive to see the enjoyment he brings to so many people! I think Michael would've had approved of this game, it's hard to do otherwise. If you are a fan of Michael or know someone who is this is a must have and a perfect gift. There are plenty of good dance games for the Nintendo Wii such as the Just Dance series and the Dance Dance Revolutions games and this is without a doubt a great addition to the dance games category This game has hardly left my Wii since I have it. 5/5 for both a fun, well constructed game and for the exercise it provides.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}

The Dead or Alive 1 gameplay is just like the original, bringing the classic feel and fun. On the other hand, Dead or Alive 2 is definitely updated. You get the same characters and locations, but the graphics have been revamped to take advantage of the XBox's engine.I have to say this is GREAT because I'm a huge fan of Dead or Alive 3 and its amazing graphics. To be able to have that same level of graphic achievement - with blowing leaves, footprints in the snow, and so on - is just great. The costumes and characters are all quite distinctive and really let you get a feel for the personality of each individual.The main theme is done by Aerosmith, but each level has its own music that fits well with the scenario. You get to fight in Japanese gardens, on the Great Wall of China, in a peaceful forest, and in other quite detailed spots. Not only are the three dimensional areas visually spectacular, but you can knock a character off a given section of the map and continue the fight on lower levels. It really adds to the strategy and gameplay.There are great new scenes to help you learn more about the Dead or Alive universe. It's like reading a prequel to your favorite story - suddenly the characters and their actions take on new meanings.The online gameplay lets you take your skills and techniques online, to test against players around the world. Instead of being 'stuck' with the gameplay in the game (which can easily last for weeks), you could play 24 hours a day and never run out of new opponents to face.If I have any complaint about this game, it's that while the guys are in really cool costumes, the women all seem to be wearing costumes that clearly show off their underwear and big breasts. Some people DO play these games who aren't obsessed with women's underwear and inflatable chests.That being said, it is at least great that female fighters are treated with respect, and it's considered normal to have just as many female characters in a fighting game as males. It wasn't that long ago that a fighting game would be males only, with women stuck on the sidelines waving little flags.A great fighting game in general, and a must-have for DOA fans to fill in the storyline.4.5/5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000NJH6YG","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"A game at odds with itself","reviewText":"You may note that I rated the game as \"fun\" but overall \"poor\". The gameplay can become a bit addictive, after a point. Once the hero becomes powerful and just doesn't stop, you can maul your way through enemies that once gave you problems. There's also a massive loot system, and you can combine simlar items to make higher-class ones. This makes for an incredible depth of customization, and a fun factor in picking your equipment, especially once you became the aforementioned death-dealing machine.But up until you hit that mark, the game is just horrible. Heck, even after you hit it the game itself is still horrible. The story has some potential, but ultimately sounds like something that a two-year-old came up with. The hero loses his sister, searches for her, finds out she's been kidnapped, and then goes on a journey of self-discovery as he uncovers the truth behind a legend surrounding his family and the powers he and his sister share. The dialog used to deliver the story is absolutely bottom-barrel trash, and the voice acting throughout the game will make you cringe. I got to the point where I just read the dialog as quickly as I can so can skip the poor voice acting.The map is asinine. First, it's huge, which is nice. But whoever made it basically took a giant square and ran a randomizer over it, plugging in a few numbers for \"max height\". Read: the game has too many hills. They're everywhere. There's no such thing as a flat plain anywhere. It's just up and down and up and down. It's like the developers never actually went outside to see if what they made makes any sense against the real world. I mean, it detailed and can be pretty at times, but the hills are just a pain. This wouldn't be a problem if not for two things:1) it makes exploration very hard. If you take a wrong turn over a hill, you can end up sliding some stupid distance and not be able to climb back up. Because that one hill will be surrounded by dozens of others, most of which will prevent you from just hopping back up to where you left off, it can literally take 10 minutes to return to the top of it just to go the other way. This is incredibly obnoxious as you MUST explore the entire world to get the location achievements.2) your horse is an idiot. Once you get one, you'll find that the horse randomly can't pass certain types of terrain. This is especially true of ~60% of the roads, which are bizarrely designed like very deep and broad ruts that are cut into the landscape instead of just being on top of the surface. The sides of most of these roads are so steep that the horse can't walk across them. You'll turn to leave the road to go explore some feature and the horse will get to the edge and then just stop or, more annoying, turn completely around and go the other way? You have to stop the horse, get up off of it, walk across over to where you wanted the a-hole to go, and then call it to you. You'll find that it can, in fact, make it across that spot, just not with you on it.Speaking of the horse, it's annoying for another set of reasons:1) it's supposed to make fighting foot soldiers easier, but it doesn't. The horse isn't very maneuverable, and the controls are just poorly done. So trying to fight enemies on foot is a pain of trying to get the horse to face the right direction and trying to get your character to swing his weapon on the right friggin' side of the horse. You also can't wield a two-handed weapon other than a bow from horse back, but you can use double-wielding from horseback. It's just weird.2) you can pick up herbs and random objects lying on the ground and way out of reach from horseback, but you can't loot the enemy you just killed or open treasure chests from horseback. So you have to keep jumping on and off the thing every time you get in a fight.3) the controls aren't just unintuitive, they're anti-intuitive. You have to press the up button to move forward. Normal, right? Not so when you realize that holding the button causes the horse to accelerate, and rapidly. And letting it go doens't stop the horse. Push up and let go of the controller, and the horse will keep moving forward. Neat? Kind of. But now you need to stop because some wolves are attacking you. You have to push \"down\" to stop. But you can only do that when the horse's movement is aligned with the screen. That is, if you've turned the camera to look to the side, you have to turn it back to face forward, THEN hit down to stop the horse. Otherwise, hitting down does something random, whether turning the horse to face toward the camera or turning it away or turning it some other random direction.It's better to find a horse that can carry a lot of weight and just use it as a travelling treasure chest. Just park it near a transporter or in a nearby city and come back to it as you explore and find treasure you want to keep. The horse can save you a lot of travel time going between towns and cities, but only in areas where you've already killed all the enemies. And the transporter system works better anyway, and you don't want to try to be on the horse INSIDE the towns and cities because it's so unmaneuverable. I actually got my horse caught on a merchant to where the merchant's character was litteraly INSIDE my horse and neither of us could move, and I couldn't dismount because that button is the same as the talk-to-the-merchant button (poor controls). Fortunately, I was able to twist around and get free, but it took a while and was pain.The controls are bad in every way. In combat, there's no blocking or dodging, just a \"jump back\". Swinging your weapon can take a while. Not that the swing is slow, but that it can literally take up to a FULL SECOND for the character to respond to the button press and swing his weapon. You can only swing a limited number of times, but that number appears to be random and situationally based and I have no idea what it is. I just know that after X-number of swings, I should just go ahead and hit the jump-back button before I get creamed. The \"jump\" button is also not the prototypical \"A\". It's \"Y\"? X doesn't attack, but draws your weapon. The attack button is a trigger, but if you press it while under attack and your weapon isn't drawn, you don't attack? It's like the character is telling you, \"I'm getting hit and you're pressing the attack button, but my weapon's not drawn, so Ima just sit here and bleed everywhere.\" What the hell?The \"Power Wheel\" is a nice concept, but poorly executed. Each weapon has different skills associated with it, but the skills are grouped together so that if you assign a type for one slot, you assign several different weapon-specific abilities to that slot. All you have to do is change weapons, and the slot automatically changes to that weapon's skill from the same group. It's a nice touch, BUT, when you select the power from the D-pad, it doesn't pause gameplay to bring up the actual wheel. It just changes an icon in the top left of the screen, and because of the inaccuracies of the D-pad you often get the wrong power. And once you've selected the right power, you have to then press the other shoulder trigger. This makes combat a malay of pushing the attack trigger, desperately trying to select a power from the D-pad, and pushing the power trigger. I just leave mine on my heal spell and don't bother with the others because most of them have low percentage success rates anyway. All you really need in the game is just a lot of strength and an axe weapon with high slashing and bludgeon damage, and you can run over just about everything. The powers are mostly superfluous and not very useful.Also, the treasure system is vast. This is, at first, a boon because you get to sweep through and get more and more powerful items. However, in order to combine items to make a higher-class one, you have to have two of the exact same type. Each piece of armor has a \"Set\" number, and there are least 600 \"sets\" in the game. A set includes helmet, chest, gauntlets, leggings, and boots. That's 3000 items in armor alone. Then there's dozens of different types of shields, and at least 100 different types of weapons, and at least 9 different types of ring. There aren't that many chests or enemies in the game, which means you're not going to find a lot of the same item in the wild. Some items are very powerful, but also super rare, so in order to get those to a decently effective and high enough class you have to find them and purchase them. This can be difficult as earning gold is limited since enemies do not respawn, chests do not refill, and you can only steal from each NPC one time. My suggestion is to save up until the very end and just power up your favorite end-game end-bringer by visiting shops.The camera is also very annoying. It's constantly recentering, but the default angle the camera centers on is mind-bogglgingly bizarre. When you're on your horse, the camera recenters to what seems to be a large angle toward the sky. But since most of the game is bizarrely hilly as I've said before, and you'll be facing down-slope most of the time, this means that most of what you care about is going to be at the very bottom of the screen. If you try to angle the camera down, it will instantly retilt back up. When you're not on your horse, the angle is different whether you're running across a semi-flat area (usually ACROSS the side of a hill rather than down it), the angle is slightly upward. But if you're running downhill, the angle changes to look at a spot about a meter in front of your character, making objects just a few meters away disappear off the top of the screen. So you have to angle the camera upward to see where you're going. You also can't just hold the camera an angle since moving the stick even slightly will always move the camera as far to one side as it will go. So you have to constantly fight the camera's recentering by tweaking the right stick in the direction you want to move the camera. The entire game. Non-stop. It. Is. Really. Annoying.Then there's the frame rate. The camera doens't move smoothly in any sense of the word. When turning, the screen jumps by at least an entire degree at a time. Running forward is jumpy too: object don't glide by the way they do in most smooth-motion games. They jump toward and eventually past you. The motion is eye-jarring horrible. You'll want to play this game on a small a screen as you can so you don't ruin your eyes with the motion-sickness-inducing frame rate. Part of the problem with the rate is from the fact that the game seems to load up the ENTIRE WORLD into memory, rather than just a small piece. If you can get high enough on one side of the map, you can see clear to the other side of it, including cities, towers, and fortresses. Most features, like smaller towns and NPCs, will pop into sight as you get close enough. But the actual lay of the land is visible at any distance, and you can see the trees being rendered from far away. If the developer had actually put a horizon that, the game would be a lot smoother.Finally, there's the character themselves. I don't think they hired an artist to create the wireframes. They're just atrocious. Everything. The main character's main, NPCs, Orcs, Groms, and wolves are all ugly. Wolves don't have any of the sleekness or elegance associated with real wolves, either: they all look like pug-faced pitbulls and run around like spastic poodles. Bears are hideous. The only things that look halfway decent are the skeletons, and that's only because there's no a lot to them to screw up visually.This game is bad. It's got a lot of good ideas, but it's just poorly executed. It definitely won't thrill you, and can be very frustrating at times. The dialog sucks, the story is sub-par, and the controls are bad. It is, however, mindless and generally easy to play. If you ignore the story and spend a few hours building up your character, it be an somewhat relaxing stress-relief to sit back, turn off your brain, and just tear through enemy ranks. When the price drops below $10, it can be worth the buy to have something to do for a week or so. But don't buy this game expecting to be wowed. Because, as an actual game, it does suck and sucks hard.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

By all rights, this game should not exist at all. It started out as a new IP under publication by Activision and then they decided they wanted to make it the third installment of the True Crime series giving it the name True Crime: Hong Kong. After many problems and delays Activision shut it down completely. After that Square Enix picked it up and development started on it again. The name `Sleeping Dogs' was given as the title because Square Enix did not own the rights to use True Crime. Sleeping Dogs a lot of good for a game that has had so much problems getting off the ground, but it is not without its problems, to say the least.You take on the role of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong born and American raised undercover cop, who has moved back to Hong Kong to get inside the notorious Sun On Yee sect of the Chinese triads. The story here seems quite standard, now I haven't finished the game yet, but I am pretty far into it. It seems Wei Shen starts out as a normal undercover cop and soon finds himself slipping deeper and deeper into his cover, making it hard for him to draw the line between police officer and gangster.Sleeping Dogs would feel a lot like another GTA clone except for it taking Place in Hong Kong does give it some separation. The game as a whole is basically the same as all other open world shooters. You have carjackings, gunplay, pretty standard story arcs, cops, drug dealers and murders. However, Sleeping Dogs does some things that make it feel somewhat refreshing, except most everything it offers is kind of clunky. You do missions for the triad starting out doing grunt work, like any other games where you are the new guy in the gang and it seems to go pretty smoothly and it moves the story along, but you also do police jobs and those a lot of the time feel forced into the game and out of place. The triad stuff does have a few surprises along the way that keeps the story somewhat interesting. Just when it starts to flat line, something happens that perks interest back up and loosely keeps a hold on you.The game does a great job of capturing the realism of Hong Kong, or so I assume, being I have never been there. Sleep Dogs does a great job of making the player feel like they are there with the environments, with how everything looks and how they feel while running around the city. There are cool landmarks to see and the city feels alive with people and cars all around and even down all the alleyways there are things going on. It makes exploring the world quite fun, for those that have never been to a region quite like this, it can seem like playing in the world of a fantasy game.I have to give it to United Front Games with the melee combat of Sleeping Dogs. It is far from great, but it is doable and the game puts a good amount of focus on it. It is safe to say that a good amount of fighting in this game is hand-to-hand and that is something you never see in these types of open world games. The melee combat does reflect that of Batman: Arkham City, but not at all as polished. Just like a lot of things in this game, the fighting is kind of clunky, but it holds up well enough. While in fights the game also offers environmental takedowns that are usually really cool that really add to the melee combat, so much so that all the gunplay in the game is actually more boring. All it takes is dragging a guy over to a highlighted area and pushing a button. You can do anything from kicking a baddie into a telephone booth to shredding their face in an air conditioner fan. Yeah, it can get pretty bloody.As stated above, the melee fighting makes the gun fighting boring, but that is helped by the shooting mechanics itself. Again, the gunplay is pretty standard, but is clunky for the most part. It seems obvious that more time and effort went into the hand-to-hand combat than went into the gun fighting. The biggest offense the gunplay does in Sleeping Dogs is going from none at all for a good majority of the beginning to all of a sudden guns everywhere all the time. It really feels like United Front Games didn't trust themselves enough or that there would be a huge backlash from gamers if guns didn't get involved, but basically they ended up taking over. I like to think that if there is a sequel, there will be less gunplay and more polished melee combat.When doing missions, you get points depending on who you are doing the missions for. If you are doing missions for the police, you will get police points. If you are doing triad missions you will get triad points and if you are doing just random side missions (called favors) you get face points. These points go to three separate leveling systems for police, triad and face. There is no real good reason these are all separated. With each new level of any of these unlocks new abilities, but all could be kept together really. It seems that maybe the police and triad points have something to do with how deep Wei Shen gets into feeling for the triad, or maybe how level headed he stays, but it doesn't seem to be the case so far (again I haven't finished the game). Also it is easy to get triad points and easy to lose police points, which also leads me to believe there is no significant point to these point systems being separate. You gain triad points whenever you kill someone and you can lose police points as easy and sliding into a light post when driving in a mission. It makes the point system feel completely unbalanced.As a whole Sleeping Dogs is not a great game, but compared to other games that had the development problems, push backs and cancellations it offers a lot to gamers. I would love to see a sequel to Sleeping Dogs. I think if United Front Games and Square Enix polish everything up, they could seriously have a series that rivals the Grand Theft Auto series. At best, Sleeping Dogs is worth checking out at least. Maybe a rental or if you can find it on sale someplace pick it up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

All hype really does is infect people with this stupid notion that the game will be the be all end all of gaming; the greatest game ever made. And then, when the game is actually released none of their expectations are filled, and so everyone is disappointed. Especially if the game concept has been in development limbo for years. Despite what most people will spout out, the current version of Too Human was actually conceived three years ago. The *idea* of Too Human was conceived almost 13 or so years ago, but that hardly matters since the Too Human on the shelves is a much different beast entirely.Too Human received mostly average reviews from professional critics, and even some downright negative reviews, though I have to disagree with everything they have said. In truth I think they didn't understand the game, nor did they have the time and energy to actually put some time into it. To be fair, the game does no hand holding of the player, and pretty much nothing explained. Heck, even the game manual doesn't explain much. No, the player is left to their own devices to figure out the game and the strange controls. And I can certainly see why some people would be put off by this. Too Human isn't your average 'hack n slash' game like all the reviews are claiming it is. In fact its quite original. For one, all of your melee attacks are set to your right analog joystick; tap once and your character slides to an enemy in the vicinity and sends them flying up into the air. From here you can jump up with them and juggle attack them for some serious combo damage, or you could pull out your pistols and fire away. Also, the camera is fixed, giving way to some awesome cinematic moments, and some great frustration. By pushing the Right Bumper you can align the camera behind you. It would have been nice to have an option to fully control the camera, but like I said Too Human is not your average 'hack n slash'. Thirdly, the game places a lot of focus (read: A LOT) on armor and weapon customization. The options are literally endless. Depending on how fast and how skillful you kill an enemy they will drop armor, weapons, powerups and even health (read: loot). The faster and more extravagent you are able to dispatch an enemy rewards you with some awesome loot (good armor, good weapons etc), while the longer you take reduces these chances. Some enemies drop nothing. Its a game of chance, really. But this makes the combat fun, as you never know what treats you will end up with once the smoke clears and your foes are laying in a pile.Too Human's story is rather interesting. The game takes place in a world where Norse Mythology and Cyberpunk meet. The world has been wiped clean by evil robots (ruled by Hel and Loki), and humanity has been relegated to a single outpost/city that houses the Gods as well. The Gods are cybernetically enhanced beings and they run the gamot of Norse Mythology. You play as Baldur, brother to Thor. The two main enemies are Loki and Hel (Loki's daughter). Overall the story is average, with the best parts happening at the very end and setting up what I think will be an amazing sequel.When you die in Too Human, Valkyrie come down from the sky and take your body to the afterlife. This involves a 15 second death animation, one that frustrated many players and reviers alike, but they probably didn't understand the reason for the super long death animation. You are supposed to be punished for dying, since it is very possible to make it through each level without dying. Since good loot is set on a timer essentially, when you die you are forced to sit out for 15 seconds, thus worsening your chances of good loot. Its very unforgiving, but hey so is life. The trick is to...not die; To use strategy and to fully learn the controls. If you can't manage this, then Too Human isn't the game for you. Remember, it is not your average hack n slash game. You can't get by with just spamming buttons. You have to know what you are doing.And you will probably die a lot, that is if you just barrage through the game without learning the controls, effecively managing your weapons and armor, runes etc. In fact, a good chunk of your game time will be in the menu screens, swapping out armor, checking stats, and changing weapons. This may sound boring to some, but Diablo and Balder's Gate loot lovers will love this aspect. There is nothing greater than getting an awesome loot drop after an epic battle; The spoils of war. When you die, your armor and weapons take damage, so if you die a lot you will have to keep swapping out your weapons/armor because once they reach a certain point they will not work so well. The trick is to keep from dying, like in any other game.For enemies, they come at you in hordes. You will almost always find yourself up against 10 - 15 enemies at once, sometimes including really tough mini bosses. Some of the enemies shoot arrows and some shoot rockets. Many times you will find yourself faced with 15 + enemies, all the while rockets and arrows are flying at you. It can get pretty tough, but if you know your controls then you will have no problem.In Too Human there are only four enemy types: Goblins, Dark Elves, Trolls and Undead. While this may seem very limited its actually pretty awesome. There are different variants of each enemy type. Some will be aligned to a certain element, like Fire or Ice, Poison or Energy, while others will be aligned with none. Then there are the light/dark variants which are immune to certain attacks (light enemies are immune to ranged attacks while dark enemies are immune to melee). All in all there are enough enemy variants to keep things very interesting, and the real trick of combat is to figure out the best approach and the best attack.Too Human is broken up into four maps (dungeons or levels, if you will), and one main hub, which serves as the city or town for the game. Here you will be able to buy/sell/repair weapons and items, use the weapon/armor blueprints you find during missions to make new weapons, and further the story along through cutscenes. The one thing I didn't like about Too Human was that you cannot interact with any of the city/town folk. They are there to pretty much serve as scenery. Sometimes they will engage in conversation with one another and you can listen to it, but it would have been nice to be able to actively talk with them like an RPG. There are only four levels/dungeons/missions, but they are pretty long. Each mission has 3 - 5 stages in it and a final boss at the end. Not to mention the myriads of mini bosses throughout. The level design is pretty awesome. Eerie cyberpunk-meets-mythology level design and some really good looking graphics make trudging through each level a visual joy. On each level there are 'secret battle arenas' that can be entered by finding a secret passageway. In these arenas you will be faced with either a time challenge, or simply a massive amount of enemies. Defeat all the enemies in the time alloted (for the time challenges), or succesfully kill all the enemies (every other challenge) and you will be rewarded with great loot. However, if you die in the process you will lose the arena and not be able to access it again. Like I said, Too Human is very unforgiving. In addition to the secret arenas there are \"cyberwells\". These wells lead to a place called 'cyberspace' where Balder can learn powers and interact with objects to make things happen in the game world. The powers you learn will only be useable in 'cyberspace' and are more puzzle oriented than anything. Basically, you will go into cyberspace and have to find a way to open a door or a bridge which corresponds to the in-game world. Once you do this, you can advance the level. While it could have been a neat concept it really comes off as filler (think the explorable planets in Mass Effect).On to the loot: There are thousands of different weapons, armor and power ups to find in Too Human, and you will definitely not find it all in one play through. Every weapon and armor item is leveled, and each has its own buffs and perks. The best weapons/armor in the game are called \"Elite\", which offer up the best stats. Its also the hardest to find. Alternatively you can find blueprints for Elite armor and weapons but it costs a fortune to make. There are so many weapon/item customization options that the possibilities are literally endless. Now, being that this is a fantasy game the weapons and armor have hilarious names like 'Jotun boots of blinding speed\" etc, but its really fun collecting all of it, selling what you don't need, and getting the truly awesome Elite armor/weapons.Your character levels up with experience points as well, and each time you level up you will get two points with which you can distribute amongst a skill tree. You can add new abilities to your character or buff other traits, add skills to weapons etc. At one point in the game you will be tasked with choosing whether or not you want to be a Cybernetic (which focuses on cybernetic enchancements) or a Human (which focuses more on natural enhancements). Both ways are equally powerful and offer up two different ways to play the game. In addition to this there are 5 different character types to choose from : Commando, Champion, Bio-Engineer, Defender, and Berzerker. Each have a specialty (i.e the Champion is a well rounded character, the Bio-Engineer can heal himself, the Berzerker has aggro), and each class offers a whole different playing style opening up much replay value.Long enough review yet? This is why I say that gamers, reviewers and critics did not give this game a chance, nor could they. Too Human is not the type of game you can play for one hour and write a comprehensive review on. There is just so much going on, so much to offer and many, many ways to play through the game. I'm on my second playthrough with my original character and I have yet to reach level 50 (the maximum level), and I have only found one mish mashed set of Elite armor and weapons. And I will definitely be playing through it again with the other classes.With all the loot to collect, secret battle arenas to find, cyberwells to activate, character classes to choose from, alignments to choose from, and achievements to unlock Too Human is easily a 100 + hours of gameplay, and then some. And honestly, Too Human takes brains to play, so if you don't have em' I'd suggest staying away. Diablo I and II and Balder's Gate fans rejoice, the Xbox finally has a dungeon crawler worth of the name!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

First off the 360 version looks very good, I have the PS3 and the PS4 versions so I can defiantly say 360 looks almost as good as the PS3 version with a bit less detail and more a cartoon feel.. It is a step above the PS3 version in the purely the gameplay  department, because it has none of  frame rate issues  present in the PS3  version. Which  does affect gameplay. The game had so much hype it would have been hard for any game to live up to. Unfortunately it does not, the gameplay is rather boring. The hacking part is very basic, and the driving and combat are floating all over the place. It feels less in control than what you want or expect. I still enjoyed/enjoy the game on all platforms but not as much as I had hoped.The game is still fun, but the lack of multiplayer is annoying but you don't miss much. it's  a mess. Once you finish the main story, the side missions are not good enough to come back and finish, and really you have no incentive to do so.

What makes the G27 better than the GT is the huge leap from the GT's \"manu-matic\" up-down shifter to a proper clutch and six-position gear box.  I don't get to log a lot of hours in the sims, but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that being able to downshift from 5th to 3rd while pulling the e-Brake can be the win-or-lose difference that the GT's up-down shifter lacks.  I could still use my Driving Force GT for playing NASCAR Racing because the tracks are typically high-speed circles (and god help you if you skip a gear), but for anything else, the gearbox is a huge must.  It's a real rush being able to downshift through various Dirt, Need for Speed, and other titles.Physically, the G27 feels more solid than the GT, substituting aluminum and leather for the GT's plastic.  The wheel's crossbar and the shifter paddles are aluminum.  The wheel, shifter, and boot cover are leather, and the whole thing is bristling with buttons.  Unlike the GT's PlayStation-centric button mappings, the G27's steering-wheel buttons have a layout like the MOMO, which is a smart move given how many people graduate up from the MOMO to the G27.  The unit containing the wheel is separate from the gearbox, which means tons of flexibility for mounting the parts in any cockpit configuration you like.  The main unit branches out its wiring, running two long cords for the gearbox to the right and two down leftwards to the pedals.  From the pedals goes the power cable that has a long cord for plugging into an outlet.  If you have to stow the set in between racing sessions, the wheel and gearbox are hand-screwed onto the edge of a desk or coffee table via clamps that grab from the underside.  The pedals will slip and slide on a smooth floor, but have fold-out teeth that will grab onto carpet.  All three pieces have threaded holes for anyone wanting to screw the parts onto some home-crafted handiwork (my neighbor built his own wheeled wooden cockpit with a Honda seat).I've driven quite a number of cars in real life.  I've personally owned:- a '65 Ford Mustang- an '87 Camaro Z-28- a '97 Eagle Talon AWD- an '83 Mercedes Coupe 380SL- an '07 Subaru STII regularly shoot through winding country roads and enjoy the feel of a real vehicle--within safe limits.  Driving the G27, I can safely push past those limits...and I can tell you that the only thing missing from the real thing are the G-forces.  Wheel resistance is firm, the pedals each feel slightly different, and the short-throw shifter makes changing gears a breeze.  There's even a way to program \"Reverse\" into your games just like a real vehicle--where my STI has the lift-up ring, the G27 has you push down and reach for 6th gear--it counts as a different 'button press' than 6th gear.There is one huge drawback to the G27, and I lay it at the feet of the game designers:  the support.  Games like Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit came out with no support for driving wheels, shocking the racing game community.  Months later, a patch remedied the situation, but by then the damage was done:  those of us who love racing games are seeing titles come out with no steering wheel support (Blur, I'm looking at you).  Thankfully, Logitech does everything it can to try to meet games halfway:  if you're on the PS3, support is fairly native, but the gearbox may or may not factor into your games.  If you're on the XBox 360, the story may be the same (haven't tried it myself).  PC gamers are on the safest ground:  Logitech's free software not only supports Windows 7 and Vista in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions, it also allows you to hand-program the wheel a lot of different ways.  Settings can be mapped to keystrokes, keystroke combinations, or macros that combine more than one button or axis (or combination).  You can make your settings global to every use of the wheel, or game-specific, and those settings can get as granular as level of force feedback, percentage of resistance, degrees spin of the wheel, dead zone and more.  There are a lot of sites out there giving advice for specific game configurations (I'll give you a great one in the comments), and there's even settings that can 'fool' a game into giving you additional support.  The gearbox is really the rub, though, and you want to check the Logitech site first for the list of officially-supported games (I'll put that in the comments too).If you love driving and know how to work a clutch, do yourself a favor and spring for the G27:  you'll be glad you did.  Support is somewhat limited, but for those games that support it, the G27 is everything but the G-s.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2012"}

JAGELLA","summary":"Far Cry--Another Great Shooter","reviewText":"Hello Everybody!I've heard so much about Far Cry, that I finally had to give it a shot. I was a bit skeptical, and I thought it might be another Half-Life or Chronicles of Riddick: That is, it might be a decent game but not everything it was cracked up to be.Well for once, the pundits were right! Far Cry is a real piece of work. The levels are amazing, and it's the shooter that's the next best thing to being there. They're not just for show either because the different parts of these levels can be effectively used to battle and sneak your way through your missions. It features one suspenseful firefight after another, and when you're not gunning you're using stealth to nail your next victim. I believe this is the only shooter I know of that actually gets stealth right. There's a seamless blend of action and stealth, and you can easily switch from one to the other to finish the mission.Like anything else, Far Cry is by no means perfect. For one thing it's HARD! On many of the missions I'm loading in the last save point again and again. The fact that you can't save anywhere doesn't help either, and you'll probably end up replaying much of these tougher levels ad infinitum. Interestingly enough, the difficulty actually seems rather reasonable, though, and in some sense it actually adds to the game's enjoyment because you feel a real high of triumph once you've finally made it through.Far Cry also has some technical glitches, and the sound of a weapon sometimes keeps going off after you have killed its former possessor. For some reason I cannot control the sound volume with the control on my keyboard, and even the sliders in the sound options menu won't work properly. Also, the game often locks up when I'm in the process of shooting my first grunt which is a real problem when I'm in the thick of combat.Nevertheless, I must call Far Cry a great game, warts and all. Its good parts are so good that they overshadow the game's imperfections. It's been a long time coming for me because the last time I found shooters I thought were great was way back in 2002 when I discovered Aliens v. Predator II and Soldier of Fortune II. Doom III was good, and Half-Life II was very good, but Far Cry really sets a precedent. So move over Unreal and Unreal Tournament, Quake II and Wolfenstein 3D'there's a new inductee into my personal computer game hall of fame. Far Cry is a great shooter, and someday I might need to say that it's the best ever. If I do, then I won't be surprised.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2007"}

If you've seen Saving Private Ryan, you know what you're in for. Head-throbbing noise and death all around you.The game goes for instant immersion. You're barely off on your first trip when shells are landing, guns are hammering in your ears and there is complete chaos. You have to be careful not to hit a friendly while you're blasting away at the bad guys.  You can barely see what you're doing. Your friends drag you along when you're hurt, and the rain and smoke can blind you.Call of Duty 3 does a great job of giving you a WWII environment with character. You're in destroyed homes with cans on the shelves and holes blown into bedroom walls. You can see the smoke drifting across the main street, the plunks of rain as it falls through the boards. Bodies collapse realistically. The PS3's high def graphics really shine here.The controller also adds to the sense of immersion. When you want to whap someone in the head with your gun, you just give the controller a sharp twist. You also use the controller for other steering-related tasks as well.How about the sound? Playing the Call of Duty series always gives me a headache after a while :) But that's the point - war wasn't fun. It's not about cool pop soundtracks while you blow away the enemies. It's about listening carefully for footsteps in the silence, and then having your eardrums shatter when the barrage rains down on you.Gameplay is well done with multi-pathed missions that let you choose your objective, within the current mission's parameters. You can't just decide to turn around and head for Bermuda :).  Your leaders tell you what your group needs to do - but then it's up to you how to get it done.Even if you're an uber-soldier and whip through the main gameplay in a short period of time, there is still the online side, which can keep you going for *months*. The in-game play is only training for the real challenge, live human opponents.  Of course, if you don't like online gameplay, there is certainly a wealth of gameplay to replay for quite a while before you start to get bored.Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2006"}

What I also said in that review, is that I like the THPS series a lot. Well, enough with the past ! That was months ago ! This is now ! Months ago, I've overheard from gamers that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is about to come out, and the more I heard, the more I got excited. When I finally got a chance to see the first screens on several magazines, I was thinking about how well it would play when it releases. Finally, in the month of November, it finally saw the light of day on the PlayStation 2 game console. I got the chance to play it, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. Everything that I've come to expect in a Tony Hawk game, is all here. Good graphics, beautifully done soundtrack, improved skating physics, one good additional character (Bam Magera from the Jackass series) and perfect gameplay balance. The graphics are the best I've seen in years. This is the kind of eye candy you just can't throw away. Perfectly polished enviroments, nicely modeled characters, and streaming blood are something cool to look at. The controls are identical to that of the previous THPS games, but with new moves and a high extension of combos to pull out. Plus new codes are there for your skating pleasure. Not to mention, cool characters. Darth Maul is one of them (remember that freaky black and red dude from Star Wars Episode 1 ?). If you highlight Darth Maul, the skateshop owner will be choking by his force grab. The physics truly make sense. It shows that the skater can't always bail by hitting the ground with your back or the rest of your body. You can bail by landing on your feet. And if you're tired of seeing blood just fly and disappear from your mouth, you get to see blood streaks on the street each time you fall and drag your face on the concrete. OUCH !!! If you skaters or skater haters out there want a skateboarding game that makes more sense than its last two prequels, get Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3. This is no doubt, the best skateboarding game for the PS2. The new Gamecube owners should not feel discouraged, because pretty soon, Tony Hawk 3, will be coming to the Gamecube at the launch day of the system. To the gamers who already have the game, enjoy yourself and skate on !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"General Pete","summary":"I liked it well enough","reviewText":"I feel incredably stupid for buying this game at the full price while it is a wonderfully enjoyable game I fell into the trap of a lot of people appaently.I am not an RPG kind of guy and when comparing the two I think I prefer Jedi Outcast.

{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"The new 'Prince' oozes style.","reviewText":"Ubisoft's classic franchise is back with an entirely new look, a new gameplay philosophy, and a new Prince. This fresh approach to an established franchise is pulled off exceptionally well, leaving this Prince of Persia as arguably one of the most memorable games in the venerable series.The game begins with our new Prince wandering the desert in search of Farah - his donkey. As fate would have it, the Prince winds up meeting Elika, a beautiful young woman and descendant of a clan sworn to guard the prison of the evil god Ahriman. Unfortunately for the two, their meeting comes as Ahriman breaks out of his prison within the Tree of Life, spreading corruption across the four areas of the world. If left unchecked, the corruption will ultimately drag the entire world down into darkness.Prince of Persia's gameplay will take most gamers - especially those seasoned platformers - a while to get used to. It isn't that the learning curve is steep. Rather, this new system - which is actually more streamlined - goes against general gameplay mechanics that have become expected in the genre, such as never needing to hold buttons down or preloading your jumps. The streamlined controls work to perfection with an amazing fluidity. Combat is also handled far differently this time around; fights are now always one-on-one, instead of the usual hordes of enemies. Because of this, battles all seem like small boss fights, still on an epic scale, and require far more skill than simple button mashing. One particularly noteworthy change to the gameplay is the absence of the Sands of Time from the previous trilogy. However, the Sands are replaced by a gauntlet on the Prince's left hand, which assists with all platforming needs as well as combat needs.Another notable change to the gameplay is the integration of the Prince's lovely female companion, Elika. Because of Elika, it is literally impossible to die in the game. If you die in battle, Elika automatically saves you, though your enemy also recovers some health. A mistimed jump yields the same result, Elika reaches out and gabs you, transporting you both back to the last platform you jumped from. Elika's controlled movements are mapped to the triangle button. While platforming and exploring, a push of triangle will result in a double jump with her help. In battle, the triangle button has Elika use her magic in assistance to the Prince. More than just a sidekick however, Elika plays an integral role in the actual story, creating an incredibly memorable character. More impressively, she is able to keep up with the Prince's impressive acrobatics without ever getting in the way and becoming a nuisance.Another change most gamers will likely notice upon starting the game up is the graphics. They aren't necessarily cel-shaded, but \"stylized\" - they provide far more texture and detail than cel-shading. The style works beautifully in conjunction with the rest of the game world, which is a marvelous expanse that can be explored immediately at the outset of the game. The art design is incredibly impressive and unique, while drawing some resemblance to the feel of the critically acclaimed Shadow of the Colossus. From a technical standpoint, everything holds up well. The animations, which are incredibly fluid in both exploration and combat, are amazing. While the world looks beautiful, the characters hold up equally as well, blending seamlessly with the game's style. The game is a testament to brilliant artistic design.Almost equally as impressive is the music in the game. The soundtrack features impressive scores that manage to stand out because of how fitting they are for such an epic adventure. The voice acting is all top-notch, whether it is from the Prince, Elika, or the bosses. The dialogue itself is also well written, believable, and frequently humorous. Some of the Prince's one-liners may be hit or miss, and it does take a while to get past the fact that the new Prince is also Drake, from Uncharted.Prince of Persia is one of those rare games that manage to stand out among the herd, not necessarily because it's the best game anyone has ever played, but because of how fun, fresh, and completely impressive it is. It boasts a compelling narrative with a considerable amount of backstory accompanied by fleshed out, memorable characters. The world brought to life in this game, thanks in large part to the remarkable art design, is purely enchanting - you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't periodically stop atop a high pillar and simply take in the view. Perhaps most importantly, the gameplay is solid, providing fluid if not too automatic platforming. Some may be turned off by an arguable lack of challenge, but the game is so much more about telling a story through a gorgeous world, interesting characters, and fluid gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Best FPS I've ever played","reviewText":"Metroid Prime has, since the announcement that it would be first-person and in 3D, enjoyed the kind of controversial hype that only a first-party Nintendo game can enjoy. Once Nintendo announced that Retro Studios was going 3D with the title, it quickly joined the new Zelda in the \"What are they thinking?\" club. You (yes, you) most likely thought it would be ruined once it began to look more and more like a first-person shooter. You then read E3 impressions that said the game was good, but you probably didn't listen. Well, guess what, Mr. Smarty: Metroid Prime is good. Really good. While Prime's graphics lack a little polish and flair and the controls never really become second-nature, the game itself simply rules. If you're an old-school Metroid fanatic, you can skip the next paragraph or two as we explain the idea to the new folks. Metroid games have always been about exploration, secret areas, and collecting power-ups that are cleverly hidden in plain sight. You might see a door in the first room that you can't reach until much later in the game, and behind that door might lie an entire new set of rooms to discover. You'll do a lot of backtracking, but you'll do it with a purpose as you realize that the cliff that was too high to get to in the beginning is a piece of cake with your new Space Jump boots. Within a few structural limits, you have free reign of the place to come, see, and conquer as you will. As you play, the world unfolds before you, and you become the powerful warrior you need to be to end the threat that enfolds the world of Tallon IV. In the beginning, Metroid Prime suffers from its own expectations. Since it is a first-person game, you'll likely fumble around with the controls as you try to play the game like, say, TimeSplitters 2 or Halo. At some point, though, you'll realize that this is not Halo, and you'll adjust. When you do, you'll be surprised just how much like the old Metroids this game feels. You jump from platform to platform (always a pain in first-person games, but rather forgiving in Metroid), use your Ice Beam and Varia Suit, and fight the same enemies you remember from the older games in the series. Once you reach that point, you'll fall right back into the old Metroid groove, and it's all smooth sailing from there. There are a few minor problems with the game. First off, while the controls are great once you get used to them, the learning curve is pretty steep, and even once you know them pretty well, they never seem to feel natural. Ten hours into the game you'll still be accidentally firing missiles when you want to see the map, and the use of the triggers to look about and lock onto targets never feels completely right. Metroid's graphics are schizophrenic in a way; some minor details, like seeing Samus's eyes reflected in the visor in a bright glare, are spectacular, but others, like muddy shadows and simple enemies, are not. Lastly, Metroid Prime requires a lot of backtracking and going through places you've already seen, and that can get boring if you don't know where you're going. Hardcore Metroid players won't have a problem with that, but others might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over. Still, even with its minor problems, Samus's latest adventure is a perfect tribute to the Metroid we all know and love. Salute to Retro Studios and Nintendo for giving us the industry's Holy Grail-a next-gen game that significantly upgrades the genre while keeping all the classic feel of the original. Well done, folks, well done.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2003"}

It really isn't.  Unfortunately, it isn't a good one either. Even though the basic shooting mechanics are pretty solid, the campaign is suspiciously short, even for an FPS.What is wrong with Warfighter?Not only was I able to complete the campaign in less than four hours, but I also did so without even the slightest clue as to what was going on.  The story, which is what Medal of Honor games try to tout the most, was convoluted and confusing jumping between multiple different timelines and characters. For example, after I began to slightly understand what was happening - and more importantly why - the game tossed in a 2 minute long mission consiting of somali pirates who had taken a ship captain hostage.  Your objective: snipe the captor.  If your fast, the mission could even be completed in less than 2 minutes.  After that mission, it was back to a different set of characters.  There was absolutely ZERO connection between that mission and the main story arc.  It was almost like an extra \"deleted scence\" you might find on a bonus disk to a movie that was ultimately cut by the director.On top of that, Medal of Honor games traditionally claim their campaigns \"honor\" the soldiers.  I had hoped that this would be a break from the hollywood escape death in the nick of time, or never ending over-the-top explosions that make up most FPS games today.  Unfortunately, from mission 1 through the rest of the game, every mission seemed to incorporate some bizzare hollywood moment that wasn't necessary.Multiplayer, in my opinion was entertaining for a few hours, untill I realized that even this too was a poor mimic of other FPS franchises already available.  To be fair, the idea of representing your country seemed very promising and innovative - and I hope the feature can make it's way into other titles.So, in light of this information why isn't Warfighter awful?Despite the long list of things this game did wrong, there are a few things Danger Close managed to actually do quite successfully.  I've already mentioned the nationality aspect to multiplayer, but there are others.  For example, throughout the campaign, there are a few foot and vehicular chase sequences which offered a good mix up from the repetative nature of FPS's.  I thought the vehicle sequences in particular the 2nd car chase mission was supurb.  Additionally, the basic \"shooting\" mechanics in Warfighter are strong and I think the game also presents an excellent soundtrack.  But these things don't outweigh the general lack of polish and length Warfighter has.All in all, I don't hate the game, but I couldn't possibly reccomend it to anyone - especially considering the slew of AAA games coming out this quarter.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"J.

It is very different than Left 4 Dead since most action is melee (guns are a rarity) and that is is an open world experience.  There is also a delicately packed RPG element into this game, which includes experience points, skill trees, and weapon stats that can really help build your character into something powerful.  The music and atmosphere is eerie at times (and corny at others, let's face it, not every quest is going to be a home run!), but the overall flavor of this game is great.There is also a drop-in co-op mode, so you can join with other survivors and play together.  People can come and leave your game at will (combined with your Steam friend's list, this is a great addition!), which makes playing even more fun.

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries.

Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Chrono Trigger........","reviewText":"Considering how much I've heard about this game through the years and how many consider it to be one of the 'Greatest Games of All Time', I had to check Chrono Trigger out. I had to have it proven to me, to be quite honest. Well, I'm here to tell you--I more than got it proven to me. I'm a believer now, lol. I can see why people feel that way.The game begins with our hero, Crono, going to the Millennial Fair. There, he quite literally bumps into a girl named Marle. After they meet, they decide to see the fair together. Thing is, Marle ends up getting teleported to the past when Cronos' friend's teleportation device malfunctions. Being the cool but silent dude he is, Crono jumps in after her. The plot is rather simple til the time travel is introduced, that's when things get pretty wild. Course, that's what I love about the game is the story. The gameplay is nothing to scoff at either,..you roam the map til you encounter an enemy & then you engage them without going to a battle screen. From there, your party spreads out, draws their weapons and prepare for battle. The cool thing about the battle system is it utilizes Active Time Battle(which is taken straight from Final Fantasy). The tech system is pretty cool too as every character has techniques that they can utilize. Thing is, your party can combine their techniques together to pull off double and triple hits & whatnot. That makes a huge difference when you're going up against a tough opponent. There's tons of side quests, FMV cutscenes and more.In my opinion, Chrono Trigger has held up pretty well through the years. I would've loved to have seen a 3-D remake of it as the graphics show their age but you can't have everything, can you?Chrono Trigger is quite a remarkable game. Again, I can see why people go on about this game like they do. It's one of the best(if not THE best) games ever made. It was, definitely, worth a purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}

First, it's not as hard as Demon's Souls- checkpoints make a huge difference. Just know going in that this is no casual game- it is difficult but fair, and it compels you to do massive amounts of research- you'll be amazed by how deep the multiple gameplay systems are, but you'll always want to learn more. The game world is massive and beautiful, and DS will make your heart pound and adrenaline flow like few other games out there. The PS3 and 360 versions are largely identical, though the PS3 community is much more active. The way this series incorporates online multiplayer is brilliant and innovative, though too complex to fully describe here. I think anyone can get into this game- just be ready to dedicate some serious time to it.UPDATE: it took me 77 hours to complete my first play through, and I think it's more brilliant than ever. There is still New Game+, New Game++, etc...you could probably get hundreds of hours out of this game if you wanted to. Can't wait to see what From does with the series next.UPDATE 12/2013: Since I wrote this, I put probably another 150 hours into the PC version, which is definitely the best version of the game with the DSfix mod, and the extra content is excellent.

As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds.

{"product_name":"B000095ZH6","reviewerName":"S. Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"Great action horror.  Surprise game of the year so far.","reviewText":"In an earlier review, I bashed this game saying it was just another survival horror wannabe like Fatal Frame and Clock Tower 3. Yeah I'm the guy who said stick with Resident Evil and Silent Hill.  Well I take it all back, now I feel like a moron. I guess that's what happends when you judge a game before playing it.The Suffering actually does evolve survival horror into a more action shooter based horror.  The horror concept is also pretty original with a combinatin of gore, ghosts, and deformed creatures. Typical scary stuff, but the game is also disturbing in a rude and more thuggish manner with even some humor thrown in. Earlier Rockstar Games released Manhunt a game that was labeled as Resident Evil or survival horror for Grand Theft Auto fans and I think this game to can go under that catergory. It's better than RE: Outbreak, Fatal Frame 2, probably even Silent Hill 3, but Silent Hill is my cult favorite.As far as the graphics and gameplay, it's very solid with a surprisly smooth control and feel to it. It's like Max Payne but 100 times smoother. Graphics are also impressive with awesome lighting effects. Sound is impressive, and despite what you'll hear from reviews the voice acting is very good and very funny, falls in right with the tone of the game.How does the game compare to other horror games as far as scare factor? Well this is more of an action horror,so you should think more along the lines of Doom or something. It's not quite in the level of Silent Hill or Fatal Frame but it's got a very disturbing yet a bit humorous thuggish feel to it. The game also has some good extras like a behind the scenes look at the making of the game, along with a very good movie on the history of some of the worst and most barbaric prisons and methods of torture ever. This game really brings prison hell to life, it's the surprise of the year for me s far.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2004"}

These are the main problems: You can't move while reloading, aiming, or shooting; instead you become rooted to the spot and therefore hopelessly vulnerable to attack. When aiming the sight is often (although, oddly, not always) wrenched away from the point already centred so you have to find your target again. And you can't jump or crouch unless prompted. What the hell is that all about? Also the AI is pretty poor. Sheva gets in the way more often than not. The UI looks like something out of the 90s and is clunky to say the least. And you can't access the inventory during gameplay (although I understand the reasoning behind this it is frustrating at times). So what is there to like? Well it looks amazing. The graphics are among the best I've ever seen, with particularly impressive character models and animations. And, controls aside, the gameplay is enjoyable, with a good selection of environments, some pretty tough bosses, and a range of simple but enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ammo is often scarce so you have to be more thoughtful about your approach to the combat than in many games. Overall it's a top-flight game marred only but it's poorly designed controls and interface. Sadly these are so bad I can only give it 3 out of 5, which is a real shame.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

Not that this game doesn't provide a challenge.  4 difficulty levels (easy, normal, heroic, and legendary) allow you to put you skills to the test throughout 10 imaginative levels.  Not that this game is entirely without fault, however.  The dificulty levels aren't moderated at quite the right ratios.  I completed the game on easy in about 7 hours (not at once) but on normal, I was killed about 5 times on the same level.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"K.

Johnson \"Pyrochaos\"","summary":"Amazing!  What an improvement over the 1st game!","reviewText":"I was going to actually cancel my order on this, since I have a ton of games to play at the moment.  I am glad I did not.  For reference I bought the Xbox 360 version.Graphics:  5/5  The world they created for this game looks amazing.  It's one of the biggest open world games I've played, and it shines from the water, to the vegetation, to the snow on the mountains.  There is little to no pop-in, and the frame rate stays solid throughout everything that is going on!  And the explosions just look fantastic.Controls:  5/5  The controls take a little while to get used to, but once you get the hang of the Grappling hook and the parachute there are some pretty amazing stunts you can pull off.  Everything else is pretty standard shooter controls (Right trigger shoot, left trigger granades, ect).Story:  1/5  I'll be the first to admit, this game has virtually no story.  It has \"factions\" that you do missions for, and they are pretty straight forward and typical for an open world game.  But once you get into the action you won't even care that there is no story in this game.Sound:  3/5  The voice acting is terrible.  At times you will feel like your little brother Jimmy or Grandpa Lou can do a better job.  But aside from that everything else sounds great.Other:  Enemy AI isn't the best I've seen, but it isn't the worst.  There is a \"wanted level\" of sorts that increases as you cause more chaos.  Their aim is pretty precise on the high difficaulties.Overall this game is a must buy.  In my opinion this game is a mix between Mercenaries 2 and The Saboteur.  Do not pass this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

The checkpoint system is horrible and every time there is a checkpoint it will freeze for around a second no gamebreaker but kinda of annoying. Also at times your guns will go through objects and the game is repetitive but finds  interesting ways to keep it fresh. The reason I gave the game 5 stars is because of how much fun I had with it and how underrated it is. The story of this one is great and voicework for the characters is pretty good they will sound westerny all the way, the characters are also pretty intriguing but its possible to get annoyed by William at times because he comes off with a sort of whinny attitude(Kinda weird how I gained respect for him through the course of the story). The story mode is pretty long for a fps and there are various settings and some free roam sections, you can also upgrade your weapons to get that ugly rusty look out of them. The story is slow at first but picks off in later chapters and the ending is epic, this game is a prequel but it can stand alone as its own beast.You can play as either Ray or Thomas each with his different pros and cons, Ray being mostly the strong one and Thomas the more agile one. The multiplayer is actually great and will keep you hooked for a while and the community is decent. You unlock classes as you earn money from matches and gradually the more money you have the better your weapons will look I have gotten to the \"prime\" state so far. To be honest I enjoyed this game more than killzone 2 and for the price I found it at it was a steal. I highly recommend this game and you can find it very cheap these days so its definitely worth. If you love westerns you can't go wrong with this one.Ps. A minor complaint is that it has no coop of any sort.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Felllix","summary":"Solid; the perfect word.","reviewText":"Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a solid game, no doubt about it. It controls well, looks great, and the writing is above average. The series has often been called \"cinematic,\" and there's a sense in which it is; several of the sequences seem made for Hollywood, and the characters are recognizable archetypes. I mean this as an observation, not a criticism; Uncharted is Hollywood, mainstream, for better or for worse.The game stars Nolan North as Nathan Drake, a smart-alecky treasure hunter-for-hire attempting to find the long lost treasure of his namesake, Sir Francis Drake. Following him is a journalist, Elana Fisher, voiced by Emily Rose, who insists on following him into dangerous situations for the purpose of her story. The plot of the game can best be described as low-rent Indiana Jones, with a slight bit more of the supernatural elements.Uncharted's gameplay fluctuates between extremely light puzzle solving, Prince of Persia-style climbing and running, and very tight cover-based combat. Oh, and cutscenes. These cutscenes don't get in the way, in general, and serve to move along the gameplay between plot points. For the most part, the player is in control during chase sequences and the game provides ample opportunity for action.Uncharted also looks great. The jungle environments are gorgeous and the facial animations and lip sync are perfect. The game is colorful as opposed to the usual grayfest of modern action games. The characters are light and cheerful, charming in their own way, and it's nice to see attempts made to move them beyond the clich&eacute;s that populate Hollywood movies like Sahara and National Treasure.All of the elements are in place for Uncharted to be a great game; so why doesn't it achieve greatness? The problems are numerous but unmistakable; first, the cover-based combat is well-implemented but too frequent and not properly balanced. The lack of a real inventory lends the game an arcade feel for combat, but also serves to immerse the player in the feel that Drake is making up his plans as he goes along. This is a good, if shallow, idea.The puzzles in Uncharted, I'm sorry to say, are not very good. Many of them are solved by pressing select, viewing a diagram, and then arranging pieces in a certain way. Strictly speaking, they aren't puzzles at all, since they don't involve anything for the player to solve. Again, not a criticism, only an observation.By the same token, the Prince of Persia-style sections don't involve split-second timing or a great deal of finesse; it often feels as if Drake is being guided by the player instead of the player having an actual stake in the outcome of his actions.Overall, I would describe Uncharted: Drake's Fortune as a solid if unspectacular game in all aspects except graphics. The game's presentation will probably be enough for most players to overlook its faults; it certainly kept me involved until the end credits. Personally, I would have preferred some real boss battles (the game has monsters, so why no big monsters?) instead of the usual enemy spamming. Despite a frustrating battle here and there, the game is also a little on the easy side.Uncharted: Drakes Fortune is a solid beginning to what will undoubtedly be a long-running game series. The pieces is all here for something memorable and endearing, and I suspect that the second game in the series will be great. Hm. Maybe one should hop over to that game's reviews to see what I think about it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

I bought it a week ago and have been playing it a lot since then. It's fun, and in some ways it is an improvement over \"The Sims 2.\"Improvements:- Travel from one location to another is much more realistic. Your sims can go from their homes to the bookstore, movie theater, etc., without having to close the game and reopen it at the new location.- Houses have environments. If your lot is on the shore, your sims can see the ocean from their windows.- Character creation is (IMO -- though there is some disagreement on this one) improved. I didn't like the zodiac-based trait system of \"TS2.\" Now, you pick six traits from a huge list (positive and negative traits are included).Non-Improvements:- It's really weird that when your sim is out driving in his car, he just drives right through other cars on the road. That seems like lazy programming to me.- Relationships with other sims are less important in this version. In \"TS2,\" a sim had to have a certain number of friends to advance in his job. That's no longer the case, which makes the game less challenging. (Sims do have to have set numbers of friends to improve beyond level 4 in the charisma skill, but ... so your sim never goes beyond charisma level 4. No big deal, at least not nearly as big a deal as advancement in the job.)- I have never seen a core Sims game released with such a small selection of objects. I guess that's because EA wants people to buy objects from the online store (not gonna happen, guys) ... but then, you'd think they would have a good selection in the online store, and they don't. I still haven't found anything to spend my 1000 free points on. Even if I do, I will *not* purchase any more points. It seems to me a pretty ridiculous waste of money to spend $1 on a virtual shirt for my little virtual person.Overall, I do recommend the game, but I also recommend spending your 1000 free points in the online store and then ignoring it after that.

The fighting mechanics, story, graphics, and sound have all been improved on in Arkham City.  Now that all the big-time criminals are stuck in Arkham City, they have their own criminal crews (similar to mafia families) and are fighting amongst each other, as well as looking out for Bruce Wayne and Batman (once he makes his presence known in the game, as well as the Anti-Hero Catwoman, though no one is truly sure what side she's on).There are enough swarms of enemies here to beat Batman down if you don't use tactics, and armed inmates make one-on-one fist fights fatal almost every time.  Fortunately, that's where tactics come in.  The game walks you through different tools at your disposal and tactics utilizing these weapons to ensure your survival and help you to progress towards the goal at hand.If you are a Batman fan (or even an action-game fan, for that matter), you'll love this game.It has so much to it, from the returning Riddler trophies to unlockable information about the characters and the Catwoman missions.Definitely a must-have for most PS3 owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

First of all, it is a whole lot bigger and there is a lot more of everything. The combat has improved with more moves. There are more gadgets. There are more places for Batman to move around since Arkham City is five times the size of Arkham Asylum. Basically almost everything about the game is great, I just sometimes wish that Batman had a lethal weapon to strike at the enemies but Batman never was about killing people. My favorite part of the game is the combat. This game has the most unique and spectacular combat that I have ever seen in an action adventure game. Anybody who likes combat, stealth, and action adventure games defenantly needs to play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"\"Hatred, Death, Courage, and Faith Symbolized\"","reviewText":"Based on the short stories and novels of Polish economist and fantasy author Andrezg Sapkowski, and brought to digital life by the endearing and rogue Polish developer CDPR (CD Projekt Red), the saga of the medieval mutant warlock Geralt of Rivia is definitely an unusual one to say the least.To begin with, in agreement with some other reviewers here, be sure to shoo the kids away and out of both visual and audible range, because the \"Mature\" rating for TW2 is well implemented and well deserved.  In fact, if you are sensitive a about 'sax and violin', please be aware that there are scenes and references of profanity, nudity, sexual intercourse, rape, torture, mutilation, and violent death here (ever wonder what 'impaling' or 'impalement' is all about or why Vlad Drakul (AKA Vlad Tepes, Vlad The Impaler, or Dracula) is so feared and hated by both friends and enemies alike? You'll see a part of it here.)With that out of the way, in term of technicality, having played both the PC and the Xbox 360 versions, I have to say that the Xbox 360 is very good; and although it is not as good in the graphics department for obvious reason, in some ways, it is better than the PC version.  Two things stand out:  Even though you can also play with the controller on the PC version, the Xbox 360 version controller layout is more intuitive.  And although still rough around the edges, the inventory system is much better implemented in the Xbox 360 version than the PC version when using a controller.To be sure, I've seen some reviews that criticized the game for being too PC-ported. The interesting thing here is that some PC Gamers are criticizing the PC version for being a console-port.  As is, I think the truth is somewhere in between. CDPR's main goal is to develop a true multiplatform game - and some drawbacks are inevitable in order to achieve this goal when dealing with a complex action RPG like TW2. Based on my observation, and taken into consideration that there are some who thought that TW2 cannot be ported to console,  I think CDPR succeeded brilliantly.There are some minor technical problems with TW2.  For long duration of playtime, I noticed that the game froze approximately every 3 hours - almost exclusively during loading screens.  In addition, there is one small but mean bug: My storage chest content disappeared between chapter 1 and chapter 2 on Roche's path.  A veteran like myself will have no problem with this bug (I've played TW2 3 times on PC and 1.5 time of Xbox 360), but a novice player might.As for the product itself, TW2 comes in a very nice and *complete* package that focus on value for the Customers - something I seldom see anymore.  As indicated in the product description, along with the 2 game discs, there are: A map, soundtrack CD, manual, and a game guide.In terms of gameplay, TW2 is a very good hack and slash action RPG.  Although the control is not as crisp and sharp as I'd like (I longed for a classic Ninja Gaiden type control feedback), there is a feel of weight and inertia in your sword movement.  And when you learn to combine your swordplay with signs (magic) and mobility (dodging is better than blocking), and supplemented with oils and potions, combat is fun and exciting.In addition, the RPG elements of TW2, like its PC based predecessor TW1, are very well done - not so much in the leveling system itself, but in terms of story progression. In other words, as you progress through the story, you are leveling up at the right time and the right place, which means that you can concentrate on playing the game instead of grinding it in order to level up.Another thing to take into consideration is that TW2 is a game with true non linear and branching story path, which is not to be confused with the free roaming elements in games like TES (The Elder Scrolls) series or the Two Worlds series.  In other words, a complex story driven game like TW2 does not mesh well with a go-anywhere and do-anything at anytime elements of a free-roaming type game.  Therefore, what is \"non-linear\" here is the story elements - not the geographical gaming area.To be more precise, depend on the choice you made at the end of Act 1, almost all of Act 2 will play out differently with a different story and in a different location.  In addition, about 1/3 of Act 3 will also be different.  Needless to say, the replay value is way off the chart here; and in order to see the whole story, you will have to play both Roche's and Ieorveth's paths. Thus, be sure to keep at least one game save for the quest \"At a Crossroads: Vernon Roche\" or \"At a Crossroads: Scoia'tael\" near the end of Act 1 after you bid farewell to Cedric the elf.Finally, the story elements of TW2 are what makes it stands head and shoulder above the rests.  In addition to the aforementioned unflinchingly mature elements, the complex and layered story of TW2 is firmly set in a world saturated with different shades of gray.  Indeed, with only one possible exception, there is no black and white; no good and evil; and no light and dark here - whether we are dealing with the protagonist, the antagonist, or the supporting characters.  Hence, the decisions to be made - which, in conjunction with your own logic and morality and along with the half-lie and half-truth that you gathered - is neither right nor wrong... There are only consequences.  And regardless of where you stand on the notion of 'the end justifies the mean', tread carefully, because you may need to do just that.  Granted, although there are quite a few games that claim to do this, very few can do it well - and The Witcher 2 is one that does it exceptionally well.In conclusion, TW2 earned a solid 4.5 stars - to which I rounded up in appreciation of CD Projekt Red. Thank You for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

{"product_name":"B000ZKDOV2","reviewerName":"coopertex","summary":"Grand Theft Auto Gets SLAPPED!!!","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto 4 (GTA 4) was gritty, had a good story but decided to make the gameplay more realistic. Realism doesn't always lead to fun. The mini games really sucked: darts, bowling, watching a caberet. How about being pestered by whiney friends that constantly called you on the phone asking that you hang out with them or lose their approval rating, was that fun? Realistic? Yes. Fun? No! And now GTA 4, just got slapped right across the mouth, with the release of Saints Row 2 (SR2)! Why would I say such a thing you ask.Saints Row 2 is arcadey, has a more colorful graphic palette. And the characters look more cartoony. The gameplay is NOT realistic, but this is more of an advantage here. Below is a list of just SOME of the fun you can have and there is so much more to SR2:Zombie uprising- this is a mini-game about killing waves of zombies, using mele weapons and fire arms. (This is similar to resident evil and even contains blood and gore, scary goodness).Septic avenger- drive a septic truck, shoot sewage to devalue property, smother cops and laugh at pedestrains. (Funniest mini game in SR2)Celebrity- be a bodyguard for celebrities as you try to protect themagainst crazy fans, dispose of fanatics any way you wish! (I enjoyed throwing the fanatics into a jet engine and having them chopped up).Fight club-  fight against thugs or even prisoners in a ring to the death.(If you ever watched Ultimate Fighting on t.v. you'll like this one).Cat and mouse- simple deathmatch game between you and your co-op partner, one of you pilots an attack copter while the other tries to escape in a race car. (I thought this was a nice twist on killing your friend).Fuzz- ever watch the t.v. show cops? You are playing as a cop busting criminals for fame and cash. (I always wanted to be a bad cop and abuse people, this fulfills my fantasy).Trail Blazing- you wear a fire-proof suit and drive around on an ATV setting pedestrians and vehicles on fire to gain extra time on the clock. (The most chaotic and difficult race, because the explosions can disorient your direction, but oodles of fun.)Ambulance Emt- you are paramedic and must revive injured victims before they die. (I liked helping the injured by using the analog sticks to electrically charge the shock paddles was fun).Fire Truck- you are fireman, douse fires with a fire extinguisher. (driving the truck was difficult, but felt satisfying putting out those flames on burning objects and people caught in flames).Taxi driver- pick up customers and drop them off at their desired destination, to earn time, money and a bonus. (fun and easy way to earn some extra cash, it becomes more challanging in later levels).Tow Truck- Drive your tow truck  and take away vehicles from their deadbeat owners for cash, time and bonus. (I enjoyed towing vehicles and having the owner come after me with a baseball bat, I shot him dead).Ho-ing- have sex with prostitutes and help them achieve orgasms for the next level. (The weakest and stupidest of all the mini games, you use the analog stick in certain directions to pleasure her, the graphics only show the analog stick on screen followed with sound effects).Base jumping- go the top of a tall building and then jump off, deploy a parachute and land on the designated area. (I always like jumping off stuff anyways, its also funny when you commit suicide because of the ragdoll physics).Tagging- mark your gang territory by spray painting walls and earn respect points. (I enjoyed putting up my gang's graphics and enraging rival gang members and even the police).Barnstorming- use and aircraft and fly through tricky areas without crashing (Very challanging and requires a skillful pilot).Drive-by- earn money, points and respect for doing drive by shootings while cruising with your car, against rival gangs. (Saints Row was made for drive by shootings especially since your car now has cruise control).Streaking- take off all of your clothes and run through the streets naked while trying to shock as many people as possible with your nudity. (I liked the reactions of pedestrians, they were varied when you ran past them, some: got mad or violent, others laughed, others were grossed out).Store hold-up- rob stores at gun point and steal their cash, but get ready to shake off the cops. (Another good way to make some extra cash and becomes easier if you have homies help you rob the stores).Hostage- carjack any innocent driver and the passanger will be held as a hostage, until they pay you the ransome money, trying to avoid cops at the same time. (Earn more money and laughs when the cars have multiple passangers).Poker- go to a casino or video game machine and play the game of poker, with the cash you wager. (I don't know how to play poker, but to those of you whom do, you will like this).Racing- you can race, with cars, motorcycles or even boats, trying to beat your best time. (And with the beautifully designed map, it makes it even more enjoyable).Flashing- all you wear is a trench coat, but unsuspecting bystanders get shocked when you flash them your nude body. (Similar to streaking and just as funny).Blackjack- go to a casino or video game machine to play the game of blackjack with the money you wager. (The game is fair and balanced, it doesn't seem to cheat you out of your cash).Heli assualt- provide air support and pilot an attack copter, armed with a mini gun and homing rockets to protect your gangs against attackers. (Good action shooter, your partner can be the gunner).And these are just some of the diversions you do when you are bored or want a break from the campaign missions. Most of them can be played co-op with a partner optionally. You still have the campaign missions, which sets you against four rival gangs, destroy their strongholds, buy real estate, do any of the various activites, buy weapons, steal any vehicle. Unlock perks and special bonuses And enjoy a excellently designed city that is huge and fun to explore. Gain power, respect, money and destroy your rivals!Customize, the look of your character by choosing its gender, age, race and then create his/her facial features. Buy different styles of clothing in shops, dress ghetto, classy or sporty or wear outlandish costumes! Customize your vehicles by adding nitrous, or hydrolics, rims, spinners, spoilers, decals, change their colors and more! You'll spend hours exploring the customization features alone; it is very robust and easy to use.Still not enough for you? Saint Row 2 also features online multiplayer modes such as: deathmatch, team deathmatch and strong arm modes! Saints Row 2 is the game that GTA should have been! If you like open world games, you should not hesitate to buy it! Don't expect \"realism\", just expect fun!Pros:+open world+tons of side missions+great campaign+bloody and brutal+duel wield weapons+human shields+intense action+great vehicles+excellent map design+excellent story+excellent multiplayer online+excellent weapons+excellent sound effects+excellent music+excellent voice-acting+excellent controls+unlock perks and bonuses+tons of customizations+play campaign co-op+ragdoll physicsCons:-rare instances of game crashing-minor collision detection problems-minor graphical glitches","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2008"}

GOW2 is smooth and I very seldom died for any other reason than my own dumb mistake.  The graphics were also a step up but that's to be expected.  I enjoyed the story and visuals a lot and I'm excited to start GOW3 now.  I just wish I could play these games on a PS3 because I still find the dualshock controller to be far superior for shooters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"DB9","summary":"You need it, so buy it","reviewText":"you need this to save games, duh.

{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Utterly amazing in every way","reviewText":"I got Homefront and Crysis 2 on the same day but I'll leave my Homefront review for another day because since Crysis 2 went into my 360 it hasn't left it.Graphically really nothing comes close to Crysis 2. Now let me clarify that statement from the angle from a retired video game programmer : there are other games currently available such as Halo Reach or Mass Effect 2 which do seem to offer equivalent next gen visuals but they're fudging a lot of what you see. In many cases the lighting may not be dynamic or the reflections aren't really true, the game engine instead falls back on pre-rendered shadow maps and refmaps - to use the geeky jargon. The Crysis 3 engine does it all and seemingly for real. A good example would be at the beginning of the game I came across a blue flashlight just laying around. I thought it was important and picked it up thinking it would come in handy later. But no, it's just there to show off the realtime shadows that EVERYTHING in the environment casts. It was toy the devs put there for you to play around with. And your onscreen character also casts shadows everywhere not just where the programmers thought it would look cool in the level.But graphically there's so much more - the water effects, the smoke, the mist, the ultra realistic fire, the in-game rendered cut scenes and of course the massive NY buildings are all a step above what any other game offers. I could ramble all day about the visuals but really you should download the multi-player demo to get a tiny taste of it.Of course, visuals alone do not a good game make, and the gameplay has to be equally as good. Thankfully Crytek learned from their other 360 outing (FarCry) which was rather lacking in the things-to-do department, and with Crysis 2 they added a slew of entertaining ways and unique tools to approach any situation. Sure, what we have here is a glorified corridor shooter where your direction is preset due to the commands barked at you from a static intercom. But most of the action is in huge open areas with distinct hints depending on your choice of play - want to stealth it out and take out the bad guys silently? No problem. Want to go in guns blazing? Again that's no problem. Want to do a bit of both, heck that's covered too. I never felt rushed even on levels that were applying pressure to get to the end and I completed the missions at my own pace. The tension is real, caused by the intense on-screen action, and not because of some fake clock timing down in the corner of the screen. This game deserves to be savored at your leisure and let's you do so.I really don't have anything negative to say about the single player campaign even though the game has a couple of my ultimate pet hates. One, you will lose all of your weapons and powers at some point and there's nothing you can do about it and two, boss battles. Boss battles can destroy a game for me turning what could be a fun experience into an exercise in repetitively learning the correct way to kill the boss - but not here. It all felt flowing and natural and not forced or repetitive.I completed single player on the easiest setting in 9 hours and 45 minutes. It felt long and these days that's a good thing. I immediately started a new campaign from the beginning on the hardest setting. I want to get some of the collectibles that I missed but also relive the game's finer moments. You can tell it's a good game when despite needing sleep you decide to do one more mission.Multiplayer is where I'm holding off. It can take weeks, months sometimes to get enough experience in an MP game such as this to decide just how really good it is. Frankly I consider MP to be a bonus and would easily have paid the full price for the SP alone.If you read my other game reviews you'll see I'm quite harsh on games. It's rare, although not unprecedented, that I consider a game worthy of all stars. This is one and it should be in your game collection immediately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWVIQ","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Siddiqui","summary":"A great single-player and cooperative adventure.","reviewText":"Dead Space 3 attempts to let you decide, do you want a survival horror experience or an action adventure with a friend? This game is teeming with new options that build on some of the same strengths of the franchise and adding new mechanics but not without falling short on others. It stumbles a few times in the story and attempts to regain the lost momentum by relying on the combat mechanics and it's decorated crafting system. But despite the issues Dead Space 3 is a great sequel to Isaac Clarke's odyssey.Dead Space 3 takes place after the events of Dead Space 2, Isaac Clarke is in hiding after the events of Titan Station from those who seek the blueprints hidden in his mind that can be used to make Markers, legendary alien artifacts that are theorized to be the key to humanity's salvation and sacred objects to those who follow the faith known as Unitology. But Isaac's luck is always in constant flux, he is tracked down by the last of EarthGov's agents and is convinced into joining another suicide mission. Captain Robert Norton convinces Isaac by telling him that his ex-girlfriend, the pilot from Dead Space 2 Ellie Langford, has gone missing while attempting to stop the Marker threat. While the story starts off strong it eventually loses it's traction due to a forced love triangle and uninteresting characters. It's a shame seeing such wonderful voice-acting go to waste because of poor dialogue and convenient events in such amazing environments.The Dead Space franchise is notorious for having one the best presentation. Visceral Games use of the Godfather Engine has created such eye catching environments that have you venturing through each setting in awe. Whether it's traveling through an abandoned space station or surviving a punishing blizzard on Tau Volantis, each environment showcases a series of incredibly detailed settings that serves a purpose in Isaac's latest hell. These situations are complemented by extraordinary sound design and lightening, little details such as the light from your visor shining on the dark floor are admirable additions.But in order to refine the series the developers has removed older concepts for new additions. An elaborate weapon crafting system has replaced the store. Since humanity's resources have reached a dangerous limit Isaac must now find raw material and use his engineering skills in order construct new tools, equipment and upgrade his RIG. Everything from the traditional plasma cutter to the deadly seeker rifle can be broken down to its basic components and reformed into a customized weapon that suits your own style. While the crafting system is robust a lot of other changes had to be implemented for it to work efficiently. Power nodes have been removed and circuits have been added to increase the attributes of guns. Specific suit powers have also been removed and now require resources to upgrade. Veteran players may find these new changes shocking but in a world where basic necessities are hard to come by it seems logical that Isaac must now depend on scavenged items in order to survive.The core combat system hasn't change in Dead Space 3, you'll take control of either Isaac Clarke or new comer John Craver in third-person and use an array of weapons to sever the limbs of Necromorphs. These undead creatures have an array of mutated varations that each require a specific tactic to quickly eliminate them. But the undead hordes won't be your only opponents, Marker worshipping Unitologist lead by Jacob Danik, have taken up arms to kill Isaac for destroying Markers and anyone else that stands in their way. However unlike Necromorphs a bullet to the head will kill them instantly. You'll still have access to your stasis unit to slow enemies and objects around as well as kinesis to lift, move, or throw items. Those familiar with the Dead Space franchise will be able to pick up the combat mechanics easily and those new to the franchise will have an easy time playing amateur surgeon.However the combat and presentation feels depend on whether you choose to play Dead Space 3 solo or cooperatively. Instead of incorporating the easily forgotten multiplayer of Dead Space 2 the developers at Visceral Games have included a drop-in cooperative option that allows two players to play through the entire campaign. With simple puzzles and the removal of the save station cooperative matches can be easily formed in any part of the game, but deciding on loot can still become a vexing experience. Isaac's companion is a tormented sergeant named John Carver, a character with a tragic backstory that can only be experienced in cooperative campaign. Carver's own reaction to the Marker's influence offers the most interesting parts of the cooperative story, reliving tragic events and igniting guilty emotions that only he can see reminded me of Isaac's adventure through Titan Station.Although the gameplay mechanics remain unchanged, having a partner at your side alleviates the tension that would exist if you were alone. Plowing your way through each fight with a buddy is great, especially when you tailor your weapons and tactics to complement one another. The dialogue between Isaac and Craver is interesting and seeing them develop from isolated strangers to brothers in arm is something that can only be understood when playing through the cooperative campaign.Despite the satisfying combat in Dead Space 3 the objectives throughout the game are bland and uninventive. Throughout Dead Space 3 you'll be given a list of chores that involve the same tawdry tasks of collecting and fixing equipment. The developers attempt to inject new life into the lifeless tasks with zero gravity jumps and piloting a ship through mines, but it's not enough. Optional missions spout up occasionally and while these objectives do store background information about the people who lived in these abandon areas they always end with a collection of items and mostly repeat the similar environmental layouts.Battling through the hordes of Necromorphs while attempting to maintain your sanity against the Marker's influence has always been the highlight of the Dead Space franchise, but it seems that the developers have striped away from that concept. Instead you get a story that doesn't meet the same stellar quality as previous Dead Space games but maintains the same presentation. The new weapon crafting system and excellent combat allows for some amazing fights, especially when you bring a friend along. In addition you have an array of optional missions, collectable items, cooperative missions and 4 different modes to contend with. Whether you decide to bring a friend or go solo you can expect a delightful journey through Isaac's fight for survival.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2013"}

During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly.

The movie clip just before you face the boss Gaia is stunning. (I saw the HD demo on the Playstation 3 and it is even more fantastic with PS3's higher resolution capability). It is fun using the Wiimote and the Nunchuk as you get more physical action than mere pushing buttons.The typical fast Sonic pace is always the best part. I am loving the new environment, I enjoy the sightseeing.The Werehog is a gentler pace but you get more figting sequences with the enemies. The encounters reminds me of Kingdom Hearts, even some of the enemies are similar. You do spend more time being a werehog than Sonic which can be a bit tiring.The movies in between are somewhat long but nice and beaut. There is also a lot of loadings, not too long but still interrupting.  I am disappointed not to have multiplayer games as me and my son enjoy playing together with the older Gamecube Sonic games.  Some fans may also miss Chao world.Overall, it is still a great addition to your Sonic collection.

{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Scott Cohen","summary":"Only recommended for Star Wars enthusiasts","reviewText":"When I purchased my Gamecube on December 1st, 2001, they're were tons of launch titles that excited me into buying the Gamecube instead of the Playstation 2. Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II was one of them. I saw videos on online gaming sites, and it blew me away. The amazing sound, the out-of-this-world graphics.I wasn't able to choose a game to buy when I bought my Gamecube, but I recieved Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 as a gift. After I beat Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, I got bored, and I decided to get Star Wars over Super Smash Bros: Melee. Boy, did I make a mistake!When you start Rogue Leader, you are greeted by little men in white costumes dancing to the LucasArt icon. As soon as you start, you see a X-Wing blast through the screen, and you see the amazing animation and explosion graphics. I was impressed. The menus are cool, and show clips of Episode 4, 5 and 6.When I started playing, I showed of the graphics, and what the Gamecube hardware was able to pull off. I kept playing, and playing. I wondered what I did wrong, but it was impossible for a person who hasn't play Rogue Squadron for Nintendo 64 to complete the first level. My cousin has Rogue Squadron for Nintendo 64, and we thought that it was really hard. Rogue Squadron is laughable compared to Rogue Leader. I haven't played Rogue Squadron for a while. I couldn't believe it, but it took me over an hour to complete the first level with a bronze medal. Even on easy mode, it still is impossible to beat.When I play a game as hard as Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II, I go to cheat sites to help me with my gameplay. I found cheat codes for Infinite Lives and health, I still couldn't beat some levels. I think this game is only made for people who were able to complete every level in Rogue Squadron for Nintendo 64 with Gold Medals.Even though Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was my first game, and I beat it so many times, I still go back and play it for old times sake. I even hooked up my Playstation and played Tony Hawk 2. I once went back and started playing Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II, and honestly, I couldn't play it for more than a half-hour. A game like this really gets me frustrated. Out of the 6 games I own which are Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, Star Wars, Super Smash Bros: Melee, NBA Street, James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire and Aggressive Inline, I couldn't say without a doubt, Star Wars was the one that got the least time under the hood of my Gamecube.Well, I would only recommend it to Star Wars enthusiasts, this is a good game at heart.

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"So wonderfully diverse despite small flaws it's a cult gem!","reviewText":"Let me open up by saying I'm apprehensive when a game gets a \"2\" anywhere. Whether it is a scale system of up to 10 or 5 \"2\" is never a good mark. Yet after playing Deadly premonition it is my hypothesis that the IGN critic rating this game did not actually play it. You see IGN is known for their love affair of free roaming sand box games such as the popular GTA series. Such games come with their own bundle of frustrations and frankly I don't see how Deadly premonition is more \"guilty\" of those shortcomings than Rock Star's chrome plated champion.The first issue to cover is this IS a budget title. The people who made it were \"small time\" independent  developers. No, you shouldn't expect Deadly premonition to look spectacular  and though the game mechanics are passable they are not revolutionary. (Than again I felt the same way about GTA, aka the driving and gun fighting were \"just okay\" but nothing to write home about.)Unlike GTA you're the good guy this time around. Agent York is coming to Green Vale to solve a murder mystery and apparently the rural hamlet is also \"cursed\". Deadly Premonition is serious enough to want to tell a good suspenseful yarn but not so full of itself it excludes cheesy satire & humor. If you love to laugh it is a decent enough reason to pick up this game! From the very beginning York is a few fries short of a happy meal. He discusses cartoons, comic books, and movie trivia with his faceless partner Zach. We can make many assumptions. Zach could be a ghost from a deceased family member, he could be representative of the player, or he might be a multiple personality in an ingenious yet unstable mind.  Regardless the actual origin no game has EVER opened up with such an odd & colorful protagonist.In itself the concept of a free roaming survival horror game is quite original. Most games of this ilk hurry us along. Whether we're stranded on a hostile spaceship or in a city infested with zombies there are never many people to talk to and any semblance of \"normal life\" is restrained to notes, descriptions, and diaries the protagonist finds strewn about. For example in Silent Hill you may read a computer entry from \"Joe the water sanitation guy\" who fought a giant sewer slug but it's not as if you get to sit down and have a cup of coffee with him.Greenvale by comparison is not \"abandoned\". People drive to work, go to the diner, get into arguments, and try their best to raise their kids.  While Agent York can collect enough evidence to move events onto the next chapter in the investigation there is never any rush to do so and he can visit anyone at his leisure.  When not tracking down the raincoat killer or fighting ghost zombies of the damned in the town's \"shadow dimension\" York buys new cars from a grizzled Vietnam veteran, peeps into people's houses to observe their routines, changes clothes, shaves, eats, throws darts in the bar, and literally goes fishing for items.You quickly discover York is not the only eccentric person in dodge. Sigourney is a crazy old woman that carries around a pot in the pursuit to keep it warm. George is a stoic Sheriff with a troubled past which left scars on his back. Emily Wyatt is snug in her role as the \"kind and courageous deputy officer tom boy\" all us geeks can fawn over.  A Californian rocker store clerk has twin sons holding an important secret. Nick is great at cooking yet abrasive when it comes to socializing. There is also Diane, a seductive rich art gallery owner known for her promiscuous habits and odd late night meetings. Keep into perspective these are only a few of Greenvale's citizens. This isn't akin to the 5 character \"skeleton crew\" found in games akin to the Silent-Hill series. The end result makes you feel as if you're in a \"real place\" instead of a Hollywood set piece.Along with York's health eating and sleeping effect his \"hunger\" and \"awareness\" meters. If you don't take care of York beyond throwing an occasional health kit at him he will suffer for it. York's \"hygiene\" is important as well. Let him go long enough without a suit change or shave flies will buzz around his scraggly beard! If you want to play as a hobo FBI agent your wish has been granted!Combat in Deadly premonition reminded me of Resident Evil 4. Pull out York's gun and things immediately are seen from over his shoulder and he even has a stereotypical \"laser light\" and red cross hair targeting icon. While shooting York cannot run but for any of you that enjoy this genre it is not too much of a detraction. In addition York can do a quick 180 spin, push objects out of the way, and smash crates and zombie ghost skulls either with his bullets or close range melee weapons he finds along the way. Certainly he is no Kung Fu master when it comes to swinging a golf club or shovel but he still gets the job done!I was even more impressed when this low production value gem had \"chase & hide\" sequences. These occur when the raincoat killer pursues the hero and he has to hide in closets, hold his breath, sprint to a safer check point, or dodge axe blows through real time events so as not to end up the next gruesome victim. Most horror games only give us the choice to fight or only give us the option of evasion so it's great to finally have a combination of both of them.Driving isn't hard. While you have it in your power to light up your turn signals, switch on sirens, and employ the windshield wipers none of those tasks are necessary to make it from point A to point B. The only annoying occurrence is running out of fuel or getting damaged beyond repair when in the middle of nowhere. Easy solution? Carry flares with you at all times. When one of those puppies lights up in the sky another patrol car will be sent to you free of charge.  Luckily you can also switch the automobile camera from 1st person to 3rd person if you have a personal preference. Having a vehicle \"cleaned\" or \"refueled\" at the gas station will keep it at top performance. Remembering these tips will save you a lot of grief!The inventory screen of Deadly Premonition is the weirdest piece of interactive game art I've ever seen. It looks like a surreal office with a cracked wall leading to outside. Mounted over a fireplace is a moving deer head. From this window in York's mental attic players can change out weapons, view the town map, look at clues, and view collected trading cards . Most designers would have made this a boring and drab task grid of monotony so the extra creativity is something that should be appreciated!It perplexes me this game got low reviews. It wasn't egotistically puffing itself up to seem better than it actually was. The people behind it were generous to offer it for a mere $20.00. If that were not enough Deadly Premonition has a fairly large sandbox setting. Unlike its' more linear action driven survival horror siblings this beast cannot be blazed through in only a few nights.My verdict: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"An Entertaining B-Horror Comedy","reviewText":"It's Desperado meets Evil Dead 2, with the gameplay of Resident Evil 4 and the humor of No More Heroes.If that sounds good to you, then you'll enjoy this game.Story:  8/10The Lord of the Underworld kidnaps the girlfriend of demon slayer, Garcia Hotspur (Yeah, that is his name) and drags her to hell.  Garcia and his floating skull buddy, Johnson, venture into hell to rescue Paula.  Johnson was a demon a long time ago, but now he has the ability to transform into different upgradeable phallic weapons and serves as Garcia's portable arsenal.  Garcia ventures through the treacherous levels of hell to try and save the woman he loves.  This ends up being pretty entertaining because hell is a really quirky place.  Eyeball chomping babies guard doors, braying goat heads light up levels, and some levels are actually giant naked women.Gameplay:  8/10This is a 3rd Person action adventure game with an over the shoulder camera.  The aiming is quite touchy, but you can adjust the camera and cursor speeds on the Options Menu.  I'd recommend slowing it down just a bit because it's tough to pull of head shots.  Garcia and run, dive roll, do a quick 180 turn, use an arsenal of weapons, and shoot light out of his Johnson.  In hell, darkness actually drains your health and makes demons invincible.  But one shot of Garcia's Johnson on a mounted goat head, and the room becomes illuminated.  The darkness clings to some enemies, making them invulnerable, but a blast of Johnson's light removes the darkness.  Once the demons are vulnerable, they can be attacked with a melee weapon, a pistol, a shotgun, a machine gun, or a grenade launcher.  Of course these have colorful names like Hot Boner or Big Boner...  because the guns shoot bones.  You can upgrade your weapons by finding Gems and there is a traveling merchant that appears in the game.  Here, you can cash in white gems for health potions (booze), ammo, or gun upgrades.There are typical zombies and larger sub bosses that all take a bit of strategy to kill.  You may have to shoot them with light to expose a weak point, then attack the weak point as rapidly as possible to inflict the maximum amount of damage.  And there are some pretty large boss battles, which are pretty fun.Levels:  7/10The levels are hit or miss.  Throughout most of the game, you run through gore drenched towns and attack zombies, similar to recent Resident Evil games.  The difference here is the comedy.  Johnson and Garcia are pretty funny guys and they'll have you laughing from time to time.  So these levels are entertaining.  There are some levels similar to the old school 2D side scrolling shooters where Garcia looks like a paper doll and floats to the right and you have to shoot enemies.  These are pretty bad.  There is a bit of trial and error here and the bullets come from the tip of Garcia's gun, instead of the base.  This makes it impossible to shoot demons that get too close to him.  If a demon touches Garcia, he rapidly takes damage and will die in 2 seconds.  This is frustrating because demons jump out of the top, side, and bottom of the screen and if you get two on you, you are dead.The checkpoints are also not in the best areas.  If you die at a boss, you'll respawn down a hallway and have to go through all of the unskippable cutscenes again.  This can get really annoying if you die a few times in the same spot.  I'm shocked that there are so few checkpoints at the beginning of the Boss Fights.Graphics:  6/10The game looks about 3 or 4 years old.  But it can get away with this because it's a parody of a B-Horror film which are notoriously low budget.Sound:  9/10The music is pretty cool and the voice acting is really entertaining.  Garcia and Johnson will keep you laughing.Replay Value:  3/10The replay value is limited.  There are 3 difficulty levels, but if you replay the game, you don't get to keep your weapons and the cutscenes are not skippable.  To make matters worse, you've heard all of the jokes already.Maturity:  AdultsGore, nudity, swearing, violence, demons, hell, torture...  No kid should play this.  It's an interactive gore drenched B-Horror Film with boobs and corpses... and occasionally corpses with boobs.Overall:  7.5/10This is a fun game that will take you about 8 hours to finish.  You will laugh if you like crude humor or quirky heroes.  You'll enjoy the game if you like the Resident Evil style shooters.  This game would have been much better if some of the gameplay mechanics were brought up to current standards.Buy it if you love stuff like Evil Dead 2.Buy it if you like Suda 51 (No More Heroes)Buy it if you are a necropheliac... naked corpses are everywhere!Rent it if you have about 8 hours to finish the campaign.Rent it if you just want to blow through the campaign.  There are no multiplayer modes and replay value is limited.Avoid it if you don't like d*ck jokes or crude humor.Avoid it if you are a graphics snob.Avoid it if you don't like the Resident Evil style gameplay.If you liked the humor here and have a Wii, try No More Heroes 1 and 2.If you like the gameplay, check out Resident Evil 5, Dead Space 1 or 2, and Left 4 Dead 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2012"}

IX came soon right after and was released to not as much fanfare but it was just as anticipated with not only a return to more lighthearted fares and more brighter atmosphere and colors but was now in spirit to the NES/SNES days of the series with many references. Of course that also meant that several elements felt...\"borrowed\" to say the least so IX is one of those titles that is a pretty fun play and quite memorable but maybe we just expect too much of the series since IX is kind of flawed but still entertaining to a degree.Story: Zidane is part of the Tantalus group, a band of thieves who are planning to sneak into Alexandria Castle and kidnap Princess Garnet. Thing is, however, is that Garnet wants to be kidnapped with worries of her mother, Queen Brahne, and her recent erratic behavior. The group escapes and soon get caught in a huge battle with several kingdoms in turmoil thanks to Brahne and a strange man seen recently in the castle.Graphics: In many ways, IX is ahead of VIII for graphics although VIII is more realistic, IX just outshines it with more detailed and lush backgrounds, diverse locales and more \"animated\" character movements. The FMV's are the definite highlight since there's a grander scope and they're shot similar to Hollywood productions with an eye on vista shots and exciting sequences. The world map as usual looks ugly while battle graphics are usable but not stellar.Sound/Music: IX's soundtrack is probably Nobuo Uematsu's most profilic work, with an excess of 100 tracks, including a separate soundtrack for the music played in FMV's. This is a mixed bag of course since some music such as Messenger of Ruin, The Place I'll Return to Someday, Melodies of Life and Frontier Village Dali are just as great as anything in his oeuvre while there's some decent tracks as well as functional, unmemorable and downright awful. Irony is he says this is his best soundtrack so I'll let you be the judge.Gameplay: The Final Fantasy series has always been similar to each other with the same battle commands, levelling up and side quests available. But what's different is how you get stronger. Similar to the Esper system, a piece of equipment (you have 5 slots: armor, head, body, wrist and special) can come with various abilities, such as Cure and Fire for the mages, Beast Killer for the attackers or support abilities like Antibody and Auto-Life. Each ability has a number of AP for you to master which is received after fighting enemies. After getting the requisitive amount, you can de-equip the equipment and use it freely, whereas if you take it off before you master, you lose the ability until you re-equip it again.The game is also littered with more sidequests with the big 2 being chocographs and Tetra Master. In the world there is the Chocobo forest, where you play a kind of Hot-and-Cold digging game, digging up items with some being chocographs, a visual clue to a treasure found somewhere in the world. Find it and dig it up and you get better rewards. I've gotta say it's quite an addicting game and although there are times where the accuracy of finding items is a bit too picky, it's still easy to be sucked in. As for Tetra Master, it's confusing, at times it's almost unfair and it's just not as involving as Triple Triad. So naturally there'll be a tournament that's required you beat to progress the story. Just play cards from the start and build a collection and you'll be fine.The game's difficulty is also a burden for some since at times it's easy. Personally at times it's unbalanced since if you level up properly, the game can be easy but the ATB meter (a meter fills which'll then allow you to select an action) is way too slow and enemies can pack a wallop, plus your phoenix downs give you a pathetic starting health so don't be surprised if they're re-killed before you even get to cure them. But this isn't an RPG that'll make you rip your hair out but some will either find it way too easy or at times simply unfair.Is it the best in the series? Probably not, unless you particularly love this one. Me, I merely like it: enough to finish it and be entertained by it, but not enough to love it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2006"}

True to its name and following the lead of its predecessor,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlierCall of Dutygames. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Great FPS but not setting the standard","reviewText":"Ugh, I hate these kind of reviews. With the massive hype and anticipation and by extension it's gigantic first day sales, I can't simply criticize the game since apparently I suck and \"should go back to my Wii\" whereas if I love the game I'm just following the sheep and the hype and only thinking what critics and sales are thinking. So here's where the fun begins: can I actually review the game in an objective matter and find the pluses and minuses without everyone on my case about something? Doubt it but I'm going to try anyway. Having done some fair bit of time with all 3 modes presented, I'll say that it's not my Game of the Year but it's certainly a pretty solid release with some nitpicks.Story: Taking place 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare, Imran Zakhaev, the main man responsible for the nuclear attack and the terrorist movement, has been killed but in his place we have his next-in-line, Vladimir Makarov. In traditional Call of Duty fashion, you'll \"body jump\" into several soldiers with the main 2 being James Ramirez and \"Roach\" Sanderson as you team up with \"Soap\" Mactavish from the first game, now a Captain, and Ghost as Makarov has a lot more planned for America than they're maybe prepared for.I'll get my positives out of the way first and say that the campaign is filled with those big gigantic moments that has often been the case with the series. Huge cinematic setpieces and large scale battles take place quite frequently and there's some genuinely shocking moments in the storyline. That being said the campaign doesn't feel as inspired as the first one and whereas the first one's as a whole was strong, there's several levels in this game that fill me with a sense of indifference like \"oh great I have to play THIS level now\". Another thing is that the story is a bit incoherent and I actually had to read up on the internet what happened in a given level to make sense of some of it. Story is full-on Bruckheimer mode really: light on story and character but cranked in action.Graphics: Some cosmetic advances and some refinement in many areas though it's not a massive leap from the first game. There's some beautiful weather effects going on in some places, framerate holds up the whole way and there's some really dynamic setpieces as well. That being said, certain textures were laughable upclose and the damage indicator, what used to be a desaturation of color is now a very annoying and weird looking strawberry jam type thing. It's like getting shot fills your vision with kool-aid and it detracts when you're trying to find cover.Sound/Music: Like a lot of Call of Duty games, the key thing is the sound and it's stunning on headphones and I bet even moreso with surround sound with squad chatter, enemy shouts, gunfire, explosions and the like all at once and never feeling too jumbled or loud for the sake of being loud (my problem with Killzone 2). Voice acting is stellar as well with some returning characters in old bodies, one returning in a new character and some recognizable voices from the Arbiter himself to Lance Henrikson of Aliens. I also loved the more specific squad chatter for example in prior games it was always something vague like \"infantry spotted, behind that car!\" well now they'll actually point it out and say behind an SUV or a cab or which 2nd floor they're actually pointing at.Gameplay: It's largely unchanged, right down to the control scheme and the finding intel that's solely for its own sake it seems; I mean, at least I could read my intel with Resistance 2. One major addition to the game though is Spec-Ops which is either solo, splitscreen or two-player online in more-or-less quick bouts through levels that can range from race down the mountain, fending off waves of enemies or having a specific goal. It's completely fun, at times almost stupifyingly difficult and begs to be played with a friend that knows what they're doing. It sucks the majority of the achievements are tied into these since some are brutal but one thing I will say is that I guess because of this, the veteran campaign is a bit more easier and took me 10 hours. For those of you who care about length, running through the game a 2nd time for the intel run, it took me 4 hours on recruit so yeah, it's a 5-10 hour game.Multiplayer is so far getting a slight bad rep on the message boards for a couple of things. For one, the maps are a bit too intricately designed with many rooms, corners and hideaways that it's practically encouraging campers so are and I hope they go away after awhile. What I do love about the multiplayer though is that it rewards you for everything you do. Killing a frag runner, capturing a control point, killing someone who's holding a grenade, shoot down a helicopter and many others, the game has vast amounts of XP it wants to give you and thankfully there's many ways to get them. And then we have the upgraded killstreaks which range from the standard UAV and air strike but now includes a controllable predator missile, a harrier jet and an AC-130 gunship. My problem with these is that they can severely imbalance a game and one guy can practically clean house with his 29-8 kill/death tally while everyone else can be 4-19. Deathstreaks, added for when you've died a bit too much, give you an additional award which can range from more health upon spawning to copying the entire loadout of whoever killed you but whether its because I'm bad at this game's MP or because players are too good but I found they didn't make much of a difference.Also I wish Infinity Ward took a page from Guerrilla Games (Killzone 2) and separated the players based on level so the new players were playing against new players while the high enders could face off against similar levelled guys because if you've just bought this game and you haven't been besting n00bs in COD4 or World at War than you're going to be seeing the killcam very frequently.  However I'm liking the large amounts of customizing that's going on, capture the flag is a blast and some maps are fun while some are just downright terrible. Hopefully the future map packs will be a bit better designed and even have some maps from the previous game redone a bit. Oh and players online? It's never been cool or funny to say racial epithets and slurs online so cut it out.For those of you curious, I bought the Hardened Edition and in regards to its contents you get mainly 2 things: a really cool artbook showcasing level designs, concept art, weapon detailing and some comments by the developers and a code to download the original Call of Duty with multiplayer and bit more refined graphics. However the game feels and plays primitive and everything from the aiming and shooting to the lack of a run button, having to cycle through menus to access a grenade and even animations make it fun for nostalgic purposes or just simply to see something in Infinity Ward's earlier years but it's not a fun playthrough so far. How's the main game? Fun, frustrating and just the right amount of accessibility and allowing for hardcore players to get their shine on but I would say it's not my game of the year but it is one of its better ones.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2009"}

I thought that Sly 3 will be the final game for Sly, but I was wrong. The game takes place after Sly 3 and the pages of Sly's book, Thievieus Racconus, started to disappear and it is up to Sly and his gang to travel in time to solve everything about Sly's ancestors. This game is awesome and hard.Main characters: The Cooper gang, a group of friends who met each other at a orphanage. Sly, the leader of the entire group and a master thief like his late father and ancestors. Murray, the muscles of the group, and Bentley the brains of the group. Carmelita M. Fox, a tough vixen cop also Sly's nemesis and romantic interest.The Cooper Clan, a group of thieves also Sly's ancestors. Rioichi Cooper, a thief, a master ninja also a master sushi chef in Federal Japan. Tennessee Kid Cooper, a thief in the Wild West. Caveman Cooper aka Bob, the oldest and the first Cooper clan member. Sir Galleth Cooper, a thief also a honorable knight in Medieval England. and Salim Al Kupar, a thief who stole treasures with the forty thieves in ancient Arabia.Villains: Cyrille Le Paradox aka The Collector, a thief like the Cooper family, and the main villain. El Jefe, a Cuban tiger who is a ruthless mercenary. Toothpick, a ruthless armadillo gangster and a greedy \"sheriff\" in the Wild West. The Grizz, a black bear who is a former pop artist and a art thief. The Black Knight aka \"Black Tyrant\" a large armored soldier with a mystery past. Miss Decibel, a British elephant who is a classic singer and she had a accident in her past leaving her unable to sing.Gameplay: Some chapters are hard and some are easy. The controls are easy and they stay the same from the 3 previous Sly games. In this game, you will play all of the gang members also Sly's ancestors. The treasures are back, the clue bottles are back and you will purchase new badass moves from thief net. Like the previous Sly games, you will get jobs to do and fight the boss. The environments are crazy, beautiful and they make the treasures and the clue bottles hard to find. For the first time, this game had masks for you to collect. If you collect all of the masks, you will get many unlockables, if you get all of the treasures, you will get a surprise that I cannot tell .Graphics: WOW, the creators did a awesome job making Sly 4 and the graphics are beautiful, sharp and crisp.As a fan of Sly Cooper, I gave this game and the rest of the 3 previous games 5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

Not only do they suck...they suck like a transvestite prostitute at a Hell's Angels rally.  They suck like a court-appointed attorney.  They suck worse than St. Louis style pizza.  They suck worse than an animal shelter owned by Michael Vick.  They suck worse than Chicago.Well...okay, it's hard to suck as bad as Chicago.  At least no video game based off a movie was ever home to the worst politicians EVER.This game shatters that rule.  It not only shatters it...it obliterates it.The gameplay is actually innovative and fun.  I had a bit of trouble at first figuring things out (the game didn't tell me how to deploy a trap...or at least I didn't see or hear it) but it has a little guide book to help you if you go into your menu.  There's research to be done (although it's hard to get a scan of a creature on the PKE meter when it's throwing a bus at your head).  It's neat to zap ghosts and feel like a real Ghostbuster like when I was a kid.  I grew up watching the Ghostbusters and remember how excited I was when they released Ghostbusters 2.Which brings me to what makes this game shine brighter than any star in the sky...the story and voice acting.You have the ORIGINAL Ghostbusters voicing their characters from the movie.  Bill Murray is fantastic (of course), Dan Akroid is absolutely hilarious as usual, Harold Ramis absolutely rocks the character of Egon with his usual intellectual wit, and Ernie Hudson returns with the straight-faced \"I didn't see no ghost\" one-liners.  Every.  Single.  Scene. Had my girlfriend and I laughing out loud.That's the important thing about this game...it feels like it wasn't made to sell to as many people as possible, it was made for the fans of the original Ghostbusters as a way for Murray, Akroid, Ramis, and Hudson to say \"Thanks, everyone\".I honestly view this game as a gift for my years of watching, quoting, and stopping on a channel that happens to be showing the Ghostbusters movies to grin because I know the funny part is coming up next.\"GET HER!\"That was great, Ray.  \"Get her\".  Real scientific.\"I just panicked...\"\"Ray...if someone asks you if you're a god...you say YES!\"\"THE FLOWERS...ARE STILL...STANDING!\"\"Must have been some cockroach...\"\"It'll bite your head off, man.\"If you don't know the movies...and quite possibly if you didn't GROW UP with the movies and cartoons then you probably won't \"get\" this game.  You'll play it and maybe rate it as average or slightly above average.If you, however, ate, slept, and breathed everything Ghostbuster and can answer the question \"Who you gonna call!?\" in less than a second and with GUSTO then this game will have you looking around with a feeling of creepyness one second and then crying with laughter the next and then RIGHT back to jumping out of your skin and madly flailing around with your proton beam.Back to the game as I'm getting off on a nostalgic rant.  There are bonus items in the form of \"Cursed Artifacts\" to collect.  There are ghosts to read about by scanning them and entering them into your Tobin's Spirit Guide.  There are also \"power ups\" to buy to improve your equipment and a running total of damage caused to all of the locations you visit.If you, your children, spouse, best friend, or your pet are a fan of the Ghostbusters then you owe it to yourself to get this game.  I have a half played copy of Call of Duty:  Modern Warfare 2 sitting in the video game drawer that is seeing little playtime because I am now taking a trip down memory lane with the guys with nuclear accelerators on their backs.So I'll say it loud and say it proud as I aim for the flat-top!\"Bustin' makes me feel GOOD!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"Adventure gaming at its best","reviewText":"Tomb Raider's back and its better than ever!  But this isn't the fun, carefree Tomb Raider from the 90s which featured smooth, sexy adventuress  Lara Craft going on exotic pulp adventures.  This is a blood soaked, action packed, ultra-violent venture into darkness certain to win over fans and newcomers alike.The  gameplay of 2013's Tomb Raider is easily the best the franchise has ever produced!  As someone who has always struggled with the camera controls on the Tomb Raider franchise I am happy to inform you that this Tomb Raider's controls run perfectly!  Not once did I fight the camera controls during the game's single-player campaign.  And if you're looking action than Tomb Raider is more than happy to provide it.  The gun play is solid, and the action intense.  Some of the large set pieces in this game are absolutely unbelievable!  The only disappointment is the lack of any truly difficult puzzles.  Puzzle solving is a key aspect of the series and it is something Crystal Dynamics should work harder on.As I've made clear, none of Tomb Raider 2013's problems come from its gameplay.  things I took issue with were in Tomb Raider's story.  Don't get me wrong, there are outstanding elements in this script and we really see Lara's progression as a character.  Tomb Raider's problem lies in a plot twist which seems to come out of left field completely catching the gamer off guard (in a bad way).  The game markets itself as a gritty, dark tale of survival, and for the first third of the game it executes that perfectly.  Then, without any warning, it switches to a pulp fantasy adventure complete with Ancient Japanese spirits, curses, and giant lifts (which we are meant to believe have been assembled out of garbage).The supernatural twist makes for a great action experience, but from a narrative perspective it breaks the whole \"survival\" aspect that the developers emphasized so much in the marketing.  I love this game, but I just can't deny that this is a huge misstep in the narrative.  I get it, Crystal Dynamics didn't want to depart completely from the classic Tomb Raider, but a bit more warning that the plot was about to spiral into supernatural -albeit blood soaked- pulp would have greatly improved the narrative flow.But not to worry, for when the story stumbles our new Lara Craft is there to save the day, keeping the gamer engaged from start to finish.  She is a solid character and is one that you want to follow even as the plot begins losing its focus.  Her transformation from frightened young woman to battle hardened survivor is well told and makes for a great character arc.  She is not the charismatic, cool under pressure Lara of the original games, but she is a believable young woman who I believe gamers will come to embrace on her own merits.Tomb Raider is a game you'd be a fool not to play.  Once I started playing I couldn't put this game down and that is a testament to how exciting the game is.  Despite narrative hick ups, some poor character writing (you can tell who's going to live and die the instant you start the game), and the previously mentioned twist, Tomb Raider succeeds at pulling you into its action.  Whether its silently hunting a group of enemies in the dead of the night or setting the entire island -and anyone who gets your away- aflame.Simply put: Tomb Raider is an adventure worth taking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect.

Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Samario C.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Edward \"war02orc\"","summary":"Trust me, this game is worth the money.","reviewText":"This game has next to no flaws in it. The first flaw I found is the controls are a little bit too complicated for a Mario game (ie: &lt;,>, A to do a spuer jump and rotate Joystick and press A for tornado jump). The other minor flaw is that the camera angle often shifts at the worst times making you send Mario in the wrong direction (very, very annoying). Other wise the game is great. The Plot? Mario travels to the tropical Isle Delfino in search of a long awated vacation. When he arrives, he finds someone who looks exactly like Mario has been spreading sludge and grafiti all over the tropical paradise. The local police mistakeingly arrest Mario. Now, in order to clear his name and be freed from prison, Mario must clean up the mess and catch the Mario imposter.The graphics are beautiful in this game and there are no skips in framerate. The camera angle is fully movable by the player (although it will automatically move itself to how it thinks you want it.... annoying) and the controls are smooth. Despite the somewhat complicated controls, you will grow used to them after about 15-30 min of gameplay. The game isn't a short one (by short I mean I didn't complete it in 2-3 hours) and the gameply becomes addicting.Want a more specific description? Remember Super Mario 64? The controls, gameplay, almost everything was based off what they did in that game only it has been improved to GC standards.If you liked Super Mario 64, you will love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Excellent concept, shoddy gameplay.","reviewText":"This game has a great idea behind it. Putting characters from two beloved franchises (Final Fantasy and Disney) into a brand-new storyline with a few new, original characters is a stroke of genius, and it works well. The environments are colorful and perfectly capture the fantasy vibe; the original PSone models of old FF characters are brought to the next-gen world with great graphics and superb voice-acting. The story itself is also interesting. So I happily leapt into this game, really excited about the whole thing.Then, something terrible happened: gameplay. Sora (the main character) moves so clunkily and imprecisely that both combat and exploration are a chore. If battles were turn-based in classic Square fashion, this would be easier to deal with, but they're not. They're done in real-time, meaning that you are never given a rest from the painful controls. No matter how fast I tapped the buttons or moved the control stick, Sora's attacks were always several steps behind my commands. And when I was platforming in the \"exploration\" segments, his pitiful jumps and tendency to keep moving once I released the analog stick was continually frustrating.All this wouldn't be so bad if the game was forgiving enough to accomodate the interface, but that isn't the case. Indeed, the difficulty is actually harder than many games I've played with better control schemes. Enemies are whip-quick and surround you in a flash; platforms are tiny and widely spaced; and replenishing items are always in short supply.Another complaint I have is that the puzzles don't make sense. Unlike better RPGs (Paper Mario 2, for example), where you can analyze the area and figure out what you're supposed to do, Kingdom Hearts gives you no clues. I would have been stumped within minutes if I didn't have the strategy guide to back me up. Like everything else in the game, the puzzles must be done perfectly, with no mistakes, or you have to start over. Seeing as you don't know if something is a mistake or not until you do it, this gets very tedious and frustrating.Overall, playing this game felt like trying to dismantle a ticking time bomb with no tools, where touching one wire could mean death: stressful, confusing, and definitely not fun. And after a while, it doesn't even matter that the bomb is decorated with beloved characters and bright colors.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2005"}

Rhodes","summary":"Don't Judge a Book by its cover","reviewText":"At first glance Kingdom Hearts seems like a game that only a child would enjoy.  But at second glance the game is an RPG masterpiece!  With a great storyline, great music, top notch voice acting and a Unique way to battle and move around, the game easily scores a five.You control a young Boy named Sora (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) and he travels through the different realms of the Disney Kingdom trying to stop the heartless in an attempt to restore piece to the land and save the world.  While not as good as previous RPGs, this gives RPGers a little something different to enjoy.Battling is a little different.  To sum it all up, its very similar to Secret of Mana and Legend of Mana.  Thus meaning you can't control your two sub characters but you control the main one.  For each enemy you defeat you get MP orbs and HP orbs to restore health (like candy in Legend of Mana).  This is also interesting because when running around in towns you can choose to pick up something or other events.The characters present a more animated look.  I know that by some of the people they'll say its a kids game becasue of the disney characters (shame on you gamers for not even trying it first).  The voice acting for these characters is top notch with Haley Joel Osment doing the voice of Sora. Characters from the Final Fantasy series are here too. From Aeris and Cloud, to Squall and Yuffie, to the legendary Sephiroth.  The only problem is that Lance Bass is the voice of Sephiroth and while to some it doesn't seem like much, to those who've played FF7 they know that Lance Bass doesn't have the Sephiroth voice.The graphics are amazing and they look very realistic.  The music is great, and gameplay is too.  But if you've seen the disney moves a lot then you'll note that you might know the outcome of some events being that its like playing through the disney movie itself.This game also takes a new step in the RPG world.  When you select a new game you can choose to select Expert mode or Normal mode.  Not to mention that you can also answer the first series of question to decide how fast your characters level up!  So you could put it on expert and level up slowly for a hard experience.Don't judge this so much on the characters, if your like me this game is good Nostalga for a Disney Lover like myself.  The gameplay is unique and the game has several mini-games and side quest.  It has a ton of secrets as well. The only other problem with this game is the annoying camera angles.OVERALL the game desrves a five.On the good side+Great Graphics+Stunning music+Great gameplay+For the Secret of Mana and Final Fantasy lovers+Difficulty settings in an RPG finally!+A HUGE cast of characters+Top Notch voice acting.The Bad-Lance Bass is the voice of Sephiroth-Annoying Camera angles-Seems short for an RPG compared to today-Too many people are gonna overlook this game because of the Disney Characters","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2002"}

I certainly appreciated the dynamic of first playing as the killer, Lucas Kane, then turning right around and playing as the cops that would be chasing him.One of the most interesting aspects of IP is first playing through a section as Lucas, then when it's time to control the cops -- Karla and Tyler -- you (the player) know exactly what to do to zero in on Lucas, but they do not.  It's amusing to steer Lucas in one direction and the cops in another, making them chase a completely useless lead.  For example, at the beginning, you can make Lucas escape the restaurant by taking the subway instead of getting in a taxi, and when controlling Karla/Tyler, have Karla go near the parked taxi outside the diner.  She'll have the idea to grill local taxi companies for information regarding passengers.  You can do little things like this if you're a sadistic bastard who likes seeing cops on wild goose chases.Which brings me to one of the problems in this game: although IP is supposedly an open-ended game with multiple endings and an \"ever-changing\" storyline, this is hardly the case; the game only gives the illusion that this is so.  Many of the different \"endings\" are nothing more than \"you are dead\" message screens, game-over screens if you will.  There is only one \"true\" ending, and there really are no branching storylines at all.  Quite disappointing.IP also falls victim to the 2 classic problems that seem to plague just about every adventure game ever made: stiff, awkward controls and bad camera angles.  Walking feels like wading through waist-deep water, and when you try to run by holding down X, you'll have trouble turning and stopping.  I know Atari was going for \"lifelike\" here, but when simply moving around the environment becomes a chore, you know you've got problems.  Interestingly enough, the cinematic movies and cut-scenes are very well animated: they're smooth and fluid (owing to the motion capture), and they are the sequences that you can't control (how ironic).As far as the camera goes, 95% of the game suffers through static, fixed camera angles.  When you're in an outdoor environment you have the ability to freely rotate the camera, but indoors you only have pre-set, fixed camera positions.  And yep, you guessed it: you spend 95% of the game indoors.  This, combined with the stiff controls, can raise your blood pressure, especially when trying to solve timed puzzles (i.e. Lucas has to hide incriminating evidence and answer the door before the cop breaks it down).  There are two instances where the game switches into 1st person as you're controlling Karla; I actually found it easier to move around and control the action in this view.  I kinda wish the game gave the option to play in 1st person all the time.And this game has two major flaws: one, it is just too darn short.  I bought the game, played it, and finished it in one day -- a little over 7 hours.  Second, the game's script tries to do too much (including a romance subplot that comes out of absolutely nowhere); near the end, the game frantically tries to tie up all the loose ends as quickly as possible, so the ending doesn't quite feel satisfying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00CX8VY4S","description":"","reviewerName":"JSiph","summary":"The Vigilante didn't live up to the hype, however is still a great game.","reviewText":"I've wanted Watch Dogs from the moment I saw its trailer. It's pretty much the same format as any other Ubisoft open-world game, find viewpoint, unlock, do tasks in that area, go to next viewpoint. The only thing that impressed me really (was better than I expected) was the story. A couple of things that bugged me about the game was, one, it is stupidly easy (still fun), but it offers zero challenge. It also is very short for an open-world game, I beat it in less than a week 100%. It is alot like GTA.Story:- In an alternate reality in Chicago,it starts out in a hotel where you, Aiden Pierce, is working a hacking job with your partner Damien Brenks. Things go awry as soon as you get in, the intrusion is detected, Damien gets greedy and tries to work it but gets traced. A hit is placed on you, but they kill your niece instead of you. You have a vendetta to find out the people responsible. However Damien turns on you and kidnaps your sister. The rest is for you to find out.Pros:- The hacking part is what makes this game innovative. The environment around you is your most useful tool for catching bad guys and escaping the police.- The story is very well written and creates a very unique atmosphere.- The voice acting is decent and not annoying like Desmond in Assassin's Creed.- For a Third-person shooter it is very fun and fast-paced. The cover system works very well.- Driving is a huge part of the game and it is extremely fun with the hacking.- You can use jam coms and blackouts, etc. With your smartphone via the Xbox one smartglass app.- Online is very fun.- There are tons of minigames (Digital trips are probably the most fun)Cons:- Stupidly easy, it is really hard to fail at anything in this game (except stupid drinking game)- Drinking game is insanely difficult.- Pretty much unlimited ammo.- There's no good or bad from playing as a good guy or bad guy, they still call the police on you if you have the highest public image.- For an open world game it's very small.- Also for an open-world game, you can't go into many houses/buildings and if you can it's mostly just the bottom floor.- The kinect is not used at all with this game.- A couple acts are rather anti-climatic. (Defalt is really random, has no backstory, and has no point but to delay the story)Other:- I beat this game 100% in a week, got all 1000G.- The achievements are very easy to get, excluding the 15G Social Lubricant achievement (ridiculously hard)Buy this game if:- You like games with deep stories- You enjoy GTA type games- Honestly, I'd wait for it to drop in price before buying. I don't think it's worth the $60 at the moment.Don't buy this game if:- You have small children (there is a lot of cursing)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"dookerJ","summary":"THE game you want to show off to your friends.  10/10!  Best game to date!","reviewText":"This game is incredible.  Simply put, this is THE game you want to have friends over to show off.More and more, we are seeing PS4 games where the concept graphics differ virtually none from the actual game.  Furthermore, one cannot discern between real-time and pre-rendered scenes; the graphical fidelity is always top-notch and consistent.At the outset, I would say, don't read a lot of reviews, watch videos, read walkthroughs, etc; as this game has numerous surprises, and it's way more fun when you get to experience the surprise for yourself.  Everything just *works*.  You're never left wondering how to do something or where to go, and it's so open-world, you can do anything in any order you wish.  Kudos to Sucker Punch and the game testers who made the gameplay FLAWLESS.  It wasn't so many years ago that even in an AAA title, it was difficult to make a character walk down stairs properly.  In this game, you can do EVERYTHING.  And all the side missions are interesting and have purpose, which is the way it should be.  They will gain you new knowledge, new abilities, and keep the story going, plus they are pure joy to do...  How can parkour and conduit powers ever get old?And the engine!  We've kept hearing the word \"photorealism\", but this game really gets there.  In the cutscenes (which are realtime, not pre-rendered) the facial (and body) animation is truly the most realistic that I have seen since LA Noir; a great game that was a bit ahead of its time and didn't get enough light (pardon the pun) shun on it.This game is EPIC.  It just keeps throwing new powers, new missions, new abilities, new plot elements, etc, at you, and never lets up.  Going for 100% is FUN, every second of it; but even then, you will want to re-play the game to play using the other Karma system.  This Karma system is great; it determines things that happen in the world, and your abilities, and even what the general public thinks of you.  It even becomes a challenge in itself; as if you get a \"Karma Streak\" you gain the ability to do an Orbital Drop, flying high in the air and then smashing down upon foes, leaving a large blast radius.  During a second play through as \"evil\"/\"Infamous\" Karma, the new powers, new missions, etc, all make for a very different play through, controls, scenes, dialogue, and all.On that note, without any spoilers, I recommend going the \"good\"/\"Hero\" Karma route during the first play through.  Then you will be inspired to try to the evil Karma play through, which is quite a bit harder (it goes against instinct to not rescue people, people dislike you, etc; it is like New Game Plus, in my opinion).  This is great, though, as there are special powers associated with each, and different story lines, so the game can be what you make it, equalling at least two games in one!  The second play through is really great, because everything is different, you get to see what you missed the first time around.  This harkens back to the days of old NES games when you had a \"second quest\" after finishing the first!  And at least two REAL ENDINGS, they don't mess around.  And if/when there's DLC in the future, I will definitely be picking that up.  Kudos, too, for NOT having the typical \"micro transactions\" and other gimmicks that some publishers have been sneaking into their games.  It's a massive, complete game, and the extra wait shows they really gave it a lot of polishing.  This game is like a magician that never runs out of magic tricks.  It is really quite an accomplishment.The game's AI is worth a mention, too...  Whatever rocket scientist came up with the enemy AI is a genius.  None of the old glitches fighting enemy AI are present in this game; enemies are incredibly intelligent and strategic.  They have to be!  Just think, when you have such a powerful protagonist, how do you make things challenging?  It's something they solved with great effort; it's perfection.  I'm also stunned at the pure amount of stuff going on at any time-citizens, traffic, street lights, not to mention all of the architecture, side quests, power ups, and a million other things.  It's a living, breathing, world, all in this game.  I predict quite a few studios will copy concepts invented for this game; it is innovation in its purest form.Nearly everything in the game's wonderfully crafted world (with creative liberties) of Seattle is destructible, climbable, malleable, intractable...  The sky is the limit.  Doing a \"dash\" (where you turn into particles and swirl through the air\" is great for regaining health, but also lets you travel far-you can dash into air vents, and fly out of the tops of buildings!  Delsin sometimes exclaims, \"Wooooohooo!!!\", and that's pretty much the entire feeling of this game summed up into one word.  It's pure fun, gorgeous to look at (I've never used the screenshot/share function so much in any game).  There are more powers, but don't read up on them, experience the surprise for yourself!  It really keeps you guessing, which few games are able to do.If you're a fan of 90s culture, you'll love the homage to that era and its music, as well.Sucker Punch was one of the many dev studios flown out to Sony's Japanese studio to give input on what they wanted in an ideal console and controller, and it shows.  The controls are flat out perfect.  Really innovative and natural-feeling use of the touchpad on the PS4; I can't see gaming without it now.  The quick swipes, holds, two-finger holds, etc, all make perfect sense and never fail.  A lot of care was put into the crafting of this game, which has been in development since the inception of the PS4.  Did I mention, it was totally worth the wait?This game was well worth the wait, and even better than the hype.  Sony, with the PS4, has pretty much shut down the Xbone with this latest epic game.  Don't believe reviews you see on MS marketing websites.  This game is easily a 10/10!It's a great time to be a gamer, and PS4 is making that possible.  Kudos to Sony and Sucker Punch for creating such an epic and downright fun game.  Will be playing this one a looonnngg time.  I hope at some point, Sony will remaster, or at least port, the previous entries in the series, to be playable on PS4, as I'd be interested in those now, too (I somehow missed them before; this one is NOT to be missed)!  But firstly, I can't wait for DLC, sequels, etc!Sony has promised 20+ exclusives for the PS4 this year alone, and are delivering in spades.  I can't wait to see the coming titles.  Being able to get games now straight through PSN (and Amazon codes for PSN), straight to the PS4, is a huge plus; no waiting in traffic to have a game store asking you for personal info that will go straight to marketing callers, etc.Go with the limited edition of this game, since it's the same price but has added content.  Nothing major, but a few extras for the same price.  Either way, it is, as I mentioned, truly one of the greatest games ever made.Lastly, I highly recommend the SonyGold Wireless Stereo Headsetto go with the game.  This headset is excellent.  Once you use it, you'll never go back to TV speakers; you can hear so much more.  I've been using it for Killzone: Shadow Fall, Battlefield 4, and now InFAMOUS: Second Son.  The 7.1 surround sound (multiple speakers in each ear, and a mic for voice chat, plus noise canceling) actually really helps with gaming; as you can find items/players/etc by directional sound.  There is a headphone app, too, which allows you to load presets for mode 2 (there are 2 modes-normal mode and preset mode); Second Son already has its own preset available in the app, tuned specifically for the game.  Works great!!!  PS, if playing a multiplayer game like Killzone, hit the mute button on the side, and unmute when you need to talk (so others don't hear your background noise, etc; it's common courtesy).Game on!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Engrossing and magical...","reviewText":"Nintendo's been trying hard to bring its major franchises -- Mario, Metroid, and F-Zero, to name a few -- to the Gamecube.  Almost two years after the release of the Gamecube, they've finally released the next game in the Legend Of Zelda series.  And fans will not be disappointed.Some have derided the game as &quot;kiddy&quot; (an argument often leveled against Nintendo and its products), pointing to its cartoonish cel-shaded graphics, the easy-to-understand storyline, and the young age of the protagonist, but to do so is to overlook one of the most engrossing games available for the Gamecube.  While the game is certainly accessible to younger players -- the difficulty is not extraordinary, though some of the puzzles may require parental assistance -- older ones will find plenty to like.The graphical style has probably been the most hotly debated part of the entire game (which is odd, because Zelda titles have generally been renowned more for their gameplay than for flashy graphics).  Rather than the texture-mapped pseudo-realistic 3D style you generally see (as in, say, Super Mario Sunshine), the entire game world is rendered with a technique called &quot;cel-shading&quot; (a &quot;cel&quot; being what traditional pen-and-ink animators call a single frame of animation).  This gives the game a bright, colorful, and at times cartoonish look.  It's a bit underwhelming at first, but as you explore the game world's vast terrain, you can appreciate how much style and personality it gives the game.The gameplay is similar to what was seen in Nintendo's two N64 Zelda games (Ocarina Of Time and Majora's Mask).  This is not a bad thing, especially since Ocarina Of Time is widely regarded as one of the best videogames ever produced.  The combat system has been slightly tweaked, as you are now able to counter-attack enemies, and you have a few more moves of your own.  You can also disarm some foes, and pick up and wield various enemies' weapons.  Wind Waker feels a bit less connected than the last few games, because the entire world is a giant ocean dotted with several dozen islands.  Some of the islands contain sprawling towns and mysterious dungeons, while others are little more than barren points of rock (though almost all of them hold some sort of secret).  Link's trusty Ocarina has been replaced by a magical conductor's baton, with which you must tap out various rhythms on the controller in order to cast magical spells.  The game also features connectivity with the Game Boy Advance, allowing a second player to assist you in certain areas.For those of you who still have your doubts, I have a short story to relate:  When I got this game, I was living in a dorm with about 30 other people, and as I was in school, I didn't have a ton of time to play it.  My Gamecube lived downstairs in the communal TV room.  One day during finals, I had nothing to do, so I went to see if I could play my new game.  What I found was one of my friends playing, and about 8 other people sitting there, just watching him play and shouting helpful advice.  I came back a few hours later and they were all still there.  If that's not the definition of engrossing, I don't know what is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2003"}

I honestly wish the game was complete garbage so I could sweep it out of my memory.  Unfortunately, the game is a bit of a paradox.  It has so much going for it (the story, the soundtrack, the voice acting and writing, the cameos, and some of the gameplay) that the major faults of the game become ever more present in your mind the longer you play it.  You can feel the love of the developers have for \"metal culture,\" and that love remains apparent throughout.  The story was actually pretty good, and it hints at something running much deeper, although I doubt we will see a sequel in the next decade, if ever.  Even before I had gotten far into the story (2 or 3 missions) I was already questioning the decision to make Brutal Legend an open world game.  It was fun to drive around for a while, but the thrill of running over creatures and finding \"artifacts\" to unlock songs, stat increases, etc. wears off quickly.  Very quickly.  All of the \"side quest\" type activities are repetitive brawls, turret defense, hunting missions, and races.  These are largely mindless and leave you unsatisfied.The game really loses steam and never recovers when you're introduced to your first stage battle.  These stage battles are boring, simple, and repetitive (there's that word again...).  I played on Brutal difficulty, and I only \"lost\" one, which I then restarted and won in about ten minutes.  I don't even see how hardcore RTS fans could enjoy these.  Every one is almost identical in terms of strategy and tactics, even when you're facing different \"factions.\"  After sitting through a couple of these stage battles I would audibly groan when the scaffolding would start shooting up and the stage lights would come on.  I didn't bother trying the multiplayer (a rarity for me) as I had no desire to do stage battles online.If you grew up watching Headbanger's Ball or are otherwise in love with metal, you should check the game out simply because it will really bring back some good memories.  For everybody else, Brutal Legend is cheap enough that you won't be taking a great risk trying it for yourself.

Blizzard","summary":"Set Sail in the Star Ocean","reviewText":"Star Ocean: The Last Hope (TLH) International is the fourth installment in the Star Ocean role playing game (RPG) series.  The developers of this game, tri-Ace, are fans of science fiction and it shows in every iteration of Star Ocean.  The fourth entry is no different in this regard.  Microsoft is trying to buy their way into the Japanese gaming market by luring away titles or having time sensitive exclusivity. Therefore, Xbox 360 had this game for a year before their agreement with Square Enix ran out.  Nevertheless, the game sold well on the Xbox 360 in Japan where their presence is about 1/5 of Sony's.  Now, PlayStation 3 owners get to enjoy it under the \"International\" moniker.  There are several differences with this version, aside from needing only a single disc instead of three on the 360, such as different language tracks, alternate anime portraits, better balancing of items, and bug fixes.Story:  Star Ocean has always had interesting, if not cliched, stories.  Typically, they often involve a seemingly normal protagonist who becomes the savior of the universe.  Along the way, there will be people who guide this hero and alter the course of events.  Star Ocean TLH is no different and, at times, takes a slightly darker course from the previous games.  You will travel to several new planets, space stations, other dimensions, and even 1957 Earth in this game.Although Star Ocean TLH is the fourth in the series, it is a prequel to the other titles.  In this title, humans on Earth were not living a peaceful life, the world government often had clashes with other states.  This led to electromagnetic pulse weapons being used, however, there was glitch or error in the devices and nukes were launched instead.  This was the beginning of World War III and lasted only a week before what remained of humanity signed a treaty and went underground to escape the contaminated environment.  Left with a barren, toxic world, humanity looked to the stars (The star ocean, as it is called in-game) and developed faster-than-light drives, fitting them to several spacecraft whose mission is to find a suitable home for humanity.  The mission started off well, but then the problems began.  This is where the rest of Star Ocean TLH's story picks up.In this game, you are joined by a number of companions you will adventure with throughout the game,  the badly-named Edge Maverick, who is you, your childhood friend, Reimi, who is excellent with a bow, the Eldarian, Faize, who is a Spock-like character with impeccable manners, the traumatized 15-year old girl who speaks in a monotone voice and looks eight, Lymle, who also has a pet demon, the emotionless cyborg, Bacchus, who is also a rocket-launching scientist, the cat girl, Meracle, who is always hungry, the seductive sorceress, Myuria, who, as Meracle points out, has \"Really big thingy's,\" the flightless featherfolk, Sarah, who possesses a kind heart but is ditsy and very naive, and finally, the battle-hardened solider, Arumat, who calls himself death incarnate.  This is very much a motley crew of individuals who each bring their own unique perspective to the game.Star Ocean TLH's story is very interesting, it can have a very cliched moment right night to a moving one followed by humor.  Indeed, there are some truly moving moments in this game where I found myself becoming misty-eyed and others where I laughed out loud.  For the most part, it is a typical Japanese RPG in how it presents the story.  Story progression and the final resolution of it is set and cannot be altered.  However, given the large number of characters, you can change how their stories end.  Throughout the game, there are a series of private actions where you can alter your relationship with your team mates, and, if you get their affection for you high enough, you can see their specific ending.  These private actions form over half of each character's back story and should be viewed.  Like the rest of the story, it can be moving, such as helping a character deal with the loss of another, or funny, such as walking in on Reimi in the shower or watching Faize and Lymle argue constantly.Audio/Visual:  The Star Ocean franchise has usually had graphics on par with games that are launched around the same time.  The art style of Star Ocean TLH is similar to that of Xenosaga I, only more colorful and, obviously, better.  This is a game deeply rooted in Japanese anime, thus, the characters do not look at all like those in Xenosaga II or even Final Fantasy XIII.  The characters and many of the environments look highly detailed and it is obvious that care was taken to make the game very sci-fi.  However, not all is great on the graphics front, the environments, though large and detailed, are muddy or out of focus, and, I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the console or the port from the Xbox 360, but this game needs at least basic anti-aliasing as jagged edges are everywhere in confined environments.  During battles, the game's graphics do shine nicely, but the character models look like anime porcelain dolls.  Star Ocean TLH runs at 720p and occupies most of the game disc.  This is a vast game with a long story and many interconnected towns, field screens, dungeons, and CGI cut scenes, tri-Ace may have simply run out of space putting all three Xbox 360 discs onto one Blu-Ray and have been unable to increase the graphics.In regards to audio, this game can be a bit of a mixed bag.  Musically, the game follows the same path all of the other Star Ocean's did, classical music during key moments with progressive rock at others.  This fits Star Ocean quite well with exciting tracks when needed and sweeping orchestral music at pivotal moments.  This blend gives the game a distinct science fiction feel, some of the music even sounds like it belongs in Star Trek.  This is all probably due to the abilities of Motoi Sakuraba who wrote the tracks to every Star Ocean.  As for the voice acting, it is also mixed in terms of quality.  Unlike Final Fantasy XII, which used theatre actors for voices, Star Ocean TLH used anime actors.  This leads to average voiceovers, as a whole, but there are some standout characters.  Reimi is perhaps the best voiced of the cast and is performed by Laura Bailey who voiced Serah in Final Fantasy XIII.  One of the more infamous voices is that of Lymle.  Because of the trauma she experienced, she sounds, and looks, unless you unlock one of the game's endings, emotionless.  At first this was annoying, but as I listened to her, the monotone nature of the voice leads to several emotional moments where she tries to summon emotion but just can't, unable to overcome the mental block, making the scene more impactful.  I strongly suggest anyone who plays this game and finds the voices, at the very least, tolerable, to go into the settings and turn off battle voices as they say the same things constantly.  Alternatively, since this is the international version, you can listen to the Japanese audio tracks.  While playing the game, you will notice the lip-syncing is off.  The movies were not redone from Japanese and still retain their Japanese lip movements.Gameplay:  All of the Star Ocean games are large with plenty to do, this one is no different.  There are a great number of quests, shop item creation orders, races, and gladiator matches.  Most of the quests are typical \"Take this there\" or \"Kill this\" but there are some more involved quests that require puzzle solving or going to the ends of map to complete.  There are also 100 or more item creation or delivery quests you receive from shops.  These either involve venturing out into the field to hunt down hard-to-find items or going back to your ship to use the item creation system to fashion an item.In Star Ocean TLH, item creation is often the only means to get the game's best equipment and to complete many of the quests.  The previous Star Ocean did not have a deep item creation system and it was often unnecessary to use it.  However, in this installment, the item creation system is a little better.  Before you can make an item, you must either research to or find a \"Recipe Memo.\" Researching can be an interesting ordeal, you place one to three of your team mates in a group and tell them to go and research.  As they research, they use party skill points (SP) to come up with new items.  Since each character has a specialization and certain positive or negative stats, certain items require the use of specific characters to unlock them.  Once you do this, you simply gather the needed materials and build the item.  Shops can have some needlessly infuriating orders.  You have an inventory limit of 20 per item and if an order requires seven items but the recipe requires five items during item creation, you have to go back to your ship several times with your inventory maxed out to create the item and go back out to buy or hunt down more ingredients to complete the order.  Thankfully, with few exceptions, none of the shop order quests are time sensitive and you can wait until the end of the game when it becomes easier to travel to all planets for those particularly troublesome items.  In Star Ocean TLH, there are hundreds of possible recipes spanning a number of fields.Star Ocean TLH is an RPG with some interesting options for character development.  Each character has special arts, symbols (Magic), and other abilities that increase stats or allow for special actions to be taken on the field.  You, naturally, level up, but you also gain skill points (SP) for each character to level them up.  There is also party-wide SP which comes from quests or harvesting materials which is used for item creation or to help level up a critical skill when a party member has run out of their own SP.  Almost all skills require the use of SP to level up.  Battle skills also require SP and provide valuable bonuses to stats or abilities such as auto-heal, often reaching extremely high levels when fully leveled up.  However, to keep a character from becoming overly powerful, you can only have two active battle skills at any given time.  There is also the BEAT system which grants stat bonuses based on an overall play style for a character.  One BEAT is more defensive and grants stat bonuses and abilities to defense whereas the other goes towards offensive stats.  The defensive BEAT (B) also affects the rush gauge.  The rush gauge fills as you either take or cause damage.  If it reaches full capacity, you can enter rush mode where certain attributes are increased.  If you activate rush mode while in the vicinity of another character and press the trigger button, you enter a quick time event.  If you complete this perfectly, you can cause a tremendous amount of damage in a very short amount of time since standard special arts and symbols with both characters are drastically increased in power.  Each of the two BEATS have 20 levels and there is a third BEAT which uses both BEATs simultaneously but cannot level up either while active.Star Ocean has always had an innovative battle system, it is similar to Grandia's battle system only fully real time.  Battles themselves do not take place on the field screen and you can avoid enemies, once you come in contact, you are taken to an arena where you fight.  You are able to field up to four characters at a given time and one remains under the direct control of the player.  This allows the player to select which one to play, though they may jump between characters at any given time, based on their play style.  Personally, I preferred Reimi since she uses a bow from the distance and rarely comes under attack unless she takes direct offensive action.  The other characters are all under the control of the AI and their actions are set by tactics you choose.  These tactics aren't very specific, but you can change them during battle and turn off any symbols or skills you don't want used.  Although the battles are in real time, you can access the battle menu at any time to use items, launch certain attacks, adjust tactics or BEAT's, swap out characters, or add and remove equipment.  In battle, you can also chain special arts and symbols together to trigger them immediately after initial use and increase their damage potential.  Star Ocean TLH uses something called the blindside, which, if performed correctly, causes the character to avoid damage, swing behind the enemy, and attack them from the rear, often granting a critical hit.  Using a blindside does have its risks, not all enemies are vulnerable to them and some will attack you with a critical hit if you attempt to use it.  Some characters can do blindsides better than others.  Another unique feature of this game is the bonus board.  If you defeat an enemy in a certain way, you get a colored gem added to the board.  This gem grants special post-battle bonuses such as restoring a certain amount hit points or increasing experience.  It is possible to double the amount of experience you receive from battle using the board.  The board will carry over from battle to battle unless you load a saved game.  However, if an enemy scores a critical hit against the player-controlled character, the board breaks.  This leads to an interesting risk/reward system in battle, do you perform the blindside or perform the lengthy and very damaging symbol and risk an enemy critical hit, or do you find a safer location or alter your tactics to better keep the bonus board intact?  The battle system is quite fun and I was never bored with it.Misc.:  I enjoy science fiction and I also enjoy Japanese RPG's.  You can imagine my joy when Xenosaga came out.  Star Ocean Till the End of Time was also released and I liked it, but I believed that Xenosaga was the best with the way it blended sci-fi and RPG's together.  Then, the six-part Xenosaga got cut to three and the game's developer came under the direct control of Nintendo cutting all hope I had for a high definition follow-up to my beloved Xenosaga.  I then went back to Star Ocean and was excited to see Star Ocean TLH coming to a modern console... the one I did not have nor wanted to buy.  Several months following release on the Microsoft console, I was overjoyed to see it returning to a Sony system.  Although I was disappointed to see it on the Xbox 360 first, I do believe the PlayStation 3 received the best version of the game given the audio and increased capacity of the Blu-Ray disc.Star Ocean TLH is a game you can enjoy if you already like Japanese RPG's.  If you do not like that particular genre, stay away from this game at it is very much part of it.  This game is compared very frequently to the newly released Final Fantasy XIII and it is easy to see why.  Star Ocean TLH doesn't have all of the polish FF XIII has and can stumble in places, but it is also a much longer game.  Critics who did not like FF XIII because of the shortened game and lack of towns, will find many of those issues resolved since there is plenty to do in this game.  For me, I had my main battle party (Reimi, Edge, Myuria/Sarah, Arumat) at level 60 and completed 60 to 70 percent of the quests clocking in at 64 hours.  Still, this game does not have the name recognition of the Final Fantasy franchise and given the demographics of PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 owners in Japan and North America, I doubt it will be anywhere near as successful as most of the titles in the other franchise.  It will still sell reasonably well with already over one million sold in all territories, but with the ridiculous year-long exclusivity on the 360 and gamers moving on to other, newer games on the PS3, I believe that sales of this game will not be as high as they could have been if this title had been released simultaneously on both systems worldwide.As for the trophies, only the most dedicated, extreme completionists, or gamers with obsessive compulsive disorders, should even try to obtain the platinum trophy for this game.  The trophies take completion to a whole new level.  For example, you must complete every single quest in the game, some of which vanish permanently due to unfortunate events.  You must also complete the game three times at progressively harder difficulty levels.  The most insanely difficult one involves obtaining 100% of the in-game battle trophies.  These are awarded as you complete certain battle objectives, such as \"Land five critical hits in a row,\" or \"Defeat 30,000 enemies,\" but some are very specific, such as \"Deal 1,111 points of damage.\" Each character has their own battle trophies, about 100, and they can only be obtained while you are directly in control of that character.  In short, you must have limitless patience if you want to even bother with getting the platinum.  There are also no gold trophies for this game.  Overall, I suggest Star Ocean The Last Hope International to gamers who enjoy long Japanese RPG's.  With its fun battle system, a multitude of quests, and customization options, this is a very well-rounded game for most RPG fans, but the Japanese quirkiness and occasional rough edges may put off some gamers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2010"}

The one thing you have to ask though is the game worth re-buying?,  for the price of for $30.00 dollars I say yes while you may have the 360 version there are benefits to owning both console versions.  Like one reviewer has written the biggest is the dual audio voice cast the second would probably be no longer having to switch out disk during game play as the PS3 version is only on one disk instead of the 360 3 disk version.  The graphics of the game are pretty much the same as on the 360 and while you can change the menu and character screens from the CGI to the animated pictures it doesn't make to much of a difference at least it didn't with me.  The game is still real turn based free action combat meaning that you can control one character during fights and move him/her around the battle area and do what you want with them,  you don't have to select on a battle menu than wait for you turn the next round to attack again.  The graphics won't be up to par with games like Uncharted an the like but still there still very good.  So is this game worth getting for your PS3 collection?,  again for the price it's going for I say a definite yes but if you're still not sure check out a demo or see if you can find some videos online either way I'm sure afterwords you'll be a fan of this game...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2011"}

Now it is 2014 and I finally decided to buy the full version of the game, after trying the Beta 2 years ago and sampling it at my friends house. I am happy with buying it now since it is around 10 bucks rather than the 60 dollar price tag it had 2 years ago.I personally loved the story line of the game and it's overall concept. It reminded me of Deus Ex: Human Revolution actually. The game takes place in the year 2069 and revolves around the DART-6 chip. The rest I will leave to you to find out. It is very interesting and I do not want to spoil it for you!Now, on the other hand, there is the multi-player. Even though it was very fun to play with people online, it was quite limited. Only 9 levels to play and absolutely no local or split screen co-op. That was what really killed it for me.This game had a lot of potential and I just wish the multi-player could have lived up to the hype as well.If you enjoy great single player games and an online multi-player &#34;campaign&#34;, then I recommend this game to you.On a side note: This product did ship relatively fast and arrived a day before expected delivery date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

I probablly played with the Wiiu for about a week and it has been collecting dust ever since. I honestly feel like I have wasted my money on this system. I encourage everyone who reads this to not waste your money, wait a year and check back on the game library then to see if you want to buy one.Why do I save done waste your money on a Wiiu? Because every game on it you can play elsewhere. Games like new super mario is the exact same new super mario games on the ds, 3ds and wii. Games like mass effect 3 are the same thing as you probablly already played on other systems. Games like zombieu which being exclusive to wiiu is just another zombie shooting game. I played a few other games at a friends house and those were all very much \"been there, done that\". Granted it is a new system and good games take awhile to trickle out but at this point there are no must have titles. Third party support is also lacking as there are'nt many third party developers creating a lot of new content exclusive to the wii u and the majority who are seem to just be porting other games to it.I dont like the online aspects of it. Like the friend request process, the lack of universal game invites, and downloadable games being split between the eShop and Wii Channel. It is just all very user unfriendly compared to say the ps3 or a pc's online community. It still feels like nintendo is being dragged kicking and screaming into the online world.The tablet is only good for about 3 or 4 hours before it needs to be recharged. That's a horribly short amount of time considering it is supposed to be the primary draw to the system. I played super Mario for a couple hours, didn't use the system for 2 or 3 days and came back to find the tablet was damned near dead and had to be recharged.It lacks the appeal to older people and non gamers that the wii did. Couple that with the fact the Ps4 was announced it looking rather nice so far and the fact that Microsoft should be announcing their next system soon, Valve is making a steambox and tablets/phones becoming more powerful it is hard to justify buying a wiiu.I cant justify the price for what it is. A upgraded wii. There is'nt a major technological leap here. Some might argue the tablet controller is a huge upgrade but its just a normal controller with a touch screen on it that has far less resolution than most smart phones, a less responsive touch screen and less features. The system itself is in HD now but it still lags behind the much cheaper and much older ps3 and 360 in terms of horsepower. But at it's core it is still just a wii.The wiiu itself is essentially just a slightly upgraded wii and nothing more. I really didnt like holding onto that tablet for very long and since it served me no real purpose aside from a few gimmick features it was pointless to hold on it. I cant imagine playing games on it that require analog stick, it would be like holding a giant ps3 controller. It is a cool concept but no one has implimented anything into their games that makes it worth while. I also didnt care for how the controller is, it feels like its a couple generations behind the curve in its mens and interface.For graphics people its still behind what a ps3 and 360 can deliver in terms of speed and graphics quality. You can buy a ps3 and a library of games for less than the cost of a wiiu system by itself and with the ps4 launching this year I cant even begin to reccomend buying a wiiu. Now good graphics do not equal good game, they never have but if they are important to you then you'll be dissapointed.So my suggestion is if you own a wii then dont buy a wiiu. If you dont own a wii then buy one instead of a wiiu because you can buy a wii and a bunch of really great used wii games and still spend less than you did just buying a wiiu system with no games. The wiiu isnt worth the price right now due to lack of good games, maybe in a year when more have come out and so on but as of now its just lacking too much to be worth paying for a new system plus the cost of games.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

To be truthful as well unless you like the animated series as well you probably will pass this off as another action adventure game.  TO be truthful, it is.The idea behind this is that they take 4 original episodes and try to make a game with at least 3 action levels and 1 training.  There are a tremendouse amount of cinema sequences that sometimes helps explain whats going on, and other times to make the game longer.The episodes involve 2 with the joker, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy.  There are 4 sub levels built into each episode which ranges from jumping from roof to roof, stealth, chase scene, boss fight, and a training session.  Not all of these are present in every episode.  For example episode 1 does not have a chase scene.  Meanwhile Episode 2 you don't do the whole roof top jumping.There is one thing that does kill it from getting this any higher, camera problems. A primary example is in the first fight with the Joker.  he is on a wreaking ball trying to hit you, as you dodge it whilem trying to hit him.  the camera in this scene is so [messed] up you will be frustrated when you try and defeat him.Aside from that small flaw, you have a pretty solid game.

These headphones are AWESOME! Pairing was really easy, just plug in the adaptor and turn on the headphones, PRESTO! Synced right away. The sound is great, 7.1 surround sound so you heard EVERYTHING. I was playing MW3 and heard someone plant a claymore in which I was able to avoid, flank, and kill the enemy. The bass impact is the best feature of the headphones. Though I do not turn it all the way, only slightly, an explosion feels as if you where there. The mic is built-in so no stick mic sticking out like on the turtle beaches. Voice chat is clear. Much better than the bluetooth headset which I hated using. Here you have output thru the two speakers instead of the one on the bluetooth. There's also a mic mute button, a switch to control balances between sound and voice, a volume control switch, bass control, VSS (virtual surround sound) button, a mode button to switch sound to the appropriate type of game you're playing (ex. fighter, racing, shooter, etc.) It also comes with a USB port to charge using the same cord you charge your Dualshock with. Also is a 3.5mm audio jack to connect to mobile devices. A audio cable IS included. Note that you can turn off the headphones when using a mobile device. If you want to adjust bass then you'll have to turn them on. The headphones are compatible with my laptop. Same directions as the PS3 for pairing with your laptop.With all the good that's been said here are the cons I have encountered:The battery is very poor. I get about 5 hours even with it fully charged. I think your volume and bass level play a factor in battery usage. I dont usually have them high. Sometimes when I play with a low volume I heard low muffling noises. I occasionally hear a slight popping noise in the right side but maybe that's just my headphones. On the box it says it compatible with TVs but only certain TVs. I have an Emerson and it doesnt work. Thanks for readin*Update* (11/24/13)So I've had these for five months now and they are still alive and working good! If you haven't noticed yet, there is an app on PSN that lets you change the settings of your headphones. When I said settings, its the modes that you can change. It lets you swap out your Music, Fighter, Shooter, etc. modes for other modes. You can also arrange them in any order you want too. I swapped out my Fighter mode for a mode specific tuned to The Last of Us. Yeah, and when I went to play The Last of Us, it sounds so much better. There are other modes like Techno, Horror, and a mode specifically for GTA V. So check that out if you find that you never use a specific mode and can swap it for something else.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}

It is fun, the graphics are amazing, it has a lot of hours of gameplay... I just felt it was a step backwards from San Andreas.I miss not being able to truly change the main character, the weight gain and loss, haircuts, tattoos... all gone.  There are even fewer clothing options (which I didn't miss that much).  But these are the little things, the big thing is that it feels... smaller. I had a blast in San Andreas because the sandbox seemed almost infinite, felt you had seen it all and then discovered the train mission. Increase your skills.  Did a bunch of Firefighter missions and discover yourself fireproof. Hunt for oysters.  It was fun, and always rewarding to explore (for God's sake you could do a triathlon.. and it was tough!!).GTA IV is much,much, smaller.  Having only one city (albeit a huge one) limits the visual style of where you can go and do. There just isn't that much to do other than the storyline missions.  You can no longer buy a property and get missions through that (what were they thinking??), no work out, few safehouses,  the sandbox is just plain smaller in general. Prettier, but smaller. No burglar missions, no ambulance missions, no gang wars, no skydiving, heck no plain diving...The tone is also a problem, San Andreas placed you in the cartoony universe of GTA, you could steal a fighter jet, you invaded military installations with your hommies, you stole military prototypes. It was clearly fantasy.  GTA IV tries to go for a much more sober storyline style, and in my opinion it doesn't work.  It doesn't make sense to have a more realistic storyline and character interaction amidst the super high octane action that the game is known for and is woven into the storyline.  Not only that, I found that despite the deeper emotional subtext, the characters were far less interesting (heck, remember the shock Big Smoke gave us?).Why four stars then?  Well it is still a great game.  The graphics are amazing, the driving is really good (I think bikes got short-changed though), there are tons of hours of great gameplay, the shooting is very well made, and did I mention that the graphics are great? The music, and radio in general, were also a step up (the TV and internet were a bust though for being too small and repetitive); the incorporation of the cellphone was wonderfully made. They tried adding a bit of new toys to the sandbox like bowling, but given all that was lost it couldn't compensate. The voice acting was very good, despite no longer having the big names as San Andreas had (I assume it was a cost-benefit decision, and probably the right one). It is truly a great game, but the previous one was a greater game and that stopped me from enjoying it at a five-star level.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Nona","summary":"A classic in RPG history","reviewText":"Even though the Final Fantasy series was already incredibly popular in Japan, before this game was released in the United States RPGs were not quite as well known as other kinds of games.  Final Fantasy 7, the first Final Fantasy on the Playstation and to use 3D graphics, changed everything about the console RPG genre.  Even though people will have differing opinions about the enjoyability of this game, no serious gamer would deny the tremendous influence Final Fantasy 7 has had on videogaming.By today's standards, the graphics in this game are quite primitive, but at the time they were absolutely amazing.  The 2D backgrounds are still great to look at today, as well.  The music in this game is also great, despite the rather limited selection of sounds Nobou Uematsu had at his disposal.  Of particular note is the song that plays during the final boss encounter, \"One Winged Angel\", which is still beloved by Final Fantasy fans today.Despite the move from 2D to 3D, the gameplay in Final Fantasy 7 is  similar to the previous six Final Fantasy games.  As you control your character on an overworld map, you encounter random mobs which you fight in an \"active time battle\" system.  The magic system, based on \"materia\", is new and just complicated enough to provide some strategic depth without overwhelming new players.  Playing through the main story is not particularly challenging (some bosses may require a few tries), but there are extensive side quests available at the end of the game, some of which are very involved and difficult without a solid strategy.However, the main attraction of this game is the story.  Anyone who has played through the game will remember Cloud, his friends, and the enigmatic Sephiroth, who are still iconic figures in the game world.  (That Square-Enix still releases games and movies based on the FF7 world helps, no doubt.)  The plot is quite strange and frequently confusing, but in its essentials it worked for me.  The translation could have used some more polish, but is of good enough quality as to not distract from the rest of the game.If there are people studying the history of video games fifty years from now, there is little doubt that Final Fantasy 7 would be one of the games they would look at, since it is probably the most influential console RPG ever.  If you haven't played this game yet and have any interest in RPGs, at all, you should try to find a copy of this game and play it.

And truth be told, it's not.  It's a pale shadow of its brothers.  358/2 Days is definitely the superior.  But this game belongs in the series, for one reason: it ties directly back to Birth By Sleep and extends that story slightly.  You also get to see a little more of Castle Oblivion and experience more of the characters that you know and love.  What holds the game back, in my humble opinion, is some of the repetitive tasks you must endure to get to the endings.  There are also points that make little-to-no sense - some of which are just downright frustrating.When you fight it's just like any other Kingdom Hearts game.  You'll go to a lot of the same areas you're used to and fight Heartless as always.  But the game is basically portrayed as a digital version of Jiminy's journal, where you are having to \"Fix\" the code to get the story back to what it should be.  There are a lot of code blocks and such all over the place, and there are hidden backdoors that contain alternate worlds in which you have to fight and put things back the way they were.  It's an intriguing approach, and in some ways can be fun, except that you do this a LOT.  It gets rather repetitive, and in some cases it feels like you're not really making any progress.Near the end of the game, you'll find yourself at Castle Oblivion and this is where the true frustration begins, as you will need to complete each scenario three times in order to get the best ending.  This isn't hard for most of them, but the very last one, which involves Maleficent and Pete, is aggravating.  It's impossible to explain how infuriating it really is dealing with this and knowing that you're forced to unlock all of the scenarios - it basically involves approaching the scenario three different ways, but with the last scenario there only appears to be two different ways of going about it.  I wasted many hours trying to figure it out before I went on toMimana: Iyar Chronicle.IF you were expecting to fight through with Mickey, Donald, Goofy, or even Riku, don't.  There is a brief bit where Donald and Goofy do help out and I believe one boss fight where Mickey shows up, but other than that you're on your own.  Also, there are about a third of the Disney worlds represented here and not much depth; no Pirates, no 1000 Acre Wood, no Dalmatians, and no flying around Never Never Land.  If the primary appeal to you is the ability to explore the land of Disney, you might skip this game, as it has just enough to be called Kingdom Hearts, but again, nowhere near that of its brothers.I want to stress that the first parts of the game were extremely unfun.  Later, the game got more entertaining once I powered Sora up.  It was still repetitious, mind, but the fact that it tied back to Birth By Sleep appealed to me.  It also allowed me to try Kingdom Hearts in an entirely different fashion with a better control scheme.  Having the DSi XL helped, as the larger screen enabled me to experience the game better than the smaller one by a wide margin.Definitely recommended you at least try the game before bashing it.  Most that don't like it are comparing it to the other Kingdom Hearts games and in truth, it's pathetic if compared that way, but if you judge it as a standalone game, it's really not that bad at all.  Superior to Chain of Memories in terms of the battle engine, superior to 358/2 Days in terms of graphics only.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2011"}

Scott","summary":"Nearly Perfect","reviewText":"Farcry 3 is what few games are: It is an adventure game, without being an RPG.Very pretty to look at, Farcry 3 is second only to Crysis 2 on the 360 in terms of realism, and is much more fun. Plants and sunlight seem to leap off the screen as you set fire to yet another leopard.Guns feel and sound good, the reloading animations are unique and varied. Though I found myself using the recurve bow more than anything else. Not to mention many of the guns are replaced so quickly by better versions that they're never used.The wildlife in the game is fun to battle with though Farcry 3 still doesn't beat Red Dead Redemption in terms of fun to fight animals. Some of them(tiger/crocodile) have special quick-time events that require button mashing to finish.I didn't expect much from the story after the laughably bad story in Farcry 2, but I was pleasantly surprised. The characters are realistic and engaging, though, like I said, you have no choice in the matter as to what happens to them. For the most part that is.Vaas, the pirate leader is one of the most interesting characters in any game I've ever played and his scenes are the most fun. Buck, the australian is also very fun, but less so than Vaas.The game runs with a very well done Drug motif throughout the game. Syringes boost your abilities, and you frequently enter trances in psuedo-cutscenes similar to point look-out in Fallout 3, or the ending of Metro 2033. These scenes are some of the craziest in any game. You collect memory cards with drug formulas on them from Marajuana to PCP.There is a lot to do, and a lot of fun to be had, but by the time you're done with the main story, the lack of interesting side-quests and likeable side-characters leaves the world feeling empty. Even so, you'll enjoy your &#34;trip&#34; through paradise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Shocking and Worthy Sequel...","reviewText":"Infamous 2 has a pretty big set of shoes to fill after the success of the first.  It seemed like it would be hard to improve upon the mechanics of the first game.  Yet Sucker Punch studios managed to find a way, and produce a worthy sequel to Infamous.GAMEPLAYIf you have played Infamous then you will feel right at home with Infamous 2.  Not much has changed gameplay wise from the original except for loads of polish.  Your character will keep his powers, avoiding a Metroid or God of War scenario, and earn additional powers throughout the game.  Climbing mechanics, aiming, melee combat all feels more fluid and lively when compared to the original.  You will explore a brand new city, take side quests and missions, find dead drops and shards... its all here all over again just with a new coat of paint.  On top of new powers to unlock, Cole now has access to THE AMP which allows him additional combat moves especially with melee.  To top it all off the map now has some destructible elements which add a nice bit of devastation to Cole's attacks, and goes along exceptionally well if you decide to take the EVIL path.One thing that does put a damper on the gameplay however is the camera mechanics.  This time around the camera got in my way a lot more than it did in the first installment, especially when it came to melee combat with the amp.  The camera gave this really nice comic book effect sometimes, giving nice low angle close ups to the fight but it also cut off my view of oncoming danger; and sometimes when jumping would go behind a building or wall leaving me blind to my position.  While not a major problem it does put a tiny damper on the gameplayGRAPHICSA big time improvement over the first game, and overall the game looks great!  The graphics are rendered exceptionally well, and the effects of Cole's powers never looked better.  The best part of all is the new city.  It looks magnificent when compared to the previous.  There is a lot more activity and visual effects going on that really do make the city feel more alive.  It is a major improvement over the first title I feel.SOUND/STORYSound wise, the game is very lively.  Cole's powers have a lot more effect to them and overall the game just sounds great.  Voice acting is of high quality in my book.  The new voice actor for Cole at first might seem out of place, when compared with the original, but it grew on me over time.  Story wise the game has a decent story, on par with the first game.  Like in the original you can chose to be Good or Evil depending on your actions making for two endings and in a way; Two story arcs each leading to different sets of skill upgrades and storyline elements.REPLAY/LENGTHDepending on how obsessed you get with collecting shards, dead drops, side quests etc the game should take you anywhere from 14 - 17 hrs.  Replay value is exceptionally high!  Not only do you have both a Good and Evil storyline to complete, but shards, dead drops, side quests all return and then some.  If you loved the first you will have no problem playing though this game twice with ease.There is also an online element to Infamous 2 which allows you to create and play user created maps/content.  While the controls and implementation of the creator do need some work (in my opinion) the level of creation available is high.  Given some time expect to see some wild user-generated content online!OVERALL  A- ... 90%Infamous 2 does the original game justice.  It doesn't change the formula much, instead just improving upon what made the original a greatest hit; while also giving it a nice face lift graphically.  Throw in new super-powers, user-generated content and online, and you have yourself a winner.  While Infamous 2 is not a perfect game, it does more than enough to make itself out to be a powerful, high quality title well worth the price of admission.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2011"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Dark, sarcastic, humorous, worth playing, not a revolutionary leap in gaming","reviewText":"I wouldn't call myself 'a gamer' but it just happens that I played theElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Editionlast year and I enjoyed it immensely. Once there was little left to explore in the world of Cyrodiil and the Shivering Isles got fully mapped and pacified the wait began for Fallout 3. I am still hoping for a 'Scrolls of the Elders V' installment some day but, Fallout was what was in the pipeline so all I could do was hope for something wonderful to come out from the geniuses at Bethesda. I will first list my impressions of the game, so far.The game engine:-----------------Technically, Fallout 3 inherits a lot from Oblivion. Sure, the landscape is very different but you can do in Fallout just about the kind of things that you could do in Oblivion: walk, run, be stealthy, pick up things, drop them, throw missiles, engage in hand to hand combat, have conversations with the inhabitants and pick up your replies from a a list of possible answers, use potions to heal, be nice to other people and trade or make friends or be nasty and steal and so on. Like in Oblivion, you can fast-travel to locations you've discovered for as long as enemies aren't too close, you can sleep in a bed to regain your strength and heal you wounds, you can get sick and your sickness can be cured. Like in Oblivion, the game can be a series of quests or you can walk the land and live off the land if you don't feel like doing what others ask you to do. You develop certain skills but the skills engine is a bit different - you can pick the skills you wish to develop as you level up and, unlike Oblivion, you won't become a better athlete if you keep jumping up and down one thousand times.New in Fallout is the V.A.T.S. system that allows you to stop time and pick up specific body parts to hit when in combat. It's not so bad and, from time to time, you get to see pretty good slow-motion shots of your enemy's head exploding, jets of dark blood coming out of his neck. It's fun and it's preferable to real time shooting when you're a little short on ammo.The Pip-Boy device is nice but it's just a streamlined version of any RPG's status/inventory facility. It does allow you to listen to the radio but, after a little playing with the radio on, I learned that listening to the radio while on a mission can be VERY dangerous to your character's health as you can't hear the bad guys approaching and they CAN hear you, loud and clear, from quite a distance.Building your character:-----------------Also like in Oblivion, your past actions have future consequences and this begins shortly after your 'birth'. You have the ability to design your good looks, move 'points' around to enhance or diminish certain attributes, pick 'perks' and distribute experience points as you level up. Again, like in Oblivion, your skills can be enhanced by reading 'skills books' and you can be trained if you find someone willing to do it.The story line:-----------------It's quite simple and it's basically 'find your daddy', following some disturbance inside the completely insulated 'vault' where you spent your entire life up to that point. Your father breaks out and your first quest is for you to escape as well and then try to figure out the world outside. Well... it's not exactly pretty. A couple hundred years post nuclear Armageddon, people in the Washington, D.C. area struggle to survive and stay away from mutants, bandits, crazies or political opportunists. The only way to gather information about your father is to do others small favors in exchange for information and you need to keep yourself healthy, fit and well-armed while at it. You fight the bad guys and, depending on what you want your character to be like, you could do bad things to the 'good' people too but, remember, there's a price to pay for everything.The art:-----------------The word is a dull-brown-gray, slightly cartoonish version of post-nuclear D.C. You will recognize some of the 'old' buildings: the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Air and Space Museum. You will encounter quite a variety of human characters and, up to this point, I've been interacting with a relatively large number of 'monsters', ranging from two-headed cows and fire-spewing ants to giant and relatively hard to kill mutants.The acting:-----------------The voices are good but, of course, this is a game and all spoken dialog is pre-recorded and, pretty soon, you will notice that characters will keep saying the same thing, over and over. Their closeup shots of their faces are not as bad as what you had in Oblivion but, let's say that there is some room for improvement in this area. The pre-release word was that the Fallout characters were a lot more intelligent than Oblivion's. Maybe they are but most characters' phrases portfolio is not that vast and you can have encounters where one grateful character stops you to offer you profuse thanks and some small token of appreciation for what you've done and, 5 seconds after she says goodbye, if you try to talk to her again all you get is a 'leave me alone' or 'get lost' reply.The several milestone encounters - with the head of the 'family', with Three Dog, with Dr. Lee are quite well acted.The monsters you fight are more intelligent than Oblivion's. The more humanoid ones are capable of attacking, retreating when wounded (only to come back at you later), working together toward your defeat.The bugs:-----------------And, not, I'm not talking about the fire ants. There are a few. There is the much-discussed G.O.A.T. exam glitch where you end up waiting forever for the examiner to hand you the exam papers - and I had to restart the game because of that. Then, on a couple of occasions, I found myself trapped and unable to move (load a previous save) or, after sitting on a bench, the world around turned very, very strange and the 'reload' was the only way out of that, I've met an invisible trader that I could hear but he wasn't anywhere around but, somehow, I was able to pass through his beast of burden. All minor bugs, except for the G.O.A.T. glitch.Game's complexity:-----------------I can see how not everyone will agree but I found Oblivion a much more complex world. There are more attributes to tweak in Oblivion, you can pick from several races, join guilds, train and develop many skills, explore dozens of dungeons, forts, ruins, visit many villages, towns and cities, interact with more characters, operate on several realms but maybe, after only 20 hours or so of Fallout (level 7) I've only scratched the surface and, if that's the case, I will come back to this review and correct it.The humor:-----------------There's as lot of it in Fallout. A lot of it is visual, three Stooges-like where you slap your enemies around and see their body parts flying. There is also some very subtle and not so subtle political humor, which I found very fascinating and quite refreshing. And, of course, it's the way characters seem to relate and react to their sordid physical surroundings which could seem 'funny' to us, since we are not 7th or 8th generation inhabitants of the post-nuclear wastelands.Overall impression and rating:-----------------I like playing Fallout but mostly because Elders Scrolls V doesn't exist. It's a good, solid game with some improvements over Oblivion but, as far as I can see, lacking a lot of innovation. It's like the big automakers developing a standard chassis and then building all kinds of different models on it. Oblivion and Fallout are both built on the same chassis and it shows - the colors and the shapes may be different and there may be different options but, basically, deep down, they are family.Compared to Oblivion, Fallout's, positive improvements are its voice acting, there's more humor, the V.A.T.S. system is a new innovation. On the lacking side, the Oblivion is a vast, colorful, hugely complex world compared to which Fallout's feels almost claustrophobic.I am giving Fallout 3 a 4-star rating (it's really 3.5 rounded up) and I would recommend it as a 'buy' for giving us an interesting story told with more or less the same old tools when, one assumes, much better ones could have been developed.________________________________Dec. 27 Update:SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN AND KEEP MANY SAVES.It turns out, the whole adventure can end quite abruptly and unexpectedly. And I'm not talking about you being killed, that is recoverable. I am talking about the entire game ending and, if you don't have a good save, the end is irreversible - no spoilers from me :). Once it ends, it's over so, if you really want to explore more of the Fallout world, your only option is to go to a save prior to a chain of events that would place you on a course that's impossible to change and leads to what I believe it's a premature end. In my case, I had just advanced to level 14 and I was about 80-90 hours into the game when I reached that end. Thankfully, I DID have many prior saves so I am now, that my character is finally well armed and armored, curiously exploring the landscape and engaging in quests that I would have otherwise missed.I can't help but going back to Oblivion. It took a lot longer to complete the main story line in Oblivion and IT, in fact had THREE separate 'main' story lines (Oblivion proper, Shivering Isles and the Knights of the Nine) on the Game of the Year edition). I am now crossing some 'tees' and dotting some 'eyes' in Fallout but, overall, it's a lesser, shallower, smaller universe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2008"}

For Now","reviewText":"Here it is, the beginning and the end, the Alpha and the Omega, the Godfather, the big-daddy (without 'Big Daddy), the reigning champ.If you put a gun to my head and made me pick  my favorite game of all time if would be this.  ...but please don't do that, that would be weird and kind of rude.This is my first experience into the Fallout universe, but I understand that it's a departure from the usual gameplay mechanics (a departure, not necessarily an improvement, but that's based on opinion.)  I'm told, however, that it does justice to the tone and palette of the Fallout world.  And what a world!  It starts with a strange, near-future, alternate America that kept the creepiest of values and fashions from the 1950's (smiles, everyone! Don't let those commies thing we're unhappy!) and yet advanced in technology to the robot butler stage that then get's completely destroyed and mutated after a nuclear war with China and a few centuries of radiation saturation.  So it's a fantasy world that then got destroyed and morphed into a whole new fantasy world.  The result is a fantasy game world that is as layered and rich as anything in the Tolkien or D&D; universe and yet is somehow MORE accesible and relatable.  The characters are, for the most part, regular people with regular people needs: food, shelter, booze, sex, etc.  There's plenty of 'science' that bends physics and reality in impossible ways, but it's amazing how the lack of things like 'magic' and 'over-used mythical creature' make the gameplay so much more compelling.  Nothing is cliched (yet, give it time) and everything feels fresh and unique.  And there's so MUCH of it all!  I've completed the story line twice, put countless hours into exploring and exploring and I STILL haven't covered the entirety of the map.  Bethesda went to great pains to develope and detail this post-apacolypse Washington D.C. (the Capital Wasteland, if you will) and it shows.  Familiar, realworld locations have been reduced to rubble, fantasy-world locations are delicately and expertly placed within the real-world backdrop and everything is pulled together under a blanket of grey ash and dust.  It's easily the most complete, most satisfying and most entertaining gameworld I've ever had the pleasure of exploring.Which is good, because it's the gameworld and the story (a search for your missing father and the quest for clean water) that they're selling.  The gamePLAY is fun but far from flawless and, though it offers a few innovations (the ability to pause and plan attacks throug the V.A.T.S. system comes to mind), remains far from groundbreaking.  If you've playedThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivionthen you pretty much already know the score on how you move, interact, attack, sneak, steal, and the myriad of other things you get to do.  The lockpicking mechanic is different, using the vibartion to peice out the sweet spots rather than watching and timing tumblers and I consider it a big improvement (but, you know, that might just be me).  Character animations are still a bit weird (the physics in the animations are off, you can tell) and moving about is occasionally glitchy (please save often as you WILL get stuck on some stupid, damn rock or something eventually, I promise you that).  Shooting and meleeing bad guys (which you'll want to do in 1st person more than 3rd, though you're given both options), is fun if not as smooth or clean as... well, pretty much anything else.I can go on and on with this.  The game lets you do a lot of things (talking, bargaining, shopping, stealling, fighting, sneaking, pick-pocketing, jumping, running) and you'll find a better version of any of them in just about any game that focuses on that one thing.  What Fallout 3 does better than anyone (even Oblivion, as far as I'm concerned) is give you a world to play in with very few rules.  The gameplay isn't bad, by any stretch, but this is one of those rare occasions where immersion and story outweigh and outplay actual gameplay mechanics.  If those things mean anything to you at all, the Capital Waste is a place worth getting lost in for a while.  If all you want is something linear, point A to point B while things explode (and who doesn't want that at least once in a while, right?), this is not the stop for you; keep heading down the line.If wandering a land worthy of any Sci-fi or fantasy novel you've ever read is something you're interested in, look no futher.  Step out, sit down, get comfortable:  your'e gonna be here for a while...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2011"}

The controls are far from perfect, especially when you are just starting, but I would hardly say they are glitchy or buggy.  Once you have mastered the controls, and it doesn't take that long, you can begin to enjoy the game alot more.  The swordplay could have been better but it's the best swordplay available right now due to the fact that instead of pushing a button to make an action, you actually have to swing the controller.  The first few battles are lame due to the fact that the guys are so easy to beat.  Later on, it takes alot more to defeat them, and you have to use more complicated techniques.  I am currently having alot of fun with it.  My son likes the multiplayer.  I'm not that big of a fan, mostly due to the fact that my son is stomping my guts out every time.

In the World War II game setting, the designers chose to replace every swastika with Hydra's green and gold serpent logo. What is appropriate forCall of Duty: World at Waris apparently not good enough for Captain America.This third-person adventure has Chris Evans (face and voice) gamely fighting Hydra, the criminal organization funded by Baron Strucker (a.k.a Supreme Hydra) and funded by his treasures stolen by the (missing) Nazis. While the Red Skull is prominent in the game trailer (and the movie), his appearance here is grossly brief, leaving you to slog through hundreds of Hydra soldiers before you go mano-a-mano with the Iron Cross.I abandoned my plan to organize this review into standard sections -- gameplay, graphics, soundtrack/voice work and playtime -- because this game so completely misses the spirit and character of Captain America, the other facets are barely worth more detail: (simplistic) gameplay, (muddled) graphics, (unmemorable) soundtrack/(good) voice work and (stunningly short) playtime.I lied. Let's discuss the gameplay. Endless on-screen prompting and visual clues drain what little suspense exists and underestimates the target audience, which undoubtedly already masteredBatman Arkham Asylum. I expect more than one gamer will shout back at the screen, \"This isn't my first rodeo.\"Trust me, you will come to hate orange halos.Getting back to character, if Captain America acting more likeConan the Barbarianthan The First Avenger doesn't bother you, ignore my review and begin pillaging Armin Zola's Bavarian castle. For me, it was roughly six hours of painful gameplay as I recreated Sherman's march to Atlanta though the castle environment.I haven't seen the movie yet, so I hold out hope it captures Captain America's persona better than this game. Steve Rogers emotional journey, not only to become Captain America, but to serve his country in World War II, makes his superhero story distinctive. This game does nothing to tap into the melodrama and suffers as a result.In summary, this game lacks subtlety and swastikas. Compared with other summer movie-tie-ins,Captain America: Super Soldieris better than eitherThor: God of ThunderorGreen Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters. That isn't saying much.Curiosity might lead you to a short, weekend rental but this game ultimately is missingBatman Arkham Asylumquality and the character that makes Captain America special.Rating: Two starsEpilogue: A bit of nostalgiaThe last great Captain America game arrived in arcades in 1991 and on the Sega Genesis in 1993:Captain America and the Avengers. I don't recommend you pay the collector's prices listed by third-party sellers on Amazon. The game, also released on the SNES, is available in many formats, depending on your game system at reasonable prices.Gamers on the four-player arcade cabinet could play as Captain America, Iron Man, Vision, and Hawkeye on a side-scrolling adventure that pitted Cap and his team against the Red Skull. The game provided an amazing collection of boss characters, including Whirlwind, Klaw, Juggernaut, the Wizard, the Grim Reaper, the Mandarin and Ultron. If that wasn't enough, cameo appearances include fellow Avengers Wasp, Wonder Man, Quicksilver and the Sub-Mariner!Sadly, twenty years later, it is still the best Captain America game you can find.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2011"}

It was the best Sega had ever done and that's saying alot.  Sega went out with a bang with this masterpiece of a system.  This is the first system to also introduce Online Gaming.

It was just breath of fresh air.It first hit stores in the U.S in September of 1999 and Sega was on a role with such titles as Sonic Adventure and Soul Calibur but the Dreamcast Ultimatley fails with not enough Sales because of the oh so popular Playstation 2.  Ps2 was beating the DC really bad which cause Sega to lose lots of sales but sega wouldn't go down with a fight as they bring some of the best games ever to kick The ps2 out of buisness but with lots and lots of advertising utlimatley...The Dreamcast had bin defeated.  Later some were between the year of 2000-2001 Sega announces that they will stop making DC and stop making Games for it and become a 3rd party game team.It was a sad fact but true...Sega had finally stopped and Ps2 had won but like most reviewers said....Popularity...Popularity was the cause of the Dreamcast demise.  Even today with all the games out on Playstation 2 it still doesn't beat Dreamcast's feel and wonder of what the games were like.  Dreamcast may have died but it will still live on as one of the greatest consoles to ever grace the earth.  The graphics were ahead of it's time and so were the games.

It's nowhere near any of the classics, but it could at least hold its own against other games of the non-classic variety.The singleplayer mode is good. Some levels are bothersome, but overall, it's fun. Good levels, nice guns, decent a.i. The movie's plot is told very well, from getting rid of Davidov to swimming through a sunken submarine to finish the baddies and save the world.The multiplayer is great. It's not quite as option-packed as Perfect Dark, but it's good. My major complaint is the whole GOOD and EVIL thing. Each character is either GOOD or EVIL, and GOOD characters can't fight each other. It's annoying, but there are at least plenty of characters to choose from(and even more to unlock) that it hasn't bothered me more than a handful of times.TWINE has some of my favorite multiplayer levels ever. A hedgemaze, two small bases connected by a skyrail(this level is done better than it's Nightfire counterpart), and one of the coolest, a blackbird jet and a cargo plane connected by a fueling line flying in the air. It's fun to go out on the wings and try not to get blown down by the wind, or to go on top of the cargo plane to snipe people off of the blackbird below.The bots are generally pathetic, though. If you're accostumed to instinctively circle-strafing, the bots don't present much of a threat. I played an entire game without using weapons. I just got really close to the bot and circle-strafed while punching them, and they didn't even get a hit in.But that's only like half of the bots. The other half are okay.I was also upset to find that there's no way to setup the controller so that you can use the up and down c-buttons to look like in Goldeneye. Instead, they are for jump and for crouch. No way to move jump and crouch to up and down d-pad. I need my freelook more than I need jump and crouch in multiplayer. O well.Overall, this game is actually really fun, but the few flaws really stand out and keep it from being classic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2005"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"Death is real \"GAMING ON A BUDGET!!!\"","summary":"Worth the wait.","reviewText":"I was expecting more from Alma and I got more then I wished for.

If you enjoy the whole western thing, and didn't have a huge axe to grind w/GTA 4, then this should pretty much be a no brainer; After a slightly slow start, and a learning curve for the horse, it isn't long until you are immersed into a very amazing western sandbox game. And while I kind of miss the color scheme of the first game, it is hard to complain about the graphics and attention to detail in this game. Of course, by now you have heard what a beautiful game this is from everyone, even if they hate it. I have not seen a night shy w/stars like that since I saw the movie 'The Proposition'...some of the music even sounds that way; the humor is all there, in the newspapers, the comments, the dialog(great voice acting), and the scenarios that are constantly popping up. For some reason, seeing a confederate being chased by 2 cougars was funny to me. Until one knocked me off my horse and killed me.There is much to do and to see; I am about 35 hours in and still into it, and cannot see putting it down any time soon; it is def a game that should be experienced, it was something that reminded me how fun games could be; and as a guy who played the first one like 25 times, the duel controls were generally effortless; and while I miss the whole 'red circle' thing from the first game, this deadeye works just as well, generally. There were a few frustrating moments during some intense gunfights w/multiple opponents and the auto target, but a minor flaw. Manual aim is pretty tough for me in this game since it only takes like 3-4 shots until you die, but try it for some interesting results...My favorite things so far: The Dog I follow around the ranch, and how he is everywhere you go(he even plays fetch in the town w/people...); the 'remedies' movie; the hooker who screamed she needed help, then tried to steal my horse, calling me 'green'(she didn't make it far....).From Bounties to cards, to the most impressive landscapes and all the animals that fill it(I mean really....the rabbits, snakes, armadillos...the detail there is amazing...), this is one of the most artistic games I have ever seen. Just don't stand and stare too long, because something is bound to come along and disrupt you.Great horse animation and some very lifelike character models...Again, the amount of detail that went into the people, places, and all the cool stuff to do and explore is all done with such...well, for lack of better word...detail.Like I said, I really had reservations the first hour or so as far as pacing, but there came a point during the 2nd hour where you are just off an running, and pacing no longer enters the picture. You can do what you want when you want, generally speaking. And the pace is quicker than GTA 4. It is one of those games where you look at the clock and are amazed how much time has passed.So far, it lives up to the hype. Not just the best western game, but one of the best action sand box shooters maybe ever, from the people who started it.My only complaint would be the difficulty level.....is should be harder; it seems Rockstar has gotten into a recent habit(since GTA4, anyways...)of making games everyone of all skill levels can complete,. It would be nice for veteran gamers to have a choice on that level, esp. after having to slog thru all the fun(and sometimes tough...)challenges of Vice City and San Andreas....they were hard, but they made you a better player. It may have taken 5 times to complete a mission, but it was rewarding. There have been parts of this game that had me saying 'is that it?', or more frequently: 'that was easy...'.But it's fun, and that's what is important to me.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

While not as incredible as it was originally marketed it was an interesting idea.  For major plot decisions you normally had three choices, which more or less aligned with being aggressive and charging in, staying in the shadows, or helping the people around you.  \"Invisible War\" went with an even more complex decision tree that was one side or the other and each decision had a kind of Yin or Yang choice after that.  \"Human Revolution\" goes back to the three choice system.  You could also in all the games customize your character depending on your playing style, which can get fairly intricate.The plot is the events preceding the story of Deus Ex when augmentations first begin to appear in humans, before the Gray Death and when the Illuminati and other secret groups had yet to publicly show their hand.  There is an interesting subtext how the color pallette is gold/brown and the main characters dress in a sort of Renaissance style to go with the story's theme of a turning point in humanity.Overall I liked almost everything about this game, from the combat to the story.  The problems were minimal; a second third of the game that drags for a bit, and the presence of boss battles, which have been out of vogue for some time.  I'd rate \"Human Revolution\" about a 9/10, but with Amazon it'll be 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2012"}

Rhodes","summary":"Building on a Great Idea","reviewText":"Steven Spielberg is mostly known for the movies he's created.  This wouldn't be the first time that Spielberg has lended a hand to the gaming culture.  Most gamers know him as the creator of the Medal of Honor series.  Boom Blox is in a whole different crowd from Medal of Honor, but it's a lot of fun.Boom Blox is quite different from your standard puzzle game.  There are several different game modes.  Not only that, but this isn't a game that will keep you busy for merely hours.  It can easily keep you busy for days.  It takes more work than you can possibly imagine to unlock everything the game has to offer.  Not only that, but it's impossible to do it alone, as the multiplayer is entirely different from the single player experience.There are a few different things you'll be doing in Boom Blox.  In one set of mini-games for example, your goal is to destroy all the gem blocks, which will require you to throw a ball or a bomb or something else.  The unique thing about Boom Blox, is that the physics are amazing.  The harder you throw the ball, the greater its reflected in the game itself.  It's not uncommon to get so into it that your arms might hurt from time to time.  And yes, where you throw it, how hard, and the trajectory are all important aspects.  The mini games where you throw are some of the best in the entire game.Other mini games give you a grabbing tool where you'll pull blocks in a Jenga like fashion and keep baby cows from falling or keep a penalty block from touching the ground.  These are incredible mini-games which really put your mind to the test.  It plays exactly like Jenga, and the same rules apply here.The last type of mini game is more or less a shooting range.  Of all the mini-games in Boom Blox, these are some of the worst.  They're neither as fun or as thought provoking.  However, if you just want to go wild for a little bit, these games aren't bad.  Still, they feel a little out of place considering what the other two force you to do.All these mini games can be played seperately in their own section, or you can mix them all together in the adventure mode which puts a lot of objectives ahead of you.  And once again, it's a lot of fun.  However, there are plenty of other things to keep in mind.  It's more than just throwing balls, pulling blocks and shooting.  There are many different kinds of blocks that play a part in each and every one of Boom Blox's complex puzzles.  There are vanishing blocks, which vanish whenever you hit them, chemical blocks that upon making contact with another chemical block, explode.  There are also bomb blocks where if you hit them, they explode instantly.Each time you complete a puzzle or advance to the next game, you'll be awarded a Bronze, Silver or Gold Medal.  The conditions for getting a gold can sometimes be steep, but once you see what it takes you'll find it was actually... quite obvious.  You can't go on to the next puzzle unless you qualify.Boom Blox is obviously made for multiplayer.  As I mentioned earlier, the multiplayer is totally different from the single player.  You can cooperate with one or more friends or you can go against them.  The mini games against a friend can be fun.  Such as one that allows you both to assault each other with a barrage of throws to take down the other's fort.  Most of them are played out with the two of you taking turns, but it's also very balanced because Boom Blox is so easy to come to.  A veteran gamer will not have an advantage over a newcomer.  Yet, it's also nice because nothing here is based on luck.Cooperative is similar to the single player experience, with the difference being in some games you'll take turns and in others you'll be working together at the same time.  You'll find yourself talking it out just to figure out how to go through it, yet it's a lot more fun than you'd expect.If there was any downside to Boom Blox, it would be that the multiplayer is far far more rewarding than the single player experience.  Once you get into the multiplayer, the single player campaign seems downright boring in comparison.  Boom Blox is a game that is meant to be played with friends and it succeeds there very well.  That doesn't mean the single player experience doesn't succeed.  It simply means that the multiplayer experience is just that much better.The other big problem with Boom Blox is that once you trump through it all... you don't want to do it again.  Aside from competing against friends, Boom Blox doesn't have much replay, as a lot of puzzle games of its like don't.  However, there's so much to keep you busy that you'll still get your moneys worth.  While there's not much replay, there is, however, the ability to create your own levels and puzzles and even share them with other players.  So even after you complete it all, you can still check out what others have created, and I don't know about you, but I think that's better than simple replay value.Graphics wise Boom Blox isn't appealing as far as visuals are concerned.  It looks pretty basic.  There's not a whole lot in the graphics that really stand out.  Everything is, of course, blocky (not in a bad way).  What stands out in the game's graphics however are its astonishing physics.  Boom Blox not only demonstrates how to use the Wii Remote to its full effectiveness, but it also demonstrates how to make a game real.  So while it isn't big on visual appeal, it has a certain charm to its graphics that you won't find in most games.  Music wise the game is incredible.  The music is really good and catchy, but the sound effects are probably some of the best parts of its design.Boom Blox is a rare Wii game.  It's one that's fun and accessible to everyone.  Best of all, it uses the Wii Remote controls better than most games before it.  If you're looking for a game that's fun, accessible and will keep you busy for a very long time, then Boom Blox is it.  It's by far one of the best games you can buy for the Wii right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000087H7T","description":"Early Adopters Pick: March 2003. As the  world's smallest video-game platform, the Game Boy Advance SP is also the first to use a built-in rechargeable battery.Many decried the original Game Boy Advance's reflective LCD screen and its reliance on external light sources. The Game Boy Advance SP's main feature--optional backlighting--fixes this complaint nicely, but it's the wealth of other features that makes this system so surprisingly good.At first look, you might think the SP is a sleek travel alarm clock. When closed, it's just as tall and deep as the original GBA, but only half as wide. Due to its clamshell design, the screen is always protected from everyday scratches. A small button in the center of the console turns on the backlighting element for use in low-light situations, like in a moving car.The SP comes with a well-designed power adapter that recharges a built-in battery; its prongs fold in for easier storage. Our informal tests found that it takes about four hours to fully charge (you can even play it while it's plugged in and charging), and the battery lasts about 11 hours with the backlighting constantly on--your results may vary. Using the backlighting less often will conserve battery power.Withseparately sold  cables, you can connect the Game Boy Advance SP to other GBAs  for multiplayer gaming (above) or to theNintendo GameCube(below) to access secret levels, exchange data, or use other special  features that vary from game to game.The quality of the backlighting is very good. It's bright and clear when looking directly at it, but degraded from other angles. This is only a problem for friends who are watching the screen from over your shoulder.But size, power, and affordability do not come without trade offs. There's no headphone jack here, though Nintendo promises an adapter. The system isn't very loud at its highest volume, and the sound can be turned down to socially acceptable levels. The L and R shoulder buttons are a fraction of the size they were on the GBA, and thus are harder to hit. Also, the reduced size of the SP is slightly less comfortable for adult hands than the GBA, but perhaps more comfortable for smaller hands. The cartridge port placement on the lower part of the console is fine for GBA games, since they are flush with the console body, but older Game Boy Color carts will stick out in a way that takes some getting used to.Open it up and the hinge will seek out a preferred, pre-set angle (about 150 degrees), though you can open it a bit wider or narrower for your own comfort. The hinge stands up well to lateral pressure, and over all, the SP seems just as rugged as its predecessor--which has proven to be very rugged, indeed.--Porter B.

Six by my count (Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Game Boy Micro.)This, however is the version to get if you want the best experience overall. The way I came to this conclusion is by process of elimination. I eliminate the first 3 becuase they lack the functionality to play Game Boy Advance (GBA) games, obviously, becuause they are the previous generation. There is nothing inherantly wrong with these models per se, but if you are going to go through the effort to track down a portable machine to play these games, it would only make sense to get the best version of the handheld. So they are eliminated.So we are left with the GBA, the SP, and the Micro. Having never owned a Micro, but seeing them, and reading about them they seem like a cool option. But it has some nagging issues that keep it from being the best choice. First yes, it's cool that it's very small making it the most portable, but that comes at the price of the screen, it's very tiny and text is very hard to read. It lacks the link port, so it can't do multiplayer or link to the GCN. It also lacks the ability to play GB or GBC games. With those kinds of negatives it's little wonder it sold so poorly, this makes them more expensive, and harder to find. Add that to the fact that for a little more money you can get a DS lite, and get so much more from your puchase. It has the same limitations with a much better screen. So it makes it very hard to reccomend.The original model retains the compatablity (multiplayer and backward compatablity), with some great feeling shoulder buttons and has a larger screen. But the face buttons are somewhat ackward (try playing racing games on it), uses AA batteries and the screen isn't backlit. This is a very common model, but unfortunatley isn't the best for everyday use.So what makes the SP model the best? In a nutshell, it's got nearly all the best features of the other versions, without most of the drawbacks. That means, it's got multipayer compatablity (which includes conectivity to GCN) backward compatability, backlit screen, a good sized, colorful screen, a great button layout, rechargable battery, and a clamshell design to protect it. Let's go through these one by one.MultiplayerOne of the best features of any handheld has got the be the mutiplayer. I realize not all people utilize this feature but it's worth noting. Games like mario kart, tekken, and advance wars are meant to be played with more than one person. The ability to trade pokemon and interact with the GCN is great too. So it just makes the micro lose so much of it's appeal to me.Backward CompatablityThe ability to play GB and GBC games is a plus in my book. Not that I have that many of those games, but again, if you are going through the trouble of seeking out a Game Boy, why not buy one that can play twice the amount of games. There are some games that are exclusive to the system, so you won't find them anywhere else. the original GB came out in 1989 and had development until about 1998, GBC runs from 1998 to about 2001. Not only that, when you boot up the original GB games you can add a limitied amount of color to the games.ScreensThis is where the original GBA falls short. The screen itself is fine. But without direct light it's hard to see much of anything. The system boots up by default with the backlight off, with a simple press of the button under the screen it lights up. The lighting isn't very even, and it does shorten the battery life, but it makes for a much better experience. It's fairly nice sized screen too, it's actually wider than the one for GB/GBC, so you can stretch it with the L or R buttons when running those games.Button LayoutIf you've ever tried to play F-Zero on the GBA you know the face buttons aren't that well laid out. They feel okay, but leave your hands crampt if you need to hold the button. I switched the gas to the B button and it helps, but the point still remains. It seems like only a minor change but it makes a big difference on the SP. The micro, from what I am told is even more crampt than the original model. The one thing I don't particularly care for is the shoulder buttons. The original models feel great, with an indentation for your fingers to rest on. The SP, just doesn't have this. The buttons are thinner to accomodate to the clamshell design. What's worse is that they wear over time and stop working. Blowing into them restores functionality for a time, but it is an irritation.Rechargable batteryThis is a godsend. While it could be argued that getting batteries for the device may prove difficult over time, vs AA batteries will always be available, but for praticality's sake the rechargable battery is just better all around. Nintendo still sells them through their website. Given the popularity of the model, it's highly likely that third party vendors will offer them even when Nintendo stops selling them. The battery life is about 10 hours with the light on, and 18 with the light off. I suspect it may be even longer depending on the volume and running in backward compatablity mode, again, depending on the backlight usage.Clamshell designWithout a doubt the best way to go. It not only protects the screen when not in use, it also makes the device more portable. There is a reason so many phones still use this design. Some have complained about hinge problems, I have had no such issues. The only real complaint I have is the surface does scratch over time, still, I'd rather the surface show wear rather than the screen.SP lite /(Mark II)/Model 101There is actually a newer model of the SP. I simply call it the SP \"lite\". The only difference between the standard and the lite model is that the lite model has a vastly improved screen. It is not only frontlit as well as backlt, it also is more evenly lit in general, and has much better color saturation. Even when the light is turned off, it is more impressive than the original model with the light on. So it goes without saying that it's worth tracking down if you want the absolutely positively best model. They were only released in 3 colors, Pearl Blue, Pearl Pink, and Onyx Black. Not my first choice in colors but I digress. The way to tell is to look at the model number, the orignal SP is model AGS-001 and the lite is AGS-101. Do some reasearch and pick up this model if at all possible, it may be a bit harder to find, but is well worth the effort.ComplaintsI do have some complaints. I think the biggest issue for me is the L and R buttons. While I covered this in the button layout I must reiterate, it's simply a frustrating ordeal to have to blow into the buttons to losen them up every time I pick it up. Secondly, the big complaint from most, is the lack of an apparent headphone jack. Considering this is a portable device, I can see the frustration. Nintendo did offer an adapter on their online store, but it has been removed. Again, third party options do exist, both the adapter to use standard headphones (the better way to go) and headphones made specifically to use that port. The other problem this creates is that it uses the charging port, so you can't charge your SP while using headphones. Finally, I am frustrated by the uneven lighting of the original model, another reason why I reccomend the SP lite.ClosingEven with it's small caveats I still say this is the model to own if you want to play Game boy games. It features almost all of the positives of the other models and almost none of the drawbacks. With this information in hand, you can now make a more informed purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2011"}

I always handle my discs with care and even though ive found a way to take the discs out without smudging i feel they shouldve had the kind of mechanism the PS2 had. Its easy putting the discs in though. Secondly is overheating. It gets hot way too fast. Like five minutes fast. I dont play for more than an hour at a time if i can help it. My white 360 can stay on for a good amount of hrs and not get hot but thats becuz the fans are bigger. This PS needs bigger fans. Makes it harder for it to be an entertainment console for Blu Ray movie nites. The sound when the game is loading is loud.

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"A Huge Tease, needed more of everything","reviewText":"First off I am gonna start by saying that this game looks amazing and that it is a great game,  you should buy it now, go buy it and then come back and read the rest of my review,  I am gonna try and keep the spoilers out but I will have some small details about the game.ok,  a good game keeps things fresh it does not help to have tons of missions if they are all the same,  that being said,  the game does not have enough heist missions were you make money,  and the game tended to be slightly confusing when it came to how it tried to help you,  on the first heist if you make a certain choice it says it does not matter if you choose a bad gunman,  because your not going to be shooting.  But that choice does matter, an inexperienced gunman does not get as much loot,  and he screws up the getaway.  this is just a small example,  of how the game trying to help messes with you. so in short the game only has a handful of robbery heists,  it needs a lot more,  which I think will be added as DLC but seeing as how the heists are the main meat of the story,  in the trailer it says you have to pull ever increasing heists,  it is an out and out LIE,  you do not get as many heists as you think you should get.Ok Second the stuff you get to do around the city is amazing,  but why did they not have the idea of letting you do a family outing,  with the entire family,  or with all three or four or five of the gang,  getting together to raise a little hell.  Also with the people you can spend time with your wife and son.  You can choose between very very few options,  less then in GTAIV you can play tennis,  get drunk.  With your son you can play tennis and darts.  But for example just off the top of my head how cool would it be to have a beer for the first time or take him to a strip club.  Also as far as I have seen i can not spend time with Tracey my daughter,  which is a huge over sight.  Why is it that you can not spend time with you daughter.  You can go scuba diving, why cant you do that with your friends,  or take them on a hike, or on a boat ride, or yoga, or anything.why is it that your shrink does not change anything,  the shrink should help change Michael,  maybe if you could choose what you want to say in the game,  something you have no choice over anyway,  going to the shrink could have opened more options.the stock market is a cool addition but like everything else in the game it is one dimensional,  you can buy and sell stocks,  but what about stock options, or hedge funds, or being able to bet that a stock will tank,  or having a financial manager to clean your money.  Having to launder you money could have been a really cool feature as in you cant just go and spend the 700,000 bucks you just got.  You have to buy a business and use it to clean you money.  you can buy places but it is not required,  i think some people may not like the idea of having to clean your money but for a game that is trying to be more realistic,  that would have been a huge amount of realism.The movie studio you work with and end up being the producer on a project,  but it amounts to a couple of missions,  you have no real influence and make no choices.  It would have been cool if you could have influenced the project,  and then got to decide if you wanted to bank roll other movies.  As an investment,  you have to choose a script, set a budget, and make choices that conclude with a movie that either makes you a ton of money, bombs, or breaks even.  That would have been really really cool.but instead of adding ideas like the couple that I have just suggested the game gives you four or five different collection missions,  you have to find so many different things in this game just off the top of my head their is the nuclear waste in the ocean,  the sub parts in the ocean,  the hidden packages in the ocean,  the ufo parts,  and letter scraps thats five different things you have to search for in the game,  its overkill on things that only really matter to people who want to get 100% and its a lot for those people to have to go looking for all the stuff.the weapons are all very cool in the game,  but I have noticed a wall of empty slots,  what I have figured is that those weapons have to be found in the big wide world before you can acquire them,  I played through the entire game and have only found ONE of these hidden weapons,  it would have been nice if they had been a little bit easier to acquire,  or if I had known that I needed to go looking for them to begin with.I think that the game is amazing its fun and it will keep you busy,  but I think it is obvious that rock star is holding back a lot of stuff that they are going to be selling as DLC,  I really don't like this trend,  and if I was a patient person,  I might have been able to wait for the complete edition with all of the dlc built in so that I could have bought the ENTIRE game for less money,  but I am not patient, which is my own fault,  not the game companies,  but it would have been nice to have had a little bit more action and little less go find these hidden things.In conclusion,  I may have said a bunch of bad stuff but I think that I rated the game fairly,  some people may think that I am being nit picky and your allowed to have you own opinion,  I think that the game is good and if your patient you may want to wait for the game of the year edition or for used copies,  I bet that a lot of people will play through the missions get bored and turn it in for the next big thing or towards the new ps4 while they can still get a bunch of money for this game.  I would not suggest renting as it will take you at least a week to beat the game,  maybe game fly would be a good option,  but if your a huge fan,  you may enjoy the replay value.  I just wish that the game had a little bit more meat on its bones and a little less of this search and find stuff.CORRECTIONI just looked up the information for the DLC and apparently the DLC will be free, and speculation is that it will be release sometime after the game goes online, October 1st.  So my bashing the game for holding back content so that they could sell it to us, was not entirely fair on my part.  That is why I am adding this correction at the end of my review, here is some information about the DLC.  You can decide for your self wether it should have been included in the game at release or not,  maybe they should have maybe it would have delayed the release of the game,  I for one am happy to be playing the game,  and the lack of a price tag goes a long way towards me thinking rock star is not totally evil.GTA V DLC PacksThe Content Creator: The Content Creator will launch with tools to tailor and publish your own Deathmatches & Races.The Beach Bum Pack: Featuring 4 new amazing beach fun vehicles, over 300 new items of incredible down tempo leisure wear and 2 new but not remotely relaxing weapons.Capture the Flag: GTA Online's take on the classic CTF mode including the ability to make your own using The Content Creator.Heists: This update will introduce full-on cooperative Heist missions that will require careful planning, teamwork and sharp execution - along with the Heist Planning Board for your apartment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

The story, while a little confusing because we follow three (playable) characters, is pretty good. I only wish I had remembered more about the first Kingdom Hearts, since it's a prequel to the events that take place there (although if you haven't played the other games in the series you'll still do fine). I'm once again a little embarrassed that I'm enjoying a game featuring Disney characters, but Square once again merges the different characters together very nicely.Voice acting for all characters is decent to great.As noted above, I've put at least 42 hours into the game, completing each character's stories, and the final episode, but could easily put a dozen hours more into the game getting further completion and in the arena (which is still enjoyable, even though I don't know anyone else with a PSP).All-in-all, I give this game 5 stars across the board.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The games that are made by Nintendo are great. Such titles as Metroid Prime 2 and certainly the Zelda series are what give the Gamecube variety in it's games. The PS2 has games that have the same story, in a way. (For instance: Rachet&Clank;, Jak&Daxter.;) Also, most of the PS2 and Xbox games that are made only for that certain console are side games, not the ones that have an original storyline, and are engageing to play. The graphics are as good as or better than the Xbox or the PS2. In addition, the speed is much faster than that of the other two. It takes at average to load a game, about two seconds; at max, about ten seconds. You would think that with the $200 price tag on the Xbox and the PS2 would make it a fast console. (It takes, what, three minutes to load a game with the Xbox)The PS2 has bad Playstation-only games. The only good and popular game only for Xbox is the Halo series. On the Nintendo Gamecube, you have Nintendo-only games that are engageing, fun, and worth buying. (For Example:Super Smash Bros. Melee) Most good games, like Grand Theft Auto, or Need for Speed, are on all of the consoles. Another plus, it is the least expensive of the three.Look at AMAZONs average rating(as of 8-11-05 and has been like this for a while).The Xbox--------avg customer rating = 4 starsThe PS2---------avg customer rating = 4 starsThe Gamecube---avg customer rating = 4 and a half stars.KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE. It looks like the people are more satisfied with the Gamecube.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"S. Der","summary":"Great game but repetitive","reviewText":"At first I really didn't like this game. It was very childish and very repetitive. It was also really simple gameplay too. But, after awhile, I started to like it...maybe towards the beginning of disc 3. I guess it got to me after the one million battle and hours of hearing that battle music. The story was okay.(I just finished watching the anime of Blue Dragon the whole series. The anime has a pretty good story, but I actually preferred the video game story, so I will change my mind from okay game story to great story!)I thought the fight battles was very bad in terms of the game difficulty. It was just too simple and too many. After I beat the game, I played hard mode, which I felt was much closer to what normal mode should had been like. Many people talked about how easy the game was and I believe what the game makers should had done was made \"hard mode\", the \"REAL normal mode\". Also, I thought \"Impossible Mode\" was really tough, and super rewarding once I beat it.Most of the boss battle are very easy and they don't really require much strategy. On the other hand, if you fight the optional bosses, those required strategies and preparation to beat. And NO, going in the battles to fight with level 99 characters without any strategies wouldn't win the fights. You actually have to plan and think about what you need to do.Furthermore, I love fighting the 5 dragons, King Boo, and Gold Mecha. It took awhile to figured out a way to beat them without dying over and over again...especially on impossible mode! No, it's not just level up till the max, I beat them at the lowest levels for a true challenge. And, leveling up takes forever too! And you still need some sort of strategy to beat them, you can't just go all gong-ho with these bosses! lolI think all RPG fans should give this game a chance. It's not so bad after disc 2 at least. Worth a buy for $10 and below. And, would give you 40+ hours of fun if you make it past the first 2 discs that is. lol","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000HE9LL8","reviewerName":"L. J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"If You Only Buy One DS Game, Make It This One","reviewText":"I am the sort of person who thrives on negativity. The prospect of failure inspires my personal greatest. The snark factor that accompanies truly bad products is often more entertaining to me than things that are really objectively good. I love to criticize and rarely sing praises... but that just goes to show how much I love Elite Beat Agents. This game has joined my rather limited collection of handheld games, and if the DS never produces another excellent game that's okay, because EBA is reason enough to own a DS.People have lots of problems. The elite beat agents try to solve them with the power of pop music. As the music plays, you tap the touch screen with the stylus in sync with the music, and it causes the agents to dance. Miss a beat and they fall down. There is a meter at the top that is constantly decreasing. Missing beats causes it fall more rapidly, but hitting the beats gives it little boosts. Hitting all beats in a sequence will net you an Elite Beat that will give the meter a big boost. In the harder difficulty levels this is the only way to stay alive.EBA is pretty short. It only has a grand total of 19 songs, and three of them you'll have to unlock by reaching a certain total of high score points. Luckily, the game has about four difficulty levels to entertain you with. That and it is just so much fun to play that you'll find yourself coming back again and again. I find it difficult to fault it for length because this is a hand-held system after all, and getting 19 full length vocal songs plus the 3D dance animations for the agents on one cartridge is a feat in and over itself.Each song is accompanied by a little story that plays itself out in comic book style on the top screen. Your performance during the song effects how it turns out. Each section of the song is broken into 3 to 5 segments, and depending on how well or poorly you do effects if something good or bad happens to the characters. Most of the stories are pleasantly amusing, and more importantly, very fun to watch.Elite Beat Agents is pretty much perfect, and its forced me to admit it. Hopefully, there will be a sequel one day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2007"}

This game is is a racing game to the core but has spectacular crash sequences and brillant sense of speed. I don't even like racing games and I appreciate the good times Burnout 3: Takedown has brought to me. The game is probably the best in the series besides the new one which I have yet to play the full version(I've only played the demo off madden 06) Still not convinced? They have more. Play Crash mode where the objective is to get the most damage from a crash by hitting: semis, buses, taxis, and other cars. They also have Roadrage where your objective is to takedown as many cars as you can until the time runs out or your completely wrecked.The only flaw in this game is that when you hit a car going the same direction as you in the back, it counts as a takedown. It may not seem like much but when your trying to weave through traffic going 120+, it makes all the difference. I'm glad to hear that the new Burnout has fixed that flaw.Overall this is a must buy for everyone. I would recommend it to anyone even if they don't like racing games because it has revived my passion for racing games. Trust me, its unlike any other racing game you've ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2005"}

You're in a war zone that's your enemy go kill them. And little to no charecter development or story to be seen. Well this game has both! Throughout this game all I could think was as much as I miss rapture, this game is the best of the three. It starts out at a slower pace then the first two, but once it picks up I was beyond hooked! Then I got to the end and my jaw just kept dropping and dropping! At the end of it I was so happy I played the game. Most endings are short and just wrap things up nice and neatly. But not this game! With all the twists at the end and everything leading up to the end all I could think was \"this is truely the best ending to any game ever made.\" I can't praise this game enough! They also changed the mechanics a lot! The only thing I missed from the 1st two was hacking things. And if you're currious I've been playing games for over 15 years. So I've played at least 100 games, but this game stands up as one of the best...possibly the greatest game I've ever played! The one thing I was confused about  was after 2+ years of developing this game there is no multiplayer. Not a big problem for me since I'm not very into multiplayer, and the story makes up for that by ten fold.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

As a first person shooter it has an OK single player mission series, but the game really shines in its on line tournament play.Yes, there is a single player mode. You go around shooting things, learning about the weapons and maps. Play with the six races and various classes to learn which best appeals to you and your gameplay style.The character choices are interesting, and the sound draws you into the game. The booming wrestling-match commands give you that tournament feel. On the down side, there is a lot of cursing in the default taunts, so this is yet another reason the game isn't great for younger kids (apart from the obvious violence).The graphics and physics are truly amazing. They've gone an excellent job both with indoor and outdoor maps. Players who are used to the Doom-like graphics of some other games out there will really appreciate the attention to detail put into the development here.  The way in which your character moves, and the world through which you are moving, are both very realistic.The weapons represent a good mix of styles. Some might complain that some of the uber-weapons from previous releases are missing - but there's a reason for that, it's called gameplay balance. The weapon set you have available here helps ensure that you have to use some brains and strategy to win, not just raw button-mashing ability.Where the game really shines is multiplayer. This is what it was made for. Once you've spent enough time in single player to learn the controls, races and weapons, be sure to head on line! You can play classics like deathmatch, capture the flag, bombing run (like football) and domination (a control-area setup).Highly recommended for any on line fan of first person shooters!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2002"}

The graphics and gameplay were good though it limits you to using a keyboard and mouse and not keyboard only or even a joystick controller like I prefer. That in itself, was just a minor drawback though. The big problem with Halo is that the system requirements are extremely demanding. My computer has a 64 Meg Radeon graphics card, 2.5 gig Athlon processor, and 512 megs ram. That combo should be able to run just about anything well, but Halo was lagging and I felt like I was playing in slow motion half the time. I think Halo has serious graphic bugs or something. I can run Unreal II, and other recent games without a hitch, but not Halo. If this is any indication of what's to come in Halo 2, very few computers will be able to run it unfortunately.  It seems like the gaming companies worry more about how good they can make the game, which is fine, but don't think to make sure that people can actually run the games on normal computer systems. I'm sure the gaming companies have much more sophisticated and powerful computer systems, than most people even know exist.

{"product_name":"B001G3B0HC","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"The Missing Pieces","reviewText":"KINGDOM HEARTS was the first video game I ever played that actually touched me.  I'm not sure what it is about the game, but I became more involved and attached to that story than I ever had with a video game before.  It was just a great and engaging story.  I was really excited when I first heard that they were making a sequel to KINGDOM HEARTS.  Much to my surprise, though, the sequel turned out to only be available on the Gameboy Advanced.  A few years later I discovered that that \"sequel\" was exactly a sequel, but more of an interlude and that a true sequel would be released on PS2.  A few months after I had initially played KINGDOM HEARTS 2, I learned that the Kingdom Hearts game that had been re-leased a few years ago only on Gameboy Advance, would be released and updated for PS2.  That game was KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES.KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES begins almost immediately where KINGDOM HEARTS left off.  Sora, Donald, and Goofy have just helped to close the great door and are in search of King Mickey and Riku.  Pluto appears and knowing that where Pluto is the King can't be far off, the trio chases the dog and eventually arrive at Castle Oblivion.  Castle Oblivion is a thirteen story building and is the headquarters of Organization XIII.  Upon entering Sora and his companions discover that they have lost their abilities and a hooded figure informs them that the further they travel in the Castle, the more memories they will lose.  Most of what Sora discovers in the castle isn't actually real but are instead projects formed from the memories of his mind.  The leader of Organization XIII, Marluxia, intends to manipulate Sora's memories and use him to get rid of the rest of the group.  Other members learn of Marluxia's plan and attempt to use Sora for their own designs.  Other than the mysterious cloaked figure, who really doesn't seem much help at all, the only people who seem able to help are a girl Sora seems to remember from his past named Namine and Axel, a member of Organization XIII.After defeating Sora's story, you are able to play as Riku and see the story from his perspective.  Certain members of Organization XIII have plans for Riku, including making a copy of him.  Others just want him eliminated.  Meanwhile, Riku is forced to wrestle with the darkness in his heart.Combat and gameplay is different in KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES than in KINGDOM HEART and KINGDOM HEARTS II.  In those games, if you were at a high enough level with just the right amount of magic, you could fight your way through any level.  KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES is different because everything is done with the use of cards.  You want Goofy or Donald to fight along side, you have to use the right card.  You want to use some magic, you have to use a card.  You need to use an item, you have to use a card.  You want to use a combo, you need to use a card.  It sounds simple, but there's actually some strategy involved because certain card work better on certain enemies.  If you don't have the right combination of cards with the right enemy, you'll be defeated.As you level up, you get to decide what you want to level up.  So, if you want to get more hit points you can, but if you'd rather learn a new ability you can choose to do that instead.  There is a difference between the Sora gameplay and the Riku gameplay because Sora can make his own deck, but Riku is given a particular deck at the beginning of each level that can't be modified.Initially, I didn't like the card gameplay of KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES and it took some getting used to.  However, once I got used to the card system, it really wasn't that bad.  Still, the gameplay in KH and KH2 is better.Like the other PS2 Kingdom Hearts games, the graphics are impressive.  There aren't as many cut scenes as there are in the other two games and some of the scenes are just words of dialogue between characters.  I wish there were more cut scenes, but I understand that since this is an updated version that was originally designed for Gameboy Advance that's why there aren't as many.The only other negative about the game is that it's really easy to get lost in the map.  The mapdoesn't stay frozen.  Instead it changes based on the direction of your character.  Therefore, it's easy to get confused, which is particularly frustrating when you want to go from one end of a complex to the other.KINGDOM HEARTS: CHAIN OF MEMORIES is a fun an interesting game that fills in the gaps of the story between KH and KH2.  The gameplay is different and isn't as exciting, but the new development of having to play using a card-based battle system makes for some unique challenges.  Kingdom Hearts fans will definitely want to play the game, particularly if you've played KH and KH2 and are wondering how Sora got inside that pod in Castle Oblivion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjo's sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her. Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back.The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage.This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid. A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel, Banjo Tooie.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2006"}

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"Steve \"SBN\"","summary":"The Beginning of an era (in remake form)","reviewText":"For those who don't know too much info about this game, this is the remake of the first 2 NES games, not the originals. 2nd is that FF2 (FF2 in japan) was never released here in the US and finally that these 2 games are actually ports from the Wonderswan versions of the games. Wonderswan is a handheld gaming system (like the gameboy) that is in Japan only and has two ways to play the system (horizontailly and Vertically).Because I have been a fan of the FF games for a long time, I actually can say that this is my least favorite of all of the Final Fantasy games that came out on the Playstation 1. FF1 doesn't really have any main character at all, but has a battle system similar to FF4 (2 in the US for the SNES). FF2 on the other hand has a main character but the way the game plays (both on the field and in battle) is a little strange. On the field, when you talk to somebody, when it comes to important events in the game or whatever, you have a menu of stuff to choose to say. However, as you progress through the game, you get more stuff to say. The point here is that it kind of sucks to have a limited amount of conversation subjects and have to actually find more as the game progresses. The battle system for this game is like FF10 (only you don't get to choose what to raise up for your stats) and you don't have any level system at all. it's like the first game. the reason why I give this game a overall rating of 4 stars is because RPGs that were made in the NES days are really difficult and don't have much storyline and subplots in the games (like Dragon Warrior), and only have to do a few important things (probably 10 or 15 all together) before fighting the final boss. these games were mostly just to level your character up, got do some things, fight some bosses, level up some more, do other things, level up some more, fight the final boss. plus these games are way too short, because in those days, games didn't have a lot of juice (memory) to put in a long game so you can probably beat the game in 10 hours or more. I am so happy that I got to join in on the RPG train around the time of the Genesis/Super NES to the PSone era to a few from this era (PS2, GC, Xbox) because you can do a lot more with these type of RPGs since they can take longer to beat. I am not saying that FF1 and 2 are horrible games, they just aren't as great as the 16 bit, 32 bit and 128 bit eras.This game isn't that important to have in your Final Fantasy collection. however if you like the ancient old school RPGs from the NES era, this is recommended. If you are a starter on RPGs, this is definitly not a good start.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00007LVJD","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Good game, but severely taxes your system","reviewText":"Right off the bat: this is a good game.  Just like all C&amp;C games before it, the core gameplay is the same, with some differences.  For starters, you can now upgrade units with enhanced technology (like upgrading weapons in Warcraft).  Many units have their own individual upgrades that enhance abilities as well.There are 3 sides: China, USA, and a world Liberation Army, which are Middle Eastern terrorists.  The sides in this game are far more realistic now than they have been in past C&amp;C games, and that makes for interesting warfare during the game.  Battles can span anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours, and they are often very fun and challenging.  Each side is fundamentally different and it will take some time getting used to all sides, as well as trying to master them.  Each side has its own campaign to get through with a story to go along with it.  Unlike previous C&amp;C games, there are no cinematics between missions.  Everything is told to you as you play.Despite the fact that this is a good game, there is one problem with it that just takes the quality of it down completely: the severely high requirements it has for gameplay.  I am running a top of the line system, as of August 2003 barely a year old, and Generals runs so slowly you would think that its running on a 486.  I don't know why the game runs so poorly, considering the high end technology I have in my computer.  Having played the game on other computers I have noticed the same thing.  It just demands far too much.  Unfortunately sacrifices must be made, and to run the game efficiently you will have to scale the graphics down so much that they will look severely outdated, almost looking like the old C&amp;C games from way back in the day.  The fact that this game runs so slowly on a P4, 2.0 gig with 1.2 gig ram and a GeForce 5 video card is mind-boggling.  This also makes for extremely slow on-line play.Unfortunately this rather good game is marred by its tremendous system requirements.  Had it not been designed ahead of its time, it would have ran more smoothly and would have been an overall better game experience.  Regardless, I enjoy the game and any C&amp;C fan will too.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Every bit as incredible as Jak II","reviewText":"Jak and Daxter are back in the conclusion of the Precursor Legacy Trilogy. This game is almost an exact clone of its predecessor in pretty much every aspect. Normally when a videogame sequel is this similar to the previous game, the sequel tends to lose its \"freshness\". Fortunately, that's not the case for Jak 3, it uses the same gameplay and graphics that made Jak II great, while also adding a few improvements here and there. The story begins with a rather surprising scene: Jak is banished from Haven City and is being left in the middle of the wasteland desert by a council member named Count Veger and his soldiers, despite objections from Jak's friends Daxter, Ashelin, and Pecker. Apparently, the city is holding Jak responsible for the Metal Heads invading the city at the end of the previous game, and even though Baron Praxis and Metal Kor were defeated, the city is still at war with the surviving Metal Heads and previous Krimzon Guard robots, known as KG Deathbots. Jak, accompanied by Daxter and Pecker, is later found by a group of wastelanders and taken to their city, Spargus, where Jak has to prove his worth to the wasteland king Damas by taking part in arena battles in order to be allowed to stay in the city.Jak and Daxter eventually make their way back to Haven City, which is a war zone with Metal Heads and KG Deathbots constantly attacking the previous members of the Underground and Krimzon Guard who now defend the city as the Freedom League. Between dealing with these enemies, proving Jak's innocence, and finding out what the obviously corrupt Count Veger is up to, Jak and Daxter have a lot on their plate. Lucky for them, they've got mad skills and even madder weapons and gadgets that they can use to deal with any challenge. In the wasteland, Jak and Daxter will do missions for the tough but fair Damas, where they'll deal with Marauders and new kinds of Metal Heads as they explore temples, volcanoes, and Metal Head nests. The wasteland is also twice as large as Haven City, and the duo can get around by riding one of several dune buggies of different sizes armed with machine guns, grenade launchers, and so on. One of them can jump 30 feet in the air, allowing Jak and Daxter to reach areas that regular buggies can't reach. Spargus itself is considerably smaller than Haven City and strongly resembles Tatooine from Star Wars. Due to its smaller size, Spargus is easier to go through on foot, however there are plenty of Leaper Lizards that Jak can ride to get to places (they control and move like the Flut Flut from the first game). While it's easier to get around Spargus, it's still possible to accidentally ram into its inhabitants, but since they're all armed warriors, you should be prepared for a firefight if you anger any of them.Haven City is quite different from the way it was in Jak II. Certain areas like the slums and port haven't changed and offer a sense of nostalgia and familiarity, as do the reappearance of Jak's old friends, including Samos the Sage, Keira, Ashelin, Torn, Sig, and so on. However, other areas of Haven City have changed greatly. The park is now the new nest headquarters for the Metal Heads and appears appropriately gloomy and dark, with pools of green acid and endless Metal Heads roaming around. Other areas of the city that experience constant battling have Metal Heads, KG Deathbots, and Freedom League soldiers fighting each other, making the city very dangerous to travel through without a zoomer to get away from the endless wave of enemies. To help deal with the many enemies Jak and Daxter will face, he once again has access to the morph gun from the previous game with the same Scattergun, Blaster, Vulcan Fury, and Peace Maker mods making a return. Also, each of the four mods has 2 new upgradeable firing modes. For example, the second upgrade for the Blaster shoots out a saucer shaped pod that spins around and fires a hail of Blaster shots at all enemies underneath it. Then there's the first upgrade of the Vulcan Fury that fires a beam of electricity. With these additional upgrades, the number of weapons for Jak has increased from 4 to 12. Jak also has use of his jetboard and the power of his Dark Jak form. He even gains a Light Jak form after being energized with Light Eco; in this form Jak can do things like surround himself with a force field, heal himself, or sprout a pair of wings that allow him to glide over longer distances. In certain missions Jak acquires several pieces of Precursor Armor that increase his overall health, so no longer will he be killed by enemies after just four hits.Aside from Jak's new weapons and powers, the game also offers a few new twists to the gameplay with certain specialized missions alongside the more traditional missions so popular with the previous game. One of these new missions has Daxter go into cyberspace, where he deals with deadly cybersecurity measures in a digital world similar to Pac-Man and the player controls a \"Pac-Daxter\". There's also a mission where Jak gets to control one of those spider-like Bomb Bots and use its laser to blast its way through Deathbots and blow up a shield wall. The game offers even more opportunities to play as Daxter by himself than the previous game did. There's also an increased number of challenging boss battles for Jak and Daxter to tackle; the last one is particularly awesome and quite incredible just to look at. So yes, Jak 3 is just as fun and hugely challenging as Jak II. The graphics are also top notch once again. The old and new environments all look great. I only had two small problems with this game. First, while it's still a free-roaming sandbox game, the missions are considerably more linear than they were in Jak II. While Jak II would usually offer between two to four missions simultaneously and let you choose which one you wanted to tackle first, this game takes away most of this freedom and normally only offers one or two different missions at a time. The second problem is that this game is noticeably shorter than Jak II; this problem appears to be tied to the increased linearity. Still, these minor problems don't detract enough from the game to lower the score I gave it. Jak 3 has all the magic of Jak II with challenging and varied missions, a great story, beautiful graphics, and of course the kind of humor that only Daxter could provide. It's all good with Jak and Daxter in the neighborhood.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M. PadillaPros:One of the best and most complex stories in gamingOutstanding graphics with many interactive elementsExcellent soundtrack and voice actingCons:Long periods of watching instead of playingSome extraneous dialogueSolid Snake may inspire gamers to grow mullets","reviewerName":"Brian Reaves","summary":"A great game and movie in one!","reviewText":"Ok, you know the downside to this game: you only get to be Snake for roughly 1/3 of the game, then you're this Final Fantasy-looking Raiden dude. That stinks, and I hope Konami doesn't try pulling that one again in MGS3 in 2004. Let us be Snake all the way through - or at least give us the option to choose whether to be Snake or Raiden instead of forcing us. Hopefully they aren't trying to wean us off of Snake and choose Raiden as the hero of the series from now on. That being said, this game is good otherwise. The cinematics are great, and Snake is more fluid-looking and awesome than ever. Yes, there are extended periods of watching rather than playing (when you finish the Snake mission and begin the Raiden one, you can plan on about 20 minutes of watching as one storyline closes and another sets up - and beginning the Raiden mission means you'll be talking on the Codec every minute - no lie! - for the first 10 minutes of your game), but that's ok because you play a game like this to enjoy the story. If you just want to kill things, then you'll need to look elsewhere. Most of the Snake mission involves stealth (you don't even get a real gun until halfway through it), so it's more like being sneaky than anything else. And yes, it is possible to finish this game without killing a single soul (or kill 'em all, if that's how you feel about it).  There is a series of LONG cinematic sequences as you get to the last two boss fights in the game (one 20 minutes long), and it's impossible to save until you get to a part where you can play, so plan on watching a LOT as the game draws to a close.  There are several plot twists thrown in at the end that really come from nowhere and don't make much sense, and the conversations sometimes go off into strange areas that have nothing to do with the gameplay at all but are meant to develop the characters.  No way to skip any of that without missing something good, so just grab a Pepsi and get comfortable.  After defeating the last boss, the ending cinematic really isn't that satisfying - other than the fact that it possibly gives a glimpse into what MGS3 is going to be about.  All in all, it's a great game and a worthy sequel. I'd give it 5 stars, but you play Metal Gear to be Snake, and that doesn't happen enough in this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2002"}

But this game has almost no difficulty (except for collecting ALL of the relics... that is a chalenge)... To be honest, the only time I died was while playing the final boss, and even then, that death could have been easily avoided if I had used one of my 13 potions. The magic system in the game is ok, using spell books with weapons to create powerful magic, but these spell books are too easilly obtained (except for the last book, the summoning tome, which reqires a little bit of searching)and just a little too powerful. The bosses are also VERY uninspired and boaring compared to previous castlevania bosses. The game is a great time killer and is fun, but if you are looking for some gothic, vampire slaying action, You should probably look at Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, or Castlevania lament of Innocence.

I want to say at the outset that the game's publisher, Ubisoft, did not return several calls and e-mails for more information and review materials for the game. We were able to get a pre-release interview for the game, but since then, no further information was passed along, so I had to rely on Gamefly to provide the game for review and did not have an outlet to get explanations or clarifications for questions I had with the game and its performance.Carpenter was a college student who decided to make a difference in the world and at the start of the game, finds himself launching with his new squad to recover pilots from a downed aircraft. Carpenter like all of his fellow soldiers, are enhanced by a drug called Nectar which grants them greater abilities in combat and is administered by the combat armor they wear.The first few missions are fairly standard shooter missions where players mow down generic baddies in a dense jungle before they undertake an urgent mission to capture the rebel leader who has been located in a smelting plant.As the mission unfolds, Carpenter begins to have doubts about his role thanks in large part to a malfunctioning Nectar administrator. In short order, Carpenter soon finds himself involved in the rebellion and seeking to find the truth behind Nectar and the real agenda of the Mantel Corporation.The game has a good setup and premise, but sadly the best moments of the game come in the early stages of the game. Aside from the abundance of generic units as both enemies and NPC characters, there are roughly a dozen lines of dialogue that are spouted in the heat of battle by your opponents and comrades. While this is an attempt to add depth to the game, it comes across badly, as many times the lines are not always appropriate to the situation, and rapidly become redundant after you hear them for the fifth time in a mission.  There were also a few moments were the audio portion of the game dropped out.Another issue with the game is the very bad A.I. that aside from rolling from side to side, limits your enemies to straight on attacks for the most part. On more than one occasion I was able to shoot an enemy only to have him take a shot at me and then turn his back to me and ignore me until I attacked him again. The game attempts to explain this during a load screen with text that informs you that soldiers on Nectar become impervious to much of what is around them. While this may be the case, it tends to make for some very dull and uninspired enemies and gameplay.Another issue I had with the game was the level design missions. Many missions involved simply getting to a point and then getting back from a point and surviving the combat in between. There were few distractions in the plot and little twists to give the game a sense of suspense or mystery, and to explain Carpenter's motivations.  A so called reveal hinted at things, but there was never a big payoff or confirmation, so I was left to accept that Carpenter had a change of heart based on what was largely circumstantial evidence and the word of another person.The game does get some things right, and that is the solid selection of weapons and the ability to administer Nectar to yourself in combat. Gamers who want a bit of perverse fun may want to give themselves an intentional overdose and watch what happens next.The finale was a big disappointment as there was no ultimate bad guy for me to content with nor were any of the real mysteries of Mantel fully explained. I had thought that this might be explored in a future sequel but since Ubisoft did not respond to my requests, I have to assume that this is not the case. The final conflict was so uninspired, that two quick bursts from my rifle and a grenade ended the conflict. I did not even need to use the special Nectar grenades that my character learned to create later in the game.Another issue with the game is the inconsistent graphics in the game. At times the game really shines and at other times, the textures seem on par with PS 2 graphics and do not live up to the potential the PS 3 offers.The voice acting, music, and sound effects in the game are average and do not really stand out, but the multiplay does offer some interesting options. While I had problems staying connected to many ranked games, there were some great options such as a co-op mode and a multiplay game where I could either be a guard or a prisoner trying to escape from a compound.I also enjoyed the use of vehicles in the game as being able to drive or ride in certain vehicles both in the solo and online portion of the game were actually some of the best moments in the game.Using the Dualshock 3 control did help somewhat as the vibration effects did allow for some added immersion into the game, but sadly did not allow me to steer the vehicles with the control via motion sensing as some other PS 3 titles do.In short, Haze is a great concept that sadly fails to live up to the promise that was so evident when I first previewed the game at the PAX Expo in Seattle last summer.6 stars out of 10Creativity 3  Good concept but falls apart after early missions.Graphics 3  Some are good but most are not up to the potential of the PS 3Sound 3  Some audio issues, music is nothing specialLongevity 3  Finished the game in about 6 hoursFun Factor 3 Had some good moments, just not enough","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2008"}

You do not need the larger hard drive unless you have no hard drive to re-use.  I bought the 4GB Slim.  Took the old 120GB hard drive from my old 360, bought a $6 adapter, popped the old hard drive in the adapter and put that entire thing into the hard drive slot of the 4GB Slim and presto!  For $205 I have ALL my old games and RockBand songs on a brand new 360 Slim with a 120GB hard drive & 4GB internal memory.  No having to port over anything and no paying an extra $100 for a larger hard drive.As far as comparing a 360 to a PS3....for me, no comparison.  The PS3's lack of ability to do background downloads is a deal breaker.  Yes, the PS3 can get you on the network without having to pay the astronomical 360 fee of 50 some dollars a year (wow), but I hate it.  I'm on a projector system and when I turn everything on and then the PS3 says it needs to do some update that will totally consume it for the next 30 minutes or more, that is completely unacceptable.  And yes, I have had 3 360s die the rrod since 2005, but I STILL prefer the 360 over the PS3.  If and when the PS3 dies, I will replace it with a Bluray player that has the Netflix app.  I will never buy a PS3 again.  It's the download thing.  Stupid stupid stupid.As for the Slim compared to the old 360s:  I hate the touch buttons.  It comes on or opens the tray even if I'm just cleaning.  Stupid!  There was nothing wrong with push buttons.  It's smaller.  Big deal.  It's quieter.  That's nice.  Is it reliable?  Don't know yet.  No other differences that seem to matter.My Elite died and I needed a new 360.  I have learned how NOT to trust Micro$oft.  Even if the 720 came out tomorrow, I would not touch it with a 10 foot pole.  I would wait at least a year, probably longer, until all the bugs were worked out.  Like I said, 3 rrod 360s since 2005.

{"product_name":"B004X56PWK","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"Not one, but two Sonics finally return to their former glory!","reviewText":"It can hardly be argued that the past decade hasn't been very kind to Sega's blue Erinaceus mascot. For years now, the quality and direction of Sonic console games have ranged from... questionable, to put it politely, to downright terrible, to put it bluntly (His handheld titles have been consistently excellent, however). I grew up loving Sonic. His Genesis adventures were the first video games I ever played as a child, and my love and obsession for Sonic as a series continued from my toddler days throughout his stellar Dreamcast outings (I even devoured the comic series for years. Over a hundred issues are still at my parents' house). I'll be honest,Sonic Adventure 2was the last Sonic game to hold my attention as a fan, and it was after that particular Dreamcast masterpiece that Sonic started to lose his unique way of doing \"what Nintendon't\" (Some argueSonic Heroeswas his last great game. I never played it myself, so I can't judge). It seemed that all was lost for Sonic, and with each lousy game his fans felt more and more disheartened and angry when dealing with the haters, more of which came out of the paneling with each crappy game.First, a little history about Sonic's quality increasing in recent years, culminating in this disc of pure adrenaline inducing awesomeness:Sonic Unleashed'sdaytime levels were a true success at retaining the past greatness of Sonic's unique, classical \"fastest thing alive\" approach to platforming, but overall Unleashed was an experience marred by horrendous Werehog nighttime levels that were slow and boring, the antithesis of what Sonic has always stood for. Then came Sonic 4 Ep. 1, which made even more progress to return to Sonic's 2-D roots and past glory, despite some missteps and questionable gameplay design choices (I'm a lot kinder here than a lot of 4's detractors).Sonic Colorswas next, and was FINALLY a wholly stellar Modern Sonic title, of which there are few things to complain about; by far the best Sonic title in years, until now.These three titles have set the table that Sonic Generations has come to, seen, and conquered. The fastest thing alive is back on his 20th anniversary, and to commemorate this most special occasion for their #1 mascot, Sega has invited not one, but two distinctly different Sonics to come celebrate. We are the guests of honor, and this is the best present a Sonic fan could have ever asked for. This is a long intro, I know, and this review will be a long one, but please, let me indulge the inner 4-year-old in me that would be obsessed with Sonic for years. This is the game Sonic fans have yearned for for over a decade. I will try to be as detailed as I can to give you an accurate picture of the game. Ok, here we go:Story: Sonic and friends find themselves the target of an evil, malevolent force that threatens the universe and time itself! Amid the chaos, Sonic and Tails find themselves in some void, face to face with a chubby Sonic n' Tails from the past, from circa early-mid 1990's specifically. Both \"Classic\" and \"Modern\" Sonics team up and set off from this pure-white hub world to journey through their most memorable past exploits in order to attempt to right the wrongs and save everything they've ever known. Is it a great, ground-breaking story? No way, but it doesn't have to be. This is Sonic, and ifSonic and the Secret RingsorSonic 06' (shudders)were games that tried to put a heavier story into the mix, I'll thank the chaos emeralds and chao that this title doesn't. The story merely gives context to the action and then steps back so the player can enjoy what you and I have always picked up Sonic the Hedgehog titles for: Excellent platforming gameplay at extreme speeds, cool style, and awesome music.Let's talk about gameplay. I'm sure many of you out there were probably worried, first of all, about whether or not Sonic Team screwed up the gameplay/control mechanics of classic Sonic. Sonic 4 really changed the physics and control behavior from the classics and that really upset a lot of fans (not me so much, but many fans were peeved). You may confidently relax, because the classic Sonic gameplay is exactly the way it was on the Genesis. The game really rewards those who work hard to attain high speed and punishes those who are careless and slow on the uptake, just like in the good ol' days. The inertia is back, yes, the continued movement without constant d-pad pressure is back, and it is glorious. The only difference I can think of is that the classic Sonic levels here actually feel faster than the originals, and that the levels and proportions of everything ranging from platforms to loop-de-loops to spikes to enemies, seems... bigger. You may not feel that way, but I definitely did. There were also graphical tricks implemented that almost gives Classic Sonic a 2.5-D feel to them. So even though you're only running from left to right, you may hit a bounce spring that shoots you at an angled trajectory (think barrels fromDonkey Kong Country Returns), or a sprint section may go through turns to the foreground to the background and everywhere else. Sonic 4 had similar tricks. These little touches really make the levels feel like living, organic worlds that Sonic is speeding through, despite the 2D \"flatforming\", and that is really rad.Modern Sonic levels are characterized by maneuvering complex 3-D obstacle courses at speeds so fast, the music and outside sound literally distorts (I'm not kidding), making for an incredible effect. You have a boost function you can abuse to get Sonic up to speed again when you inevitably miss that 1/100000000th of a second you needed to react to miss a corner or ledge or enemy that stops you cold. You can even hold Sonic's boost button down to go at ultra fast speeds consistently over time. It's quite the rush, trust me. You can't abuse boost for long, however, as you need to take breathers, perform stylish moves, collect rings, or take down enemies to absorb more energy in order to replenish the boost bar. It's a nice balance. Modern Sonic gameplay really seems to push the envelope in every way, from speed level to set-piece epicness. It's all so over the top, and really captures that \"HOLY CRAP!\" feeling you and I probably first had when Sonic ran down that skyscraper or was chased by that killer whale inSonic Adventure, OR the massive death truck chase fromSonic Adventure 2. Even the Modern Sonic reimaginings of classic levels have set piece moments like that, and that's really cool. Bravo Sega. I'm sorry for doubting you so much (but can you blame me?).The presentation in this game, from the art design to its graphical presentation, is phenomenal and the definition of fan service. When I started up Sonic Generations, my brain fried a little from Nostalgia overload at the modern remix of Sonic 1's menu music and both Sonics waving their finger at me. I foamed at the mouth, a tear of pure joy and sunshine gathered in my eye, and my heart started beating in dubstep. It was... overwhelming, and probably not pretty but I make no apologies. When I started up Classic Sonic's Green Hill zone... well... gosh, this is going to be hard to describe... impossible actually, so I'll just say this and then let you discover the magic for yourselves: The graphical presentation of pretty much every Sonic level here is absolutely amazing. They all retain the spirit of their original appearances, while utilizing the power that today's consoles can afford the art design, and it is spectacular. That's no small feat! This applies to the age-old classics AND the more modern levels. I have less enthusiasm for levels from the \"Post Sonic Adventure 2\" section of Sonic canon, but this game's art design and gameplay mechanics are so great, I enjoyed them thoroughly too.The classic music is enhanced, while harnessing that great ol' Genesis synthesized goodness, and the classic sound effects are all there. Same goes for the music/sound design for the modern iterations. It's quite amazing. It IS strange (and awesome) to hear \"modern\" versions of old tunes while playing as Modern Sonic, like Green Hill Zone from an actual rock band for instance, as opposed to the original synth stuff. One thing I *really* enjoyed were the awesome \"classic Sonic\" versions of newer \"modern Sonic\" songs. They're astoundingly awesome, seriously. Another really positive accolade for the sound is that much of the voice acting is actually tolerable now! You'll still stumble across some painfully cheesy stuff, but that's to be expected. To be mad at Sonic for campy cheesiness is like getting mad at Star Fox 64 for campy cheesiness. That would be crazy. Campiness is part of Sonic's \"edge factor,\" so stop hating and let him cheese it up, I say. The excellent gameplay certainly affords him that right. It's definitely a vast improvement overall though.There are levels from nine different games in Sonic's canon. That may seem paltry, but when you consider that each level has two different, and I meant very different, versions, one for classical Genesis Sonic gameplay, and one for Modern Unleashed/Colors Sonic gameplay, this is forgivable. This game has tons of replay value, as each level has several different ways to get from the beginning to the end-post/end-giant-ring. There's also tons of unlockables which not only drive the incentive for replay, but really are nice nods to Sega fans out there. This was nice. There ARE only four *true* boss fights in the entire game, however... yes, FOUR! This strikes me as odd, when you consider that the old Genesis titles literally had a boss fight after every stage. For a game trying to harness past success and design philosophy, such a small ratio of boss fights to stages seems very strange. I know a boss fight for every level is a bit much in today's age, but four still seems a bit anemic. At least they're incredibly epic, for the most part. There *are* three \"rival fights\" where you must battle past rivals in order to grab yourself a chaos emerald. One such rival is Metal Sonic, to give an example, and each of these rival battles are really fun and unique. I thoroughly enjoyed these cool segments. If you count these, then there are technically 7 boss fights, and that feels like a more adequate number.\"Long\" review, I know, but if you're like me, you may feel a bit of trepidation about buying this game. Sonic has let us down so many times, and even though the handheld games were awesome, as well asSonic Colors, the blue hedgehog still has an iffy reputation on console. Well, I can tell you now that, all things considered, this is an amazing game, period. It's an absolute masterpiece of a Sonic title. For years Sonic lost his way, and delivered experiences that felt NOTHING like the quintessential Sonic title. This is a return to the original, simple philosophy that Sonic always stood for: being the fastest thing alive. For that alone, this game deserves the highest recommendation. However, when you combine that with the incredible nostalgic experience this game offers, the outstanding production values and design (both in the visual and audio departments), and the absurd amount of fan service this game has to offer, purchasing this game becomes a no-brainer. Buy it, speed, dash, n' blast through it, and let yourself get lost in this celebratory sub-sonic bubble of retro Sonic glory.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CPK","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Hurts, doesn't it?","reviewText":"As other reviewers have mentioned, playing Killer 7 isn't really like playing your average video game. There are puzzles to solve, but they're spelled out for you. There are areas to explore, but you can only move on a set path. There's a storyline to follow, but you might turn blue before you figure out what it all means. There are seven characters, but actually eight, though most of the time you only play as six. If it weren't for the game's first-person shooter mechanics (which again defy the norm by giving you unlimited ammo), you'd be hard-pressed to call this a video game at all.Killer 7 is an experience. Sometimes bizzare, other times violent, always a tad frustrating. The distinct blend of cel-shaded graphics and anime-styled cutscenes is consistently impressive. Strong voice-acting gives life to all sorts of memorable characters, and the enemies come in all shapes, sizes, and colours. The controls, if very simplified, respond well and work to the game's advantage. Ever get tired of checking every door in an area to find the one that actually leads somewhere? Killer 7 only leads you to the areas you need to visit. Combine this with your character's fixed running speed, and Killer 7 controls your pace. You can't finish this title any faster than it allows you to. It's a fully controlled experience.Where Killer 7 will likely frustrate many gamers is not the simplified controls; if you're old enough to play this title, you've probably played older games like Myst on which Killer 7 draws influence. It's the constant enemy respawning that bogs things down, because they come back after you leave a room. Most have to be killed over and over again as they're directly in your path. Should you die, the process of recovering your character's head is slow and tedious. And eventually the constant character switching, to solve puzzles and kill specific enemies, grows old.Despite these gameplay flaws Killer 7 still manages to suck you into its world. It's a completely fresh experience that's never really been attempted before. There's a lot of profanity, violence and sexual elements going on here, but they serve the experience instead of pandering to the masses. This isnt a game little kids buy to show off to their friends, and even most of the target demographic will probably feel confused. But please give Killer 7 a shot, it's one of the strongest Gamecube/PS2 titles ever created.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2005"}

Stricly for the older crowd and it's good too","reviewText":"The Wii has a horrible reputation for being a \"kiddie system\" and therefore games like Madworld do not exist or belong there, according to the mass media and the occasional PS3/Xbox 360 player. Well forget that BS because this game is good and has plenty of ultra violence to experience and be entertained for gaming sake.Sega took a gamble on publishing Madworld, an ultra violent game where you control the main character through various stages. You must kick, punch, impale and maim all of your enemies in a \"televised program\" where you fight for the right to survive in a post apocalyptic future. The main character goes undercover to find out who is behind the program and that is why he entered the show. You use the nunchuck and remote to perform all of the main character's moves with the occasional shaking of the remote. The graphics are very unique in that it has a comic book art style to it and it's only in shades of black and white. The only time you see color is the blood of the enemies and bosses as you beat them up. You earn points for beating up people and you can use all sorts of objects and environmental traps to add more points in a combo system used by the game.If you grew up to the likes of Double Dragon and Final Fight, then you will feel right at home because this is a straight up beat 'em up game where to complete stages, you earn a bunch of points to get from point A to the section where the boss is. As you progress through the stages, you run into fun mini games where if you beat them and complete the stage you're on, you open them up for the multi-player section to challenge another player to see who can get the highest score.The only bad things I could say about this game is because of the lack of colors, it does seem like the background areas are used over and over again even though you have different themes for each stage. The controls, while not hard to get used to, aren't spot on so you have to do certain gestures more than once for the game to register it. The game camera is in your control but sometimes you will have to fight with it as it becomes erratic and doesn't show you what you need to see. Despite these shortcomings, Madworld is still lots of fun and offers a challenge, especially if you play on the highest difficulty level. This game is not for kids so if you're a parent and you have young children, don't play it in front of them. To everyone else, I recommend this game to rent or as a potential purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000KGD1GO","reviewerName":"Shaun L. Stoffer","summary":"Surprisingly good with a few minor setbacks","reviewText":"Gameplay: A pleasant surprise how creative and innovative this FPS was. Throughout each level you typically command two squadrons such as an assault team and bazooka team where you can assign them to take cover behind different barricades such as wood fences, next to windows, or brick walls. There you can order them to do tasks such as destroy enemy cover, lay down suppressive fire, or flank the enemy. You can choose to either be the sniper or rush in with your squad to quickly shoot down your foes. Healing system is the simple hide behind cover for five seconds and you're healed.-There is a lack of variety of weapons, not even ten. However, you carry one rifle and machine gun, a pistol and up to six grenades at a time. However you recieve 20 magazines for each of your firearms and can come across ammo stashes to replenish your ammunition.-The AI are all fairly intelligent which was a major relief as a huge part of the gameplay is commanding AI.The only problem I had was that sometimes they would run into enemy fire in order to get to a destination instead of going around them, in short they would go the quicker route instead of the safer route.-A few levels you control tanks and the controls for that were fairly simply and smooth. I enjoyed blowing up sandbag bunkers and blowing up enemy tanks.-There are ten levels and therefore this game shouldn't take more than 10 hours to complete, but each level is pretty long and action-packed to compensate.CONS: No melee attack whatsoever. Short campaign. Story and characters aren't particularly intriguing. Grenades are fairly inaccurate and hard to aim. Lack of variety of weapons. 225 achievemant points are for pointless tasks such as playing the game every week for three months or on Sep 17th. Multiplayer achievemants are worth 0 actual points. Graphics and voice audio are below average.Graphics: The games falls far behind the likes of the Call of Duty, Battlefield: Bad Company, and even the Medal of Honor games. The visuals are far from crisp, the texture of enviroments can seem muddled at times, and all the enemy AI look pretty much the same,Audio: Standard at best, often times I couldn't tell the distinguish different voices and had a hard time trying to figure out which squad or character was talking in the heat of battle.Story: Nothing run of the mill about it. Simply a squad of soldiers simply following orders to fight Germans and minimize casualties of alliles and innocents while dealing with their own personal demons and dilemmas. Unfortunately, you are unable to skip a fair amount of the cut scenes and will be forced to follow the plot.Achievemants: A single run through you will probably obtain, with relative ease, around 700 pts and difficulty fortunately does not affect the achievemants. However, 225 of the achievemant points are recieve for doing pointless, hindering tasks such as playing the game on Sep 17th, playing 7 days back-to-back for an entire week, or 100 days in row which is completely stupid and unrealistic.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

The game combines elements from Hollywood action thrillers with the latest in video game technology to deliver a highly original gameplay experience.","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"3.5 Stars. One cop with nothing left to lose","reviewText":"Max Payne was one of the first games I played when I bought my Playstation 2. But I hadn't gotten around to purchasing it till recently. Though while still very good, with other games pushing the PS2's graphical power, the Max Payne is looking a little long in the tooth.Max Payne is a New York detective who's wife and young child are brutally murdured. Three years later, the story is about to come full circle as Payne finally discovers who has shattered his entire world.Max Payne's biggest strength is it's story. The storyline is very compelling and will make you keep wanting to play the game. Full of mobsters, wise guys, low-lifes, and all around scum bags, the developers are Remedy and Rockstar Games have painted a very dark and gritty picture of the New York underworld. If Max Payne were made into a movie, I'm thinking it could very easily make the transition from game to screen. The cutscenes however leave something to be desired. They consist of comic book style frames with voice overs. But the story does manage to make it's way through them.Although while still good, Max Payne's graphics are somewhat subpar when you compare them to other games that have been released in the past few years. The character models are somewhat primitive by today's standards. Where as a game like the Getaway has more photo-realistic renderings, Max Payne's are almost stick figure like. What Max Payne'graphics do very well, however, is portray New York City extremely accurately. Everything from the graffitti on the walls to the subway stations has a very \"New York feel\" to it. The framerate, however, suffers from considerable slowdown. Often time it slows to a crawl. The sounds are very good. Guns have loud \"Bangs\" and you hear bullet casings hit the ground. The games music is very ominous sounding, giving you a chilling foreshadowing of things to come.Max Payne's controlls are a little difficult to grasp at first. The targeting reticule consists of a white \"dot\" in the center of the screen, and you aim by moving the right analog stick. It's a bit tricky and takes some getting used to. One of the game's standout features is Bullet Time. Max can slow down time around him and execute Matrix-like moves. Max Payne restores his health by rummaging in medicine cabinets and closets for painkillers. A bit of a unique change from the standard med-packs and meal rations.Overall Max Payne is a good game. The only thing really \"wrong\" is it looks a little dated. Otherwise it's well worth the new Greatest Hits price (even if it's just to pad your game library) and definitley worth the discounted $9.99 PC game price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2004"}

Basically a slow motion system that allows a pseudo-matrix style game play for a few brief seconds.  Apparently, they thought that such a gimmick could sell a game.  Unfortunately, thousands of people fell for it.  The only real revolutionary aspects of this game are the new heights of tedium that this game induces.This game starts off with a story consisting of a comic page animation (e.g. mostly still, cheaply made) with what apparently was an English major desperately trying to use big words and a raspy voice in order to sound sophisticated, deep, and dark.  This fails miserably and the darn thing never stops.  Then there is the game.  You can only save at the start of sub-levels, which automatically brings it down two notches.The game basically is a sequence where you turn a corner, wait for the slow bad guy, shoot, try to open a door, then try another, enter, wait, shoot, and on and on until you hit a save point.  That's it.  The first level is fine, but the second level gets you.  The controls are clunky and shooting is jerky and unresponsive.  Bullet damage is seemingly random.  Sometimes, you shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun, and he's barely touched.  You shoot a guy fifty feet away with a handgun, and he might go down for no reason.The first level is almost fun, since you might die to the randomness, but you'll have to repeat the killing of one or two guys again.  The second level, you sometimes have to face up to 15 guys.  It's no fun when the 15th guy, at 100 feet away and out of sight, shoots you in with a handgun and destroys all your health.  And it takes forever to return the same place beforehand.  The producers apparently couldn't differentiate between needless waiting and stealth.  By the middle of the game, I was so frustrated by the repeating, waiting, random deaths; I just turned it off and sold the game immediately.  I have never gone that far in a game and not finished it.  Just totally frustrating.The best way to describe this game is like the non-car missions of Grand Theft Auto, without the fun.  I know why this is called Max Payne now.  It hurts.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2003"}

While only composed of two games thus far, the Max Payne series offers some of the most innovative gameplay of all time.  It's in the original Max Payne that the concept Bullet Time was first introduced.  Allowing the player to put his surroundings in slow motion and pump the enemy full of lead made the game worth playing all on its own.  The fact that Max Payne is one of the best games ever constructed for the PS2 seems a mere afterthought.  Here we have a story centering on a detective looking for his family's killers in the New York City underground in the dead of winter.  Now that's cool.  Max Payne himself is a revolutionary character; your grade A badass with a take-no-prisoners mentality.  Max looks a little like Mel Gibson, and acts a little like Charles Manson.  He doesn't care, he swears, he breaks the law he has defended for years; he's a rebel without a cause.  The plot of the game is awesome, told to the player through the use of a graphic novel, pieced together by Payne just as if Batman is were on the case.  Max Payne is trule a must for any PS2 owner, a game which breaks new boundraries in video gaming, much like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto franchise.  With the first installment being that damn good, surely Max Payne 2 would match if not exceed its predecessor, right?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2005"}

Yet with the release date oh so far away, I decided to take advantage of the recent price drop of the Call of Duty PC game hoping that it would tide me over.  However, after playing countless hours of the game on my PC, I'd have to say that Call of Duty: Finest Hour is a bit of a disappointment.  I understand that a console has nowhere near the processing power of a PC, yet I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by FH's graphics which were simple and bland at best.

That meant after spending ten minutes or so blasting your way through a difficult level, you would have to start the campaign all over again from start to finish if your player is killed.  I always appreciate a challenge, yet not when the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against me.  The one aspect that the console version did translate well was the \"war is hell\" theme.  The beginning level featuring you as a Russian soldier taking back Stalingrad from the \"steeking Germans\" was intense with gunfire raining all around you and enemy soldiers around every corner.  The death animations are overly exaggerated which made in difficult to distinguish whether or not an enemy was either wounded or dead only to have them shoot you in the back.  I played this game for only an hour before I filed it away with my other games.  I imagine that I will someday go back, but in the meantime, I'm having too much fun with the PC version.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Would you kindly play this game?","reviewText":"How's this for a story? A man becomes annoyed with the current world, a world where the great are taken for granted and told that their toils are either for the people, for God or for the government. In response, he creates a fantastic environment, free from all of these turmoils. A place where all the great men and women of the world can create their own inventions without fear of consequence. In this place, men and women could do what they wanted.If this sounds like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, you'd be correct. However, in this particular case, it's also the background story behind Rapture, the under-water city that takes centerplace in Bioshock. Many words have been bandied about about video games and their ability (or inability) to become art; you have folks like Roger Ebert saying the medium as a whole can never attain that goal. My personal thought on this matter was that, as a medium, games haven't made enough strides toward that lofty goal. But Bioshock certainly takes a huge step forward.Andrew Ryan is a visionary the likes of which his namesake Ayn Rand would possibly write about in Atlas Shrugged. He exemplifies the qualities of a Randian hero and showcases Rand's philosophy of objectivism. He created the city of Rapture and filled it, much like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, with the visionaries of his land. Rapture soon was a thriving city that emphasized science and growth and the importance of the individual. They dabbled in creating plasmids that changed a person's DNA, enabling them to do feats the likes of which had never been seen before.Then something happened.Flying over the Atlantic sea, you are Jack, a person who was destined for greatness, if you ask his parents, and whose plane is now crashing into the sea. Jack is apparently the only survivor of the plane wreck and swims to a lone building, a light house it seems, that beckons him onward. Eventually, he goes into a blathysphere and enters into the world of Rapture. But this isn't the Rapture originally envisioned in the pre-recorded film he watches as he journeys into the city. It is a city comprised of deadly machines, once-human monstrosities named Splicers who are insane and, of course, the Big Daddies and Little Sisters.Bioshock concerns itself with the gray area between right and wrong. This dichotomy between right and wrong is what fuels everything in Rapture. Roaming the landscape, the Little Sisters are twisted abominations of little girls who locate corpses (which they call \"Angels\") and harvest Adam from them with a long needle. More grotesque is that bottle at the other end of the needle that the Little Sisters drink from. Dutifully following them are the Big Daddies, giant brutes in ancient diving gear. These...things...are at the heart of the story and Jack's survival depends on them and whether he can harvest the Little Sisters or set them free.The conscience of the gamer is represented in two mysterious figures, Atlas (another allusion to Rand) and Dr. Tenenbaum. Atlas seemingly wants Jack to save his family and explains that the Little Sisters are anything but the human girls they appear. He nudges Jack to put them out of their misery and take the Adam they harvest so he can survive and save Atlas and his family. On the other shoulder perches Tenenbaum, another mysterious individual who created the Little Sisters and seems to want to do anything possible to save them. They are the obvious angel and devil sitting on Jack's shoulder, but the question is...which one is the angel?To go into further detail would be to spoil this amazing story. Along the route, twists and turns abound with moral, ethical and philosophical questions aplenty. What's interesting is the way Bioshock presents a stark opposition to Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. Rand's heroes always contain the same qualities that Andrew Ryan exemplifies. But here, the artists behind Bioshock seem to be questioning these qualities by presenting a situation so familiar to Atlas Shrugged, and yet, so far removed.It is literate, thoughtful, disturbing and moving. Even if the gameplay didn't live up to the story, Bioshock would be worthy just for this reason.Luckily, that's not the case. For the gun hungry, sure, Rapture is filled with guns aplenty and even presents opportunities for you to craft your own upgrades. But that is just scratching the surface. Everything goes back to the story. Plasmids are located across the ruined debris of Rapture and contain the keys to recreating your DNA. Some early examples of Plasmids are the ability to shoot electricity from your hands to being able to set things on fire to telekinesis.But these plasmids aren't only used for fighting. Minor puzzle-solving crops up, some of which require plasmids in the same way as gear in Legend of Zelda. The biggest puzzle is how to take down the game's variety of enemies. While you can definitely charge in, guns blazing and sometimes survive, cases will present themselves where such tactics will end with you on the bad end of the Big Daddies' drill. Instead, you can create your own traps and war zones. Using plasmids, the environment and, of course, your weapons, you can create elaborate traps that will bring a smile to your face.A lot of games coming out right now that use the Unreal 3 engine don't look as spectacular as they could. In particular, character models tend to look shiny and/or completely ugly. This is not the case with Bioshock. Everything comes together, from the disturbing scenery, the art deco architecture to the the insane creatures and characters populating the world.  Shadows and lighting also create a sense of atmosphere that drips heavily, much like the water pouring down the walls. It's stunning. The only complaint (and it is minor) is that the frozen portions you can melt don't look very convincing. When things melt, they don't leave anything behind. The only reason it sticks out is that the rest of the game is absolutely beautiful and amazingly crafted.None of this would be as effective, though, without superior sound. And Bioshock has that (mostly) in spades. The voice work is stunning throughout and the actors provide a great sense of dread. The audio diaries do an exemplary job of providing the backstory, but also work the best in crafting dread and terror. Some of the most disturbing things occur listening to them. Unfortunately, sometimes the characters' lines are repeated too often, ruining the disturbing nature of their dialogue.  Musically, the game is also amazing. It flits into the picture at key moments, increasing the tension before it will flow away. You might not even notice it's there, but that's why it's so good.You know, the funny thing about hype is how people react to it. Game journalists can go blue in the face trying to get people interested in forgotten gems such as Psychonauts, Beyond Good & Evil and Stranger's Wrath, and since they weren't financially successful they become these gems. When a game sells incredibly well and is hyped to the max (both of which fit Bioshock), people say \"over-rated.\"Ignore the hype machine. I know you're tired of hearing about it. But give Bioshock a try, if you haven't yet. Download the demo for your PC or try it on the Playstation 3 Network. It is a game that's definitely worth everything that's been said about it and more.It is art. And no words by ignorant movie critics will change that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2008"}

There are several areas ranging from the opening beachfront to a dilapidated city to sewers and excellently rendered jungle, all populated by the undead who have various levels of speed, strength and awareness. Every zombie form is catered for including the required slow trudging zombies to the speedy ankle-biters of 28 Days Later. Unfortunately the initial fear factor of these enemies is diluted once you realize that they re-spawn pretty much within seconds of you leaving their vicinity. Once this 'dawns' (apologies) on you, you no longer bother to vanquish them as skipping past them with your limited sprint saves so much time.Quests vary but offer little to entertain and I began to hate even obtaining quests from NPCs due to the utter ridiculousness of the voice acting and character movement. It was like each actor was auditioning for a movie part with each one trying for the most dramatic pause-filled stretching out of... each... word... Thankfully each Shatneresque sentence can be skipped but boy what a chore to listen to.As this game is predominantly melee based combat you have to get up close and personal and I'm afraid to say this is one of the biggest fails in the game. Your character swings wildly with no blocking or skill set. And registration of contact is very spotty with your arm and weapon often just magically passing through your enemies without impact. So you just mash the right trigger and hope the correct swing is chosen and it makes a hit. Weapons deteriorate at an alarming rate even when you're much later in the game when they've been upgraded. Non-dead enemies posses super-human resilience to attacks by mallets and cleavers and some zombies take literally minutes to kill. Fortunately, or rather unfortunately, the devs balanced the ridiculously tedious lengths it takes to kill zombies by having your character fairly impossible to kill. Oh you die in the game but it doesn't end - you simply respawn nearby to continue the fight. There's no real threat or challenge when facing any zombie and you could almost certainly play the entire game without actually killing any of them.Missions dart from fairly interesting ones such as restarting the power in a gas station to the inevitable escort missions where being able to navigate an area is not dependent on your skills at playing the game, but dependent on the AI of the character you're trying to protect. The AI of course utterly sucks and will happily wander into a molotov cocktail that you just threw on the ground simply because they're following a set movement script. Oh if they die the game ends and you go back to a previous checkpoint. Sweet.Leveling up has zero bearing on the game. I want to reiterate that - leveling up does not impact how quickly you can dispatch enemies. As you level up so do they, from the meekest of old ladies to the giants in straight jackets. At level two they can kill you with three or four hits just as they can at level thirty so as you progress you never feel like you're ahead of the game and aside from four main zombie types (guy in straight jacket, lumbering fool, bloater and bald guy with no hands) every enemy you face is the same in terms of difficulty.I do have to mention the audio - it's stunning with the growls and rumbles from the undead casting just the right amount of discomfort. Sadly it's wasted on poor design choices that the developers made. I must also mention that this is a co-op game but if you play it through solo then the cut scenes make no sense at all.Overall I initially enjoyed Dead Island for being a camp yet often scary game. Once, however, you appreciate the vast under-developed AI and repetitive gameplay boredom takes hold and you realize that the game will never manage to offer the experience that it could and should.Bargain bucket or rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"V. Berk","summary":"A Exciting Sci-Fi Adventure!","reviewText":"Perfect Dark is hard to review because in many ways it is the same as Rare's previous shooter, GoldenEye 007, but in other ways it is so much better.  In short, Perfect Dark is the perfect, non-official, sequel to GoldenEye 007.  Sure, the settings are different, and there are some different weapons (after all this IS a science fiction based game), but overall you can still see the loving touches the developers brought back from GoldenEye.The game is set in a well developed science fiction environment and many of the levels provide difficulties that are handled by the new features added to the character's options.  The wide range of weapons is one of the major improvements over its predecessor, GoldenEye, as well as the unique plot (after all, this one isn't based on a movie).  So the plot is an interesting one involving alien invasions and government conspiracy and does keep the gamer interested throughout its run, but without a doubt my favorite feature of this game that I found lacking in GoldenEye 007 is the actual use of voice actors.  Joanna Dark and all the other characters in this film have a voice we can link to their image, while with GoldenEye we'd have to go back to the film to recall the voices of our characters.Of course, the major improvement over GoldenEye 007 is the multiplayer feature which is fun, and do to a wider range of weapons the gamer is allowed to execute new strategies, so overall Perfect Dark really is an expansion of GoldenEye 007 as well as being a great gaming experience by itself.This is a game that is great to play back-to-back with GoldenEye 007, because you should probably learn the controls from GoldenEye before you play this game because it makes it a lot simpler (but I suppose you could play this before you play GoldenEye, but I'm someone who likes to play/view in chronological order).So if you enjoyed GoldenEye 007 (as so many other people have over the years) you should certainly dust off the Nintendo 64 and come back to this perfectly worthy successor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Maintains \"zombie nostalgia\" other games in the genre have lost over time","reviewText":"Valve has gradually made me a fan of first person shooters. Half Life 2 though frustrating was a very fun game and Portal was an ingenious concept which made a non violent shooter addicting to play.Needless to say if you belong to the camp of people who believe Resident Evil has lost its' roots or that you want a bit of urgency, thrills, and horror in your FPS, Left 4 Dead is the answer for you!To be honest Left 4 dead has a simple premise. You are 4 survivors amidst an epidemic that has given humans rabies turning them into violent psychopaths. Your sole goal is to leave the town anyway possible.As the 4 survivors go about their tasks they talk to each other, crack jokes, make comments on what they see, and shout \"reload!\" when they have to reach for more ammo. All the characters are likable but my favorite is likely Bill, the gruff war veteran who was in Vietnam.The controls are very simple. Right trigger fires, left trigger is your melee, and you switch between weapons, pain killers, and med kits with the D-pad. After you select an item right trigger will use that item on you while left trigger will use it on one of your friends. Pressing up turns your flash light on and off. As someone that has had problems with the controls of certain fps games I can say valve made everything stream lined and easy to learn, a good thing when the zombie hordes are running at you with their blood curdling screams.While left 4 dead does not have a stellar story it is different each time you play it. Zombies will usually spawn in different locations each time you play and the 4 survivors come off as so real and genuine as people there really doesn't need to be a better reason to motivate them other than surviving and getting the heck out of dodge.The only truly unrealistic factor in left 4 dead is that weapons and ammo are found on tables everywhere, especially at the beginning and end of check points. However a \"zombie infection\" is not truly realistic either and the point is to be sure everyone is having a good time.In addition to normal zombies that can leap fences, run at you with psychotic rage and gnaw and claw at your face there are \"mutant zombies\" which are more formable. The obese boomers vomit bile that blinds you and attracts other infected. \"Witches\" are pitiful creatures that sob in the dark and don't immediately attack unless you make loud noises or shine your flash light at them. If you annoy them they will make use of their long ferial claws and they are extremely difficult to put down. Trust me, it is better to tip toe around them. Hunters can scale walls effortlessly and fall atop you while smokers will use their long tongues to grab you or blind you with a natural type of tear gas they omit from their pores. In addition there are \"tanks\" giant atrocities that excel at mauling and chucking heavy objects. As with the other zombies these abominations do not always attack in the same place so you feel as if you always have to be alert.The area environments are fun and easy to navigate. Poor Gordon Friedman had to run on narrow beams and along the side of cliffs. Luckily there are no tiny walk ways elevated hundreds of feet in the air within Left 4 dead. Enemies can however push you through windows if they time their sneak attacks just right.Some may argue if left 4 dead is a true survival horror game. In my opinion it is based on the fact you are normal people instead of elite mercenaries + there are zombies everywhere. While I love me some RE 4 and RE 5 they have strayed far away from their survival horror roots. Left 4 dead captures the nostalgia of the older RE games minus the crappy camera angles and broken controls.As you can expect there is the single player campaign, multi player co-op online and offline, versus, and survival mode. In Versus mode one team gets to be the infected. I heard they recently added a \"fatigue meter\" to the survivors so they cannot simply melee attack everything to death. Whether or not this makes the game more fun and more balanced is hard to say. \"Survival mode\" is self explanatory and very much akin to mercenaries mode in RE 5 or Horde mode in Gears of war 2.(Aka you get swarmed by enemies and you try your best to hold out as long as you can.) I will comment that the AI is smart and tactical. Your \"buddies\" will be helpful to you and rarely a hindrance even when not controlled by other players. While I did not personally have a beef with RE 5's AI I do admit it is far better in Left 4 dead.It's amazing how good valve struck a chord to honor a true \"zombie apocalypse\" theme. The game is reminiscent of 28 days later or Romero's \"Dead\" movies in that it makes you feel as if you are the characters on film. Though critics may argue the story is sparse and vague I honestly believe a convoluted over complicated back story would drag the game down and bitter the flavor in this particular case.Being Left 4 dead has dropped in price the only advice I can tell you is get it now! You will not regret it!Pros+Easy to learn controls+ 4 survivors carry on like real people. Each of them are likable and it is easy to sympathize with their struggle.+The environments are fun to explore as opposed to being a bit frustrating like they sometimes were in Half Life 2.+ Zombies spawn in unique locations each play through so the \"surprise\" never tapers off while playing.+ Nice co-op and versus modes online and offline.+Befitting music and sound effects that are spooky and keep you in a cold sweat.Cons-Vague story line with not many (if any) cuts-scenes. Personally I did not mind this but other players might.-Unproven if the \"fatigue meter\" added in versus mode balances the game or rather makes it a suck-fest to play as the survivors.- No true main antagonists. I do not consider the \"mutant zombies\" true bosses however in this case it's not that big of a deal there are none. Predictable boss fights at the end of each scenario might remind players they are playing a game thus waking them from Left 4 Dead's haunting spell. Once again I think it is a good thing there are no predictable boss fights though other players may once again disagree with me here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2009"}

Unfortunately for Vader, you aren't quite as perfect as he had hoped. You still have feelings and memories which interfere with his direct commands. You are still in love with Juno - and Vader is furious with you for your failings.The graphics are lovely. You're a dual-wielding saber dude who can bash everything within sight. You gain points as you destroy objects, and unlock challenges. You fight stormtroopers and robots of all shapes and sizes. The stirring Star Wars music is everywhere.The game is quite forgiving. When you die you usually start very close to where you left off. So you are encouraged to just plow ahead and tackle enemies. And the game supports that. You're starting out as a well trained soldier, not as a newbie. So right from the beginning you take on enemies with power and skill.There are tweaks that you can do to your lightsaber, like adding gems to give them color changes and bonusses. But on the other hand you're stuck with your one character. He is the way he is. He can't have dark skin, or be female, or anything else. In our modern world that's quite bizarre. Why can't you use a character that connects with you?These are all minor issues compared with the one massive failing of this game, though. It is incredibly short. You could pick it up on a Friday after work, expect to sit down to a long weekend of game playing fun. And then you're barely through your third slice of pizza and THE GAME ENDS. Sure you might expect four hour gameplay if it was a cheap download that you got to pass the time until you headed out to a movie. But for a full price game? A game with this history? It makes absolutely no sense at all.Sure you can replay it on a harder level. Sure you can do some of the challenges. But when you get a game like this you expect a fairly long, epic-style story with character development, plot twists, and intrigue.Finally, we have had the game crash on us at the hardest level.Worth renting, but not worth buying.Rating: 3/5","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2012"}

Denick","summary":"Campaign Review: An adrenaline rush like none other","reviewText":"PREFACE: I'm an \"old school\" gamer in my 30s, who plays games only for their campaigns. Multiplayer looks like fun, but I simply don't have the time to get into it, given my job, obligations, and other interests. All of my reviews are based SOLEY on campaigns, and they are simply my own opinions. I typically enjoy games that can be completed in an afternoon or evening, due to my schedule, and the fact that I grew up with games like \"Bonk's Adventure\" and \"Contra\". Nowadays, I like shorties like \"Journey\" and \"Limbo\". If you can live with this, please read on!Wow... just wow. Activision did what seemed like it may very well be impossible, and delivered their most exciting campaign yet, besting even MW2 and Black Ops. The intensity of this game, and its breakneck pacing, simply cannot be adequately described in words. By the time the final credits rolled, I was actually sweating and shaking a little bit- I felt like I had been in the heat of the battle! Time to debrief with a couple of cold beers!Unlike most of the COD games, they don't ease you into this one with a nice, slow tutorial. In a stroke of genius, you hit the ground running in this game, and experience an intelligent \"on the run\" tutorial that works much better than the previous installments (while NYC is blown to pieces all around you, by the way). From that moment on, it's one mind-blowing level after another (submarine takes the cake), offering variety, visual splendor, and the most excitement I've ever experienced in a game.The campaign is nice and short- about five hours, which is more than enough for me, particularly considering that it's five hours of straight action, as opposed to any backtracking or filler. There is not one wasted moment in this campaign, and I liked it so much, I played through it a second time within days. I know a lot of people complain about the linearity and the \"roller coaster\" effect, but like a lot of other gamers, I love that! I like roller coasters, and to me, games are like interactive books or movies. I want to enjoy a ride that has been lovingly crafted, from start to finish. For those of us who grew up playing the original \"Doom\", MW3 is a remarkable testament to how far the FPS genre has come in immersing the player.If you're looking for a game that puts you into that \"action movie experience\", it would be hard to do better than MW3, in my humble opinion. \"We're Oscar Mike!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B006ZPAXYW","description":"","reviewerName":"Nakkiel","summary":"You can tell FunCom made this","reviewText":"Edit: Removing a star because not only did they actually find a way to increase how often the game crashes (It crashes every 3 hours or so now instead of a couple times a day) but the people at end game are really stupid. They expect you to have significantly better gear than can possibly drop in the instance you are running, meaning you would have no reason to run that instance in the first place. While I realize Funcom has no control over this and it has been an MMO trend in the past couple years, there is no real \"progression\" content in this game. It isn't just like you can join a guild and wait for new content to come out. The Nightmare modes are it... and people expect you to have the best gear available in game, which comes from badges you get from running those same instances over and over, to run them in the first place. It makes no sense, but that is MMOs for you.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: I received an e-mail from FunCom today stating that The Secret World is now free to play. (with initial game purchase) As I stated in my initial review, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth the 1 time purchase.I am adding a star for now and will be giving it it's 5th star later if I find they have fixed the glitches. I bought it directly on their website if you are wondering why I'm not showing as an Amazon purchase. I do not recommend doing that because their credit card verification seems painfully slow and you can't play until it is verified.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok... first of all I am playing the 5 day trial and recommend you do the same before purchasing this. I gave it 3 stars, but it is more like 5 stars in some aspects 1 star in others. When you start out it gives you weapon choices. It allows you to test them, but since it only lets you use the basic abilities for that weapon you don't get any idea how the gameplay works for each weapon tree. Unfortunately it is important, because there is no \"respec\" but rather as you level you get more and more points, so whichever you choose is what your stuck with unless you want to waste a lot of points changing weapon tree. I recommend you spend an hour or so looking at \"decks\" (Which are premade ability combos for later in the game) and abilities in each weapon type as well.There is a lot to like about this game. Interesting gameplay, flexible skill combinations, lots control over how you play, etc. It starts out a bit boring, but the more you level the more fun it gets.The main problem with this game is the overwhelming amount of glitches. It is common for a group member to just not be able to get into the same instance version as you. There is no way to fix that since there is no instance reset option, it is supposed to be automatic but doesn't work correctly. Not even disbanding and reforming will fix it... there is just no way to run the instance when it glitches unless you want to 4-man it.  After a few hours of solo questing (After a frustrating group disband) the problem just seems to go away on its own.It is common for a quest to glitch out in one of a couple different ways and be impossible to complete. Sometimes you don't get quest credit when you complete something but the item still is no longer clickable as though it was complete... so you just cant get to the next step. Sometimes an item just isn't respawning. Etc. No way to abandon a quest and even picking up a new one only pauses that one... so you just sort of have to hope that fixes itself later and come back to it.Aside from glitches the game only lets you pick up one \"main\" quest (stories and whatnot) and three \"side\" quests. (Mainly random items you find.) The problem with this is you will often have to run back and forth across the entire zone for one quest then have to do it again and again for each individual quest since you can't do them all at once. Also the side quests are usually found in random places in the middle of nowhere, so if you \"pause\" one to pick up another you need to find that old quest to do it. (Paused quests don't stay in journal.)As for quest content, most are fairly fun, but others are literally impossible to do without looking stuff up in a search engine. (A real search engine, that isn't just an in game thing.) You are supposed to look up stuff from all kinds of places and solve puzzles based on info you find (The Bible, information on painters, random historical figures, etc.) Honestly its easier to just look up the solution. And some you can't even look up, you just have to know random things or directly look up the answer. Do you know morse code? Because for one quest you have to translate beeps in an audio recording in order to find the coordinates you need to go to. There are also some quest areas that I swear are there to troll you. For example there are moth creatures that call every single moth in the area to swarm you, which is just impossible to defeat, so you basically have to corpse crawl your way through a forest of these things.Finally graphics. i don't really know what to say about them, they are just very varied. Some things look amazing and have ultra realistic detail while other things look like automated level design or just really poorly done with that molded plastic look.The fact is if this were a one time purchase I would say it is worth the full new game price. But it is a subscription pay MMO... which costs a lot in the long run. I don't know what \"end game\" is like. (By the way your level is determined by gear which you need enough skill points in that piece to wear, so end game would be highest level gear.) But honestly with all the odd glitches I can't say this is worth a subscription. In a 5 day trial I also climbed through 5 gear levels and there are only 10. (Although there are 10.2, 10.4, etc after that.) And cleared 3/8 instances in the game as well as acquired all the damage/healing role skills I will ever actually need. So honestly other than playing around with new builds and collecting skills you don't really need I can't see there being much to do once you clear everything on \"elite\" mode. So in closing I would love to buy this game if there were not a subscription or it was significantly lower, but I just can't justify paying $30-50 to activate the game then paying $144-180 a year to play it...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"CallMeZoidberg","summary":"How do you improve on one of the PS3's best titles in every way? Like this.","reviewText":"The folks - well, geniuses, really - over at Naughty Dog have done it again. Given that Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is easily one of my favorite games of this console generation; my expectations were unreasonably high for its sequel, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Then something unbelievable happened. Uncharted 2 was released and actually managed to surpass my unreasonable expectations, which doesn't even make sense! That's right; Naughty Dog got it right again, surpassing the stellar original title in every way.Uncharted 2 sets the tone early with the opening cinematic; our loveable antihero Nathan Drake awakes in a pool of his own blood on a train in a snowy mountain range, immediately realizing that very train is treacherously hanging off of a cliff, as assorted pieces of train begin falling towards him, knocking him out the back - now the bottom of the vertically hanging train, as he begins his climb back up before the train drops into oblivion.The game rivals summer blockbusters in terms of storytelling, yet has a level of immersion the film medium can't ever hope to attain. In fact, Uncharted 2 is much better than a summer blockbuster, as it also does well to focus on character development and dynamic relationships amidst the compelling adventure tale rife with betrayal and jaw-dropping moments. The story is something best left unspoiled. All that needs to be said is that it's one of the best I've ever experienced and I couldn't help from asking myself the completely blasphemous question \"Is this better than Indiana Jones?\"One of the reasons for the compelling narrative lies in the excellent performance by the voice actors, particularly a brilliantly nuanced, spot-on performance by Nolan North as Drake. But one of the most important things to selling the character's performances lies in the technology. Naughty Dog still has the best animations around, bar none. Yet, somehow, they've managed to up the ante with Uncharted 2. Such subtleties like muscle twitches and facial expressions exemplify Naughty Dog's attention to detail, but also add to the believability of the characters, furthering the narrative.Technology is definitely another of the many aspects Uncharted 2 prevails in. Graphically, this is arguably the best looking game ever made, and at least the best console game ever made. Lighting is just as beautiful in the sequel as in the original, but now it's even more subtle, yet at the same time more realistic in regards to how it interacts with the environment and casts shadows. The game is so finely detailed, it's almost impossible to say a negative thing about the graphics. Clothing, individually moving hair, the swaying ring-necklace on Drake's neck, snow, lush jungle life, water - it's overwhelming how beautiful the game looks, and it's even more impressive the beauty holds up in motion. Equally impressive is the slight blurring when aiming and looking, providing an excellent sense of depth. Not to mention the scope of the game when you arrive at a high vantage point and just stare out into the world - it's just as beautiful and finely detailed way out of the realm of gameplay. To top it all off, I use the word \"beautiful\" to describe the game because it isn't merely photorealistic, but it is vibrant and so full of life, with an excellent range of colors. There literally isn't a moment in the game where whatever is on screen isn't impressive.Adding to that atmosphere and sense of life is the epic orchestral score, which is once more, somehow even better than the first. One of the reasons for that is how seamlessly it's blended into the game, while managing to stand out more than in the first. It accompanies the action and gameplay perfectly and even adds to it as the score amps up the tension perfectly during exciting moments, without getting drowned out in a hail of gunfire and explosions.Yet, none of those perfectly executed aspects mean anything if the gameplay isn't up to snuff. Thankfully for us, Naughty Dog didn't miss a beat here either. The game plays similar to the first, with third-person/run-and-gun/cover-based gameplay, but it's tightened up overall. Grenades are much easier to manage being mapped to the L2 button and not requiring the use of Sixaxis controls, and guns - including some great new ones - work better than ever. Hand-to-hand combat has also been overhauled, feeling much more visceral, much akin to common street fighting, and providing a wide variety of attack animations. Uncharted 2 also provides a stealth option this time around, though it can't be used throughout the whole game. Still, while the one section that required complete stealth caught me a bit offgaurd, the option works out well, just adding to variety in the gameplay, and it also proved a prudent tactic in eliminating several opponents before proceeding to open fire on the rest of them.Platforming, of course, is still a key element to the game, and it's well-paced throughout and very solid. It feels even more precise this time around, as traversing environments is loads of fun - and there are plenty of environments to traverse, as Naughty Dog takes you to a variety of distinct locales, from snowy mountains to ancient temples to lush jungles to a decaying urban city.One of the reasons these two gameplay elements manage to surpass the first is simple, and it's Naughty Dog's uncanny ability to blend gameplay elements with a dynamic, cinematic experiences. The game is so active and full of life, it's even enthralling to watch, because it really is like watching a movie. Events typically relegated to cutscenes in most games are put under your control in Uncharted 2, leading to a ridiculous amount of insanely invigorating experiences, as well as exciting set pieces. Whether you're controlling Drake and shooting foes while moving around - incredibly realistically, thanks to excellent physics - in a building that's crumbling to the ground or running away from a speeding truck while blind firing, Uncharted 2 is nothing short of enthralling. In fact, there's one segment that takes place as Drake heads to the front of a train from the back car that is by itself more impressive than most video games are in their entirety.And if all of that wasn't enough - and rest assured, it's more than enough - Naughty Dog also took it upon themselves to add in a stellar multiplayer component. Not only that, but it's one of the most fun multiplayer experiences out there, featuring both competitive and cooperative modes. The competitive modes feature your typical fare; modes such as team deathmatch, elimination, capture the treasure, and more. There is also a ranking system which allows you to purchase perks and upgrade your character with the money you get from games. For co-op, there is a survival mode that pits you and your friends against swarms and swarms of enemies that require dispatching, as well as cooperative modes, which lifts scenes from the main game, supplies you with a unique scenario or goal, and lets you have at it, while sending enemies at you from every angle. Both modes are loads of fun and require plenty of strategy.The reason they're so fun is that the multiplayer plays just as good as the main game - which in this case, of course, is amazing. The elements of verticality and platforming are just as prominent in multiplayer as singleplayer, which forms maps through excellent redesigns of singleplayer locales. Aside from leaving intact what makes the gameplay so fun, it provides a fresh, unique experience not common in online multiplayer today. You can play multiplayer just as you played singleplayer, which includes stealthily dropping down from above and snapping some necks, if you'd like. The multiplayer is so brilliantly entwined with the singleplayer elements that it feels like one cohesive package.Uncharted 2 is an experience - and one that needs to be experienced not only by gamers, but by non-gamers as well. The game is closer to perfect than anything I've ever encountered in every single aspect of the game. Naughty Dog hit the ball out of the park with the first title, yet somehow managed to smash through the stadium lights and send the ball into orbit with this one. If you hear people proclaiming this game to literally be the greatest ever made, they're not being hyperbolic. Unprecedented technological mastery, a terrific story and characters, an outstanding musical score, phenomenal gameplay, outstanding multiplayer - I'm running out of positively connotative adjectives. The game is that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

And if you were really good, you know how great it felt to be in the Top Ten with your initials for everyone to see.Fast forward to 2010.I can SO see myself playing this on an arcade platform.For one, this game is strictly SINGLE PLAYER. No Co-op. No Multiplayer. Just you and your skills versus enough robots to populate the city of Detroit.Secondly, although the ultimate goal is completing the game, the second goal is a classic: Get a high score! After all, there has to be some way to measure your skill as a player.Now, considering there are a lot of bullets flying around in this game, I find it only appropriate to break down the PROS and CONS into . . . you guessed it . . . bullets!PROS:--Solid gameplay. If you've played the demo, that is enough of an experience to prepare you for the full game, at least as far as controls are concerned.--Cut-Scenes. At first I was like, \"Hey, quit SHOWING me the action when I should be out DOING it!\", BUT then I realized two things. One, the cut-scenes are really amazing. Like watching a high production SF film. Finally, the cut-scenes provide about the only \"breathing time\" you get. The rest of the game is spent with your heartbeat going through the roof as you hope you can take down that last handful of enemies before your suit runs out of juice.--Spiffy animations. Seeing your assault rifle turn into a rocket launcher is awesome. Seeing robots dance is even more awesome. Seeing THE UNKNOWN move around and skewer you as it morphs and moves like a Transformer--unfortunate but more awesome still.--Hard, but not too hard. If you camp out and try shooting something apart piece by piece--I hope you have patience. But usually if you're more daring you get the reward of a shorter fight.--Jaw-dropping set pieces. If it's big and bulky, it's coming right at you!!!--Great one-liners!--Possibly the best Credits screen I've ever seen in a video game.--A hint of a SEQUEL at the end?!?!CONS:--Although the whole game can be described as one never-ending firefight, the presence of sandbags and barriers is always a cue that one better get ready for some action. This was a problem with MASS EFFECT 2. For once I'd like to see battlefields that aren't so obvious.--Let's just say that Burns gets what he deserves for all his cussing.This was an impulse buy for me after spending 100 hours with JUST CAUSE 2 (another great game, btw), but unlike some impulse buys, this one was actually worth it. If you thought the demo was ok (like I did) I think you'll find the game to be much more interesting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00F6YD2AK","description":"","reviewerName":"hammodi","summary":"Praise the Sun! Once again.","reviewText":"*****No Spoilers. I don't like them. Nobody likes them****** ****** I will update this thread whenever possible******The original Dark Souls was my favorite have I've played over the years in my life. the feel to it was great and it was a unique game. now that Dark Souls II was about to come out. I couldn't let my self to let the chance of playing the sequel of my favorite game go away. I preordred it on Sept. 2013. I was so excited for the game itself And I couldn't wait. I got the game today morning. And I played it for few hours and here is what do I have to say- The game itself has a very different start from its prequel. although similar in the general goal of the game. I don't have a review for the story. because it would be considered a spoiler.****************** TO SEE UPDATES. SCROLL DOWN TO THE BOTTOM ****************************************Black Armor Edition and Collector edition content . PS3******Will download through a code included*********-Early access to some weapons and shields. nothing that useful. they're only good for the first 4 Bosses. you will find better weapons after.-My favorite. Dark Souls II dynamic theme. this is on the PS3. I don't know anything about the X360.-Soundtrack CD. nothing groundbreaking. listen to all of them. only 2 or 3 were good-And the  METAL case. nice cover art.( Just careful when you take the game disc out of the case. its very hard to pull it out of its position. so pull it out from one side. if you pull out too hard it might break because the holder is very tight.)Gameplay.- Gameplay is very smooth. very much enhanced from the original. if you think this would be easier than Dark Souls. I will disappoint you. It is not. as far as I've gotten now. this is harder than the Original. but they don't basically throw you into the fire just like they did in the original. there is a long prologue that will make you sure you get the game and its controls. but after that. playtime is over. the real Dark Souls starts. it will be very challenging. and Yes. you will die. A lot of times. am used to that personally. I've died probably around 1000 times in the first. (Considering that I've played the first DS and I still think that DSII is harder than DS is huge. so if your a new comer. expect this to be really hard.brutally hard)- Graphics and frame ratewe all know that the original Dark Souls had some really good graphics. but also. its known for frame rate drops. really steep drops. especially in Blighttown and such places. but so far in the game. I haven't had any major frame rate drops. nothing that I noticed. The graphics are surprisingly better. way better. I liked how they had really nice contrast to them. texture quality is awesome. world details are great and I couldn't ask for more.- Controls and  in-game itemsControls are same as the original for the most part. the only difference I noticed is that you use L3 to perform a running-jump  instead of using the Circle Button. I really didn't have trouble with that. but the L3 button is hard to click while the Circle button is the button your already holding to spring. so its a better option. In game items are for the most part same as the originals. Alluring Skull. Cracked red eye orb. and of course Estus flask. and many others are present in this one as well. so. playing Dark Souls before this is a huge advantage- Character and game GUIthe way you build your character is same as the original DS for the most part. so I don't need to talk to you about it. however. There are 8 character classes in the game. Warrior, Knight, Swordsman, Bandit, Cleric, Sorcerer, Explorer, Deprived. you obviously notice that the Pyromancer class is missing. which is the only thing I am pissed about. Pyromancer class was the best for a start-up. and It was pretty unique and it fits the game very well. I hope they add that to the game later. but since that is too hard to do as the game is already finished. I doubt we're gonna see that happening. but there are still Pyromancies. which anybody can use them if you have the required item. which is the pyromancy hand. game GUI is significantly better than the original. very clean layout and easy to read text font. nice menu and generally the GUI itself is a nice upgrade .What I liked about it.- I liked how DSII is very similar to DS. many games screw up games but going off the topic and the layout of the original. but From Software has done it right. they stick to what people like. made the necessary upgrades and enhancements. but they didn't force any major changes as we usually see in video game sequels. for me. that's always a good thing.Enjoy the game. And I would get it right now. not in few years while multiplayer is pretty much dead. (even tho Dark Souls multiplayer is still very active). this one needs to be played early. and of course. Praise the Sun!***UPDATE***-You can change the running-jump control back to the Circle button from the game options. that's a good thing. And once again. I assure you that this game is harder than the original Dark Souls!. I have a weapon pack and it is still harder.****TIPS****- as a DS player. I would like to give you few tips on this game*First and most importantly. Scan your environment. there are alot of hidden items and walkways that you might miss for hours, days if you don't look. (I just missed the walkway to a place in DSII. went somewhere else that I shouldn't be at at my level. took me hours and I couldn't beat the hard enemies over there. Wondered why. apparently. I should be somewhere else).*Don't rush it. if you rush through Dark Souls II. you will not last few minutes in your run. eventually. you will either, Fall over a ledge. Get backstabbed from behind. or quite simply run into a herd of just too many enemies and get surrounded by them. do the game slowly.*Don't use flasks or any health healers during a close fight it DSII. in DS. if you get hit while drinking an estus flask. you get reduced damage. but in DSII. you get full damage anyways. so it makes it a waste of estus. get to a safe sport and stock on health.*Upgrade the crucial skills first. . I would personally upgrade my Dexterity and Vitality.Don't upgrade the intel or faith. do that later.  (In DS. vitality increases Health, In DSII. it increases stamina.)I will add other tips when I get more experience in DSII. for now. this should be helpful if you don't already think about doing this. mostly logic.****Have something to say****when I say that this game is harder than Dark Souls. I mean its way way harder. imagine that Dark Souls is an easy mode of the game. and DSII is the hardest mode of the game. that might be even less of how hard the game is. its just unbelievable difficult. side stepping is useless. enemies will still lock on you and hit you. even if you side step while running. the AI is really high. it takes about 2 hits to die in the game. Just run past through enemies to find a bonfire. I did that few times. you only have 1 estus flask when you start. 2 when you upgrade for the first time(which you will be able to early). if you had trouble with DS and you hated it and you don't want to get stuck a lot. this is not for you. this game is extremely difficult. even harder than Demon's Souls. Personally. on DS. I've played 3 playthroughs. killed Smough and Ornstein by myself on all of these playthroughs. on the last one I did it on the first try. am not the best or even close to but I consider myself good. this is beyond you can imagine hard until you actually play it. don't invoke an enemy that you see if you don't have to fight him. just run through them. find a bonfire. and then go back and kill them. its nearly impossible to get to different places with killing all the enemies. your fancy footwork won't work here. the AI is high. very small chance it does. I have a weapon pack. which has a good shield and a good weapon. about 3 times better than the startup one. and am getting my but whopped basically. they basically through you into the lava. not the fire. this time.Few people said that this game will get easier when you advance. that's partially true. the game won't get easier. you will get better. even tho DSII keeps throwing challenges at you that you will die many times over and over before winning.So far. about 6 million deaths have totaled in DSII. only 7 days in the game and 6 million deaths have totaled. shows you how hard the game is.UPDATE.THE CURRENT DEATH COUNTER IS AT  over 70 MILLION DEATHS? O.o. I was surprised myself.*****UPDATE***So far. am kind of disappointed at few things'- so far. been through 7 areas. nothing large like Darkroot garden,Basin. ash lake. in DS2. its very compact and it feels like playing a generic RPG in terms of the world. that disappointed me a lot.- the game kind of lost its Dark Souls-ness feel. the game is harder than DS. but it is so different in terms of enemies. mechanics and how the game goes about the story. very different. you will notice that*****UPDATE. MULTIPLAYER and some other issues*******- I was able to reach areas where I can be invaded. and so far its a huge disappointment. Lag is unbearable. I slash the enemy with my sword. he was around for 10 seconds before he actually get staggered and lose damage. surprised because it should reduce lag due to the dedicated servers. horrible so far. needs a quick fix.- My second issue with MP is that. Invasions are so random. you can get invaded while hollow or human. and unlike dark souls.  you see the \"You Got invaded\" message AFTER the enemy is in the map. few times i got surprised to see the enemy right next to me without a message. also. I've never seen a summon sign so far. Even in the 2011 Dark Souls. I still see people putting summon signs.- People have weapons that I don't even have. I killed 9 Bosses. And I only have about 10 unique weapons. and others have the weirdest weapons that don't exist so far in the game.- Hacking: yes. here we go again. game has some hackers. some naked guy running around and yet he receives less damage than me with a heavy armor with 700+ protection.- Another issue is that so far. I don't have any really good weapons or anything. In Dark Souls. you could obtain some really cool weapons early in the game. but so far. it doesn't seems like it in DS2.- Titanite anything. is freaking rare. as I said. am 9 bosses down. and Yet. I've never found anything but a titanite shard, large titanite shard. and both of these are very rare and limited.- Not as many merchants at all. only 3 merchants that have limited supply. and sell you the worst weapons and armors, items. in the game.- One positive thing I've noticed is that its harder to get a backstab. yes. believe it or not ladies and gentlemen. it is harder to get a backstab.- Again. one thing I didn't like so far is the lack of Mini-bosses. remember how many times you died against Havel the Rock in DS?. there aren't many Mini-bosses or really strong enemies so far. I will update more if that changes.I might need to reconsider my 5 star review. but I will do that when Am done with my first playthough.********UPDATE******- Even though a couple of areas in the beginning of the game weren't the best. there are really nice areas that are awesome. reminds me of DS. challenging areas with really strong enemies. falling of the ledge and all that is here. great. I was pissed off about some things. but this game keeps getting better and better. ****they released a second patch to fix PvP and summoning because it wasn't working**********UPDATE******- The world in this game has such great elements. there are some enemies and bosses that will make  you wonder how great the designer was. few enemies are the best fighting and gamelooking ever. really great game design. level design. especially at about halfway to the end of the game. really great what DSII is bringing to the table.When I say that this game is brutally hard. I don't mean it in a bad way. no. the reason why mos of dark-a-holics play this game because it challenges you. that what this game does. no easy mode. no easy way out. this game will be painful in terms of how hard it is to beat. just like any souls game.******UPDATE.MP*********- as OP as magic was in the original DS. it is even more OP here. MP is basically ruled by hexes(which are Dark Magic. they're called a different name here). and regular magic. many of them just kill you in 1 hit. fast attacks. and too much speed and hard to avoid. I am personally terrible at MultiPlayer against magic or any of its categories. i usually win in physical fights. but other than that. magic is unbeatable for me. if you want to be good at MP. your only option is a magic/hex build. just too strong and am dissappointed. Pyro is as weak as it was in the original dark souls. miracles aren't really intended for PVP. so they're weak anyways. and thats it. Rolling is being made an essential part of this game. shielding with a good shield isn't enough. they made it even worse for me. i like dark souls because it has heavy equipment. but they're (once again). giving advantage to magic users and light armor runners.******Finished first Playthrough*********Played the whole game. and This game is really really good. I liked it tons. but this makes me think. is this better than the Original Dark Souls?. thats a good question. I will play more playthroughs. and we will see. so far. am really disappointed at how unfair and unbalanced multiplayer is. as i said. magic rules in MP (if you played Demon's Souls, Dark Souls. you probably already know that. its becoming a \"Souls\" game trend. OP magic). trust me. it is. the only way you think that magic is not OP. many say that its not because they're themselves magic users. and they basically don't want to say that they're good players because of the magic. for PvE. I'd have to say that Dark Souls is better. but not by much. Dark Souls II is still awesome. worth playing right now. but I liked the original DS. my personal opinion. I liked some elements in DS II over DS. weapons are way better in Dark Souls II. there are less weapons (I Believe). but the variety of move sets are way more. some of them are awful. halberds and spears have some really weird move sets that make no sense. Best thing about DS II. the Bosses. there are ** of them. few of them you don't need to kill at all. but they give you something. let me put it in this way. unique.******UPDATE 6/1/14*******- I personally gave up on multiplayer. many things are very unbalanced. when I mean unbalanced I mean the most unbalance you can imagine. broken mechanics. your literally in god mode when you roll. even if the sword physically went through you you don't get damaged. its heavily abused. magic and Hexes kill in 1 hit no matter how much magic/dark defense you have. its pretty much the way it is. hitboxes are giant. way bigger than your character model. some weapons will do damage even if they  slice five ft away from you. Poise is practically non-existent. its a completely broken mechanic. causes me. with 150 Poise. probably the highest poise you can reach in this game. TO BE STUNNED WITH A DAGGER. AND A CAESTUS. anything can stagger me which shouldn't happen. renders it useless. parry weapons are broken. for some reason they do damage and the hit is few ft infront of you. and they're fixing things that do not need fixing and ignoring these issues. I doubt them getting fixed, game is riddled. AND I MEAN RIDDLED with hackers. I had few people running faster than light. they were like the Flash superhero. am not kidding they dash around and i cant do anything.Lag is unbearable. its just bad. I get killed with projectiles that are 10-20 ft away from me. i get lag stabbed from 10 ft away. attacking enemies does nothing often. lag has gotten worse.however I recommend staying away from PVP. its all broken. but Co-Op is awesome. putting summon signs to help others beat bosses is my favorite Multiplayer part. I'd spend hours doing it. and you get rewarded with souls. its great. I just spent about 3 hours doing it. its fun. whats better than unlimited boss fights with CPU and Human allies. its awesome. so you might get on that to help you get souls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

Most, if not all, of the people I had spoken to about the game said that it was tedious, boring, and not worth playing it. Then the mysterious happened. Suddenly everyone was playing it, including me, and couldn't keep their fingers off the controllers. Once you have enough skills to be formidable the game becomes a ridiculously fun repetition of itself that is, to say the least, addicting!Though you would think the game would be about ancient civilizations, old world order, and assassins it is actually about only the later. Specifically a modern day drop out assassin who has been kidnapped by a company called Abstergo. You are forced to enter the Animus, a machine that taps into genetic memory, and you must relive your ancestor's (Altair's) history. This is by far the most creative part of the whole game. Otherwise, it's rather drab. Another benefit, however, is that you get not one, but two story lines that connect loosely to one another and unfold sparingly.Back to the drab part of the review. Assassinating a target is a very small part of the entire game, otherwise you're simply moseying about collecting data, avoiding (or slaying) templars, and trying very hard not to kill random citizens that get in your way (so hard not to do). Still, this makes sense. Assassins gather a lot of information and knowledge before they go about the actual dirty work, so I was never too bothered by it. However, gathering the information is simple and boring. The hardest thing to do is assassinate some pesky targets for another assassin because of a sprained leg or back (imagine my eyes rolling) later in the game where even bumping into a wall will send every guard within twelve miles flocking. Otherwise you pickpocket, eavesdrop, beat information out of people, or do those helpful requests from other assassins. Almost all of my time was occupied either doing these missions, saving citizens, climbing viewpoints, killing templars or collecting absolutely useless flags. The flags are only for those who are obsessed with gamer points or as easy save locations. Otherwise, just let them hang out there and glitter. Ohh...and why must you die when you fall in water? For all of his prowess, I suppose Altair can't swim.Regardless of a lot of the repetition, annoying long, unskippable cut scenes, and a vast amount of redundant tasks the game is still, shockingly, fun! Running around everywhere, climbing ridiculously high structures, escaping and killing guards, all brings us gamers back and looking for more. The proof is in more recent games, such as inFamous, where the same concepts of open world environments and interactive surfaces become realized even more. The storyline is also rather interesting and it is a step away from the norm. For this we commend the game and it is no wonder we welcomed the newer editions to the franchise and were pleasantly surprised that the producers listened to the complaints of the first.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

What the heck is up w/ latest SquareEnix games? First, before every battle you'll have to wait 5 seconds and occational slow down during the battle.  There's no traveling to a city.  You just get a global map and point and you're there.  I don't know if it's just me, but I enjoy free traveling.  Second, to me the graphic looks worst than final fantasy 12.  Granted, this game is not Final Fantasy but it's from the same company! Why did they use unreal engine? I won't comment on battle system as I'm only 2 hrs in the game.  Also, I won't comment on the story as well but so far it feels rushed and very boring.  I will comment on the graphics though.. some may enjoy Westernize RPG looks but I'm more into Japanize RPG looks.  I don't want the character to look like a real human, I want a character w/ spiky hair w/ huge eyes (Cloud on FF7).  Not sure why SquareEnix wants to merge Westernize looks when they clearly have a successful formula w/ final fantasy.  Again.. why would square use unreal engine??? they have been known to make epic story w/ gorgeous graphics! heck~ they even made movies! now why would they use other people's engine? anyways.. enough of my rant.... I will play until the end of FIRST disk and decide if it's worth my time.  So far... it's been a HUGE disappointment!

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew","summary":"Really not liking it, probably won't keep playing","reviewText":"I really don't like this game. Like many people I loved the early RE games. The modern versions really just aren't good.I have played about 3 hours of the game and think I am going to quit.First of all, I hate the controls. Loathe them. Maybe not the worst I've played, maybe not even the worst in a RE game, but they just plain suck. There are two fundamental things ANY game should have, a good camera and perfect controls. Yes, I said perfect. I don't know how hard or easy implementing controls is, I am neither programmer nor game-designer, but lots of games do it without issue. Not RE games, not this game. (Note: Perfect controls means I can do anything [that the game allows] without struggle, undue-difficulty or frustration).Secondly, I HATE action-sequences (where you have to wiggle the thumb-pad or hit \"x\" at a certain time). They are stupid, sometimes difficult (i.e. I physically cannot wiggle my thumb left-right fast enough) and LESSEN immersion rather than deepening it (what I assume developers mistakenly think it does)*. I know RE has always had them, but in the 3 hours I have played this game I have probably had about 40 of these. They are an anachronism that needs to die.Otherwise... The game's story is forgettable and boring.*Action-sequence remove your consciousness from the game and make you think about your hand(s) and controller. This reduces immersion. I don't know why game developers include them in games but my theory is that if you asked a developer they would say that since you are completing an action on your controller similar to what your character on screen is doing, it increases immersion. I also suspect, if you asked these developers if they enjoyed action-sequences when they play games that they would respond with something along the lines of \"I DESIGN games, I don't PLAY them\".","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2013"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora.

This is actually right in between with some 2D and 3D elements. Gamers that complain about not being able to dodge while aiming missiles need to step up their game because I was always able to dodge in the middle of aiming. You simply pull back on the remote so it's not aiming at the screen and tap the d pad. Real simple guys. Team Ninja was given crap about this game and I believe they did an excellent job.

It's an effective story with one particular surprise that isn't too relevant but definitely clever. I don't want to ruin it.

{"product_name":"B00004SVS6","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"pretty hard game, I believe","reviewText":"Mega Man 5 is really amazing but probably not *quite* at the level of awesomeness that MM 2, 3 and 4 provides.  MM5 has plenty of really cool features and mainly focuses on an outer space-type level design.  This is one thing that caught my attention immediately back in the day.I remember 20 years ago when my mom would rent this game for me.  I did poorly back then.  I was able to complete exactly ONE stage, and now I can't even remember which stage it was!  Ah, a trip down memory lane when video games meant the absolute world to me.  Back then I considered Mega Man games *enormously* difficult.  This was a couple years before the X series came out.  I was totally confused and needed help to figure out which stages/bosses I was supposed to battle first.  For some reason I had trouble figuring this out and didn't have a Nintendo Power in my possession to help me.  Even though I was subscribing back then, I never had the issues that would help me through these Mega Man games.  The good news is that the challenge seems more understandable and less intimidating as an adult, however.Anyway, yeah, these levels are really colorful for an NES game.  A graphical and background-filled upgrade in comparison to MM4, but probably only a slight one.  One stage even has the jet ski!  Talk about cool.  I didn't think the NES had the ability to use it without the play control slowing down significantly due to the speed and the amount of enemies going by the screen, but I was wrong- it flows near flawlessly.  One thing's for absolute sure- you HAVE to have the correct weapon in your inventory when entering a boss fight.  Having the right weapon hasn't been this important since the very first Mega Man game (and it was VERY important in that game).  Also make sure you don't accidentally enter the fight without enough weapon energy or you'll pay in the worst way!The music is really good this time around, but probably not quite as memorable as the themes from MM4.  Even though as an adult I find the challenge level more bearable, it doesn't change the fact that the game is still rock hard.  You *will* lose plenty of lives so be prepared for that, and there is a degree of practice required in pushing your way through these stages successfully by experimenting with the right weapons and avoiding all the dangerous traps (of which there's many).  This is what the X games lack, however.  In the MMX games it doesn't really matter how you get through the stages because you'll probably survive no matter what due to the generosity of health energy scattered everywhere and enemies normally being less threatening.  Not so here.  I like MM5 though, because it reminds me of a good old-fashioned arcade experience.  Raw, relentless and sometimes aggravating.  That's what makes the older MM games so splendid.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2006"}

However, I would have liked more puzzles, more dungeons, and most certainly a greater variety of enemies. Rather, I am treated to an ominously eerie Elder God making vague threats to his agent Raziel, or Kain feeling sorry for himself (again!), or Raziel treating us to his observations of the ever-changing world of Nosgoth around him.

I spent nearly all day playing it recently, and I believe that was time well spent.  This is perhaps the best war game I've ever played and it certainly ranks right up there with one of the best games ever.  The graphics definitely are something to behold.  That being said, I still think Gears of War's graphics are slightly better (slightly).  The gameplay more than makes up for that.  It is constantly insane and raucous.  I played it on normal difficulty and it still challenged me at nearly every turn.  The variety of missions is so satisfying.  I've never been bored with this game for one second.  However, I have been frustrated several times (especially at the end, which is where things get really challenging).  I can't really think of anything that's bad about this game.  I've not had any framerate issues to speak of.  The sound is crisp and clear.  It's totally engaging in every way.  This game really shows what the PS3 can do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}
