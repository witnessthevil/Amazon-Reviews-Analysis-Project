{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"\"chrisshadybell\"","summary":"GOOD...FEVER","reviewText":"This is one of the best (NFL) Football games I've ever played I think I'd like Blitz just a little bit better but it is great.

What's different in Suikoden III is that you play the story through the eye's of 3 characters.

Also, the gathering of the 108 stars of Destiny. Each person has a skill to help you during the game. This game has a great story, great characters and some good cinemas as well.

This game features plenty of modes--from Grand Prix races to multiplayer to new mission modes--and a slew of unlockables to keep you going for hours on end.Audience:  You don't need to be a racing fan.  These games are great for nearly all ages and people of all skill levels, and feature varying degrees of difficulty to cater to the needs of just about anyone.Graphics:  For a handheld the graphics are great.  No problems there--this game looks excellent on the DS's dual screens.Gameplay: Despite the relatively simple concept of Mario Kart, and despite so many games in the series, each title still manages to keep the franchise fresh.  Mario Kart DS features a Grand Prix mode with a total of 32 tracks (you have to unlock many of these by winning on the ones available).  16 of these tracks are new, and 16 are tracks from the other Mario Kart games.  This is a good thing--it's a lot of fun to revisit old favorites.  There are also many characters to unlock.  Mario Kart DS features an all new Missions mode, tasking you with various objectives and leading up to boss fights after you pass a certain number of them.  Some of these are very tough.Battle mode is an important part of any Mario Kart DS, and in this respect Mario Kart DS does not disappoint.  There are a couple forms of vs. battles, from the classic break your opponents balloons to the gather the Sunshines mode, and all are accompanied by the weapon-slinging mayhem you've come to expect from Mario Kart!Control:  The controls were adapted perfectly to the DS.  Control is pretty much the same as earlier Mario Kart games, which, again, is a good thing.  The top screen is used for racing and the bottom for a map of the track, which is a great addition.  It's nice to see who's coming up behind you or where other racers are positioned on the track.Challenge:  The great thing about Mario Kart has always been the varying degree of difficulty.  When you start out the races are pretty easy, but as you unlock new modes and speeds and your opponents become more aggressive the game becomes quite a challenge.Multiplayer:  The multiplayer action on this game is absolutely great.  Not only can you connect over Nintendo's Wi-Fi network with 7 other people for an 8 player Mario Kart race or battle, you can also play with other people locally with only one copy of the game.  You can also create a custom logo, which identifies you when you're playing online.Mario Kart has always been one of Nintendo's strongest franchises and this is another installment in a series that has yet to disappoint.  If you've got a DS I'd consider this a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"J. W. Mullins","summary":"Rainbow Six Vegas, refined","reviewText":"RSV2 is every bit a refinement of the original. Being a Rainbow Six game it is challenging and you will die countless times having no idea who killed you or where the shot came from. RSV2 now has three difficulty settings but casual seems a bit more challenging than it was on the first RSV.For all intents and purposes you are essentially paying a premium to play RSV with new levels and weapons, which isn't a bad thing perse, providing the refinements and changes do add and improve the game. Playing through the single player campaign the enemy AI may be slightly improved, it is much more aggressive, with enemies running at you like kamikaze warriors at times. The AI for your squad mates seems to be much worse than the original. It is adequate but could be much better, its surprising that the AI would take a step backward when the game is developed by the same studio that made the first. They will sometimes do very stupid things, like stand in the open and get shot, or run in front of your fire. Or the best, run in front of you as you throw a grenade, which means death for the whole team. They also tend to follow you very closely which can become a pain when you can't escape enemy rounds because your guys won't get out of the way.The ability to sprint prevents a few grenade deaths, but doesn't take anything away from the tactical shooting aspect. So those fearing that RSV was moving too far towards the COD style need not worry. The new weapons are nice and the balance between the different types seems to be better. Terrorist hunt returns, this time with the ability to take your AI squad mates with you if you want. Of course the best part of terrorist hunt is the ability to play with for of your friend online and RSV2 doesn't disappoint. You are also able to play through the entire campaign with one friend online now, with the primary player also controlling the AI squad. I preferred the ability to play through it with four people online but Ubisoft didn't ask me.The ability to customize your character in the campaign mode is a nice touch and you can show all off the cool gear you unlock in both campaign and multiplayer now. If you unlocked everything on the original RSV multiplayer you will see all the same items here, all ready to be unlocked again at almost the same ranks. The fact that you now gain experience in both campaign and online multiplayer is an excellent addition.I am not too sure how found I am of the ACRES system, which is they system that unlocks your weapons bases on your style of play. I enjoyed the ability to be able to use any weapon on the campaign in the original and unlocking new weapons and gear on the online mode. The fact that you have to actively kill enemies in a certain manner to unlock a weapon you might really want seems a little unneeded to me.I have found a few bugs on my game so far. I have put almost a hundred rounds into an enemy while blind firing around a corned and just watched him dance with the rounds, which is funny but not right. Every time I have then leaned out into the door and shot he would die instantly. Several times my weapon has disappeared and left me just walking around waiting to die. It always corrects itself when you reload your check point but its annoying. And speaking of annoying the checkpoint save system is terrible, you will spend a lot of time player through the same part of a level because the developers like to give you a really hard firefight just before a save point. Which means you might play through several tough firefights, then hit the hard one, die and have to do it all again. And as much as you die in any Rainbow Six game this can become very annoying.The original RSV was the best tactical shooter available on the 360 and RSV2 does a great job of following it up. If you are new to the series RSV2 is a great place to start, and if you love the series you are going to pick it up anyway. A few people will be disappointed at having to pay full price for a not entirely new game. But most people should be quite happy with it. I recommend it highly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2008"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"The Art of Moving","reviewText":"If I were to review Mirror's Edge (ME) based solely on originality I would give it 5-Stars. Though after finishing the game the hard truths that often follow innovation are all to apparent. ME is a decent game with a new and fresh presentation and even (gasp!) a message. Though a wafer thin combat element and sometimes sloppy controls keep the game from getting a higher rating from me.Mirror's Edge is set in a near utopian future. Crime, poverty and other plagues have been all but eliminated - although with a cost. The freedoms that people enjoyed have been abandoned and a totalitarian big brother has an iron grip on all but a few fringe segments of society. Those that oppose the powers that be communicate through \"Runners\" - a group of disenfranchised youth that scale skyscrapers and stay off the beaten path. In Mirror's Edge you'll control Faith a runner on the mend who suddenly finds herself fighting to free her sister who was framed for murder. Those familiar with Parkour a.k.a. \"the art of moving\" will be right at home with ME. For everyone else think of ME as \"urban running\". Instead of using the streets though, urban runners use the environment around them to find the most efficient path over, under and through the cityscape.The graphics in Mirror's Edge are clean and efficient though sterile. Although you'll spend the majority your time in and urban setting you never really feel it's believable. The developer, DICE, certainly wanted to convey a sense of sterilization and uniformity in the environment. The use of bleach-white in almost every element of the cityscape is evidence of that. Contrast that with limited areas where bright reds, oranges, blues and greens are used. Unfortunately this sterile environment is what you'll be spending your time looking at. Dull rooftops and cinderblock interiors make up the majority of the game.Gameplay is where things are interesting. Think First-Person-Shooter without the emphasis on shooting and instead on running. You'll use L1 for jumping and L2 for ducking/sliding. That coupled with your forward momentum will be 90% of the game - running, jumping and sliding. There are enemies and they are armed. Faith has basic melee combat abilities and can instantly disarm and cripple the \"Blues\" (police) as they're referred to in the game by carefully timing a button press. You'll also be able to pick up the guns the police drop and use them against your pursuers. Though it's here that ME really stumbles. Clearly the emphasis of the development went to \"running\" and not to the combat. Though you can melee enemies it's more of a single button mashing affair. Disarming enemies is based on timing and though you're given the ability to slow-down time - call it heightened awareness a.k.a \"bullet-time\" - disarming enemies is often hit-or-miss. Using guns against enemies is unsatisfying for a few reasons. First the weapons are dull and inaccurate. Secondly, enemies take a ridiculous amount of bullets to kill. If I had to use a phrase to describe the combat in ME it would have to be \"tacked-on\".The music is thankfully very pleasant and understated and I actually found it a highlight of the game. After you finish the game you'll unlock the ability to listen to the entire tracklist through the extras menu which is a nice bonus.The main story in Mirror's Edge is short - probably 6-8 hours. The game does feature several options to keep playing including speed runs and time trials. Speed runs are all about beating an entire level within a time limit. Time Trails feature parts of levels with checkpoints spread along the way. You can upload your own times and compare against your friends and the rest of the world. Other than that the game features 3 difficulty levels and related trophies for beating the game on different settings.It would take a really terrible game for me to suggest avoiding it altogether and ME is definitely not a terrible game. Still ME is best left a rental than a purchase in my opinion. Good for a run through and for the experience but not something to add to the game library.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

Be the hero embarking on an epic quest or a thief rising to leadership of his guild. Be a sorcerer developing the ultimate spell of destruction or a healer searching for the cure to a plague. Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit. Change character or creature attributes and skills, introduce new weapons or dungeons into the game, or create entire new worlds to explore.","reviewerName":"L. Blasiman","summary":"Incredible game worth the price.","reviewText":"I got Morrowind on a whim after reading some good reviews. I was impressed right from the start and it only got better.Morrowind, simply put, does everything right for an RPG. Most everything about the gameplay seems natural. Skills for example increase based on usage rather than using arbitrary skill points. I really enjoyed the amount of freedom the player has in almost anything the player can do. From enchanting custom items, to the methods used to complete quests or even not do any quests at all and just wondering around leveling up. The range of options made available to the player is amazing. You are not &quot;required&quot; to do things a certain way or even do anything at all. I played the main quest from start to finish. Then I started over and chose to ignore it and joined another faction. There was still plenty to do and see, and some things I didn't see the first time, with out having anything at all to do with the main quest or story. I still feel like I have only done a tenth of what there is to do in this game. This is a massively single player role-playing game.One thing that stood out was that Morrowind has a unique look and feel. This comes from having a large and original story. Nothing is based on D&amp;D rules. Races and characters all fit in to Morrowind's elaborately crafted world. You can spend a lot of time studying the many books in the game to just learn the history of Morrowind. This is all represented with some impressive graphics. Visually the game is very appealing. My favorite is the sky at night. You can see very detailed stars through the wisps of animated clouds that nothing at all like a skybox. You could write a book on the many fine details found in the game that all help it seem living world and not a static backdrop made for the player.If the game has flaws it's that there are still some things that seem unfinished. There are too few ambient sounds, making most places oddly silent and empty. The number of monsters to fight is limited to a dozen constantly reused models. NPCs will stand around in the same general area day or night. Enter a diamond mine and you find miners but you will never see them mining anything. These things detract from what is otherwise a very immersive game. It seems odd that these things could not have been improved before release.Yet these things in no way stop it from being a very good game with a seemingly limitless number of quests to do and a huge range of options for the player.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2002"}

This time, James Earl Cash, you are the sport. They gave you your life back. Now, they are going to hunt you down. You awake to the sound of your own panicked breath. You must run, hide, and fight to survive. If you can stay alive long enough, you may find out who did this to you. This is a brutal blood sport.Continuing in Rockstar North's tradition of world-class gameplay with high production values and sardonic humor,Manhuntexplores the depths of human depravity in a vicious, sadistic tale of urban horror.","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"One word.....Sick","reviewText":"Manhunt is another gitty game from the creators of Grand Theft Auto.  Rock* have pushed the bars with this game as it consists of nothing but brutalized killing and scary stealth.  The games story is pretty weak not to mention dull.  But that doesn't stop the excitement of what this game has.  You play as James Earl Cash who is sentenced to death..Reasons unknown.  But soon you find out everthing is a hoax and you'll have to you use your instinct and wits to survive as what I like to call \"one of the worst nightmares a man can have\".  The game consists of nothing But stealth, well atleast most of the time.  What makes Manhunt a really unique kind of game is the fact that you can do 3 different types of kills on your enemy depending on what type of weapon you have wether it's a hammer, baseball bat, or a crowbar.  Either way there all prettty violent.  And later on in the game you'll have the ability to use weapons such as pistols, uzi's, and my pal...The Shotgun.The graphics are one of Rock* better games besides Max payne 2.  The graphics are really well done and some of the levels and envirment are really really creepy.  The gangs are also creepy such as a boss you face near the end of the game called \"Piggsy\".  The graphics do stand out.The gameplay is the best part of the game especially when you get weapons but the stealth never got boring for me eventhough it was overused a lil' to much if you as me.  But soon once you get the revolvers the games picks up pace.  The gameplay is also the reason why this game is so violent...duuhh..The sound is just plain earie..  The sound of the foggy distraction going through your ear.  The sound of those sick sick gangmembers taunting at you trying to get you to come out of the shadows so they can kill you...It really is creepy.The game is pretty long since its a stealth game...it's pretty average length.  It would atleast take 15 hours if you play it on hard.  The game is pretty average I guess.Before I say anything els I must say this is one of the most Violent and out of control games ever.  It has extreame graphic violence(blow your foes face off with a shotgun and you tell me) and lots and lots of profanity such as a part were there is a gang member right infront of you and a something on the wall tells you to kill him(it says \"kill the dumb $&^&k;\")It's a pretty graphic game and does deserve it's Mature rating.Over all with all the violence and mayhem and poor fighting controls not to mention the dull storyline and \"kina gets old\" killing after killing I give Manhunt a3.4I acctually had a blast playing this game but still R* should have dont better with this game","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2004"}

If you played past street fighter games and enjoyed them, you will definitely enjoy this game. The controls are very responsive and their are tons of moves which are pretty easy to do. The ultra combos take practice though. The graphics and sound are both amazing! The single player is actually pretty good with pretty nice storyline where you fight your rival and Seth who is the final boss but it isn't that difficult to beat Seth. As for the multiplayer, I would have to say it is the most difficult multiplayer competition because there are so many great players out there. I can hold my own with tekken multiplayer but I get destroyed with SSF4 multiplayer. I just got to play more with SSF4 and get better. You don't necessarily have to play multiplayer to enjoy the game though.

{"product_name":"B0009XEC02","description":"Third installment of the popular SRPG series.  First for the DS handheld.","reviewerName":"Rorke Haining","summary":"Perfect way to kill time on long and short trips","reviewText":"I'm a man in my late 30s who used to enjoy video games, but between work, going back to school, and children, I just don't have time for gaming any more.  So it's been ~5 years since I tried any gaming system, much less a handheld (which I've always viewed as worthless from a gaming perspective).  Recently, I had a long business trip, and friends recommended the Nintendo DS Lite and Advanced Wars:  Dual Strike.  I bought both on their recommendation and I can honestly say it is a truly fantastic experience.  It made the trip fly by, I wasn't even interested in the movie or reading.  It even worked great to defuse my frustration about having to wait for an hour in a slow-moving security line.  In this review, I'll speak about the game, and will write a separate review for the system.AW:DS is exactly what I was looking for.  A solid, turn-based strategy/tactics game.  The Campaign mode did an excellent job of teaching you how to play, introducing new elements over time.  As seems to be the norm these days, many elements are not initially available but unlockable after accumulating a certain number of play points.  This has the effect of hooking you even more -- you want to just unlock that one extra feature!Detailed info about the game:Units include air, naval, and land units in 6 different classes, including transports, units that specialize in attacking only certain types of targets, ranged units, cloaking units (subs + stealth aircraft), bombs, repair units, etc..  Each unit has common stats (vision, speed, range, health, attacks-vs-armor, attacks-vs-soft targets, mobility type, etc.) as well as unique capabilities (extra vision when stationed on mountains, can transport units, can repair, etc.).  One of my few criticisms of the game is that I wish the complete stats of the units were available from within the game, as opposed to just descriptive text explaining their capabilities.Some maps are played with open information, others are played with fog of war.  You can choose from a variety of COs, each with unique capabilities and drawbacks, adding an extra dimension to the game.The game also makes good use of the DS features, such as wireless multiplayer support.  Best of all, though, was the use of the 2nd screen.  In most cases, the 2nd screen was used for status & details of the selected terrain/unit, and you could always return to that mode.  In special circumstances, though, the 2nd screen shows movies related to the mission (e.g. a space weapon powering up).  Best of all, though, were the two-front battles (e.g. a battle on the surface and an air battle 30,000 feet overhead).  Winning on the 2nd front isn't usually required, but doing so helps you on the main front.  In addition, some units can be sent from the main front to the 2nd front, depending on the scenario (e.g., when the 2nd front is a sky battle, only aircraft can participate).  The dual screen made for an excellent and unique gameplay experience.My only quibbles are minor.  I wish the \"wait\" command was not the default for any unit, as too often I mistakenly skipped a unit's turn and was not able to undo.  (Either that or provide an undo command.)  I wish the Campaign mode allowed you to return to maps you had previously unlocked to show them again.  It might be nice if the campaign was branching rather than linear (though there are hidden scenarios with extra bonuses if you work to find them).  But overall, this is exactly what I was looking for:  a strong strategic game that can kill 15 minutes or 15 hours.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"A Classic!","reviewText":"Mario Kart 64 is, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made for the Nintendo 64 (or any other system). Even today, 8 years after its original release, Mario Kart 64 is still amazingly fun. The controls are PERFECT- and I do mean perfect. The first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn, you'll see what I mean. The game is perfectly balanced- each character has strengths and weaknesses. Your skill determines if you come in first- not because you picked the best character. Oh, and I haven't even spoken about the brilliant course design. Every course has shortcuts, and special features, making them truely unique. The placement of the powerups is wonderful. And the multiplayer... Oh the multiplayer! One word: brilliant. Playing with your friends is exciting, competetive, and will have you laughing like crazy. This is what multiplayer gaming is all about. If the game does have one weakness, it is the graphics; being 8 years old, Mario Kart 64 doesn't stack up well against today's crop of games in terms of visuals. But when you're having this much fun with a game, do the graphics matter? No way!! Even if you own the Gamecube version of Mario Kart, you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2004"}

Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed.

The new Shinobi features a new main character, completely new play mechanics, and basically takes everything other than the essence of the original game, and strips it away.What's left is a game of pure ninja action.This isn't Tenchu, it's not Metal Gear Solid, it's not Splinter Cell, or Thief. This is an action game, pure and simple, no waiting or sneaking involved. In a typical interaction, you'll come across a small group of possessed ninja - members of your ninja clan turned against you. You will run up to them, stealth dash around the first enemy, leaving a ghost image of you in front of him, which he will attack. Hotsuma will slash him in the back, then dash quickly again to meet a new foe. After each foe has been defeated, if the time between each foe was short enough, Hotsuma will strike a quick pose, as your enemies fall apart into pieces simultaneously.While this combo system looks incredibly cool, it is also integral to the gameplay. With each successive kill in a \"Tate\" (pronounced Tah-tay, not Tayte) combo, your demon sword becomes more and more powerful. Kill one person in two blows, and the next might be felled in a single stroke. Kill three or four, and your sword will be powerful enough to slice a tank in two.The result is a really fast-paced action game where your moves are calculated to maximize the damage you can do via the combo system. While not complex enough to really be a \"thinking man's\" hack and slash, it adds a depth to the game that rewards the skilled player.There are some drawbacks to the game. The story takes place in a virtually deserted post-apocalyptic Tokyo. While the setting is nice, it's somewhat lifeless. The levels are relatively linear. The boss battles can be extremely difficult. But it doesn't really matter, to be honest.If you enjoy fast-paced action, and the thought of leaping into battle throwing a burst of shuriken, slicing up a bunch of baddies, and striking a cool pose as they fall apart sounds good to you, you'll enjoy Shinobi.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2002"}

'rush' and 'conquest' are both fine, don't get me wrong; they're just HUGE [size and people] and can take 20-30 minutes to complete [but that can be fun, too]. leveling up and customizing weapons is pretty standard, so i won't say more than that. it's also cool to choose which kind of soldier you want to be: assault, engineer, medic, recon.the coolest part of the multiplayer was collecting the dog tags of enemies you melee/knife.  it's VERY satisfying to find a sniper [preferably someone who's already taken you out], sneak up behind them, knife them in the back, and collect their dog tags. very cool! the multiplayer also offers a very nice variety of medals, pins, and honors and keeps track of how many times you've earned each.all in all, i think this is a GREAT game and a must buy. dice and EA deserve a big round of applause for developing a FUN game [that's what it's all about, right?] that will keep you coming back for more and more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2010"}

BFME is fun, strategic, and beautiful","reviewText":"Before receiving Battle For Middle Earth this Christmas Eve (gotta love that darling girlfriend), I had read quite a few dismal reviews for it.  In case you've read the same BS, I'm going to attempt to clear some things up for you so the nay-sayers don't bump you away from a great game.  So.... The biggest complaints people have had about BFME are:1.  Not enough unit types2.  No strategyHeh.  Wrong and wrong. ---- First off: There are plenty of units spread out between the four playable races in Battle For Middle Earth.  If people have a problem with exactly how many units are in the game, they should take it up with Tolkien Enterprises and not the game's developers.  EA was only allowed to play off of characters that were in the movies.  And I'd say they did a damn good job mustering all they could with a limited rights license. // Mordor and Isengard are crawling with different units, but low on heroes.  Gondor and Rohan may not be the most well rounded when it comes to troop variations, but let me tell ya:  Gondor has Gandalf (his powers are truly awesome to behold in this game )  and then Rohan is chock full of heroes.  They have Theoden, Eowyn, Merry, Eomer, Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas.  So it all evens out.  I don't care who says what about 'shortage of units'. - They're all there. There are plenty of formations and combinations to try when it comes to the troop equation.The second blundering re re misconception that some reviewers have had, is the whole \"Yeah it looks cool, but it's light on strategy\" tripe.  Dear reader, please listen:  This game has every bit as much strategy as Rome: Total War, Age of Mythology, or the beloved Warcraft III.  These three aforementioned titles are the games that people keep comparing BFME to when complaining about what they deem to be \"lack of strategy.\"  In BFME, you need to use the same kind of strategies that you would use in R:TW, Warcraft, or Age Of etc. - You need to strategically choose which troops to attack which sortie with, you need to choose where and when to use magical abilities, you need to balance your base between fortification and upgrades, you need to decide when to launch severe assaults and when to buckle down and build up, you need to put your troops in different formations for different attacks, and you need to decide when and how to expand throughout the map and take various outposts in order to attain more resources etc.  I don't know about you but I'm seeing plenty of strategy here.  I`ve even heard several geniuses say, \"Yeah, well in R:TW you can flank, but in BFME you can't.\"  **Attention**  Just because Battle For Middle Earth doesn't have a fancy 'Flank Button,' doesn't mean that you don't use the technique of flanking.  God forbid if everything isn't pre-programmed for these people.  Its called Move your troops around your enemy with queued mouse clicks, and then hit them from the side or behind.  Not exactly rocket science.  And, I'm sorry, but what the hell is so strategic about Warcraft 3? - You fight using large forces of troops supplemented with magical abilities... gee, that sounds familiar... It's the formula for just about every RTS game that's ever been made.  BFME follows this formula too and it's a lot of fun. And BFME is also the first RTS game I've ever seen to successfully employ a fun siege feature. In BFME, you'll find yourself holing up in your base with an opening and closing gate while the enemy tries to scale the walls and knock in the doors with battering rams etc.  You need to place defenses on your walls, man it with archers, and choose when to open up and bring the fight to your foes.  Now I have to say, on EA's part, they did some damn fine designing there.  And most importantly:  they made it FUN.The game's graphics, as I'm sure you've heard, are great. The only thing you need to worry about there is updating your drivers, getting the patch that's coming out in January, and not cranking your settings too high.  This game is a resource hog.  I'm playing it on a Pentium 4, 3.0ghz cpu with 512mb 2700 ram and a geforce fx5200 card.  I have it on 1024 resolution with the detail set to medium.  It looks great and it runs great.  Even though my computer meets and exceeds the requirements, the frame rate gets demolished in the bigger battles if your settings are too high.  So that's something to keep in mind.  But even so, on medium setting, there is nothing to complain about.  Gorgeous and fun effects.  Gee, there's that word fun again.The sound/music is great too.  Top notch.  The din of battle is great in this game.  Clanging, thudding, explosions, cheering and screaming etc.  They really did a great job of capturing that chaotic clamor of the movie battles. - And the music is pulled straight from the films as well, so you know it's awesome.  Remember in The Two Towers when Gandalf arrives with Eomer at Helm's Deep and they charge down the hill into the waiting sea of Uruks?  Well the really beautiful and bittersweet sounding song that's played at that part in the film is called Forth Eorlingas.  What's cool, is that in BFME, you'll be charging into battle and that song will come on... you know - the long drawn out and eerily beautiful vocals?  Yeah, well, that song will sometimes start to play as you charge towards the enemy ranks throughout the game. It is rather chuff and inspiring, if I may say.  This game is fun and oddly moving in a way.  Especially if you're big into the films.  Nicely done.As for the actual gameplay:  You traverse the storyline from the side of good or evil and follow the events of the movies.  But the cool thing here is, you get to play ancillary (secondary or extra) battles where you get to build up armies and villages and fight skirmishes.  The storyline from the film is played out in full, but interspersed with all sorts of fun additional battles along the way.  BFME is a long game.  There is at least 20-30 hours of gameplay here with the storyline alone. And after you complete the story modes, you get to go back and fight skirmishes with the AI and also with other LOTR geeks like myself, online.BFME is a fun ride. You get to relive 3 great movies through some great RTS action/gameplay.  Plenty of strategy and plenty of fun.  Lots and lots of fun.  Once again EA proves to us that it's possible to take a massive movie license and make a great game out of it.  Anyways, take my word for it:  This game does not disappoint.  Order this bad boy and go have yourself a bloody-guts good time in Middle Earth.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2004"}

It is all about team play. With Left 4 Dead you must cooperate with your other three team members or else you will not, cannot make it. The concept is ingenious and you will be adding friends to your list and looking forward to nothing more than filling the zombie hordes full of hot lead with your new mates. Valve completely underestimated how popular this would be. Left 4 Dead is everything that Resident Evil multiplayer wasn't and then some more. Just get the game if you like social gaming and fps. There is nothing like it.The game itself is quite simple. There are 4 scenarios with 5 levels each. A game takes approx. 45 minutes from start to end. You make your way across each level with your buddies shooting zombies to get to an extraction point. You get a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and health pack. Along the way you can get pipe bombs, molotov cocktails and pain suppressants. You can share items with your teammates. You will always encounter zombies but they could be in any number form 3 or 4 to literally one hundred. There are special monsters along the way like the witch (hear everyone on voice say turn off your flashlight) who goes mental if you disturb her, hunters that jump on you and pin you helplessly unless a friend gets you up, bloomers that explode yucky stuff on you that attracts hordes of zombies directly to you and a smoker that has a tongue that can drag you helplessly along the ground. There is also the tank, a huge zombie monster that takes like most of your ammo to kill.The thing is once you are helpless a team mate must get you up. If you are all helpless then you die and need to restart the level. Some members get damaged more than others and how the game flows depends largely on how selfish or friendly your team is. I played scenarios where cooperation was rife and we made it through really well. Other scenarios I played with self-interested members and anything can happen from watching them get all the best stuff while everyone else dies to not being able to finish a level, ever. If you can play it where everyone else is on voice then it absolutely rocks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"Rick \"BchNuts\"","summary":"The tanks are way over used and over powered.","reviewText":"I do like this game but there are two things that make it just a time filler until Modern Warfare 2. First off, the campaign is only about 3 to 4 hours long on normal, if that.  Although the multiplayer is mostly very fun, the levels where there are tanks suck. Basically, if one team gets a tank or two, the rest of that team easily picks off the other team because they are so preoccupied in either destroying the tanks or being blown up by them.  It takes an average of 3 rockets to take out a tank and that means a two man job because they only give you 2 rockets with the launcher. So like I said, all your time is spent worrying about the tanks and not killing the other team or completing objectives. Plus there is no option to turn off the tanks or play those levels without them. If you play in any room, just watch, the people who run straight for the tanks dominate the match. To me it just takes the fun out of the run and gun atmosphere of Call Of Duty. I personally think vehicles in first person shooters should only be used as transportation. But I guess every game has it's cheap little tool to ruin the rest of the experience.

Its such an amazing game, very beautiful as well especially now that it's been remastered. The controls are a little funky though and Ico should have gotten better in the charts with how awesome the story, graphics, and game play are. Definitely worth keeping and adding to the collection. Ico is better than it was on the PS2, the illusion of depth is better and Colossus feels like it was made for the PS3 due to added polygons although the characters look a little blocky. They are beautiful classics that were redone well and although I feel re-releases are over priced money grabs by the publishers... this one really deserves it and was well done. They did it right this time, particularly in Shadow of the Colossus... The frame rates are much smoother than the original PS2 release, and the atmosphere/presence of the Colossi carries more impact and suspension of disbelief since it's not interrupted by the jagged lines that were in the originals.

In this game you do all the combat moves Batman is known for when taking down baddies especially the tough mutants and stealth which is very important when sneeking up on baddies and when avoding things as you use your brain for this game. You also use your gadgets including explosive gel for when blowing some things up to get inside that place or secret area to the classic grappling hook to all that, you can also solve Riddler's challenges in some areas.What's also cool about this game is you can use Detective Mode which is like X-ray vision even when analyzing things for clues to all the way to tracking down that person your suppose to look for and even glide your cape.All in all, this is a very satisfying and fun game for all gamers and not just Batman fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2012"}

I say yay because that means I don't have to feel bad when I murder their faces.StoryThe story begins with the main character, Sean, a champion race car driver, in Paris recounting a series of events that has lead him to this little pub, being hunted by one of the countries most powerful Nazi commanders. While having a drink, a mysterious man approaches Sean, offering his help to rid Paris of the Nazis once and for all, but the dangers involved could risk the lives of everyone Sean holds dear.GraphicsThe games graphics are grainy, on purpose, to give the feeling of dread and doom (which is understandable, it IS Nazi infested Paris). While in Nazi territory, the environment loses all color, becoming black and white, the citizens are downtrodden and fearful.As Sean takes down key points held by the Nazis, color slowly returns to the area, allowing him more freedom to explore and climb various buildings without being attacked by Nazis.ControlsControls are easy and simple to learn. Driving, which is notorious in games for being poorly made, is also simplified so that anyone can master it in a few minutes. Certain areas of buildings (rails, doors, windows, alcoves, etc) are highlighted by a small shimmer that allows the player to climb them to access the rooftops of buildings (ala Assassins Creed), however if caught by Nazis, they will open fire, knocking Sean down.Sean can equip a numerous number of guns, ranging from pistols, shotguns and even rocket/grenade launchers (these will give your position away faster, but are a lot of fun). Gunplay uses a more over the shoulder style (similar to The Mercenaries), but you can also stealth kill if you wish to be more elusive.Voice/Music/SoundVoice work is done well, Sean (who again, is Irish sounds like an Irishman), citizens have a French accent and the Nazis sound German. What stands out is the music, which changes depending on the situation (in dangerous territory, it's somewhat depressing), when in friendly territory, is more friendly. If Sean does something suspicious/illegal, Nazis soldiers will come after him and the music takes a more dangerous turn.OtherThere are many, many, MANY objects to destroy (in fact, if you're an achievement whore, this may be a painful grind, as there are easily 600 things to destroy), luckily, the map shows the location of where these things are (although not always ground level).There is a plethora of hidden areas for Sean to discover, and more vehicles then one can count (which, if you bring them to one of the many garages you eventually unlock, you'll be able to drive them at any point in the game, and this is also an achievement).OverallThis is a fun game if you like open-ended games and/or collectibles, and blowing s*** up. However is can get very tedious for achievement hunters.8.5/10.0 (4.5 STARS)Pros:- Destructible environments- A very large play area- Very fun exploratory gameCons- Can get repetitive- Numerous amounts of weapons, cars and destructible objects for achievement hunters- Straightforward game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

Not a game for Shooters","reviewText":"I really wanted to like this game but there are a number of things that has made me really dislike it.  Number one is the crummy save system.  Instead of saving the game where you left off before you died the game either sends you back to a HQ where you tediously have to reload your guns and ammo or it starts at a checkpoint where you have to go through all the things you did before.  The sneak doesn't work because the too numerous Nazis can apparently see everything and through walls and behind trees so it is an almost useless skill.  if you expect to win a shoot out, forget it for once the silly Nazi blows his magic whistle the Nazi spawn out of the ground faster than Darkspawn and you will never kill them all as they spawn right in front of you and behind.  Sean is a weak character who dies easily when the Nazi spawns pop out of the ground and see through the trees.  You do a lot of tedious running for your life in this game looking for safe places to hide only to find that most of the time when you get there you can't get in because the all-seeing, all knowing Nazis saw you from a hundred yards away.  If there were this many Nazis in France in the 1940's all seeing and all knowing, they would have won the war.  What could have been a great game is just ruined because of the silliness of spawning Nazis with magic whistles.

Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces.

There are a total of four difficulties you can play the story mode on, but you need to beat the game to play the hardest difficulty. The graphics are amazing, and blows all other next gen games out of the water, but only when it comes to graphics. The game play can leave your hands tired after bashing all the buttons over and over again. There is a lot of blocking, breaking the enemy's guard, and attacking that makes the game challenging, but not impossible. The coolest part is the spacial rage attack mode that is very useful when attacking multiple enemies at once.I tried to play multiplayer, but I was unsuccessful, because it would not connect to the servers.Overall Ryse is worth playing, and is a member of the good launch titles. A plus of the Day One Edition is that there is a free DLC code.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

Game calibration is a cinch compared to the wii and move.  all you do is stand there and it autocalibrates.  You don't have to stand in a specific spot.  You don't have to hold any controller in a specific position. You don't have to aim a reticle to calibrate.  Unless you have little kids, the best placement for the Kinect is higher up.  Go closer to the 6 feet than the 2 feet height.  You'll get better results.  Also, the higher the Kinect, the closer you can play to the Kinect.  The kinect has an auto-tilting mechanism to get the right angle no matter who plays.  it's a very smart device.There's a lot the Kinect offers.  Controlling the Xbox with only your voice and/or hand gestures is pretty amazing.  Right now, not everything can be controlled by voice/hand so that's where the disappointment is.  But once you start navigating ESPN with only your voice, you won't go back to the controller.  It's just that cool.Another great use of the Kinect is video chat.  Right now, you can talk to other Xbox people or you can talk to people with Windows Live Messenger (MSN messenger).  We did chatting with family across the country and the experience was fabulous.  Even though we were sitting about 10 feet away from the Kinect, we sounded crystal clear to our family who were using a laptop on the other side.  They also sounded loud and clear on our side as well.  The Kinect will autofocus and autozoom and will automatically track you as you move around the room.  You can literally walk around the room and the camera follows you.  If other people step in front of the Kinect, the cam will zoom out to accommodate them.  If there's only one person in front of the cam, the Kinect will zoom in so that the person takes up the frame properly.  There are 4 positional mics inside the Kinect and they will aim at the person speaking in order to eliminate background noise. In fact, you can be playing a movie but still give voice commands and the Kinect can hear you.  That's how good it is.  Note that my dad is approaching 70 and he hates sitting in front of a webcam.  He finds the whole setup finicky and would rather talk on the phone.  But after using the Kinect, now he wants to just chill on the couch and talk.  He hates the computer but sitting on the couch was just so inviting to him.  Now he's trying to get his friends to get Kinect just to do video chat!But a couple tips.  While the voice cancellation is excellent, there are some things that can help out.  It's not necessarily volume of voice that makes the voice commands work better or not.  It is enunciation and making sure the Kinect knows who is talking and making sure you hold your face toward the camera so that it can see your lips.  I noticed that when I was facing downward, the Kinect sometimes didn't recognize my voice.  But even when I whispered, it could hear me as long as I properly face the camera.  Of course, if you don't face the camera, you can compensate by speaking up.  However, voice recognition was spotless when the room was quiet.  But when I was blasting a sporting event, music, or a movie, I tried to be very conscious of looking at the Kinect when I was speaking a voice command.  Also note that right now, Video Kinect doesn't seem to support multiway chat but they promised 8-way video chat in the future.  That just sounds mindblowing.  I could video chat with my brother in San Francisco and my other brother in New York at the same time and all of us could see each other at the same time!The Kinect also has a great feature called Kinect ID.  This allows you to just stand in front of the Kinect and it scans your face and body to identify you and then logs you automatically into your account.  So whenever you want to hop into a game or some Xbox feature, the Xbox will instantly recognize you.  And if you jump into the middle of a game that your brother, for example, is playing, the Kinect is smart enough to make the game multiplayer and you can play together each with their own account.  Note that since Kinect ID depends on reading your face, this feature does depend on good lighting.  So while the games play fine if you're playing in the dark, if you use Kinect ID or if you like the pictures the Kinect takes of you, or if you plan on using the video kinect video chat program, you need good lighting.Note that the Kinect tracks your body through an infrared sensor that functions like sonar to create a 3D map of your room.  So it doesn't depend on the light in your room at all.  In fact, you can play totally in the dark if you like.  That was something that couldn't be done previously with other camera setups (if you had a Playstation Eyetoy, you know what I'm talking about).As for the games, it comes with Kinect Adventures.  This is a fun game and shows you some of the things the Kinect can do.  Having a lot of experience with the Wii, the Kinect is a whole new world.  With the Wii, you can just sit there or stand there and wave the Wiimote to play.  When I first started playing Kinect, I was just moving my arms like with my Wii.  But nearly all the games make you move your whole body!  You literally have to walk around the room to do things.  For example, they have a leaks game in Kinect Adventures where killer fish are punching holes into your glass cage so water is spilling in.  You have to plug the holes with the your hands, your legs, and your body.  But you can't just reach out with your hands.  Sometimes the holes are a couple of feet in front of you so you have to walk forward to reach the hole to plug.  Or in the space event where you pop bubbles, you have to walk forward or backward to reach the bubbles you have to pop.  So you're moving in all 3 dimensions.  It's very cool once you get away from the Wii/Move paradigm.  And trust me, you will sweat with the Kinect.  I was in puddles of sweat after a short time with the Kinect.  I never sweated with the Wii except for EA Sports Active and a few other games.And cheating with the Kinect is much harder.  You know if you play with Wii games like Wii sports that you can cheat a lot of moves to play better.  For example, wrist flicking is much more effective than actual real life motions in events like tennis.  If you swing like a real tennis swing, you'll lose.  But with the Kinect, most of the events require real movement.  I have Just Dance and the Michael Jackson game for the Wii.  But Dance Central on the Kinect is so much more realistic.  It can tell if you're stepping forward with your right foot when you're supposed to step forward with your left foot and score you negatively because you're doing the dance wrong.  That's the brilliance!  Your feet actually matter.  It can tell if you're not dropping your shoulder properly in a dance step or if you're not swinging your arm correctly or if you're not moving your legs properly.  For the Wii dancing games, the games were fun but it never tracked you like Dance Central on the Kinect tracks you.And if you're looking for a modern version of Wii Sports, Kinect Sports is just awesome.  You can't cheat in events like bowling on the Kinect like you can in Wii.  All the games have plenty of nuance.  If you like Wii bowling, you'll love the Kinect version.  Everyone can bring in their own bowling swing and once you get the feel for how you want to bowl, everything just feels great.  I bowl with spin and finesse.  My brother bowls straight with power (you can see little flames around the ball when he bowls).  It just feels awesome.  Volleyball is great especially if you have experience with volleyball.  In fact, it helps that you know the rules of volleyball.  Because for those that don't know volleyball, there are prompts to do things like jump to spike the ball.  I grew up in California so volleyball is just as natural to us as football.  But if you depend on the on-screen prompts, you won't have long term success because the prompts are a little slow.  But if you play as if there are no prompts and play just as if it's real volleyball, you'll be super successful.  And since the game tracks your whole body, you literally have to move!  To reach some balls, you have to really go toward the ball!  You can't just stick your arm out there.  And to spike you actually have to jump!  And you can do jump serves as well.  Table tennis is just plain awesome!  You can direct shots toward any part of the table.  It's actually important where you stand in relation to the table.  You can't just swing your arm.  If the person hits a ball wide, you actually have to step or jump to the side to reach the ball.  There are some many great events in Kinect Sports and this is supposed to be a review of the Kinect itself so I won't go much further.Some activities are just so much better without holding something in your hands.  Like when you're dancing or exercising.  Like with the Wii EA Sports Active, I had to have the nunchuk strapped to my leg!  And who wants to hold a remote in your hand when you're dancing?  And forget about batteries!  Since there's no controllers, there's no batteries!But one more thing about Kinect games.  Just like all Xbox games, there is plenty of online multiplayer!  As great as the Wii games were, most of them depended on people coming to your house to play.  But with the Xbox, you can play any of the games online against real people.  Nothing better than 2 on 2 in volleyball or table tennis!One last thing about the Kinect.  It is a very social system.  Not only can you play games online against real people, the Kinect takes pictures and videos of you while you play!  And once it takes these pictures/videos, you can send them to your private account or directly to Facebook from within the game.  You're completely in control of which pictures/videos to save and which to upload.If there's a negative, you can't use the Kinect is a small space like the bedroom.  You need 6-10 feet of space between you and the TV.  It's not a hard number.  Some games let you keep playing if you're standing 4-5 feet away but other games will pause and tell you to step back.  Remember, the higher the Kinect is, the closer you can stand to the TV (since the higher the Kinect, the easier it is for the Kinect to see your whole body and the floor).  And since Kinect is multiplayer, you do have to be aware of the person next to you.  We all remember Wii videos of people hitting each other in the head.  Well, now, you can also kick them.  I knocked my brother's glasses off once.  And if you have low ceilings and/or ceiling fans above you, you do need to be aware that a lot of Kinect games want you to jump.  There are already videos of peoples arms hitting their ceiling fans.I can't recommend the Kinect highly enough.  The proof is in the pudding.  Go try out the Kinect and try to forget your Wii/Move tendencies (such as just moving your arms), and you'll see how magical it feels to move your whole body.  If you've seen all the hacking videos with Kinect, you know the possibilities with Kinect are endless.  They're already talking about hybrid Kinect games where you use a game controller to control the game but can use hand motions to throw grenades or issue hand signals or control a virtual HUD in a cockpit.  If you lost that magic you had when you and your family first started playing Wii, the magic will come back when you try the Kinect.  It did for me.  I still really like my Wii.  But after awhile, the low-end graphics, the limited gameplay, and the lack of online multiplayer wore on us.  We still use the Wii sometimes but more often then not, it's just for parties.  But now everyone is excited again about the Kinect.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2010"}

The design is sleek, attractive and ergonomic. The screen is colorful and sharp and the interface is sensible and easy to use. The sound quality is fantastic as well, both from the speakers and from headphones. After purchasing the Vita, once I picked up my 3DS again it felt old, outdated and of lower quality (build, sound, graphics, screens etc). Of course, the 3DS has a fantastic selection of games, so it still has that going for it. Sony is way ahead of Nintendo when it comes to online interactions and UI design. It was easy to set up everything in the Vita and I had no problem figuring out where everything was and what it did.Now, the problem is that the Vita lacks titles. For me, there is only ONE good Vita title (Persona 4: Golden), aside from remakes such as FFX. However, the system was still worth it because of the PS Store, which is constantly expanding. The PS One and PSP games generally look great on the system (though not all of them do). Tactics Ogre and Fina Fantasy 9 for example look and sound amazing. There are also some ways to get PS store games onto the Vita through your PS3, so if you have a PS3, that's another advantage. I strongly prefer these games on the Vita to my PS3 because I'm not glued to the couch in front of the TV and I can use headphones. If, however, you prefer TV play to the handheld, then this may not be worth it.So, these are the only problems with the Vita:1) It's expensive ($$$ memory card)2) You should probably get a case (doesn't flip shut like the DS or 3DS)3) There are almost no good Vita games yet (but plenty of great downloadable classics)...but if you have the slightest desire to play the old, phenomenal PS1 (and a few PS2) games on a beautiful handheld system then this is a must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2014"}

I Played the first Dead Rising and got the 53, and whatever zombie achievement, I leveled Frank all the way up, etc. etc. In short, it was fun, I found myself killing Zombies just to pass the time. The question was, did they do anything better in Dead Rising 2. 25 achievements, and 3 playthroughs later, i find myself perplexed with the inability to come up with a definite 'yes' or 'no' to that question.In Dead Rising 2, you Play an Ex motocross Champion Chuck Greene. Chuck was in the Las Vegas Outbreak, and the incident claims his wife and almost claims his child. Since the last Dead Rising, a new drug called \"Zombrex\" has been invented, it temporarily delays the change into a Zombie by 24 hours. Problem is, Its EXPENSIVE, Chuck has to do some weird crap to make enough money to buy the stuff so his little girl, Katey doesn't try to eat him or the cat at home. Chuck ends up in Fortune City in a game called TIR (Terror Is Reality) to participate in a Zombie killing-fest game to earn cash for Zombrex. During the games, a Zombie outbreak occurs, and Chuck and Katey now have to survive until the military get there, 3 days from now. You have three days, in a Fortune City Casino Strip Mall, Katey Has no Zombrex, and You have been blamed for the outbreak. Chuck's life, Katey's life, and countless others' lives are in your sweaty hands. Think you're up to find the truth? Well, lets find out if you'll even want to first.What's Good:Graphics:Dead Rising 2 isn't the cream of the crop in visuals, but then, most games can't boast hundreds of zombies all moving with no hiccups in framerate. Its impressive, its immersive, the graphics are great really, Capcom really brought fortune city to life, (and ironically death). Zombies are animated wonderfully, and they come apart into pieces even better in this one than the last. Its just fun to kill them because it's so fun to watch them come apart (i note HOLD B broadsword's damage). Though occasionally i had hiccups with explosions while mowing down large crowds of zombies in the 4X4, on foot, never one.The Story:DR2 gives you a reason to care, Katey's so darn cute and lovable, plus Chuck himself is generally respectable. He's been wronged and he has to find a way out of this. The story is engaging, and it definitely is not a rehash of the last DR. The story feels unique, and some of the endings, are very powerful. I Strongly recommend beating the game multiple times to see them all. That said its quite bland too, its predictable at times. Still its a good story, and it doesn't really fall into \"Dawn of the Dead\" kind of stuff.The Controls:The biggest Gripe I had on DR1 was Frank Himself, he controlled, in my opinion very awkward, took some getting used to. But chuck is more fluid in his movements. He feels less clunky (and he doesn't look old when he runs). Chuck can aim guns with the left trigger, and drives with the right. Get what i'm saying? The game adopted general standards, it behaves like a racing game in a car or bike, and it behaves like a TPS when you have a gun (LT aim RT fire) Sweet! Now you can just shoot or just drive. All in all, the button mappings and Chuck's movements do what you expect, when you expect them.Weapons:DR2 introduces custom weapons, called Combo Weapons. Combo Weapons are weapons made from two different Weapons, such as a Box of Nails and a Baseball Bat. Combine the two in the conveniently placed Maintenance rooms to create a Nail Bat, it does more damage, it gives you PP, and it lasts longer than an ordinary Baseball Bat. Great addition, and some of the combination are zany and just ridiculous. But most of them are very fun.Multiplayer:Make money and Kill zombies on a crazy gameshow online with thousands of people over XBL on TIR or simply add a second Chuck to the game you're playing and kick some Zombie butt together. Awesome idea, just really hoped for split screen. oh well.Zombrex:The Zombrex finding missions are good, they're a mixed bag because they are a bit tedious, but the game does get you all four you need without you going ballistic, and tells you int he watch menu which missions will give you Zombrex.I Liked Katey's character, and i didn't want her to die, so was glad i didn't have to pull my hair out to find Zombrex.What i thought needed improvement:Saving:DR2 drastically improved saving, now there is a bathroom in every area. But honestly i'd have preferred it a save anywhere system. As is, it is better than fine, but my main qualm is that sense of \"i'm Saving Now\" there are no Zombies in the bathroom, and there would be the way they have it set up. I'd have preferred it if there was an air-duct in every area going to the safe house in some way to give that \"there is one safe place\" feel. But its minor at best, the save system is ok, just USE IT for your sake.Low levels:This is the biggest problem i have, tight quarters, 4 bars of life, hundreds of Zombies, you're slow as molasses, and zombies like to grab you. You will die, quite a bit in the beginning, its annoying and i got quite angry. But once you get a Speed +, the world is a happy place. Quickstep the drink helps a lot too.LOADING:Holy crap, load load load load load load load. Ok you get me, this game loads, a LOT. Its takes up a lot of time and drastically drops immersion factor. Plus the hard drive install, doesn't really help. I mean there are times when it loads the cut scene after a cut scene it just showed. Ugh, i got very impatient waiting so much.Psychopaths:The first Psychos in DR1 seemed easier than these guys, these guys are made of steel, are faster than bullets and do ridiculous damage compared to the first one. Holy crap the psychos are hard in DR2, and they just don't have the same feel to the battles as DR1 it was more about just figuring out how to kill them in DR1 not running around and waiting till they get tired and hit them with a shotgun blast that does like a smidge of health damage. Then repeat until dead. I remember in 1, if you had a good weapon you could easily overpower certain psychos, in this one, their psychotic behavior somehow gives them the ability to withstand an atomic bomb. Its ridiculous, and frustrating especially at low levels, btw any one hit kill attacks will not work on psychos, it won't even land. (That's why the charge up sledgehammer move won't hit them if you're wondering.)Time:There never seems to be enough, its a constant juggle of do this, do this, get to the safe house then, kill stuff, kill this guy, crap I'm gonna lose this survivor AGGGGH! Yeah, it will give you Grey hairs if you let it overwhelm you. I think they could have removed some urgency and it would have been more fun. More time to kill stuff = good.All in all though, Dead Rising is more of the same but much better, its more playable, it feels longer, has more replay value, and can let you kill Zombies with friends. it has a few problems but what game doesn't? Its definitely worth at least a play if you like violent games, like zombies, or you like platforming type games, even Shooters. Its worth a rent if you're unsure. If you liked Dead Rising 1, pick it up. If you didn't because of the saving and that kind of thing but thought it was fun, rent this one and try it out. If you loathed DR1, you'll hate this too. Its a lot of fun if you like this sort of stuff, i recommend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2010"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"From The Wastelands to the Borderlands (this is a mash up both done well)","reviewText":"The flood of great games over the last two years I believe has spoiled many gamers.  It's easy to tear apart new experiences because they are similar or different than what you have done before.  Maybe you beat Fallout 3 times and saw every morsel of dirt to be seen, maybe you leveled up in borderlands all the way up to 69 (I think this is the level cap).  If so I can understand not finding RAGE a completely new experience.  Maybe this is why it has garnered some mixed attention. Some like it because it doesn't attempt to be an RPG clone of Fallout (or many games coming out these days  Morality choices to lead you down the \"good\" or the \"bad\" path with a wheel of abilities to craft your hero.This is not what RAGE is all about.  It does not attempt to be anything else but a shooter with some decent driving elements.  You won't level up or become the next Wasteland Champion.  No,  RAGE is all about exploring the worlds that Bethesda painfully created and shooting a bunch of mutants along the way.  If you go into this game expecting that...  You will come out enjoying a great gaming experience.  Now that I have explained what the game is... How does it do at achieving its goal...?1. At the top of my list are the graphics  5/5...  This is a truly beautiful game.  Stop on the way to the first Ghost camp and look at the detail in the \"metal trees\" the mutants created around their base.  It takes you to a different place and emerses you in the detail.  I caught myself MANY TIMES!!!  Looking around at the textures and sites of this new world (er.. old world).  This is no doubt one of the best polished games out there. It is beautiful.  Personally I can live with the 3 discs on the 360 version but I bet it looks great on the PS3 as well.  This is a big draw and reason to spend some time here. The mutants are varied and animations are quite well done.  It's really cool to see the mutant you just shot limping over to you for one last attack before you blow his helmet off and then seal the deal with a headshot. The targeting system was top notch and I felt my shots were true... Especially when using the scope. Good stuff. Fun.2. Gameplay 4/53. Fun Factor 5/5I give it 4 on gameplay because of the lack of a meaningful character creation system or anything that would allow you to cusomize the look of your character.  Not a big deal but we are in 2011 and in case Bethesda forgot to check- it's a pretty popular ingredient in modern gaming to be able to build your character based on choice.  This is not that animal here. There is no real ability system to speak of outside of buying new items at the merchant locations. So the gameplay (while fun) reminded me of some of your last generation shooters that focused on gameplay and firefights more than customization.That is not to say that the guns and upgrades you find by completing quests from NPCS do help add the feel of customization but it's aesthetic at best.  This is a pure by the numbers shooter (much like you remember when you played DOOM all those years ago).  Experience the enemies, the world, and the Weapons. Cut.... repeat.Story 3/5I should really fault this game for not having much in the way of a story (as I like a good story) but the gameplay is good and the NPC quests keep you on the path from one objective to another.  This certainly could have been improved as there is a wonderful world that use some history to make us understand why we are in this apocolypse anyway.  I didn't fault several recent games for lack of story (I'm looking squarely at you Dead Island!) It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and the gamer should treat it that way to properly enjoy the game.Controls 3/5  eh... It's about what you'd expect. Not bad- not groundbreaking either.In short, let it be what it is and you will have a great time shooting down the denizens of the wasteland of RAGE... Hope this helps in your decision..  Thank you for reading.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

Over 20 charachters, great movement and game speed, and some new stuff that add up to the experience.If youve never played fighting games, or have done it only eventually, SF4 is gonna be very tough on you. This is no begginers game. This seem to have been made for street fighters fans. Some people complain about it, I actually LOVE IT. If its hard for you, change the difficulty level to very easy.There are some very minor things to critique though. The background worlds dont excell in graphics, even if theyre 3D. And, when youre playing arcade against the tough guys, I believe the game brakes its own rules putting you in disadvantage. Ive seen my combos ,ultra combos and focus attacks broken by a  low punch wich is frustrating. I think SF has to be like a good game of chess, both players have to have the same tools and pieces against each other.Overall, FOR ME, this is definately, the best fighting game of the decade.

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world.

As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

Your \"character\" simply is exceedingly slow, there is little jaggies or system level slowness.  If you have played something like everquest or WoW, think of it like this; running in Morrowind is at the speed of walking in those games, and walking in Morrowind is about half that speed.Also, the \"since of wonder\" at seeing stars is old, been done everywhere and doesn't impress.  Walking down a road and seeing a door stuck in the side of a mountain means \"dungeon\" in morrowind...there is no since of wander, the dungeons are doors in the side of a mountain.finally, if you want to buy this thing go ahead, clearly it appeals to some people.  I rate it as one of the worst games I've ever spent money on and furthers my belief that if a game doesn't  over a demo then there is some reason they are hiding it until after you make the purchase.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2005"}

Still, pretty decent game, if a little too similiar to the other 3","reviewText":"The fourth installment in the classic Mega Man series introduces a new villain, Dr. Cossack, a Russian scientist who has taken over as resident mad scientist bent on taking over the world.  Capcom released the game in 1992 to moderate success.Between MEGA MAN III and this game, Capcom considered taking Mega Man to the SNES, but decided to delay Mega Man's arrival to the new console for a further two years.  There is some debate about this, but the general consensus in the gaming community is that Capcom made the last three NES Mega Man games because they were easy games to make, the development team knew had to make a good product, they were cheap to make, and would provide a steady income for the company.  While it is true the second trilogy of MM games, while not nearly as good as the first (simply because the formula wasn't so tired and stale by that time) are very good games, they are completely overshadowed by the first trilogy.The storyline is rather simple, but then, most NES games didn't have the most complex storylines to boast (most involve an evil lizard king and a kidnapped princess).  It turns out after you defeat Dr. Cossack, Proto Man shows up with the good doctor's Kalinka.  Proto Man reveals that Dr. Wily is behind this world domination attempt (yet again), and he kidnapped Cossack's daughter and forced Cossack to build the eight robots.  After you defeat Cossack, Mega Man sees Dr. Wily, and chases him into a newly constructed Skull Castle.  For an NES game, the storyline isn't that bad, but unfortunately Capcom would use the exact same device for MM V and MM VI as well.  This I refer to as the Fake Villain Trilogy.Following the masterpieces that are MM II and MM III, this game, while a good game in and of itself, feels simply like more of the same, and there's not any drastic changes in game play, although there are several new features.*Mega Man can now charge the \"Mega Buster\", to fire a more powerful shot.*Two new items are introduced: A grappling hook known as the Wire Adapter and a Balloon Dispenser (Ballon Adapter).  These items have not appeared in any other game.*Fliptop (Eddie), a helpful robot, is introduced and gives you random powerups in certain stages.*Unfortunately, passwords no longer save your accumulated Energy Tanks*Like the first game, you can now reenter levels to replay them, a feature absent from MM II and MMIII; however, the boss lair is now empty.*Also the first game since MM II to have forced scrolling in one of the levels.There are several similarities between this and MM II.  The fanfare for level intros and when you defeat the robot masters are very similar to the corresponding music in MM II.  Also, Dr. Wily's last stage is shaped like an L, and while II has acid drips you must avoid, MM IV's level has robo slugs the player can use to rebuild their weapon supply and energy.  MM VI has this same L shape on the last Dr. Wily level, but in that game the level is much more varied.  Like MM II, when you finally do confront Dr. Wily, the final battle takes place in a darkened lab room.Overall, the Robot Masters are rather imaginative, and the levels well designed.  Pharaoh Man is probably the hardest robot master of all six NES games, and has a very powerful weapon.  Skull Man is pretty cool.  Drill Man is a little derivative of Hard Man from MM III, but still a good design. of. The other Robot Masters (Toad Man, Dust Man, Dive Man, Bright Man, and Ring Man) are fortunately pretty original, and it's clear Capcom hasn't come to the bottom of the barrel as far as ideas for Robot Masters go just yet.For those who like the first MM trilogy, this is certainly a worthwhile game to play.  But as good as the second trilogy is, the first trilogy is great, and it's those games you should turn too if you really want to play the best of the classic series.  The second trilogy is just largely a repeat of the first trilogy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2007"}
{"product_name":"B000FQBPDU","description":"You ARE Samus with Wii control! By moving around with the Nunchuk and aiming Samus's gun with the Wii Remote, you'll do more than look through the eyes of Samus&#8212;you'll experience a quantum leap in first-person control. Fire on the run, grapple enemies and yank off their shields, or manipulate machinery with movements of the Nunchuk and Wii Remote&#8212;it all adds up to a level of immersion only possible on the Nintendo Wii, and the best first-person controls on any platform, period. **  Corruption is everywhere... Dark Samus, Samus's longtime nemesis, is corrupting entire planets by launching enormous seeds called Leviathans into them. Samus must travel to multiple planets&#8212;each with unique alien landscapes and dangers&#8212;to fight the corruption and track several other bounty hunters, all the while fighting the spreading Phazon that threatens to take over her body completely. As it corrupts her, it also grants her incredible powers...  **  Enter Hypermode! Samus will employ a never-before-used device called a Phazon Enhancement Device (P.E.D) that harnesses the Phazon within her and puts her into a state called Hypermode. In Hypermode, Samus can destroy Phazon impediments and annihilate enemies with superpowered weapons...but it drains her health to use it, and she risks utter corruption if she doesn't empty her Phazon meter within a certain time frame. You'll need to carefully balance your need for ultimate power with the inherent danger of corruption.","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A great title, but the control isn't all its cracked up to be...","reviewText":"I managed to purchase \"Metroid Prime 3\" yesterday, and after one night of play, I can say that it's a very strong title. The game continues the story of bounty hunter Samus Aran...somehow. I don't really know, and don't really care. The games really exist apart, and their story is fairly minimal.The first addition I am pleased with are the voices. Nintendo seemed allergic to voice on its GameCube titles, opting instead for some weird combinations of grunts and sighs. It was OK for Metroid, because usually you interacted with aliens anyway. Now, however, we hear the voices of humanity, and they sound good. Not great, but perfectly adequate.The graphics are solid, but not nearly as stellar as some would have you believe. I've read numerous places that these graphics give the PS3 and XBox2 a run for their collective money - it's a lie. Still,  the scenery is crisp, the characters look organic in their environments, and all in all, it is aesthetically pleasing.The control scheme is...perplexing. The placement of the buttons on the Wii controller often leave much to be desired (firing a missile by pressing down on the crosspad is particularly annoying, since missiles are so important in the quest). The jump and fire buttons seem backward to me. Using the point-and-click method to fire is excellent, but using the Wii remote to turn your character is frustrating - in the heat of a pitched battle (such as the first dangerous boss fight against Iceman), you will find yourself often tracking off of the screen, wasting valuable time in the process. In general, there is some fine-tuning missing here, and this is why I drop the game's rating one star. Essentially, the game sometimes moves too fast for the controller. It makes for a frantic experience, but it is frustrating for the precision gamer.The bosses (well, at least the first few) are great. You'll see some new faces (the Iceman encounter is incredible), and some old favorites. But all in all, they are very imaginative, and very fun to fight.Travel has been VASTLY improved. Although backtracking remains necessary, the game has a built-in teleport feature, via Samus' ship. Each world has a few landing points, and any landing point may be used as a jumping off point to any other area. Excellent job, guys! Metroid Prime 2 was incredibly painful precisely BECAUSE of this backtracking. It doesn't seem to be a problem here.The game has a nice extra system, for those interested. Rather than being forced to finish an entire game, or find EVERY scan in the game, each triumph brings a little reward in the form of a credit. These credits are then used to purchase extras such as music, artwork, etc. There is also some \"friend\" system in place, but I haven't used it at all (I don't even have my Wii online).So, long story longer, this is a great game. I'm not sure it's the masterpiece some are making it to be, but it's the most solid Metroid Prime title to date. However, the controls are quite annoying.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2007"}

I had high hopes for Madden 10, and it has so far surpassed them. The game graphically looks amazing. The field, players, and coaches are recreated with great care. A game has never come closer to recreating the actual feel of watching TV. The game play is also refined in this installment. There are a few issues, but nothing that serious. The franchise is improved very nicely. There is a nice Extra Point show that adds to the fun of the Franchise. The online is also less glitchy, and plays a lot smoother. A great game and I agree with John Madden \"This one is going to be special.\"Presentation- The game has the great NFL Films music in the menus, and in the replays. The menus are pretty much the same as every other year. The little videos before the games are a nice touch, along with the great weather effects. I wish there were replays playing in the main menu, like in the Madden days of old. 4.5/5Graphics- The game looks amazing. I feel like I'm watching a real NFL game sometimes. The field, logos, players, coaches, and stadiums are very well reproduced. The turf looks fantastic with especially when the weather elements take its toll. A few of the players are a little off, but most look awesome. There is a delay sometimes in the players on the sidelines. Their textures take a few seconds to load, which is annoying. On a positive not the rain and snow on the camera is a great touch. 4.5/5Game play- This game has been refined and the passing game is much more accurate. You can fit the ball in the tight spots. The players don't morph to the ball as much as other years. The long ball is still hard to pull off, but you at least have a shot. The defenders are a little stupid sometimes and instead of picking it off they let it hit them in the face. Also the fight for the fumble is a little annoying. The running game has been put back in effectively and you can run with ease this year. This game overall plays well with only a few glitches; the passing game is a blast as you can actually throw the ball into tight spots, and thread the needle. 4.5/5Story- The franchise is very well done. It is a blast to play. The addition of the Extra Point adds to the realism along with the challenge of trading players. It's actually difficult to trade players, just like real life. There is the addition of nice Super Bowl uniforms, and players progress season to season which is nice. I would like them to bring back the newspapers, but overall a great franchise. I've already completed 4 seasons. 5/5Lasting Appeal- It's hard to say right now, but I think I'll being playing this game for a long time. It won't lose my interest like I did in Madden 09. I have finished 4 seasons and have no intention to stop anytime soon. 5/5The Verdict- This game is special. It looks better than any Madden game that has come before, and the game play has been refined nicely. There are a few game play issues, but overall it plays well and looks great. Any football fan should pick up this game. I highly recommend Madden 10. Overall 4.7/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

Everything looks so detailed, life-like, and fluid.  Motion-animation is so realistic and smooth.  If you squint your eyes little bit, I swear it looks as if you can really touch it.In terms of gameplay mechanism, this game sets out a new direction and opens up a lot of potentials and possibilities for the future of video game industry.  Everything is simply yet quite complex in execution.  Instead of having single button assigned for each task such as attack, run, and jump, single button is assigned to each hand and one for the legs.  In different situation, the reaction will be different.  In fact, all the game mechanics in this game are pretty much context-based.  It takes a little adjustment period for we are so tuned with the traditional one-button-for-one-task method, but once you get the hang of it, it is very intuitive and exciting way to execute the gameplay.So with innovative game mechanics and gorgeous graphics, this is a great game?  Unfortunately, that is not the case here.Huge gameworld where you can freely roam around anywhere anytime (although each area is divided by loading screen) and some interactivity with the environment might have you to believe this is open-ended game like 'Oblivion'.  That couldn't be further from the truth. The game is very restrictive and linear in constrast of what you might have been led to believe.  Linearity itself doesn't necessarily create the problem, but the scope of the stage the game is set and the repetition do.  The world is bustling with tons and tons of people.  But they might as well be animals or objects in this hollow world.  They are just there, period.  Yes, they react when you push them.  You can kill anyone.  But that's it.  No quest given by NPC as in 'Oblivion', no side quest to perform like 'GTA', no dialogue options like 'The Witcher' (you cannot talk to them, period), they are truly monotonous, and this makes the world so distant and hollow.  And all of the assassination mission are exactly identical.  I mean exactly the same.  The only difference is the character you are to eliminate and the cutscene involving the mission.  The only thing non-linear about this whole game is who you are going to kill first and which entry point you are going to take.  That's all, folks!!!  To make the matter worse, it just takes forever to get between one mission and the next without much activities.  You have this huge world, and you have nothing better to do than to walk, run, ride horse, or engage with people in combat.  There is no incentive to traverse and explore or to kill people.  What little storyline and plot twist (if you can call it one) is all marred by this insanely boring and alienating tasks.  There is no sense of urgency or danger.  Especially if you die, the game automatically load fresh start from the automatically saved game.  Sometimes linearity works a lot better and this game is one of them.  It will bring out some sense of structure and intensity sorely missing in the game.In a nutshell, you are a medieval Spidey jumping from rooftop to rooftop and kill baddies and rescue some helpless citizens from the same baddies.For a game of this much production value, art direction, innovative game mechanics, and beeeaaaaauuuuutiful graphics, it is really a letdown to see the gameplay makes you really boring.There are many elements people would love in this game, and the opinion is subjective.  This is by no mean a bad game.  Actually a quite well-made product.  But in the end, what could have been a truly mind-bending, innovative game that combines the stealth action of 'Splinter Cell' and platform action of 'Prince of Persia' (both immensely popular games from 'Ubisoft'), 'Assassin's Creed' feels like a big tease of what is to come in the near future.(((((PS3 OWNERS)))))There is no issue with this version of the game.  In fact, better framerate and better graphic overall than 360 except some constrast ratio.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2007"}

Ram","summary":"Imagination Runs Wild!","reviewText":"Right from the intro screen, this game draws you in. The whole experience is highly creative, and though it can be short, sharing levels and designs (and searching for every item and bonus level) adds lots of replay value.A few notes:- Like any platformer (including the Mario series, which obviously inspired a lot in this game), LBP can be somewhat uneven. Most of the game goes by fairly briskly, but several levels has areas that can be very frustrating. It's not so much that the sections are difficult; it's more that the controls can be imprecise and sometimes gameplay aspects aren't always clear. For instance, one of the levels has you jumping on rotating barrels over a lava pit. I tried that same area probably 20 times (you get four \"lives\" per checkpoint) before realizing I could grab onto the barrels, making it much easier to navigate between them. And while the last few levels are supposed to be challenging, there are some parts that have to be replayed dozens of times before you finally get through them (plus if you lose the four lives, you have to replay the ENTIRE level just to get back to that point, which really annoyed me).- While the 3D aspect of the game (where you can jump between the foreground and background) is generally well done, at times it isn't clear whether some things in the background are \"solid\" or just there for decoration, and sometimes you'll get killed when the game doesn't register that you want to jump down rather than just stand at the edge of a platform. Super Mario Galaxy was more precise in this aspect, even considering the awkward controller.- The first few levels feature a narrator who helps you along the way and points out new powers and such, but he disappears for the rest of the game.- Every level is filled with decorations and materials that you can use in the level creator, which extends the gameplay considerably. There are also keys in several levels that lead to bonus stages - these can be fun, but I'd prefer another regular level or two (maybe another ninja level, as those were great!).- There are places where playing with another person (or more) can net you even more bonuses.- You can also find clothing and such to create multiple puppet designs. Mine included a zombie, homeboy and fairy girl (tee hee!).- The music fits every level. The settings are diverse, including versions Mexico, Japan, New York and India, and you might find yourself stopping just to hear the unique songs.If you play alone and aren't into level creation or collecting items in a game, going through it will take around 10-15 hours. Despite the problems and frustrations, you'll still enjoy the game for its quirkiness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2010"}

I was delighted  that they decided to make a game based off of that system and it does not disappoint.  The land gameplay is similar to AC3, but you do get two swords at once, which makes for some pretty cool hand to hand battle sequences.  Ubisoft has even allowed people to rate each mission for feedback so that they may improve future titles in the series.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

They are both ambitious in their own right, but Infamous is definitely the game that works well on many levels, most effectively, the visuals. You are a superhero with an unbelievable ability to control electricity at your will and you can use it to blast enemies and be the hero, or damage the public and become the villain. Throughout your time within the game you take part in a number of different missions that influence whether you become ultimately good or evil.In the game you play as Cole McGrath, a bike courier who is given a package to deliver which explodes in his hands destroying Empire City and leaving Cole with unbelievable super powers. Cole now has the ability of electricity manipulation which he can use to shoot and blast enemies away. Cole is recognised as being at the centre of the city destroying explosion, the city turns against him, including such enemies as Reapers and Dustmen in the different districts of the city. Cole is asked by a woman called Moya to return to the city after the blast to track down her husband, John and the Ray Sphere which holds unimaginable power.The game is very strange in a lot of ways as it allows you to freely roam Empire city which can include the roof tops of any building which you can climb with ease. The look of the city is unbelievably detailed and in terms of lighting effects, is definitely the best looking game out there. As you trounce through Empire City, if you're not being shot at, you notice that the pedestrians within the city have quite a clever AI as they react to your actions. Some may resent you and retaliate if you do something evil, yet they may also praise and adore you if you do something significantly good. The very atmosphere of Empire City definitely promotes the idea of a post apocalyptic New York Downtown type area if it were to be faced with such real scenarios.The story is told very cleverly as the cut scenes that drive the story along are told in an anime, comic book style that allow the plot to remain quite dark and dismal, yet keep the comic book feel of the gameplay alive. The growth of your character is very RPG driven as you perform stunts and defeat enemies in unique ways to gain XP points which will allow you to purchase new powers and upgrades to make the game that much more fun as you travel through the story. Each time you learn a new ability, an underground mission level will allow you to try out your new ability and get used to any new mechanics you may be introduced to.Aside from the main plot missions, there are quite a number of different side quests and missions which you can use to kill the time. These consist of things such as territory gaining missions in which you will be asked by a bystander to do them a favour such as put an end to a gang war, end the pollution of the water system and save a person taken hostage by some enemies. There are also hidden package type missions in which you can collect blast shards of the explosion that destroyed Empire City and Dead Drops which are satellite dishes which contain recordings of a man you're looking for. A cool thing for the search missions are that you can use your internal electro-radar to help locate the shards and the dead drops, making it a bit easier for you to find them. Of course you have the option of making it more difficult finding them all by not using the radar.Overall, this game was an ambitious quest for the developers which ultimately delivered. Although there are a few missions that can become frustratingly difficult, the entire experience and the feeling that you will gain some form of character reward when you complete a mission makes the frustrating moments worth it. The Cole character does suffer from Christian Bale's Batman syndrome with the unnecessarily gruff voice which does become quite annoying, but is ultimately forgettable when you're used to is.This is a stunning gaming experience. Buy it. Now!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002CHIWO","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"Final Fantasy on Cube? Not quite but very unique","reviewText":"Baten Kaitos could be considered as another most anticipated RPG for Cube owners. Developed by the same minds behind Xenosaga and Chrono Cross, it could be understood why it is an anticipated title.Baten Kaitos returns to the turn base RPG but with cards. Though most card battle systems are disappointing, the card battle system in Baten Kaitos provides the player both intuitive and strategic options in the battle. Players started off with a small number of cards they card hold and wield in the battle and as they &quot;class up&quot; the number of both increased. However, a \"class up\" also change the initially infinity time limit for wielding the first card to as short as 5 seconds. That means you have to make sure you get the right cards in the decks before the battle starts, for changes are not possible once it is started. Kills are relying on combos. Pairs and same cards in no matter what order increases your chance of scoring bonus, nonetheless, it is the straight numbers, no matter ascending or descending that counts most. The numbers are written on the cards, from initially one on the right to over all four corners. A good combo can triple damage to 300% of the face values. Further different characters have different speed in finishing one move. For example Savyna is extremely fast but devastating. So if you want her to kill fast, you have to think fast for once the action of the last card is finished, the string is broken and the turn is finished.On top of that, the elemental factor plays a huge part in the game. To improve your kills, you have to have the right elements in your deck. So fire against water and vice versa. Nonetheless, in terms of defence, it is more difficult to predict for a water based enemy could cause more than one elemental damage, which mean you might need different armours to protect yourself, especially if the attacks on you are multiple.The downside of this card system is the randomness in the cards available in each round. There could be a chance that you only have attack cards in your defence round, which means if your attack cards can't act as defence cards, you would just be standing there to be hit. Of course you can forfeit certain cards to hope that defence cards will come up, but that will also mean that you are losing attack cards in the next round.Cards in the game could be purchased from shops but prices are steep. So the best will be getting them from the enemies. However, this would require players to spend huge amount of time to create their dream decks. Certain enemies drop certain cards repeatedly, so you can decide whether you would want to stay in one area for a long time just to level up your character and your cards.Levelling up is done through visiting the church. Level up, as mentioned is by experience points but class up requires certain items that you could find throughout the adventure.In terms of dungeons designs, there are areas that could be annoying especially considering your enemies will reappear if you leave one place and go back later. There are a number of dungeons requiring backtracking, which if you are not a levelling up fan you could find it annoying. Puzzles are pretty straight forward though. The graphic designs are lavishing and full of style. Different islands have different cultures and they are fully exhibited and exploited. Every bit of details that you could think about were attended to. The only downside is some of the non playable characters are quite unobvious that you can't see them. This would be annoying when you need to finish certain side quests. The opening scene is phenomenal and can rival to all current FF series.Story wise, it is in fact very clich&eacute; and there are some really annoying bits. It is very typical Japanese style and some of the chauvinistic aspect would put some people off. Nonetheless, having said that there are still a number of twists that could impress you a lot in the plot. However, it is quite linear at certain points for you won't be able to do anything but what you are asked to do. The most innovative part comes in when you are actually playing the role of a guardian spirit. Characters will ask you for your opinion and advice and a good advice could increase your tie with your character. This improves the interactivity of the game.In the department of music, the tunes are well composed but they are recycled too many times in the game. Sometimes after listening to the same tune again and again in different areas you would just want to switch the music off. The voice acting is even worse with cheeky tones connecting cheeky conversation, the best solution will be turn the voice off, though you still could not cut the voice off in battles, as you could do with Arc The Lac.In all Baten Kaitos does offer a whole lot of good game plays. The battle system is good and the side quests are interesting, though pretty standard. It is more interactive and it definitely offers a different and unique experience in game plays. However, the story itself and the voice acting taxed out quite a bit of the game. Hopefully in the remaining a year or so for the Cube before the Revolution, Nintendo would be releasing more new and good RPG titles. Probably a lot of Cubers are looking forward to Zelda, Advance Wars on GC, Fire Emblem and Golden Sun. But at the meantime, just enjoy a good game with Baten Kaitos.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2005"}

I don't mean to alarm anyone here, but this game requires the use of... a FRIEND!  That's right!  If you manage to locate another person who will play the game with you at the same time, it actually works really really well!My buddies and I freakin' LOVE this game.  It is fantastic.  Unlike, say, Resistance:  Fall of Man (also great) this feels more like a tactical combat system - you cannot simply charge in blazing away and hope for the best.  There is no auto-aiming, you are going to have to actually hit people directly, with weapons that rarely have an area of effect.  That's where the *two player* element comes in; unless you cover each other and work together, you are going to die.  But if you do, the delights and rewards are many.  Through the use of the \"aggro\" system, you can get foes to focus on you as the primary threat by shooting at them with heavy weapons or killing several of them quickly, freeing your partner up to flank them.  Using cover is a must - enemy foes are good shots and will in turn try to flank you.  The multitude of weapons is a joy - and they can and must be upgraded with cash you earn through missions.  By attaching new barrels, stocks, and front mount shields you can turn a relatively innocent sub-machinegun into a highly accurate instrument of death.  Sniper rifles go from jerky, breathing-affected rifles to smooth, long range telescopic scoped murder devices.  It's awesome.Again, this is a game that requires you to work together with a human partner.  Often you will see enemies run by or dive into cover and not be able to get a shot off in time by yourself.  That's life.  Tell your friend where they went and work together to take them down.  It's also why God invented hand grenades and the ability to dive into cover of your own.  You can even shoot guns over your head while staying under cover, what's not to love?  I've had sequences in this game in which I've used a sniper rifle to kill an enemy sniper, immediately switched to a combat shotgun to take out guys trying to overrun my position, grabbed a soldier dropping onto my position by helicopter by the throat and headbutted him to death, and then tossed a grenade into a nearby upper story structure to rescue my partner.  In perhaps 10 seconds.  That's a fun game.  And even if one of you goes down, you can still fight!  There's nothing like dragging your buddy out of the line of fire while shooting back over your shoulder wildly to keep enemies back - and the guy you're dragging can even keep shooting as well until he's patched up enough to walk!This game is probably my favorite PS3 game so far.  It has to be played with a friend, and as a team.  Once it is, it really blossoms into something special.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JBL4","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Better Left to Nostalgia","reviewText":"Like many of the other folks rating Duke Nukem Forever, yes I am a fan of the original Duke Nukem game from the mid-to-late 1990's. The original game ranks up with classic PC games such as Doom, Wolfenstein and Quake. Duke differed from the pack by bringing a crude sense of humor, girls... and parody's of pop culture icons.Duke Nukem Forever wasn't ever really a game that I can say I was anticipated highly. During the incredibly long development life simply moved on and the memories of my adventures with Duke Nukem faded. After DNF was finally released I was interested if only for my history with the series but a rash of terrible reviews kept me away. Part of me wishes I had. Now my memories of playing Duke after class in the `90s will always carry some of the tarnish of DNF. I'm not sure what's changed - gaming or me, and quite possibly both - but DNF was not an enjoyable game.The first thing anyone will likely notice is the graphics. They're not great but not terrible either. This isn't Crysis for certain. Still to give DNF a pass simply b/c \"graphics aren't everything\" is unfair to all other modern games that are rated against the same scale. More could've definitely been done. Levels are pretty bland, colors are frequently washed out and the character models aren't great.Gameplay is about what you'd expect in a shooter. No fancy mechanics or surprises here. Most levels are a straight run from start to finish. There are some extra frustrating bits whenever Duke gets shrunken down to miniature size (why the development team even thought this was a good idea is beyond me). Throw in a few driving segments and a few mounted gun segments and you have a by the book, A-B-C, 1-2-3 video game.The big allure of Duke seems to be the celebrity behind the series. Well in 14 years or so since the original was released Duke has become a relic of the past and DNF hasn't done well to reestablish the series as a premier game. Duke's jokes and mannerisms are the stuff of Bevis and Butthead. If belching, farting, scratching jokes make you giggle then you might be the target demographic. Even then those few crude chuckles come wrapped in a completely mediocre and forgettable package.For about $10 you can get your very own copy of DNF. Personally I sort of wish I'd left my childhood memories of playing the original Duke Nukem alone instead of trying to relive those moments in DNF.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2012"}

I bought a PS Move and a gun attachment just for the soul purpose of playing this game. Alot of F bombs in this game from Isaac so if you're a parent and are thinking about buying this game for your child, you might want to push mute during the cut scenes. lol. Also there's alot of violence and gore. I've never played the Wii version but this one is obviously the version to get because of it's improved graphics and sound and a few bonus features so i might not even bother getting it for the Wii. I'm about half way through the game but the stages arent that long and the bosses repeat their tactics making it easy to defeat them. It's a fast paced game with a variety of different looking zombies. I'm playing it alone but i'm sure it's a blast with 2 players. This is the kind of game that you could spend a weekend playing and enjoying with a few buddies. It's a straight arcade style game of course and you don't move the character which can be a pain at times because sometimes i see special items i could shoot but the character moves around so much that i miss out on alot of them. Replay value is little to none. I mean you can play through to save up enough money to get all the guns in the game and unlock some 3d models but after that, this is a game that will be played every now and then. The comedy in the game is somewhat funny. It's like a cheesy C list parody of any or every zombie movie that's ever been made. The environments and levels look pretty cool. It's easy to calibrate the PS Move controller and yes, you can play this game with the regualar PS3 controller but it's not highly recommended because it's just not as fun when playing the game that way. Anyways, i bought this game for like 15 bucks and it's definitely worth the price in my opinion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2013"}

So, they threw this game in the frothing mouths of gamers and from what has been see so far, has received some relative acclaim. Brute Force takes place in the future in which the Terran Confederation uses special operation groups to maintain order and 'take care of business' so to speak across the Galaxy. This group is comprised of four individuals dangerous on their own, but deadly as a team. Tex, who you start out with and generally most gamers will form an affinity with, is the squads heavy assault trooper designated to do one simple job, [destroy] everything. He has the best ability to soak up damage and dish it out as well, carrying only the heaviest weapons. Brutus, a Ferix, who is second added to your team is the all around trooper, capable of using his alien-borne gift to sense heat and [destroy]without the need of a weapon. Hawk is a covert specialist in recon, third added to your team. She is the lightest, fastest and takes damage easiest. Flint, being the last member added to your team, is the sniper who with steady hands and far-sight can take enemies out so fast it can make their heads spin, literally. Playability equals that of a third-person view Halo. If you have played Halo, the controls will come second nature and you can lose yourself easily in the game. Music is usually defeaned out by the heavy gun-fire and superb dialogue given throughout the game, with ambient sounds unique to each world making you wish for 5.1 Dolby. Replay value is relatively high with co-op for up to four players in a campaign able to jump in and out at any time as well as system link capabilities, this game is worth the...price tag. Also, and finally, to ease the fears of gamers, the AI is sufficient to where your squadmates can handle themselves in combat, just keep an eye on them in situations where stealth is more than a necessity. With an over-satisfactory gaming experience and a gore factor that had an M-rating impressed on it compared to other games I've seen, this is a must-buy game that'll keep any gaming from frothing at the mouth for Halo 2, at least for a little while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2003"}

Well the answer is yes and no. When you start out the game driving through the flat desert plains of Africa it feels more like Far Cry then RE, once you enter the small village look around and get right into the action it does have a nice atmosphere, but not the overall creep, and unerving one that we've all come to know and love. The first thing you'll notice about the game are the Gears of War type visauls via Chris Redfield and his bulging biceps and even the way he holds his gun and kicks open a door which btw they took directly from Gears. Your surroundings are untterly beautiful with this being some of the best graphics you'll see on any game this year. Now onto the gameplay. Well its the typical point and shoot, run and gun down the zombie gameplay you had with RE4 which in my opinion can never be touched. RE5 gameplay is much the same but a bit sloppier mainly because of your new partnet that follows you around like a little lost puppy. Don't get me wrong she comes in \"very\" handy in moments where your out numbered but can be a royal pain in the butt when it comes to making her pick up ammo, or making her get out of the way in certain tight areas. Also you'll notice there is a new stomp feature once the zombie hits the ground your given the option to kick it while its down, this obviously inspired by \"Dead Space\" but not nearly as affective seeing the the zombies head doesnt crush, he simply dies. Also there is a good touch of the game \"Dark Sector\" which in my opinion plays out a lot better control wise than RE5, when you play you'll just sense it. The new cover system is \"ok\" it does work but you very seldom ever really need it.Sound wise the game is pretty basic the locals scream in a foreign language, dogs howl with broke open faces, and demon reptiles screach at you from the skies, enemies are all unique and bosses seem old yet new. The dialogue is the usual cheesy cut scene RE hooply, and the story well is just basic and kind of cliche'. So with all this being said why do i give it a 4? Well this is the first RE game to grace a console in about 4 years or so and i've played RE4 to death so it does seem fresh and it is a lot of fun even if its not what i expected after many delays and controversy over the subject matter. By the way ive never read one article or seen one youtube video of ANYBODY claiming this game is racist. Matter of fact a young tall black boy stood behind me at gamestop at midnight for its release and we talked about the demo and how we thought it was ok and hoped the game was better, so hmm guess not everyone if anyone thinks the game is racist. So why this isnt going to be up for game of the year,(maybe sales wise) like i said its a nice new addition to the series even if it does lack that creepy, mansion, graveyard, dark forest material that we all wanted. So if you want by it, i think anyone will be taken in by the visuals alone and still get addicted to the great gameplay and staying alive that RE5 does have to offer. Dispite some of the bad RE5 does have some very \"tense\" moments and is worth of picking up a copy for various reasons.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2009"}

Single player has givin' me hours of fun whether i'm following the story and completing missions or just roaming the city acting like a maniac.  The multiplayer's been a source of a lot of fun too.  My main complaints about the multiplayer is there is no main lobby to search for open games.  Your just entered into games at random.  And that can be annoying if there's not a lot of people online.  It'll keep entering you into games with 1 or 2 people when you'd prefer a game with 16.  Another problem is the police.  Sometimes they can be very overwhelming.  And unlike all the PS2 Gta games, there is no cheat to turn police off. Why not?  How hard could it be to allow a simple cheat?  And there isn't as varied exploration as in GTA SA.  4 is basically all urban NYC.  Where as SA had plenty of different terrains.  Still a great game overall.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"The Modern Classic You've Heard Of..... Eventually","reviewText":"Is \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" a great game? --- AbsolutelyIs it playable for countless hours? --- Yes, even if you just stick the main story.Is it a 10/10, 5-star masterpiece? --- I think it's amazing, but that's nitpicking.Is it a non-stop romp from start to finish? --- Afraid not, but once it hits is stride, it never, EVER stops being an incredible game.Fans of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series sometimes forget that each of the titles since \"GTA 3\" (2001) start a little slow.  I expect to be led by the hand for a while, with a little tedious work as a lowlife criminal.  But in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", I almost gave up.  I was doing some silly taxi driving for a stupid cousin.  I was working for one Russian thug after another.  I went on numerous dates with a girl who eventually had off-camera sex with me, but there were no discernible benefits.  Even the story of our protagonist, Niko Bellic, an immigrant trying to redeem his past and make a new life in America, wasn't encouraging.But then, the game just started working for me.  I was double-crossed by another Liberty City criminal trying to make things right with the world.  I was forced to hide out in another part of the city.  There were more shops to visit, more guns to buy, and more characters to meet.  It became clear to me that \"GTA 4\" wasn't going to just move from 1 character to the next..... they were all going to be fleshed out with backstories & motivations, and play a role in the story.  Before I knew it, I was gripped with the story.Previous games in the \"GTA\" series have been incredibly fun as over-the-top experiences with a certain part of our culture.  \"GTA 3\" used the Italian mob as a catalyst.  \"Vice City\" put us in another time & place inspired by 1980s Miami.  \"San Andreas\" was an early 1990s tale putting us in the black community almost like something out of \"Boyz N The Hood\".\"Grand Theft Auto IV\" explores a different side of culture, but with more gravity and seriousness in its story.  The violence is still gloriously insane (as is the sex, drugs, and farce comedy), but you have characters behind it all that have a firmer base in reality.But don't worry, because \"GTA 4\" is still going to ask you go through some crazy crap all to make a name for yourself.  I'm afraid to give any missions away, but I will reveal that a bank robbery gone horribly wrong becomes an epic struggle to survive.  But behind the madness is Niko Bellic, a man whose capable of vicious brutality, but has a gentle moral code buried somewhere beneath his scarred soul.The gameplay is better than ever.  The gunplay is tighter.  It's not perfect, mostly because the cover mechanics could've used a little more tweaking.  But, firing away at your enemies (from by ground or vehicle) is thankfully upgraded.  Hand-to-hand combat is also solid, but not great.  Then again, you won't use it a whole lot (unless you want to).The driving takes some getting used to, because the arcade-y mechanics have been replaced with some more variety in the way the vehicles handle.  But you'll get used to it in no time, and will find your favorites as you play throughout the game.  Otherwise, you can always take a train ride or catch a cab...and watch the entire ride.  You can always skip the rides if you want, but watching the beautiful Liberty City (especially at night or in rain) is a treat.I guess this is as good a time as any to bring up the graphics.  Holy cow, they look unbelievable.  I'm told the PC version has some serious issues, and that the X-Box 360 release is very impressive.  But from own experience with the PlayStation 3, this version is incredible.  The framerate didn't slow down.  The load times were reasonably short after the initial boot-up.  I didn't even notice that much pop-up, which this series has admittedly been guilty of in past games.  And the characters are well-animated, thanks the Euphoria engine that gives life to the people that walk and plague the Liberty City streets.\"Grand Theft Auto\" has always had terrific voice acting, radio chatter, and music to listen to.  \"GTA 4\" is no exception.  Everyone is well cast, with just the right dose of lunacy and believability.  The music is very diverse, with hip-hop, new age, rap, rock, and --- my favorite --- jazz.  The stations don't make it very clear what station has what, but it's a great selection if you take the time to dig in.  Heck, there's even TV channels that you can watch in your home.Rockstar North knows how to make quality games, and even if you're not a fan of this series, you can't deny that \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" excels in presentation.  But in my opinion, they've really outdone themselves with the gameplay this time.  It's familiar enough for the longtime fans, but has enough new twists to keep it all fresh.  I've spent a lot of time on the presentation of the game, but basically, the purpose of \"Grand Theft Auto\" is to let you, the player, roam the city at will, and perform jobs for Liberty City's diverse cast of characters to advance the story.  It's basically up to you whether you want to advance the story, or if you'd rather just fool around and wreak havoc, or if you'd rather just drive a taxi and be an upstanding citizen.  It's up to you, though getting your hands dirty is recommended.  If you can stomach it, it's the best way to experience \"GTA 4\".There's so much I haven't touched on: Using the internet to get dates.  Using your cellphone to hang out with your friends and do jobs.  Avoiding the police if they spot you causing trouble.  Playing darts in a bar.  Getting drunk in a bar.  Going to a show (first the dirty disturbing Cabaret Club, later the respectable Comedy show).  There is so much to do.The only reason I'm not giving this game a 10 out of 10 is because it takes a while to get moving, even by GTA standards.  If you're new to the series, you might enjoy how the game takes its time to teach you the ins & outs, but I'd imagine some might wonder what the big deal is.  And if you're a returning gamer, I know if you stick with it you'll love it.  But just hang in there.  \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" became the masterpiece I wanted it to be.  I just had to work for a while to get it.  Just like Niko Bellic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2010"}

No interesting unlockable.- Though the gunplay is alright, but it doesn't last.

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review if for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) who usually sits on the couch and watches.I remember, many years ago, welcoming the Japanese import ofBeatmaniainto my house. Beatmania wasn't difficult for me, it was impossible. All of the dreams I never had of being a DJ were slashed. The thought of a new turntable game sent me into a panic. I knew we were going to buy this game, so when Vine offered the Demo unit, I figured it was an easy yes. Now, we'll have two turn tables (we already have aMicrophone) and the DJ battles can begin.This game (or at least the demo) is really fun! I'm not good at rhythm games, but the tutorial started me off with the basics and prepared me for what was to come. Right now, I'm playing on easy. When I move up to medium, the fade function gets added to the game, upping the difficulty a good bit. This is likely as far as I'll go. While the first two levels show the scratching symbols in any direction, hard gets more specific, forcing you to scratch with the direction of the arrows.While I'm sure this game is nothing like being a real DJ, it's still a lot of fun. There are improvements that could be made, but it's a great freshman effort. Because it's limited to two players, it will never be the party phenomenon that Rock Band is, but most games aren't.*I will update my review once I've had a chance to play and evaluate the full version of the game*","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

Lambert \"DS Player, PC gamer\"","summary":"Prepare to Enter Oblivion.....you will never be the same!","reviewText":"After a long time viewing this game, reading reviews, and looking at forums about how much of a gaming system you need to even run this, I decided to give it a try. Needless to say, my system I currently have is \"under\" the recommended system requirements. I say recommended, because the \"minimum\" will be inadequate to even get this game to run properly. There are ways around this, however (Oldblivion will alow you to run this game on older graphics cards), and this is what prompted me to buy it.I am totally hooked now by this game, and anyone who is a RPG fan will enjoy this. Below is my breakdown of the game:Highs: The graphics are outstanding (even when tweaking this game, I'm totally impressed). Gameplay is smooth and combat a major plus. Atmospheric in it's entire presentation, Oblivion draws you in. I have audibly caught my breah on several occassions playing this game. Sound is exceptional, and properly executed where appropriate. Voice acting is spot on, and the \"radiant AI\" system makes the NPC's in the game come alive. A living, breathing world is yours to enjoy at your leisure. Finish the main quest when you choose. The \"sandbox\" gaming is a pleasure to experience, and you can complete the game when you feel it's time. Many hours of playability from the side quests to just exploring the countryside are yours to do with as you please.Lows: Of course as everyone else has said, the system requirements will make your computer choke to death. Some (okay, lots) of glitchs are also around the game. Crashes are infrequent (for me, anyway), so always save your game at regular intervals. I recommend tweaking this game and getting the program \"Oldblivion\" for those of us that don't have the latest graphics cards. My machine: eMachine 2.93 ghz, 80 gb hard drive, GeForce FX5200 graphics card with Oldblivion installed and other mods to help with \"grass clipping\" and other issues. Runs at 89 fps indoors, around 30 fps outdoors (hint: turn anti aliasing OFF).Overall: Great game with a little patience on your part. Once it runs to your satisfaction, you will be hooked in to the world of Oblivion. Hours in the outside world will pass without a trace. Don't forget to eat, sleep and drink on occasion, and yes, see your family and friends. Heck, get them involved in playing, too. :o)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2007"}

I must say, after playing a game like L4D2, Riptide just blows my mind. To me, it feels like its a combination of L4D2 and Dead Rising 3 with a dash of RPG elements! It is just fantastic and I absolutely love this game. I am sure anyone who likes zombie games along with the role-playing factor, will love this game.The special edition does come with some neat DLC, and I enjoyed having it. The digital map was handy and the alternate skin was pretty neat as well.Now, I know this is a sequel to  the previous Dead Island, however after seeing the ending to the first ending and then looking at the beginning of Riptide, I just saw this game as an add-on or just a separate game. Well, anyways, that does not matter. After completing the very annoying prologue that takes 30 minutes or so, you can finally jump into the action and adventure that Dead Island Riptide has in store for you. Highly recommend to zombie lovers and those who enjoy games that are Open-World rather than level by level.Very fun with friends!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2014"}

That's all I can say.","reviewText":"This is the first game I wanted to buy when I got my Playstation, sadly, it is super rare and took my 6 months to find used. This is probably the rarest Playstation game, which is sad, because it is also one of the best.It combines classic Castlevania gameplay with RPG elements, such as the use of magic, and level points system, and a deeper storyline. Also adding to the depth is the use of money, relics that give special abilities, and a wider variety of weapons. The ability to equip weapons of your choice is a first for the series. By far the coolest is the ability to transform, you can be a bat, a wolf, or fog (!). The main character is Alucard (spell it backwards), who older gamers might remember from Castlevania 3 for NES. You meed a wide array of characters, some good, some bad, throughout your journey through Dracula's castle. The object of the game: same as the rest-find and destroy Dracula and end the vampire bloodline.The graphics are classic 2-D, which might turn off some gamers hoping for something more like Castlevania 64 (which was fully-rendered 3-D). Despite the 2-D, the control and character movement is greatly enhanced thanks to better animation and smooth controls. Castlevania games always had great music, and SOTN is among the best in that department. Each score perfectly matches the given environment, with beautifuly orchestrated melodies. Don't let the old-school look discourage you, this is an amazing game.Calling Castlevania: SOTN simply a nastalgia trip, while true in my case, would degrade the value of the game. It is an excellent and addictive game that satisfies on almost every level. It ranks among the best games for the Playstation, and you sould expect to pay a hefty price for a copy. It is now super-rare.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Cross-over madness?","reviewText":"It's actually been ages since I first acquired this game, but for some reason I'm only just now getting around to reviewing it.  When I first heard about this game my initial reaction was Disney and Final Fantasy together?!  This is going to be complete crap!  However, because I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy, I just couldn't resist buying this game and trying it out.  I just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about...Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics are excellent.  They're sort of cartoony in that everything is rounded and sort of exaggerated in proportions, but that's appropriate since most of the game involves Disney characters, which ARE cartoons.  Anyway, the art style aside, the graphics look very good.  Everything is crisp and detailed and lovely.  The only thing one might complain about is the fact that Final Fantasy characters are altered from their original art styles to fit in better with the more cartoony look of the game.  I didn't hold this against the game though since they would've stuck out like a sore thumb otherwise.Music (score 10/10): Whether or not you enjoy the music will depend almost entirely on whether or not you liked the original film scores for several Disney movies since a lot of the music for each area is based on those songs.  I'm not a huge fan of the Disney songs, but I enjoyed them just fine.  What is unequivocally awesome, though, are the original songs.  I love the intro. song, the music in Hollow Bastien, and the music during the final boss fight.  The voice acting is very top notch as well, so this section of the review gets a perfect 10/10 score from me.Characters (score 10/10): The main characters are pretty likable.  Sora is a bit simple-minded, but he's also fairly young (I'm not sure exactly how young), so that's understandable.  Riku really shines as a complex and interesting character who's vacillating between his friends and joining the \"dark side\", so to speak.  In fact, I found him more interesting as a quasi-villain than Ansem - the actual main villain.  Now let's talk about the side characters.  For the most part, this game is more about the Disney characters and the original characters (like Sora, Riku, Kairi, Ansem, etc.) than it is about the Final Fantasy characters.  While entire game worlds are built around the Disney characters, the Final Fantasy characters are more like cameos that pop up here and there.  Their backstories are often altered to fit in with the plot of the game (which makes perfect sense), but their core personalities remain intact and accurate.  So, despite their essentially ancillary roles, I was quite happy with all the fanservice anyway!Story (score 10/10): Well, how to sum up the story?  Um, there are these things called \"hearts\" which seem to be like souls or cosmic energy or both.  There's a bunch of talk about \"light\" and \"darkness\" and metaphors about good and evil and you get to hit people in the head with giant keys shaped like swords!  Okay, okay, I'll get serious.  You start off as protagonist Sora who lives on a small island which is suddenly engulfed in weird black mist and attacked by a bunch of monsters.  He finds a strange door and it leads him to a totally different place, where he sets out to try to find out what the flip just happened to him and how to save his home.  That's basically the beginning of the story in a nutshell.  Sora travels around to different worlds (these are small planet-shaped areas in space that are each based on a different Disney movie) in order to try to stop the monsters from overrunning everything.  I really like the story since it feels fresh and interesting.  My only complaint here is that you will hear the word \"heart\", \"light\" and \"darkness\" a little too much and it all starts to feel cheesy and heavy-handed in its message.  It doesn't detract too much though.Battle System (score 9/10): I usually don't play action RPGs because my reflexes suck and thus they are usually too hard for me (yes, I hate to admit that but it's true).  I was very pleased to find that Kingdom Hearts has a very easy to use battle system, and the difficulty level is very approachable.  This is mainly due to the fact that this game has an excellent auto-targeting system that sort of draws you inward toward whatever enemy that you are trying to hit.  The game still feels plenty challenging in parts, (the boss battle against Maleficent springs to mind) so they did a good job of making it fun yet challenging.  My only complaint has to do with your A.I. controlled party members (Donald and Goofy).  Their A.I. is laughable bad, so don't rely on them to intelligently attack an enemy or keep you healed or anything really.  Thankfully, this isn't much of an issue since you can easily handle all the enemy yourself without having to lean on them.Gameplay (score 9/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  I've heard some people complain about the camera but it didn't bother me much at all.  I mean, sometimes it goes a bit wonky, but it really wasn't an issue for me.  As for the rest of the controls, this is a stunningly well-polished game.  The menu navigation is good, the pacing of the game is good, you get a good variety of weapons and items to play around with - basically it all feels good and I don't have any complaints.  Also, the game never feels too grind-intensive (grinding is NOT the fun part of RPGs), so that makes me happy too.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Wow am I glad that I decided to pick this up.  Just think, If I'd stuck up my nose at the Disney aspect I'd have missed out on a great fun game.  So please, even if you consider yourself to be a \"mature serious gamer\" just give Kingdom Hearts a shot.  If you're just a little open-minded like I was you might enjoy yourself!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

While this is the first headset of this brand I own, friends of mine who own different models have been telling me how quality seems to have been decreasing recently. The picture in the Amazon product description page and or course, in the box in which these come in, depicts a sturdy good looking headset. The first thing I noticed when I got these out of the box is how different they looked and felt when compared to those pictures, they are good looking, but kind of fragile. They do not feel that flimsy, but they certainly do not feel like a high quality headset like I expected for the price, this is more evident when comparing them to my Elite headset for the PS3, this limited edition headset pales when compared to the PS3 Elite.Which brings me to another point, I got so used to a wireless headset that wearing these was a pain, the amount of cables make them very uncomfortable to wear; while these cables do bring benefits like several hook up methods or a lighter headset, in my case it resulted more of an inconvenience than an advantage. My recommendation, for the same amount or money you may be able to get a wireless set. If you are into these because of them being a limited edition for Call of Duty and don't mind the lack of wireless capabilities, you will not be disappointed. The sound that comes from these is simply amazing and they are comfortable to wear; something I would like to mention, as someone who has to wear glasses, it is very difficult to find a headset that does not adjust tightly (pressing the glasses against one's ears), this does not seem to be a problem with the COD headset.Additionally, you can use this with several other devices, I read somewhere they even work with a PS3 (even though these are being marketed for XBox360), I have yet to test it and will update my review if I am able to successfully use these on a PS3.* EDIT 12/20/2013 - Not only was I able to use these on a PS3 but after looking at the box, it actually says there these are compatible with a PS3. My confusion came from Amazon listing the headset under XBox so I thought I'd update my review.Overall, these perform well but I cannot help but think they are more a gimmick than anything else. As stated before, there may be better options in the same price range; for a COD fan on a budget these may be a little pricey when all you get is a wired headset with some COD designs in them. Having used both types of headsets, my recommendation would go to a wireless one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000HFGKN4","description":"super castlevania IV 4 for super nintendo","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Castlevania swung to the SNES as a classic","reviewText":"In the fall of 1991, a few months after the Super NES made its debut, Konami began its full fledged support with Gradius III and the classic gem, Super Castlevania IV. Finally, after players romped through the excellent Castlevania III for the NES, the Castlevania series swung to the SNES in classic form but upgraded with 16 bit graphics, music and sounds that took advantage of the strengths of the new console. Many players had regarded this particular Castlevania title as one of the best in the series. Read on to find out why.Players take control of Simon Belmont, whose family were comprised of legendary vampire hunters who protected their land from all evil, particularly Dracula. When Dracula rose from the grave again to spread his evil, Simon takes off to find and destroy him. His journey takes him through 11 stages filled with enemies, traps and boss characters atop various backgrounds and scenery. Armed with a whip that you can strike in eight directions and can swing from \"door handle\" hooks, you'll use your main weapon throughout the entire game. Along the way, you can pick up sub weapons such as boomerangs, daggers, holy water and axes as well as hearts (weapon ammo), money bags (points)and turkey legs & pork chops (health power ups.) A password system lets you write down a password to continue your game later on but the game gives it to you only at the continue screen.The PROS: Never mind that the bump in graphics and sounds from Castlevania III was obvious, but everything blends well. It's a blast to play thanks to the crisp and gorgeous graphics featuring cool special effects, the spot on controls, brand new music plus remixed music from previous Castlevania games, a huge variety of enemies and bosses and a difficulty curve that rises as you get further into the game that doesn't overwhelm you. And when you beat the game the first time, you automatically start over where the enemies move faster, take more hits while you take more damage and the clock runs down faster. Top it off with a password system that is easy to use and you got a great Castlevania game that showcases what you can do on the Super NES.The CONS: the only, minor flaw I can say is that the game is short compared to the last game on the NES. While Super Castlevania IV featured 11 stages, Castlevania III had a whopping 17 plus stages and was considerably much, much harder to complete.While Super Castlevania IV won't challenge you like the previous games in the series, it was and still is fun to watch and play. Konami went all out to show just how good it can be and they exceeded everyone's expectations. To those who missed the chance to play this particular entry, you'll be paying a pretty penny to buy this brand new. Either get a used copy if you have a working SNES or if you own a Wii, you can download this game from their Virtual Console service for 800 points ($8.00.) It's a great deal considering what you would pay for the cartridge. Don't wait any longer; if you haven't played this masterpiece, do so ASAP. I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable. For example, by completingMetroid Fusion, you can unlock the original NES version ofMetroidinMetroid Prime.

What an involving game.  The storyline is pretty good (Samus getting infected by the X-Parasite and must destroy it while dealing with the parasite's fusion to her) and the graphics are actually outstanding.  It's not perfect, but they brought back the original style of \"Super Metroid.\"  They also improved the wall jump.  The world map is a little more linear than Super Metroid, but so what?  It's good nonetheless.Looking at the reviews on Amazon, I cannot believe how much Prime is regarded over this.  Fusion may not hold a candle to many of the classics, but considering today's video game market being dominated by ultra-cool graphics and cinema scenes, THIS GAME IS A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.  If anything, this proves that an old school game can survive in this day and age.  Gamers tend to forget the reason why games are awesome in the first place: GAMEPLAY.  This game has it.If you have a Game Boy Advanced, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU PICK THIS UP.  This has classic written all over it and you should not be without this game, especially if you are a fan of the series.  This is a worthy sequel to Super Metroid.

Backgrounds tend to look like just that, dead backgrounds.  The game does include a lot of things which can be hacked, and hey it is fun to drop onto another player&#8217;s single person game, or change the traffic lights when being chased.I am not a big fan of extended story lines in games.  I don&#8217;t like to watch the pre-game video content, as my play time is limited so I want to jump right into the action.  But I do like the game to have an actual cohesive story line in mind.Watch Dogs does not deliver a strong story line; everything is loosely tied together but the overall plot is weak.  Revenge, Retribution, ????Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the game is fun and the mini-games offer entertainment.  It is just not a &#8220;top game&#8221; where you say &#8220;I want to go play&#8221; over and over.  To me that makes it over-priced as I don&#8217;t want to pay full price on any game that is not a great game.As far as performance, the controls handle well, although some are not intuitive, and handling cars can be shaky.  Sometimes your driving is all over the place.Overall, if you can get this on sale and want to give it a try, it can be entertaining, especially if you enjoy hacking things in games.

Kirby must collect the scattered pieces of the Star Rod and restore the Fountain of Dreams. How's he going to do this? By copying the bad guys' best moves and eating--yes, eating--them and their weapons. One copy of the game supports up to four players (via the separately sold Game Link Cable) with special mini games, but if there's a copy of the game in Game Boy Advance, players can play cooperatively through the game.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Kirby's glory days revisited on the GBA","reviewText":"Nightmare in Dream Land's story is simple: King DeDeDe has stolen the Rod of Dreams, which in turn takes away the people of Dream Land's dreams. It is up to Kirby to get it back and restore everyones dreams.The gameplay is real basic, and to be honest, real fun. You run around the levels as Kirby who has the power to jump, inhale air and basically fly for a little bit, swim, and swallow hisenemies for thier abilities. There are roughly 30 moves, some exclusive to this NES remake, including shooting lasers, throwing large blade-boomerangs, turning into a tornadoe, or surrounding yourself with ice.If you find certain secrets within the stages, you can unlock mini-games and an \"ability gallery\" which was cool. Some mini-games include grinding on a pipe and having to press \"A\" to jump over spiked portions of the railing while racing other colored Kirbys, or having to face-off with a handful of enemies by pressing \"A\" faster then they can so you can beat them up. There are more but I just don't feel like getting into it. As for the gallery, it's pretty sweet - you enter this room and usually there are 2 different abilities waiting for you to take them. Sadly, this game didn't borrow from the SNES smash hit \"Kirby Super Stars\" or even the N64 title \"Kirby Crystal Shards\" with the idea of combining abilities, but we can look past it for now.The graphics are definitley an upgrade from the original NES title, and are very colorful and nice. The enemies style look unique and interesting, the abilities still look devastating, and levels are really nice looking for a GBA game. It sort of has a cartoon feel now that I think about it..The music is great and really catchy. I can't really explain it - imagine it as sort of a techno beat, but much more...hmm..less serious and more experimental. The SFX are great as well - I love the sound of the bombs exploding or the firey sound.. superb. There isn't any talking in this game, but after witnessing the cartoon series and the N64 game of Kirby, I'm grateful for that.Nightmare in Dream Land isn't really too hard of a game, and it isn't really a long game either. Sure there are maybe 7 different worlds with about 8 different stages within the worlds, but they fly by pretty quick and easily. What is kind of annoying is that sometimes the controls will be unresponsive - you'll be running forward, then wanna quickly turn around to attack an approaching enemy, but Kirby is still running forward and BAM you get hit. I'm not going to type out the ending, but lets just say it was sorta dissapointing.To finish it up, I highly suggest you atleast play this game. Yes, it gets repetitive, but with it's basic side-scrolling gameplay, nice graphics, interesting levels, and wide array of abilities & mini-games, how could you truley get bored? Better yet, its a remake of an old NES game, and a good one at that. Go and play Kirby: Nightmare in Dreamland if you haven't already.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

I loved Assassins Creed, Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood and was excited when I saw this was coming out - but - I read other reviews and thought, \"why spend the $59+ for an 'alright' game?\" And, believe me, at that time I was desperate for a new game to play but I was tired of the structured plots and action of CoD and the rest and a little disappointed with the games I had picked up recently (Fallout New Vegas being the exception). I wanted a sandbox to play in. But still, I passed on Revelations. And then, my lovely wife saw it in the store, knew I loved the Assassins Creed series and gave it to me as a present. Hallelujah! I love it! I don't know what these other reviewers are expecting, maybe everyone it just pretty jaded at this point, but I absolutely love it. This is a beautiful game. It's colorful, it's wide open, it's Assassins Creed the next evolution.I try to play all of the game: the side missions, developing new assassins, completing the skill requirements for the guilds, Desmond's memory blocks, whatever I can find. Man, I've been drilling this thing hard for over a week and still don't see the end in sight. My wife is sorry she gave it to me, calls herself a PS3 widow, but I thank her for it every time I hit the ON button.I have a hard suspicion that some of the negatives come from other game developers which is a tactic I consider to be lower than whale feces, and that's on the bottom of the Pacific, jack. You know, there's enough demand for GOOD games out there for everyone and if you can't do as well or better then get off the f*****g merry-go-round. And that goes for regular reviewers also. If it is totally bad, say so, but if you just want to nitpick the thing to death then come up with something better or shut your pie hole and get a life. Stop ruining it for others just because you can.OK, I've had my rant. Fat lot of good it will do, but it's said.If you haven't picked up Revelations, do so. You won't be sorry unless you're one of these other bung holes that whine about everything. It is a great game.Thank you, Sweetie.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

I am also one of the few that hasn't owned every Legend of Zelda game. In fact, the only Legend Of Zelda game I ever owned was the original. I didn't want to play any of the other Zelda games over the years because I didn't have the time anymore to play epic adventure-riddle solving games. Plus, I didnt like the realistic looking Link. I think this new Zelda is an attempt by Nintendo to draw new younger fans, yet appease the die-hards that demand the same game play. Give it a chance!!But, in the case of the Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, I decided to get back into the fold. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. The gameplay is smooth. This is a huge game, jam-packed full of puzzles, action, and excitement. There is only one other game that made my jaw hit the floor when I first saw it, and that was Super Mario 64.

I mean 32 GB + Nintendo Land + Gamepad Charger + Gamepad cradle + Wii U stand + Black color for 50$ more? Hell yeah.I only played the game \"Nintendoland\" (the game it came with) so far and I love it! It's a whole new gaming experience. It's innovative and most importantly F-U-N!. I can tell right now when the new Zelda, Mario Kart, and Smash Bros come out I'm gonna have a blast. I can only imagine how aweseomely they're gonna incorporate the gamepad into these big titles and future original games.Nintendoland, first off, is a great game when your with your family or friends. It shows off what the gamepad can do. However, I would not recommend buying this separate as it is NOT worth 60$ as you'll find everywhere online. I think it should go for 39.99 separately. Tops. I recommend the deluxe set where it comes free.Some of the best NintendoLand Games to play with your family are:-Mario Chase-Animal Crossing: Sweet Day-Pikman Adventure-Luigis Ghost MansionThe main reason I got this system, is because of the New Super Mario Bros U. I'm a die hard fan and I NEEDED to play it. I tried selling the Nintendoland (unopened) online so I could get money for the Mario game. But it seems everyone is putting their Nintendoland game up for sale! So if your trying to sell Nintendoland online, good luck. Also if you want to trade it in at a local gamestore. TOPS they will give you, even if it is factory sealed, is 10$... Yeah, I know. They gotta make money somehow right? Haha...Anyway I'm gonna list some pros and cons.Pros:-The OS (Operating System) is very welcoming and smooth.-The gamepad is very responsive-Stunning graphics. (1080p ... Finally) HDMI Chord included!-It's up to par, if not beyond, the graphics of the PS3, and Xbox 360-The gamepad controller isn't too heavy or too light, it feels very comfortable in your hands.-The gameplay is beyond any you'll find on ANY other gaming system.Cons:- System update takes about 60-90 Minutes. (Only have to do it once and your set)- Gamepad and Wii U attract dust easily. (I'd recommend a case and screen protector for gamepad)- Some long loading screens when the system is being set up.Other than that, I can't think of any other cons. It truly is a great gaming device. It's fun to play with friends and family. It's also fun to switch from tv to controller in less than half a second. I'd recommend buying this now because I know there will be great games for it in the future.Update 3/7/12Finally purchased the New Super Mario Bros U game! I have only beat the first 2 worlds and all I can say is WOW! Hands down THE best (2D )Mario Game ever released (Super mario 64 will always be my favorite and have that special place in my heart).. Haha but anyway, first off the graphics are crazy good! But like the director of Nintendo said... \"It's not about the graphics, it's about the gameplay!\" And I agree.

I've been a pretty heavy gamer since Atari.  I've owned every system (except NeoGeo, that Nokia one and a few other crappies) and played hundreds if not thousands of games (including the original GTA on PC).  I can say with absolute certainty of my opinion that this game is the greatest ever made.If you are a fan of the previous GTAs, then you will love this one.  It uses a physics engine technology called Euphoria so there are no longer any canned animations.  Everything is computed on the fly, and it makes for some great gameplay.  Everything from the previous GTAs is revamped.  The combat system is much better and the game makes great use of it.  Graphics are incredible and the world is live and completely interactive.But the new improved gameplay is not what makes this game the greatest ever.  It's the attention to detail.  Without going into too much detail, you can tell they spent a lot of time on this game, and it pays off.But it's not just the attention to detail either.  This game is also the funniest game I've ever played.  From the hundreds of unique comments you can hear from pedestrians on the street, to the ads on the radio, to the characters in the story.  Everyone has a lot to say and most of it will crack you up.  Even the cabbies you call for car service are hilarious.This game is just such a masterpiece, if you own a 360 or PS3, you must own it.

The cover art and basic premise of the game left me really skeptical about the quality of game that was contained within.  I have to say that I am glad one of my friends showed this game to me because I otherwise would have ignored it.Basically, Jeanne D'arc is a fantasy retelling of the Joan of Arc legend and the 100 years war.  I'll admit, it took a bit of getting used to seeing the great deal of liberty taken with the story, but overall it is quite good.  The game is a turn based strategy game a la Final Fantasy Tactics, Tactics Ogre, Vandal Hearts, and Fire Emblem games.  As far as turn based strategy games go, I have to say this game ranks among the best and fans of the genre should pick it up.Pros:+ Vibrant graphics (usually)+ Compelling (albeit quite weird) storyline told with animated cutscenes.+ A deep character customization system that doesn't require users to micromanage for hours on end to build the perfect party.+ The ability to go into free-battle mode on a number of maps in order to gain treasure and experience.+ Individual battles are usually fairly quick, ideal for portable play.+ Some absurd but funny French and English stereotypes.Cons:- The frame rate is kind of jerky at times- For history buffs, seeing Joan of Arc fighting orcs, lizardmen, and dark elves takes a little bit of getting used to.- Some levels have atmospheric effects such as fog that look just plain ugly.- Some absurd stereotypes and a few really annoying character designs that make you say \"Hmmmmmm...\"- The menu controls are not as intuitive as other games in the genre- Battles usually limit you to a small number of characters on the battlefield.  On the plus side, battles don't drag on forever and ever.Overall, this is an excellent game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the strategy RPG genre.  The game obviously contains some very religious overtones due to the source material (Joan of Arc) but approaches the subject in a relatively inoffensive manner.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2008"}

It probably helps if Re:coded is not the first Kingdom Hearts episode one plays but it's not essential. I am not playing this game but my 8 yr. old girl, the owner and operator of our family's DSi does and she just loves her first 'big' RPG where she can level up, do boss battles and feel in control more than in any other game she played so far and... get her acquinted with 'the other side of (King) Mickey (Mouse)', they real one she she says.This installment is about the 'data' version of Sora with help from Goofy and Donald cleaning the real Sora's digitized journal's datascape of 'bugs', hoping to learn about the true meaning of the mysterious message above.The game plays just right on the DS, taking advantage of the lower touch screen where the map and all the housekeeping 'stuff' is shown while the main action takes place on the top display. I can't say that the game is specifically made for little kids but the DS rendition makes it a lot more kid-friendly than a PS3's so thsi is an opportunity to let the younger kids (8-9 yr. olds, boys AND girls) enjoy a good game with a good story, featuring many familiar Disney characters.I will grant Re:coded 4 stars (mean's \"I like it\" as opposed to the 5 stars' \"I love it\") mostly because anyone 'new' to the series has a lot of catch up to do to fully understand what's going on and not all the background can be find in game or in the manual.

He's done it all. Saving princesses, winning the 150cc Star Cup and snagging a few holes in one are all in some of the earliest pages of his resume. On the Nintendo 64, Nintendo decided to let Mario try his hand at tennis (though the series arguably dates back to the NES title \"Tennis\"). The result? People loved it! And so they released a Gamecube sequel that added in offensive and defensive power shots as well as gimmick arenas, which was also quite successful. Did Nintendo succeed in bringing this success to the 3DS?My first impressions of the game on launch day were that the game seemed sloppily thrown together - and that impression still resonates with me. The character select screen in particualr seems very lazy. Instead of the usual board of characters, we get a scroll through list, and the characters even seen out of order.The controls are simple, and work fine. You move your character with the slide pad, and control shots with the buttons. You still have the same options you always have plus one need shot type. In addition to the ever present lob (A), slice (B), and the various options that come through their combination, you have smash shots (Y). Smash shots are fast, and straight. This game gets rid of the power shots introduced in Mario Power Tennis, and instead uses a system referred to a \"Chance Shots\". At random times, or if certain requirements are met, a small circle on the field will glow a particular color. The colors are coded along side the shot types, and using the correct shot type while in the circle will use the chance shot. For example, if there is a blue chance shot, and you slice the ball (B), the result is a super charged shot that curves outside the field and back into it. Alternatively, if it glows white, you can drop shot(B>A) for a super short drop shot. There is a chance shot for every type of hit in the game, and the most annoying has to be the purple ones. If a player uses the new smash shot while in a purple chance area, you're in for it. The player will spike a super fast fast ball straight down onto your court, and those with slow reflexes won't stand a chance.Chance shots may sound interesting, but they can quickly become annoying when playing against high level CPUs. It seems that in the higher difficulty tournaments, the computer will always get several chance shots in a row while you just play defense for a couple of minutes. You can call me childish or imamture, ro say that I jsut suck at the game all you want, but there's no getting around the facts - that is an annoying, cheap, and lazy way to make the game harder.In a never ending attempt to make their games more accessible, Nintendo has thrown in a couple of options for young and newer gamers. Rather than sue the buttons to select your shot type, you can simply tap the touch screen button with the color and name of the shot on it. They also added an option called simple shot, which can be activated via touch screen or by pressing (X). Simple shot will automatically use the most appropriate shot type for your current situation. The shot will be weaker than normal, but I still feel this is a bad idea and will prevent new players from taking to time to learn the real ins and outs of the game.As always, Nintendo has included some challenging minigames to occupy your time as well as unlock characters, as well as earn coins which you can sue to buy gear - we'll talk more about that in a moment. The minigames are, for the most part, quite challenging. They are very entertaining if you have nothing else to do, but once you've beaten all the difficulties and unlocked all the characters, you'll only be coming back to farm coins. My favorite minigame was Super Mario Bros Tennis, game in which the camera scrolls through a level of Super Mario Bros. world as you collect coins and kill enemies with the tennis ball.Another feature Nintendo has been including as of late is the ability to play as your Mii. Normally, I groan at this standard, as Mii's generally just annoy me and take away from the game's atmosphere. For the first time, I'm actually glad they included Miis ad playable characters - it is actually well executed. You can spend coins to buy clothing and rackets for your Mii, altering their stats into whatever suits you best (or whatever you think looks cool). You can even dress your Miis up in character costumes such as Bowser and Yoshi.Possibly the coolest new feature is the use of AR codes. Nintendo has been releasing Ar codes via Nintendo Power Magazine, their official Facebook page, and Club Nintendo which allow you to unlock characters in the game. While this certainly has potential,so far it has been wasted on nothing but some character outfits and some different colored Yoshis. Perhaps they will better utilize this feature in the future.This is the first Mario Tennis game to be playable online...er..that is that is able to be connected to Nintendo's Wi-Fi network. To say it is playable online would be an exaggeration. Lag and dropped connections are the norm no matter where I connect, be it at home, college, or even McDonalds, the online is simply unbearable.The graphics are honestly not that great, but there are worse looking games. Everything is fairly smooth and well animated, and as is to be expected of a Mario game the bright, pastel colors stand out nicely. The 3D effect made me a little dizzy, so I just turned it off. If you hold the 3DS vertical, the camera angle will switch to right behind your character, and the character will move a small amount on their own. I found this feature to be utterly useless, and the camera angle screwed me over more than it helped me. If you play this game lying down, the gyro censor will sometimes think you are holding the system vertical, and switch to this camera angle. The best option is to turn the feature off completely in the settings.Mario Tennis Open had a lot going for it as far as ideas are concerned, but the execution of these ideas is less than stellar. You'll have a much better time if you just buy Mario Power Tennis or even the original for the N64. If you are still adamant about getting this game, I recommend buying used and trying to find the best deal you can- it isn't entirely unworthy of your time, but it isn't worth the full $40, especially with all the other much better 3DS titles you could buy for that same price.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Games these days are getting easier!!!!!!!!!!If you were looking for the same challenge as was in the first one, this game is easier. Most people would find smashes very hard to reach against power players and their serves, but they lowered the \"speed\" of the balls making those out of reach balls possible to get. Smoother gameplay makes the games seem to go faster than those of the original game. Each person has their own defensive power and offensive power which can return out of reach balls or send your foes sprawling. I believe Nintendo will stop Mario Tennis games for a while and go over with the Mario Soccer and Baseball. New gimmick courts that have special themes that make the floor move, enemies that grab on to you and slow you down, sludge which also slows you down, and etc. Probably a must have game for 2005. New special games are tennis-themed mini-games that are great for multiplayer. Basically everything else is same. Also some new characters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2005"}

What can I say, I'm an Assassin's Creed nut and I was really excited for a game I have a genuine interest in on the Vita.Assassin's Creed 3: Liberation does on the PsVita basically what Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines did on the PSP, only in my opinion, not as well as Bloodlines. Liberation is a better game in every way, except for gameplay. The problem is that some of the games most used commands don't work like they're supposed to. The counter/parry command only works some of the time, the free run kinda sends you leaping off to the wrong thing more often than the right thing. Traveling out of the current memories boundaries leaves you trapped on the other side of the wall until the game just resets you for being desynchronized, enemies can somehow spot you through walls. But however, this games biggest flaw is the Persona system, yes it makes sense from a story aspect but insofar as fun fulfilling game play on a portable console this is not what I need from a game. I need something that pops that can make me feel like I've accomplished a lot in the short period of time I've played it because that's what I do with my portable systems, I take them to the laundry mat or on a bus ride or in a car ride. But when I have to spend 30 minutes of my time and my handhelds battery life 'walking' the streets of New Orleans in the Lady Persona, virtually unable to fight and totally unable to sprint or climb because that's how the mission dictates it need be completed, it grinds my enjoyment of the game to a hault. To the point where I just turned the game off and just played some Super Stardust Delta instead.I picked it back up finished the mission only to get in a fight and realize you're pretty much defenseless unless you wear Aveline's assassin garb which comes with a constant level of notoriety and you will trigger a fight virtually every time a guard sees you.Locomotion suffers from the same bugs and glitches that are so prevalent in Assassin's Creed 3 so if you've been playing that you'll alread be familiar with that buggy new engine that they've put in place for both of these games. Honestly, considering this is a handheld and has so many control options built into it I would have preferred they use the AC2 engine instead. It's tried, it's tested and most importantly they had pretty much worked all the kinks out by the time Revelations came along.I know I've made this game sound really terrible but it's not all bad I'm gradually coming around to the slower paced game play and I'm hopeful they'll get a patch out for some of the bugs and glitchyness. But to be honest, I own 8 PsVita titles and most of them have only been patched once, and the first thing I did after I downloaded this game was refresh the live area and download a patch, and then the developers kinda abandon them, hopefully there will be enough interest in this game to at least get them to iron most of the kinks out.The good of this game is that it is an Assassin's Creed game right in a handheld, all the running through trees, performing assassinations with any equipped weapon, tree climbing/parkouring from Assassin's Creed 3 is all here in this game. The story is interesting in a historical sense just like every other AC game, the city and the bayou are beautiful detailed maps and I'm really interested to see how much further the game is going to take me. Sound get's a little wonky at times with the music and ambient noises dropping out to nothing randomly. The touch screen controls for map and inventory are very convenient and don't feel tacked on in any way to me personally.This is probably the best Vita game I own and I'm just being hard on it because I expected nothing less than perfection. Is it perfect? No. But was this game worth my money? Yes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2012"}

At over $600 at launched and plagued by a mediocre library of games, the PS3 went from the most anticipated game consols in history to the most dissapointing game consol in history. Sony tried to fix it by releasing 7 versions of the consol, each upgrading the privious model in order to improve the PS3, but it just made things confusing. All were backwards compadible with the original Plastation, but some were not backward compatible, so the average consumer might be suckerd in on bying a non-backward compatible one when they were looking for the backward compitable one.In the mist of all this crap, Sony was indeed making a real effort to restore their console to number one like the Playstation and the PS2 was, and it came in the form of the PS3 Slim. Like the PS2 Slim, it's a smaller version of the console that has a few revisions in design. Let me tell you, from what I've seen, if you have an original PS3, backwards compadible with the PS2 or not, it's worth the trade in. The PS3 Slim has twice the memory as the current PS3 model does, but it costs the same. It's halve the size and has a better cooling system, so your PS3 won't over heat. It's not backwards compitable with the PS2, but at least you can tell the difference, so not to worry.It's like Sony figured out that their old system was crap and just to show you that their new Slim model isn't crap, they even fixed the crappy PLAYSTATION 3 logo to simply PS3, just like the PS2. So lets just push aside the old PS3, pretend it was never released, and throw it in the garbage and invest on the new PS3 Slim, because it defenatly looks worth the money, only a affordable $300 price tag for 120 GB of memory and blueray.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2009"}

From the trailers leading up to the release of the game, you could tell that the emotional impact was going to be significant. The Reapers are finally here. In a universe with such rich backstory, where decisions have a major impact, and you've grown to know and love characters over the dozens of hours of the two previous installments, it would be easy for BioWare to have a major misstep.Luckly, they didn't. This game is AMAZING!The scale and scope of the game leaves me in awe. From the skyscraper sized Reapers to the battles that are occurring in the background. From the magical space battles to the conversations with the crewmates, everything is beautifully done. BioWare knew what they wanted to do with this game and they delivered in spades.Gameplay:If you enjoyed the feel of Mass Effect 2 more than 1, you're in luck. The gameplay carries over almost verbatim. Squadmates are even more independent than ME2 and that's a good thing. The micromanagement that went into ME1 was tactically interesting but really slowed down the battles. They know what needs to be done and they do it. Getting into and out of cover is at times a little wonky, as in the past, but there are times when it flows perfectly it feels like a perfectly executed maneuver. Then sometimes I bounce around and get shot in the face... win some/lose some.The only notable addition are the melee strikes. This is helpful, as more often than not you're forced to abandon cover (whether it's a grenade or you're being charged). This makes the battles a little more dynamic than the \"pop out of cover when the other guy does\" battles of ME2 and makes them feel a little more fast paced. I generally avoid melee unless I have to, but it's an interesting addition nonetheless. I will say straight up that the environments and enemy types vary more than the previous two games combined, and that's awesome. It's nice to face different strategies, keeps things fresh.There's the Kinect option to use. I tried it and I couldn't get anyone to listen me half the time. I attribute it to the fact that my speakers were cranked so, if this were real life, they probably couldn't hear me anyway. Yeah... that's the ticket. On the rare occasion it does work, it's pretty cool.Graphics:The look is a little crisper, the framing a little better, everything looks a little more polished. I absolutely loved the background events, the cinematic space battles, all of the crazy stuff.Sound:Everything is very sharp and works well on my surround system. The Reapers make some sort of crazy bass sound that shakes my entire living room. It's awesome. Seriously.Multiplayer:If you liked Gears of War Horde Mode you'll love this. Simple as that. I think it's fun but I'm always placed with random since my friends don't buy games very often. Still, it's pretty sweet. Plus, it helps you becomes \"more prepared\" in the actual campaign. It's not required to play but it's a nice touch. Persistent leveling also gives a sense of purpose. Be careful cranking it up to hard, it gets pretty nuts.Overall:GET IT! If you loved ME1 and ME2 this could be a bucket of crap and you'd get it since the story is so amazing. Luckily, it's fantastic. Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003171CEW","reviewerName":"P. Sorornejad","summary":"The Road to the Show is Back and Better than Ever","reviewText":"Summary : I have been a huge fan of MLB the Show for a few years now.  After playing the 2k series for quite some time, I felt that it was time to see what all of the rave is about, and at the time MLB The Show 08 was just released, I picked it up, and never looked back.  The graphics, sounds, and gameplay really helps bring the entire baseball environment to life.  You feel like you are in the game, and that you are the man at the mount/plate, ready to make the game winning hit/out.Graphics: Each year there have been improvements to the graphics, and this year is no exception to that.  Player models are spectacular, from their batting stance, to their mannerisms they simulate the players that we are accustomed to watching each day.  From Kevin Youkilis's batting stance, to K-Rod's interesting pitching motions, to high fives to the first base coach, this game captures every detail.  The baseball fields are all amazing, and really give you the sense of the \"spotlight\".  When playing the minor league games, you are in fields that arent as flashy, arent as filled up, and overall have a \"quiet\" tenor to them.  But once you are playing MLB games, you are taken away by the fireworks, the crowds loud chanting, and the glamor that is in the distance of center field.  The dust kicked up on slides, and the dirt that stains the clothes of players, it doesn't get anymore realistic than this.Sounds: This is one place that I have a bit of a gripe with the \"Show\" series.  As a previous owner of Show 09, I can attest that there have been very minor differences in the commentary of Show 10.  This adds a bit of negative points to the game, mainly because you almost feel like you are playing last years game.  The commentary itself isn't one reason to consider the 2k series, but if commentary is something that can make or break a game for you, then this just isn't the mlb game of the year for you.  Other than that, the sounds of the crowd's cheers, boos, and chants couldn't get any better.  From the accustomed chants of \"DER RICK JE TER\" or the fun \"YOUUUUUKKKKKKK\" you just feel like you are sitting in the ball park eating your popcorn.  The crack of the bat gives you that feel of \"oh my god its a home run\", and the sound of the ball fouling off into the catchers mask gives you a moment of \"*gasp*, hope hes ok\".Gameplay: One of the most exciting features for me, is the inclusion of a Home Run Derby.  One thing I missed about last years \"Show\" was the lack of a home run derby.  In my opinion, one of the most fun parts about 08 was the two different home run derby modes.  It made for hours of fun with friends, and really added to the replay value of the game.  This year has the home run derby classic mode, where home runs are points, and everything else is an out.  Its a fun time for everyone involved, but it requires you to pass the controller around as they didn't include a way to assign controllers to the players.  This year also includes a refined Road to the Show.  Now, you are able to play as the catcher, and call the shots.  While I havn't tried this mode myself, I have heard some wonderful things about it.  Another thing that will stick out in road to the show, is pitchers now have training sessions like the batters do.  With two different training simulations, pitchers can train by pitching 3 inning sessions, or by hitting targets.  Each simulation allows you to really boost the points of your pitching.  Lastly, when starting a road to the show game, you are automatically entered in the minors, unlike previous games that had you try with the majors first.  Now you must earn the call!Overall:  Overall I'd say this is the must have baseball game of the year.  The threat from 2k10 is present this year as they have done a lot to try to take the throne away from \"The Show\", however, \"The Show\" takes the cake yet again with its supurb graphics, and overall gameplay.  Everything feels smooth, crisp, the graphics are clean, and the gameplay is overall fun.  The only gripe is the lack of new and exciting commentary, but this can be easily overlooked.  If you are debating between this or 2k10 for PS3, and you haven't really spent time with \"The Show\" series, i suggest downloading the demo for 2k10, and maybe renting The Show 09 just to get an idea of how \"The Show\" plays.  I chose this game, and am not even remotely dissapointed","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

The games are massive, so its hard to pinpoint specific issues with areas due to the insane amount of them, Its also hard to communicate spells, weapons or just about anything else without kind of ballparking the general idea that Bethesda is going for, as well as incorporating what you've figured out so far. The main issue is a review for this game should take years of notes. There is just so much content that to fully prepare a reader, you'd need to cram 300 + hours of questing, leveling, fighting and customization into a review not even three pages. In short, if I miss something, that's why.***TOC:******1. The Basic Jist***2. Changes and improvements:******2A: Movement******2B: Menus******2C: Quickselect******2D: Magic******2E: Hands******2F: Perks******2G: Speech******2H: Non Returners******2I: The New Leveling System******2J: Creation***3. Gameplay***4. Issues***5 Wrap Up***1. The Basic Jist:***You're a prisoner from a raid ambush, and are the Dragonborn, a mortal with the soul of a Dragon, Without having really quested too far, the idea here is simple, you are prophesied and therefore destined to be awesome and save the world. Pretty much the general main plot of most of these type of games. The reason being a Dragonborn is important is that apparently, only the Dragonborn can fight dragons with their own words. To learn Dragon Power Words you must find the word, and learn that, but to use a Power Word, you must have a Dragon's Soul, and only a person who is Dragonborn can absorb the power of other Dragons. If you're confused, its okay. I'm not fully in complete understanding either. But, that's the basic story. I'm going to move on to the differences (the main meat of this review) of TES:V.***2. Improvements and Changes:***Whenever a game undergoes an evolution, it changes, becomes more or less refined, and in general tends to improve, and this game is no different.***2A: Movement:Characters move more fluidly, Especially in 3rd person view, this game, for the first time in the series, has focused more on how your character moves when in 3rd person, the jumping, landing and general movement animations look good and realistic, this also extends to the enemies you fight, and finally the animation to attacking which is better, and also more realistic. Finishers have also been added, and their animations are also fluid and well done, if a bit haphazard at times.***2B: Menus:This is a mixed bag for me due to the massive difference from Oblivion, but all in all, i find it cleaner and faster than Oblivion's as well, its also considerably less cluttered and texty. Basically, when you press B, you use the d-pad up, down, left, or right, buttons to use Skill, Map, Magic, or Inventory Items respectively. This is a big shock at first due to the just odd nature and drastic severance from previous games, but all in all the inventory and magic screens are easy to use, auto sorted, and The map is very nice, all while still being cohesive. The only thing that is massively different here that further needs addressing is the Skills, which I'll cover later.Continuing with the menu, the stamina bar (green) is lower right, Health (red) is in the Center, and the Blue bar on the bottom left is Magicka. While these are often out of your way, there is actually no way to know how much health you have left in digit form. In oblivion you could check via the first status screen and it'd give how much you had. This way its kind of just there on the bottom. Its cohesive yes, but, there's not a simple way to check R.G.B. bar buffs. But the system works. Enemy health is shown for hostile enemies in the top center and the compass is there as well. The only other things on the screen are pretty much the enemies and occasionally you. While vastly different, the menu's are easy to use and easy to navigate.***2C: Quickselect:As we know it its gone. The wheel is replaced by a list brought up by the up button on normal play on the d-pad. This pauses the world while you select what you'd like to use. Populating this list is done by navigating the magic or item menus and highlighting equipment/spells and pressing Y. The list becomse populated and is a crucial tool for all play types for potions, spells, and weapons needed on the go. Its also seems pretty bottomless.***2D: MagicThe BIGGEST Change in this game. Gone are custom spells, spellcrafting, and The hassle of weeding through 1400 spells to find the one you want. They've simplified the spells to being learned from books, easily purchased and read from salespeople. But the Perks system and Hands System refine and customize your spells. In short, the spells are all prescripted, but now are mix and match, holdable, and are not leveled the same way as before.Mix and Match- You can use two spells at once, or two of the same spell at once, or with a dagger or other one hander, or with a shield or however you like! Use fire and cure, fire and ice, Rage and Paralyze. Sky's the limit.Hold: Many spells are holdable, meaning you can reap benefits from the spell the longer you use the spell with LT or RT Instead of boinking the button 8000 times. Some are still fired though and some must be charged \"cooked\" and then fired.Level: More on this later, but the spells don't level unless you're using them now, making them harder to grind, But they are more battle friendly so you'll actually use them.***2E:Hands!The hand system is another big step forward, you have full customize-ability of your right and left hand. You can equip 2 swords/maces/daggers one, and a shield a shield and magic, a staff and magic , the list goes on. You can essentially fully utilize your character the way you want now.***2F: PerksPerks are located in the Skills tab when you level. When you do you get one point to spend on a perk. When you look through your Skills such as Destruction, or Restoration, each has a constellation associated with it. Pressing a allows you to see how you can customize this skill set. Things are available such as a bonus 25% to fire damage or Destruction spells are 1/2 magicka. If you have the level and the prerequisites, you can spend your points on a star in the constellation, giving you the bonus and turning it from white to yellow. Some have multiple levels as well.  This allows much deeper customization and more unique characters as you build them to be better at the skills you use the most, since low level skills usually do not have the ability to utilize Perks Points.***2G: SpeechSpeech here is handled much differently than the close up shot from oblivion, here its a non changed camera angle, the characters simply speak to one another on the screen. There is also no personality mini game. The voice acting has been massively expanded, as such many characters feel more unique and many voices aren't as recycled as in Oblivion. However, not all the voice talent was great, but honestly its better than the like 12 people they had for oblivion.***2H: Non returners:Many movement related skills are gone, specific weapon Skills are replaced with one or two handers, many others are more simplified or missing. This is to smooth out the game, keep it grindy but not feel like grinding. Least it feels that way. The old leveling system is also gone, as well as the old system for spell creation.***2I: The New Leveling System:The System of old simply used two types of abilities. In Morrowind 10 advances in minor skills would net a level or 5 major skills would. This was changed to 10 major skills only in Oblivion. Then you would get to level your attributes when you slept. Here, there is no sleeping no attributes and no leveling requirement. The easiest way I can explain it is that you level by doing whatever. When you advance in any skill it adds to the level pool. But the higher the skill being leveled, the more of a percentage will be added. So you get more exp for leveling your destruction from 5-6 than you do for moving it from 2-3. Levels are also instant and benefits can be reaped immediately. The game allows you to level your RGB (Health, Stamina, Magicka) bars by 10 points at a time upon level.***2J: CreationYou no longer can create stuff all over the place on foot. Potions, Armors ,and Enchantments require a workstation. Each of these three has a corresponding skill tree. The skills allow you to create and upgrade armors, create potions and poisons, and enchant weapons and armor. Its also very worth it to create you own stuff as it will be better than most merchants' with time.Whew, that was a lot of changes, so what about the rest of the game? are the changes good or bad?***3. Gameplay***All in all, this game plays very well. From most of the videos I watched, Bethesda was trying to make the system punish players less by making the system reward them for work put in, and allow them to just play as their races without messing with signs and the like, allowing the player to have a looser mold of their character.  The problem they wanted to avoid wasthe , \"I messed up my character\" restart. They were very successful.The customization options are plentiful, good looking, and cool, the beginning of the game is much less text based and Gives you the ability to essentially do what you want in the weapons or self defense departments, actually giving you all the different types of weapons within the first 15-30 minutes to try out with and use.The whole TES V experience is seamless and immersive and its a very very fun game. That being said, it incorporates a lot of challenge.The game goes back to the Morrowind-esque difficulty model where some monsters will wreck your face if you're not ready to face them yet, also removing the level scaling. This gives the game's zones more depth and their own feel, instead of seeing Daedra everywhere at max level like in Oblivion. I do sense some scaling, but its not as prevalent.To make a long story short, not many bugs, good story and controls, and good interfaces, coupled with a good exp and fight system, and this game plays awesome. Not to mention this game contains massive amounts of sidequesting and other random stuff you can do. TES has a huge amount of playtime associated with it, and its not for the faint of heart, nor the casual RPG player. But I've focused enough of its positives, what's its problems?***4: Issues:***TES V has some issues, the same things that make it great also break it.*** Its not a short game, don't expect to be able to be the biggest baddest warrior ever in a few hours. You'll be lucky to start swinging right by then.*** Its grindy. This ties in with the above, and it will take serious time to max skills, whether you have the patience for this game can make or break it.*** The map is big and a lot of the time its hard to find new places in a good time frame, that being said, there is fast travel available.*** Too many quests! So much to keep track of, and so many distractions. You can literally play this game for more than 200 hours and not TOUCH the story. So its possible to wear the game out before really ever actually playing it.*** The interface can be problematic, its simple but its occasionally annoying since pressing B always exits the whole menu, you'll do it accidentally a lot. remember only selecting things with A and using the D-pad and finishing with B, otherwise you'll be bringing up the menu a lot more often that you want to.*** No default Subtitles. The game is surprisingly quiet. Subtitles should be on so you don't miss things. I believe they can be turned on but, well yeah.*** Graphical bugs and occasional Texture blandness. Being as big as it is, I'm not surprised, some bugs happen but there is a known issue with the caching system for installed games for the textures on 360. If the game looks bad, its likely due to the install you performed. Bethesda is trying to fix.*** The interface for perks is clunky and difficult to use. Its evry difficult to get the perk you want if its in an odd placement from where you sit currently on the grid. It makes perk usage more irritating than it should.***5 Wrap Up:***All in all this game is phenomenal. I can make what I want, kill who I want, Do quests, Don't, Kill big things or run like a sissy. The game allows me to do basically whatever I want, How I want, and is in essence the best Sandbox RPG to date. Does it have some issues? Yes, a few, but not any you're likely to not be able to overcome. This is one of those games you either love or hate, not because its bad, but because there is just so many play styles out there will be some people that just don't like games like this. The game isn't really fast paced, but it doesn't need to be since its so big. So is it good? Yes, Yes it is, but bear in mind, this game is a big undertaking.TES V: is a great game, and really redefined the series, and its easily a contender for game of the year. Its a great game for the right player, and very much worth the money, it'll last a long time, with massive replay value. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

It also features Wild West themed mini-games, new targeting and cover systems, extensive horse riding abilities, a wealth of period specific weapons and more than 40 huntable animals..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }StoryRed Dead Redemptionis a Western epic, set at the turn of the 20th century when the lawless and chaotic badlands began to give way to the expanding reach of government and the spread of the Industrial Age.

Second, the voice acting is also terrific and draws you into the game, and gives it a very naturalistic feel.  Unfortunately, the gameplay itself is not as well executed.  The individual missions are pretty similar, and there's not much incentive to accomplish them since you aren't really trying to accomplish any goal that you're aware of at least.  There are some vague allusions to fame and redemptive characteristics that you're trying to build up, but no really exciting weapons or other goals that you're trying to accomplish.  The individual missions are disjointed, and at least the first fifteen or so that I've played left me sort of empty after completing them.  In fact, several times I wasn't sure that I'd even completed a task because there was no narrative afterwards indicating what i'd done.  There isn't much interaction available with your surroundings -- you can't talk to anyone, or do much except shoot them or tie them up with your rope.The worst part of the game though is the sparse map with large expanses that you need to travel alone on your horse in order to get to the next mission.  I feel like most of the game is spent with the \"A\" button held down so my horse keeps galloping through the empty plains.  I'm going to keep playing a little longer to see if there's anything else worth doing, but so far (after about 20 hours) I'm pretty disappointed and bored.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2010"}

Being dropped in with random players and continuously abused in multiple ways tends to run as the norm.

{"product_name":"B003O6G6RI","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Why exactly were people pissed about this game?","reviewText":"First and foremost, let it be known that I own the PS3 version of this game and while it does offer a few more characters, none of the characters are truly a bonus making both versions even IMO.Now, onto the review-Graphics-The graphics in this game are fantastic. The color is vibrant, rich and although the street fighters look the same as their previous titles (SSF4/SF4), there's something much better about them in this game; especially with the color.The backgrounds are nice; although I actually preferred the backgrounds from SSF4 and SF4 better being that they really embody the location. Some backgrounds in this game lacked the flash found in SF4 in my honest opinion.One thing I really liked about this game was the dynamic zoom ins during double team attacks and supers. It gave this game that much more flash. Also, some things should be noted in SFXT-A. Ryu and Ken's fireballs look different in this one. They actually look similar to Super Street Fighter 2 (1994) rather than the same as SSF4 OR SF4.B. When you beat someone with a finisher, my god does the ending effect look sweet.Overall, the graphics are great.Sound-This is where I wasn't too crazy about SFXT. The music is forgettable. I didn't find one track that I truly liked or cared about unlike the past SF titles (think- Dhalsim, Dudley, Ryu's SF2 theme and Bison's theme from SF2. Also, some music from SF4 as well)The sound effects are on par with the previous SF games this gen. Nothing special and nothing too bad. One thing I found somewhat annoying about this game would be when you're scrolling through characters, the announcer says their name. This is a minor quirk at best, but worth noting nonetheless. The voices by default are Japanese, but you can change them to english and customize them much like SF4 AND SSF4.Gameplay-This is where every thing pays ofF AND IS SOMEWHAT of a mixed bag. The SF characters in this game are the same with some new tweaks as well as a few new moves tossed in for some. But the Tekken characters have weird control schemes that are largely different from Capcom's, but similar nonetheless. Some Tekken characters such as Bob were not the best choice to pick.Anyway, the roster is pretty good in this game and if you're inclined to purchase DLC; you can expand the roster with 12 plus characters. This may be bothersome to some, but to most, it's a matter of wanting to expand your game and the true question of whether or not you actually feel the need to. In my case, I actually did purchase DLC and was pleased with the extra characters. The real downside is how expensive the DLC may be to some. 1600 points is no mere feat, that's like buying a few used games in general.I wasn't exactly agreeable with the DLC price just because the characters are on disc; but what the hell.SFXT also gives you a few new gameplay options, namely the ability to change your characters colors of outfits/skin tone or dressing them up differently altogether. There's also the new take on \"gems\" added to the game. I honestly didn't bother using any gems and could care less about them. Gems worked great in Marvel Super Heroes; but not here.You're also given the ability to tag in your partner being that this game is primarily 2 on 2 fighting. The tag function adds a lot of depth to this game and gives you more ways to take out an opponent.Speaking of the tag function, there's also a hectic 4 characters on the screen at once mode in versus. I was not that big of a fan of this and also wasn't too hot about it on the PS3.With that said, there are some minor gripes I didn't like about this game-The Tekken Characters do not control smooth enough to me nor are their special moves really special to me. I'm not asking for fireballs, I'm just asking for a little more flash.The finishers are different. Instead of the traditional SF finishers where you press down forward twice followed by a punch or kick button, you're instead given finishers in the tradition of Capcom's big versus titles where you'll have to do a simplified down forward x3 punch. This can be a little confusing for some.Other than those minor gripes, I have absolutely no problem with this game and feel that people were expecting this to be literally a SF game with a tekken engine tossed in. The tekken characters take time to master; but are worth the effort. The graphics of this version are excellent. (I found the color to be a little more vibrant/rich in this one than the PS3 version which would be the only difference.)I highly suggest getting this game. It's different from SSF4/SF4 but it's still a good game if you don't mind shelling out extra for DLC characters.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2012"}

I have not played the game, because quite frankly, after my experience with Diablo III I don't need to to provide a helpful review to people. I'm hearing this launch is making Diablo III's look as smooth as butter. I'll never give my money to any company that does this, ever again. EVER. This is it. We either put our foot down and say enough is enough or this will continue and we'll continue to get broken products. And while I am very happy to see this game getting rightfully hammered here, I'm also disheartened to know that all (or at least the majority) of these negative reviews exist because every one means a copy was sold.Never in my life would I have ever thought the day would come to pass where we have to wait in line to play a game. If you are considering buying this, think about that for a minute. Please, I beg you to reconsider. This practice is ruining this industry and the only thing we can do is speak with our wallets. Ubisoft ceased using AO DRM, we can make EA do so as well. The only upside for me is I will gladly pirate it once cracked and sleep entirely guilt free whereas if EA had thrown any respect my way I'd have gladly paid. Thanks for the freebee, EA! Keep it up! You treat me like a criminal, and I'll act like one.EDIT: Apparently, someone has made this playable offline and has broken the borders (obvious DLC expansion).  So the game is locally stored on the PC. What this means is that eventually there will be an offline version with no borders that will be moddable. If EA has any sense they will patch the game to do this. Why would I pay for a game with heavy restrictions when I can have one for free with none?  I'd recommend waiting until a year has passed, things are fixed, and watch what EA does. They continue this online BS, then just know you can have this offline (with many other pluses) through other means, and it will be the game it should've been.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"A Luxury Resident Evil","reviewText":"There are so many reviews of this top game around, that I will keep to the vital points. Is this the best Resident Evil game yet? Yes, It looks absolutely fantastic, but due to familiarity, it's not as scary any more, unless you have no idea what to expect. The zombies don't even fall to pieces in chunks any more! WHY??? Is it in complete 3D? NO! This was hyped up pre-release, but the truth is that, although the camera follows the characters around a little, all scenes are viewed from selected, semi-fixed view points, and you cannot look around at will. Shame! If you make it through to the Bonus game, you can play in first person, and really see the amount of detail present in those scenes. I actually like the fixed perspective of these games, as it looks so cinematic, but imagine the whole game with this freedom... Is it value for money? Yes! This is a long game that rewards some serious time investment. There are many, many locations and places to explore However, although it is a very long game, it's not that difficult! Claire has to battle the Tyrant in the back of a plane halfway through, and this is the only really tough challenge, the rest of the encounters are a bit on the easy side. You should not die much if you are a seasoned player. But the positive details override these small let-downs. Everything looks real! Locations and characters are perfectly realised, and Claire's lighter provides a really beautiful effect. The sounds and music are also excellent, you get to play as three people, and what a story... Dreamcast owners can really boast about this addition to SEGA's line up, and it has to be one of the must-haves of the system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2001"}

This game allows you to have as much fun as you want by providing you with options/freedom to do what you want. You can spend 10 min or 3 hours at a time. You can choose to play challenges, side missions, or contracts. This game is all about options and choices, and it is much deeper than you expect. You have the freedom to choose which weapons/vehicles to use to achieve a given objective. You can try different strategies, or use the same ones, if you so choose.Again, this game will NOT compete for game of the year, and has problems, but if you are aware of its limitations, there is great fun to be had.

{"product_name":"B00019HNNM","description":"The close of a trilogy is a touchy thing. Miramax's slasher pic Scream 3 highlighted the role of each part: Chapter one sets the rules. Chapter two bends the rules. And chapter three throws them all out the window in favor of taking the story full circle.Which brings us to the third part of the Onimusha trilogy, subtly titled Demon Siege. In the first of many switches from the franchise's usual MO, there are three playable characters &#8211; Jean Reno's Jaques, the first Onimusha's Samanosuke, and Parisian military woman Michelle. Each offers wildly different play mechanics, and this coupled with the game's time warp storyline (more on that later) offers needed variety to a survival horror franchise that was never really know for its fear factor.Each character will upgrade their weapons and skills through the course of the game (much less so for Michelle, as she's playable for far less of the game than the other two) in the usual fashion&nbsp;&#8211; collecting souls. Without a combo-laden combat system, Demon Siege relies heavily on timing and strategy to master each of the three warriors. This mechanic is very reminiscent of Enter the Matrix for two reasons: minimal button presses result in onscreen action that looks very, very cool. Two, the timing of action is far more crucial than combos. The difference is that Demon Siege is just a much better game &#8211; the enemies offer more variety, the control is more precise, and the elemental weaponry is extremely varied.While some action hardcores will likely fault the game for its simple control scheme, most will appreciate it for the satisfaction it brings to the screen. Kicking a demon away so you have better range with the Ball and Chain of Doom (my name for it, not the game's) is quite cool, after all. Just keep in mind that plot and combat play equal roles in the Onimusha universe, and each are doled out fairly.On the story side of things, Demon Siege has that dual time period hook. How well is the idea executed? Well, Paris really looks like Paris; and without being able to experience feudal Japan firsthand, all I can say is that it looks beautiful in the game. The plot unfolds at a lightning pace and requires players to use one character (in one time period) to do something, which has an effect on the other character (in the other time period). Switching frequently, the game's pace is so well crafted that there are few places that seem to be a pause &#8211; you'll always want to do that next thing.What I really like about this game is that I always felt like I was getting a new weapon, going to a new area, or fighting a new boss (most of which are ferociously tough, by the way). There was no drag for me. That, and kicking Genma butt made me look badass. Personally, I wouldn't want anything else for my favorite samurai/horror sendoff.Concept:Craft a compelling, edge-of-your seat action game to conclude the Onimusha seriesGraphics:3D backgrounds don't mean that players have camera control, but it does mean that everything looks really greaSound:The score alternates between totally inspired and super cheesy &#8211; but it does fit the gamePlayability:Timing is the key to success and I rarely felt robbed, so it did what it was supposed toEntertainment:Demon Siege is one of the most cinematic games to date, and I soaked up every second gratefullyReplay:HighRated:9 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:The final chapter of the Onimusha trilogy radiates excitement and is the very definition of epic. The opening CG cinematic is so detailed and explosive that I wouldn't be surprised if George Lucas started handing out pink slips to the ILM crew. I know this clip is only a few minutes in length, but it is worth the price of admission alone. Further justifying that you absolutely need to add this title to your library, the gameplay is equally exquisite and is brimming with non-stop intensity. The methods with which you dispose of your assailants remain simplistic and true to the series. Plus, the battles are much larger in scope, the pacing of levels is relentless, and the visuals that you breathe in are all the more majestic. This truly is game development at its finest. While I would have liked to see more interaction in the environments, and depth in the combat, I really couldn't ask for a better conclusion to one of the PlayStation 2's finest series.Rated:9.25 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"New Boy","summary":"Kind of what you'd get if you mixed Resident Evil and samurai's","reviewText":"Played this games a few years ago and I loved it.

My big problem, however, is the lack of tracks and lack of variety of tracks. You can easily play through every single track in the game and eventually you just have to play the same ones over and over. I don't know the exact number, but I'm sure there aren't many.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

The graphics are much better than the N64 and the sound is just as good as the new systems. Super smash bros melee graphics look almost as good as the wii's and that was one of the first games that came out for the GC. The mario party is much better than the N64s. I like the controlers much better than the n64 because it is more like all of the other systems. This is also the first nintendo system that had discs unstead of carts'. And they are also mini which makes it handier. I love how the GC is mini because it is eaiser to carry around and take places. The GBA hook up is fun to use on the games are can use them on. This console has a new beginging of many schemes like the game boy player which allows you to hook up your gameboy and play your game boy, color, and advance games with a custom border to choose from. You even get to use the gamecube controller on the games. This is a very handy item that only cost 10 to 20 bucks and it adds 1 inch to height to the bottom of the gamecube. The gamecube also has the gameboy hook up cable which allows you to do many things on many games such as animal crossing lets you play a different type of animal crossing game on the gameboy that is awesome. Harvest moon has a feature, Zelda wind waker gives you hints while playing it, and many more. Metroid rose from the dead because it was not on the N64 and everybody was shocked to see that it came back out on this and in first person unsted of a side scroller!!!

Of course, the only way to fix this is to buy a new controller. I've went through two controllers like this, and the same thing kept happening. I had my PS2 controller for seven years, and it still functions like new. These controllers last 1-2 years, but only if you take breaks for long periods of time.

{"product_name":"B0088MVP3S","description":"","reviewerName":"R.Suarez \"R-Suarez-\"","summary":"I really wanted to like this game...","reviewText":"Let me start my review by saying I am a huge Castlevania fan, and I, like many, had high hopes for the sequel of the critically acclaimedCastlevania Lords of Shadow. This summarizes what I believe is the main problem of this sequel, the first one was so great and well written that we all expected something at least similar to the original. And this is where Mercury Steam failed to deliver.The following paragraphs may contain spoilers for the original Lords of Shadow, however, I am NOT including spoilers for Lords of Shadow 2.A lot of the criticism has gone to the stealth sections of the game, but the problems in Lords of Shadow 2 go beyond than that. The opening scene of the game (wisely selected to be the demo) shows you in an amazing sequence the vampiric powers Gabriel acquired at the end of Lords of Shadow. However, as the game starts in the present day (after a lengthy cut scene that resumes Lords of Shadow and Mirror of fate), you are immediately stripped of such powers and have to regain them... in your castle. Lords of Shadow 2 uses a quite silly plot device (if we could call it that) so you can travel from the present time to your castle, nothing of this is explained nor makes any sense. As the story progresses characters who died in the prior game reappear, but it is not explained how such thing would be possible, are they a vision? Are they ghosts? Are they memories? Who knows? But it sure helps having them around so they can conveniently explain what you have to do or where you have to go. Which leads me to another problem I have with the game, Gabriel is pretty much reduced to an errand boy who does not question or hesitate to follow orders, from anyone, even characters that, if you played the last game, you know should not be trusted.The infamous stealth sections aren't really that bad, but it is clear they are there to indulge whoever came up with them at the development stage. Imagine this scenario: you fight a boss on the top of a train with full use of your abilities, you defeat him and arrive to the next station, and then you have to turn into a rat to evade 3 security guards (fighting is not an option, the game forces you to stealth though these sections) Like this, there are many other similar situations in which the game forces you to do things that really don't make any sense, like hiding from a character in a library (otherwise you are killed on sight) only to fight that very same character in the next room as a boss battle. Bottom line, in an attempt to make the gameplay varied, they sacrificed having a consistent story told in LOS2.At a graphic level, LOS2 is also disappointing. There is a big difference between the design of the castle stages and the present day Castlevania City (that is what it's called) All the scenery in the castle is simply stunning, the amount of detail is noticeable, something that does not happen with the city settings, whatever may be the reason for this (perhaps the leaked information about a troubled development is true?), it does not help the game either. Something I am surprised no one has mentioned (at least on the reviews I checked) is how pixelated many sequences of the game are, especially towards the end, there are a couple boss battles that I honestly thought were pixelated on purpose as a homage to the NES games, but of course that was not the case. This problem is more noticeable in sequences with bright lights, but happens so often near the end of the game that is just too distracting.The game also offers an upgrade system that in my opinion, is not rewarding at all. Whatever upgrades you may buy, they are barely noticeable. I pretty much played through the whole game with the basic weapons and had no issues at all. The upgraded powers you acquire are similar to the first game in the sense that many of the items and upgrades you find throughout the story are only reachable when you acquire those new skills. I am not joking here, you acquire the full powers almost near the end of the game. Do they really want you to backtrack the whole game to find those upgrades when you are 3 bosses away from ending the game? You may want to try it if you want to replay those stages but you certainly don't need to, I didn't and was successfully able to defeat the last bosses without them.  How so? The battles in the game are unbalanced to a point beyond frustration. There are maps where enemies will be thrown at you that require a lot to do to kill them (like huge demons or the big mechas... yeah, Dracula fights mechas in this game), which is pretty much an impossible task to do when you have other big enemies attacking you. On the other hand, if you master the power to become mist, you can pretty much defeat any boss in this game if you time your powers right. The mist power makes Gabriel invincible when used, so you can literally stand in front of any enemy hitting them and turning into mist when they are about to hit you to prevent damage.In all honesty, I really wanted to like this game and I would lie if I said I did not enjoy playing some bits of it, but it is nowhere near as good as the first Lords of Shadow. If you like Castlevania games you will definitely want to play this one, my recommendation? Wait for a price drop (though it seems to be dropping price rapidly) otherwise, there may be better hack n' slash games out there for you to try, like the first Lords of Shadow or any game in the God of War saga.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek Lowe \"twerking the jalopy\"","summary":"2 Things I do not like","reviewText":"Okay I picked up a Vita as my PS4 Companion, I have been talking about getting one for years but with the Gamestop 50% more trade in credit this week I just pawned off a ton of my PS3 games and decided to pick one up.First OffThis is a very impressive hand held system, completely blows away any other hand held in the market. the graphics are insanely good and the controls are amazing. Mix that with Netflix and Hulu on board and I am in heaven. except a couple things that make me wonder what the hell Sony was thinking.You can not deny it when you first turn it on and load up your first game ( KillZone mercenary ) And it looks just as good as your PS3 and handles just as well also. This is a solid system that has been over shadowed by less worthy hand held systems. Then you head over and link it up to your PS4 as a second screen to get some game time (Second Son ) in your front room while the PS4 is in the bedroom. heavy solid built and worth every penny.Buy my problem is that we have 2 people who use the PSN account in my house ( guessing some people have more ) and you find out that in order to let two people use a PSV ( each on their own account ) you have to have 2 memory cards. each memory card is tied to an account and this is just part of the problem.If you could use a standard SD card like every other device on the market this would be easy. but instead you are locked into a proprietary Sony SD card and the prices are insane for these cards. A 4GB card will only hold at most 2 small games since each game runs in the MB's I mean come on the graphics are AMAZING.I would need at least a 32 GB card and that will cost you around $65-$75+ especially since I am a PS Plus member and look forward to my free monthly games which are digital downloads and will eat up space on the memory card. you can run down to any wall-mart or even Walgreen and pick up a standard 32 GB SD card for about $20-$25 these days. so the markup on the Sony card is just insane !It is simply a defense tactic ( from piracy )  that should have never happened from Sony. I get you want it tied down so people can not copy the games but there are much better ways as far as ( coding the OS ) is concerned to accomplish this without making people regret the purchase.Don't get me wrong I love the PSV so far and am very glad I decided to get one, but I regret not reading more about the memory card issue before I purchased it now.On top of this why make it so insanely difficult for your core customers ? The PSN account is a monthly & annual revenue stream if people decided to purchase a subscription from you they are dedicated to your system. Sony is pretty much making it hard for the people who actually support them.

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack - by taking out rivals and instigating spectacular crashes. Speed, depth and destruction are waiting for you, in the game of on-the-go automotive anarchy.","reviewerName":"Alex \"47\"","summary":"Best Burnout Game...?","reviewText":"The Burnout series has been on my list of greatest racing games since Burnout 1, which was a super sleeper hit. Although Burnout was lacking in a lot of things, it had potential. I didn't think a second game would EVER come out, but to my suprise one DID come out. Burnout 2: Point of Impact ( My favorite Burnout game besides Burnout Legends PSP ) That game got a lot of praise, and soon enough, Burnout Takedown came out, and just recently, Burnout Revenge. However, Burnout Legends is a handheld exclusive ( PSP and DS only, but the DS version really stinks. )Graphics: 8.5/10. Probably the low point of the game. This may be confusing; but Burnout Legends in my opinion is THE BEST looking PSP game available, but I give it an 8.5 simply because of glitches. If you are riding up against a wall or something, you can see through them and stuff, just like if you take someone out against a barrier or a wall, their car will often fall through a glitch. It isn't a bad thing really, it just kinda shows a car falling through blue sky. Moving on!Sound: 9.5/10. At first the soundtrack I thought was horrible except for Goldfinger's song \"I Want\", but that isn't really true. After listening to the songs over and over again, i found myself singing some of the songs at home (D'oh.) The soundtrack is all new songs that weren't on any other Burnout. Besides the music, all the other sounds are in there, they are pretty much exactly the same as the console versions, they sound very good.Control: 9/10. Can it get too much easier? In standard driving mode, X to drive, D-Pad or Analog nub to manuever, square to brake, and R to turbo; that's pretty much it. It's very simple, although the game isn't simple.Fun: 9.5/10. Not suprisingly, this was an amazing game, Suprisingly though, is how well the frame rate holds out. You can literally be taking down cars over and over again and there will rarely be any lag on screen. Due to the fact the PSP's screen is so well sized, you can easily see cars well up the road. ( assuming your face is on screen into action, like mine. ) Many people say this is not worth more than a rental. Uh.. wrong. It is pretty much impossible to even beat this game in a rental period because it's so in depth. I've played it fairly often since christmas ( I have 4 other PSP games ) and I'm only 18 percent through the game. This is simply an amazing game, and a true PSP gem. A must buy for a PSP owner, no doubt.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2006"}

Taking place in a devestated New York City, Aya jumps back and forth through time to take on fiendish beastly enemies called The Twisted.  That's as much of the plot as I'm going to reveal, because it doesn't take too long for things to get so outlandishly ridiculous and convoluted that there's a good chance your head may explode in the process.  Story aside however, The 3rd Birthday offers some pretty good third-person action and shooting elements, along with some great weapon upgrade and customization options as well.  For a PSP game, the game itself looks great, and the cut-scenes are just gorgeous sights to behold.  All this doesn't quite make up for the stiff controls, but that doesn't detract too much from the total package.  All in all, The 3rd Birthday is a fun, albeit flawed, action/RPG that's worth your time, and one of the better recent PSP games you'll find out there right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2011"}

The weapons represented in the game really are what was avaiable during the war (in other words you're not running around with an M-16 wasting everything in sight) The ammunition dispersal is realistic. You take it off dead enemies, steal it from warehouses.  The missions are very plausable. You had to take out German weapons productions, stop the Nazi A-bomb, and destroy a V-2 rocket lab.  And, unlike most other games, you do have to watch what you shoot! If you nail an oxygen tank, for example, you and anything withing ten feet is done for. I've seen some screen shots for this game.

Well, to make a long story short, I've spent my entire day salivating over a mere taste of the game I just forked over $55 to play, but instead of battling aliens in City 17, I'm battling network problems that Valve should have anticipated... but that's absurd because I want the single player campaign, and my internet connection (etc etc) shouldn't even be an issue.Most games average $39.99 new, but no, Valve demanded $55 (as did Doom 3 and Diablo 2 and all those overhyped \"we're doing you a favor letting you buy this masterpiece at all\" games), and to add insult to injury I can't even play what I paid good money for. I don't know what the game is like, so I can't judge it -- but I can vent my frustration, as others have done (and are doing in increasing numbers), by informing potential buyers of all the pains that come with owning Half-Life 2. You shouldn't have to jump hoops when you've already paid, and to say I'm \"steamed\" (forgive the pun) is quite an understatement.I'm showing Valve how much I appreciate this mess by selling my copy of Half-Life 2 and turning my back on it.

Not only is it more fun to play then the first two Spinter Cell games, but it looks about ten times better then Pandora Tomorrow. This is by far the best looking consol game I have ever seen. Yes better then Halo 2, Doom 3, DOA Ultimate. Better then all of those games. The textures are freaking unbelieveable. Individual pieces of gravel on the ground, textured bricks on a wall, its just incredible.Lets talk abour multiplayer...well...it rocks. It has co-op online which is great. I havent gotton to see if it has the same multiplayer from PT, but if it does, watch out Halo.Overall, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theroy is the best of the best when it comes to Stealth\\Action games. If you have an X-box or a good PC, get it before its gone.Concept- Bring back the worlds most loved spy and make him ten times better.Presintation- 9.7- The box art is a little off(except on the collectors edition) but everything is put together well.Graphics- 10- the best looking consol game ever, textures are incredible, aminations are top notch, everything is awesom.Sound- 10- The first time sound has played a major, and I mean major, role in gameplay. Its done really well.Playability- 9.6- The shooting elements are a little eh but otherwise its great.Entertainment- 9.6- Never has sneeking up behind someone and cuttinmg their throught been more fun.Replay Value- 9.6- Great Multiplayer","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2005"}

As the conversation dies down we feel the need to seek out a game of some sort. I look over at my newly aquired BUZZ Jr. game and wonder if perhaps it would provide the enjoyment we seek. Granted it appears as if its just for children, the back of the packaging has several kids playing the game, its got you picking a different colored monkey and the games themselves don't require too much brain power.And yet we had an absolute blast playing it together. The games were easy to get into and it was alot of fun being able to playfully rival others within the minigames as well. The buzzers worked like a charm and were long enough for us to sit back and relax without worry of tangling or short cables.

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Battlefield Delivers EPIC Battles You've Been Waiting For.","reviewText":"While not ground-breaking, Battlefield 3 is that Epic FPS Multi-player Battle Experience You have been WAITING for.  I have played Call of Duty games and I have played Battlefield (Bad Company).  I am in no ways partial to one thing over the other.  You should find the kind of games you like and play those games.  I have enjoyed the campaign of Bad Company 2 and World at War but never got into the multiplayer of either, I am a huge fan of multiplayer on FPS's like Resistance 3 and Killzone 3.  I just never really got into the online multiplayer in games until a few months ago.Naturally I was intrigued by the hype surround Battlefield 3 and seeing that it w made by the same people who made the very enjoyable Battlefield: Bad Company 2, I thought I'd give it a try.  It is very fun.  I must say I really am enjoying this game.  I got this game at Midnight last night and have been playing it every spare moment I have since then.  It is quite fun, I don't think you'll be disappointed.PresentationBattlefield sticks with the slick black-digital advertising for all it's menus.  There is no real cut-scenes as you boot up the game, no \"you care about the game because of Russians are invading.\"  None of that, it feels like it's saying \"I am Battlefield, that is enough.\"  It gets the job done.  The Battlelog is revamped autolog seen on Hot Pursuit a year ago, which is a great idea to keep connected with your friends on Battlefield 3.Single Player Campaign:Yes, the single player campaign in this game is enjoyable.  But if you're coming here looking for the best FPS storyline, you're not going to find it.  It's a run-of-the-mill Military Shooter storyline that could describe many Military Shooters of this generation, much like the Hollywood Blockbuster Action movie formula, it seems game developers have found a rut that \"works\" so they're sticking to it.  It's not that the storyline is particularly bad, it's just not memorable, it's a summer \"flick\" giving you pretty cut-scenes and little reason to care to get from action piece to action piece.  This is fine if that's what you're expecting.  It's not like the storyline from Bad Company 2 was all that much better, it just had memorable characters that you cared about which made you interested in the storyline.MuliPlayer:I'm glad that I've had a good taste of various multiplayer experiences particularly in the FPS category.  This one is really good.  It sets itself a part from other FPS's with its' huge maps and vehicle combat (which is tons of fun) and sets itself a part other shooters by being less constricting map wise and more strategy based, you need to think in terms of teamwork to outsmart and outgun the enemy.  This game doesn't simply reward you for shooting and killing but also in supporting your team mates and accomplishing other tasks.  I must admit even from a graphical standpoint this game doesn't set itself a part from Bad Company 2 like I hoped it would.  If you're looking for a beautiful FPS on a tight budget or aren't into military shooters as much as other people, I'd say play Bad Company 2 and wait until the price of this comes down.  If you loved everything Bad Company 2 is and are thirsty for more, then get this game.Graphics and Sound:This game looks gorgeous.  It looks beautiful and gives some great \"realisim\" to all the environments you find yourself.  With the huge maps, you will notice occasional screen tearing or an occasional texture pop, but on the whole this game looks quite good, it's a step up from Bad Comapany 2 to be sure but it's not a huge leap in terms of graphics from it's older cousin.  The sounds are phenomenal in this game allowing you to be really immerssed into the experience.Conclusion:This game might be lacking in presentation, storyline and originality or being \"ground-breaking\" (which is quite high as expectations are concerned).  But what it lacks in style it more than makes up with solid, fun FPS multi-player action with some great vehicles to use coupled with a lot of \"realism\" and \"take me seriously\" if that's what you're looking for in a FPS I think you'll really enjoy this game.  In the depth of the guts of this game, the gameplay mechanics are solid and fun to play which is the most important thing about any video game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001E8QA2E","description":"Batman: Arkham Asylum","reviewerName":"D. Everts","summary":"Best Batman game I have ever played.","reviewText":"I wasn't expecting much from this game as in the past Batman has not been treated well by the gaming industry.I am happy to say that in this case they have done it right.Its not perfect in every way, but no game is.One thing that did bother me was the speed at which batman walks, which is terribly slow.  Now, most of the time you will be running though so its not a big problem. But when you do walk its slow.  And the transition from walking to running by pushing a button is a bit on the slow side as well. Truly this is not that big of a deal though.There are LOTS of Batman Gadgets in this game, some of them you will have to use to progress through the game and some are just there for spice.Throughout the game, Batmans costume will get cuts in it and the cape will start to look tattered.  Now, this isn't like the new Wolverine game where the damage is a direct reflection of what your doing, its more like the farther you get in the game the more withered the costume looks.  And each play-through I notice that its the same exact formula.  You will see the same cut on your chest in the same place at the same time on a second play-through.There are a lot of characters in the game and I love how they were treated.  The art guys did a great job of making everybody look great and updated.  Joker was more of a throwback here and I liked that a lot.I believe in order to be a good review you need to understand what you will be doing in the game so this next section aims to give you an idea of how the game works.The game is about combat, stealth, gadgets and puzzles.CombatYou will find yourself performing many combos and cool moves, which are contextual.  What I mean is, lets say your beating on a guy and you have hit him 3 or 4 times and another guy is walking up behind you and starts to attack, you can press Y (I used a 360 pad for the PC) and counter that blow even mid swing on the guy your fighting.  This is because the fighting system seems to be built in such a way that it will slow down or speed up things based on how you are fighting.The combat felt well done and Batman will be performing combos and jumps and counters almost without you doing anything but button mashing.  Obviously it will be even better if you learn them, and their aren't many to learn.  What you need to learn is how to use them effectively and together.One thing that is cool is you can be fighting one guy and decide to fight another at any time by aiming the thumb-stick his way and continuing your button mashing and Batman will switch to the character your aiming at and usually do it in a sweet looking fashion. He may, for instance, perform a roundhouse like kick over one enemy and into another.StealthThere is a lot of stealth in the game but generally its line of sight and gargoyles.  So you can crouch behind walls and such and do takedowns when an enemy walks by and you can use the gargoyles to hide from the other jokers henchmen that will come around to find the guy dead.  You can also learn an ability to lower from a gargoyle and string up a guy below it.  Its pretty sweet.  I found myself waiting for guys just so I could do it every now and then.GadgetsThe gadgets are fun.  From swinging around levels, to unlocking doors, they were all implemented well.  I don't want to give to much away, but they all work like they should and I had fun using them.PuzzlesThere are a lot of small puzzles that your going to need to do to get through the game, none of them are hard and most involve your gadgets.  Again, don't want to give to much away.There are some fun boss battles too, none of them are all that hard, they just require that you learn what to do.  For instance, one boss fight you may have to dodge his rushing attack and let him hit a wall and get dizzy, then jump on his back and make him hit other things.  Again, trying not to give to much away.All in all I found the game fun.  Its very short but offers replayability if you like to collect things as riddler has left you things across the entire game and some of them require gadgets that you don't have at the beginning of the game.  There are some areas that you must play back through but the environment has usually changed a bit so its less annoying than some games.If you like Batman, then this game is a no brainer easily.  If your less of a fan, you might try renting it (If you have a console) as its short and collecting stuff might not be your forte.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Carmilla","summary":"Excellent Metroid game.","reviewText":"While this is pretty much a remake of the original Metroid tale, it is still highly recommened to al GBA owners.The music and mission of this game holds true to the original and will make you remember the classic like it was 1987 all over again... if youre old enough to remember.Plus the added bonuses, like including the original Metroid game in its entirety, and including bonus galleries and a 15% challenge puts this Metroid game a cut above just about any other game out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"A labor of love","reviewText":"I'm not far in to this game so far, but it has impressed me greatly.Having played many Bioware games in the past, they seem to suffer now from a cold distance now. It's hard to describe except to say that Bioware RPG's like Dragon Age take themselves too seriously and they spend alot of time saying nothing.This is a better game than the Dragon Age, or the SWTOR series. To start off, the world is much more vibrant. The architecture is awe-inspiring with something really neat and not entirely in your view (so you stretch around to look at the great architecture). I haven't been this impressed with architecture since World of Warcraft.The combat is fun and visceral. Yes, it is like God of War, but it is better because being an RPG the combat is customizable. At its core it is a beat-em-up, but with RPG elements. The nice thing is that the player has more leeway in terms of how smart he plays than with traditional RPG's which basically play themselves while you struggle to stay awake.It's also funny. and the dialogue is interesting. A lot is in the new IP and discovering the lore, but there were some characters who I found myself laughing outloud at their cleverness. And I'm fairly jaded. Already, I think it's better than Dragon Age.Really, this is like a single-player world of warcraft before it was ruined by flying mounts, and without the monthly fees, annoying players, and better combat.Now downsides are a few. The biggest issue I have with the game is the death system. When you die, you have to reload.This sucks. I really do not like it. Since with these games, I'm accustomed to having to ressurrect at a different place when dying. I wish that they had come up with an interesting death mechanic. Heck, just rip-off WOW and make you run back to your corpse as a spirit. It would have been cool.There's significant texture pop-in which points to need for improved optimization. Since the company is bankrupt, a fix will not happen.The game itself feels a little \"bouncy\". you see it in the map and in some of the character's movement when she hits an invisible wall.I like this game a lot. I wish that the company had survived and gone on to make sequels as well as the fabled \"project copernicus\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005RKO7","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"If you missed this title now's your chance to get it!","reviewText":"Initially I was disappointed with this port when I bought it. The graphics seemed worse than its PS2 counterpart, in part, because the XBox's power made the flaws more glaring and obvious. That is, until I discovered the noise filter by complete accident. Somehow the knowledge of this feature had slipped me. Once I turned the noise filter off the graphics became leaps and bounds better than the PS 2 version. Everything about this game is better on the XBox. I'm surprised Konami even bothered with the noise filter when the game looks so much better without it. I'm now glad I got this version over the PS 2 version of the game and am eagerly awaiting Silent Hill 3, which promises to tie the other two games together to give us the answers the fans have been waiting for... what on earth is going on at Silent Hill?The story for SH2 remains largely untouched, aside from the additional side scenario \"Born from a wish\", which, in my opinion, doesn't ad anything of value to the over all story, although it does establish that Maria and Mary really were two different people... which raises the question, of who was the final boss?There was a huge surprise toward the end of the main game that I didn't expect (I never finished the PS 2 version) and it was greatly appreciated, as there are far too few plot twists like it. I won't blow it for those who haven't made it all the way through the game.I must confess that there were a couple of times that I got scared, or just creped out. For instance, in the prison with the loud foot steps above James, and a deep booming voice calling out for someone named Ishmael, or Richile, or something like that. I was very paranoid in that room because I was certain I would be attacked by something huge that would take a lot of bullets to kill... something bigger than the Pyramid Head, who was perhaps the most disturbing creature of the game.Wile the story remains deep, and well thought out it is not as deep as the original. This game gave me no clue to what is happening at Silent Hill. Was this game happening at the same time Harry Mason was trying to find his daughter, or after? If it is after, since the demon Samiael is dead, why is Silent Hill still suffering the effects of his summoning? While it answers none of the questions about the town itself that I have (at least in the main plot and documents that I found) the story has a very strong cast, and a plot that develops each character appropriately. You feel for James (until the end) and you feel for Angela, etc. The voice acting in this game is also stellar, and very real. The biggest surprise was how Laura sounded so much like a real eight-year-old girl. Usually the voice acting for child characters is terrible, but not here. The game also features some of the best FMV sequences ever, and the game flows from real time to FMV very smoothly, although the colors were a bit pale, and the real time graphics suffered some anti-aliasing and edge enhancement issues, but otherwise looks brilliant. I was especially impressed by this games light sourcing. Once that noise filter came off this game looked almost as good as GameCube's Resident Evil. For those that don't have the PS 2 version, and those who have missed this game be sure to pick it up. Just be warned it is nowhere near as terrifying as the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2002"}

It is ultimately the story that drives this game, which is refreshing these days, and the story is engrossing enough to keep you wanting to play.  I know that the game isn't for everyone.  It doesn't require too much skill and the pacing may be too slow for some--I thought it was fine.  Ironically, I find this game to be relaxing.  It's a murder mystery but the way the game flows and the forgiving qte's give you little reason to tense up while playing.

Do not, I repeat, do not believe any negative reviews you see for this game as far as fun factor and story go. I don't know what is in some people's head, but don't believe the negativity. If you enjoyed the first two Batman games in this series, or if you haven't even played the other two games, you will enjoy this game. This game is just like the other two, not much different, but how much different can you make it, it's Batman. If it ain't broke, don't fix it! Some people are upset because the Joker plays a major role in this game. What would Batman be without the Joker, his nemesis! He was fun in the other two games and he is fun in this game, albeit Mark Hamill did a better Joker voice. People must also realize that this is a prequel, so it makes sense that the Joker would be in the game again. There are some frustrating moments like some freezes here and there but nothing that makes you throw your controller and not play the game. People who played the game on day one release complained about some technical issues which is why I rarely play games on day one because updates are sure to come. I bought the game on day one but didn't play it until a week later. Soon as I popped it in, updates needed to be downloaded. No major problems for me yet. I will say that I enjoyed Batman: Arkham City more, but this game is still fun, fun, fun... With all there is to do, it is worth the money, and I don't say that often!Addendum: After 45 hours of playing and reaching 44% completion, it happened. During the Blackgate prison sequence in search of the Joker, the game glitched. It was a major glitch that made the game unplayable from that point on. The game did not do what it was supposed to do and I could not progress. I'm stuck in limbo with nowhere to go! Needless to say, I had to start the whole game over. This is totally unacceptable for a game that cost sixty bucks! Up until this point I was having loads of fun with the game. It's still worth buying, but major glitches like this have to be fixed, pronto! I will not change my score for this game being that they are for how much you like the game, and I really like the game, but major issues like this are unacceptable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001B15RA","reviewerName":"Miketheratguy","summary":"I've had around 20 systems, and this is one of the best.","reviewText":"I stand by my original review of the Xbox, but a couple of the negative votes I've gotten were possibly because I clearly preferred this system to the others of its generation. I'll try and be more fact-based if I came off as biased before, so here's my hopefully smoother review.THE SHORT: Graphics on par with and sometimes surpassing the other consoles of its generation, the ability to record music to the system and play it (sometimes in games themselves), great online service, and extra long cords. I don't have many problems with this system, though it is pretty clunky and it's a shame that dvd playback requires the seperate remote controller.THE LONG: I've been gaming for over twenty years, and developed favorite and non-favorite systems. This one's high on my list. I've always been a Playstation fan and own all of Sony's systems (as well as the Gamecube) so I have no system loyalty- it's just turned out that for me, the Xbox hosts the best games and has features that I really appreciate.The PS2 was my favorite for years, more so than the 'Cube because the PS2 got lots of exclusive games that are more of my type- Silent Hill, Grand Theft Auto, and late in its life outstanding titles like Shadow Of The Colossus.At first I didn't care about the Xbox- I waited for the game \"Morrowind\" to be released but until then it did nothing for me. I liked its custom soundtrack ability, which allows cds (some versions of the system allow burned cds) to dump their music onto the system for listening anytime. It works in a good selection of games, too- listening to my own music play during Grand Theft Auto makes the Xbox version the one I prefer, since they're so similar.And that's my point. I didn't like the first games for it, so I waited on the system. Once Morrowind came out I got the system and adored it, but more because it was simply \"the system that Morrowind is on\". After that game however, more started flowing. Many of my favorites were being released for all the systems or at least the PS2 and Xbox, and through the power of this large system's hard drive, many games load more quickly and sometimes look better on this system. Thanks to this, I started building my Xbox collection and noticed more and more how much I preferred it.The reason is this: A system should be bought not only due to performance, but more so due to whether it's got the games you want. PS2 and Xbox seem to get a lot of the same good ones, so for me the swaying factor is the extra functionality of the Xbox. The music ripping is handy- the Box in my living room and has replaced my cd player since I have about a thousand songs on it. It's also a dvd player as good as the PS2's: You get zoom control and multi-variable skipping speeds, and the playback is fine though it is silly to always have to use the system remote (there's no way to use the controller for dvds at all). So don't lose that remote! The other negative isn't too big a deal, but can be awkward- this system is pretty big and clunky, weighing near ten pounds. That makes it pretty inconvenient to bring anywhere (such as on plane trips or to friends' houses) but at least you can save game data to portable memory cards like with the PS2 (saves also go onto the system's massive memory automatically). The system's big size also allows for the use of break-away cords, which seperate at the base so it won't kill you if you trip on the cord. Like the remote, don't lose that connector piece of cord though.But in addition to stuff like this, there are little things too- the cords are super long, making this the only one I didn't need at least an RF extension cord for. I like the size and comfortable feel of the controller as well- The PS2 controllers are still probably my favorite, but the now-standard small Xbox controller is a nice smooth fit.Lastly, both the PS2 and Xbox offer online multiplayer gaming. I've never used the PS2 service- there aren't a great deal of games that utilize it, I don't know if you always need their pricy network adaptor add-on, and I've heard that the support just isn't that great. Not necessarily a fact, it's just my limited knowledge of the PS2 online service. Until only last month I'd never signed up for Xbox Live, Microsoft's online service, but I'm happy to say that I love it. There are always website pages that allow you to log on and view stats, scores, options and friend lists. You create a gamer tag, a name permanently bonded to you. Connecting using one of their free 2-month trial cards was a snap- everything was done from my Xbox itself once I plugged the ethernet cable into our broadband connection. From the Xbox menu I created my identification, supplied my credit card number and info, and within minutes I was all set. I threw in my copy of Star Wars Battlefront 2, and again within the Xbox menu was directed to a downloadable bonus pack of features exclusive to the Xbox version of the game. I downloaded after agreeing to the $5 fee (most downloads are free however) and within seconds the content was plugged into my system, playable online or off forever afterwards. I thought I'd use Live only for service like this, but I found playing SWB2 online to be great. Lots of game hosting options, lots of scores, leaderboards, and sessions to look into, and a very friendly interface for not only requesting friendship from other players but also sending a call to them to join my game in progress. I can't compare this to the other systems, but needless to say I was quite satisfied with Xbox Live, and moving the account onto the Xbox 360 is supposed to be a snap, even opening many new 360-exclusive online features.So in all, I'm quite happy with my Xbox. The features are there, but the main question is whether it's got the games you need. Aside from shared classics like Grand Theft Auto, it's also got great exclusives like Morrowind, Fable, Halo, Ninja Gaiden, Sid Meier's Pirates, and more. If you want the highest gaming experience at the moment, the 360 is where it's at and many of the original Xbox games are playable on it. But if that system is too pricy or not old enough yet to have much interest to you, the Xbox is a great deal now at between $150 and $170 dollars. Thanks to some of the games just listed as well as the online service and soundtrack ability, I've logged thousands of hours on this system and had a great time doing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0043B5SLI","description":"","reviewerName":"justsomeguy","summary":"Decent enough.","reviewText":"I got this used for pretty cheap.  I like the action-RPG type of games best and based on what I read here for reviews, I thought this game would be a good fit.It's OK. You play as a girl who is thrown into the whole action-hero thing somewhat against her will. The graphics are, OK.  I have a hard time picking out things that I can interact with (plants to pick up, vases to smash, coins to pick up).  They sort of blend into everything else.  It's a colorful world, but the jerky-fast movements of the camera along with how fast this girl runs, makes it very hard to take in everything around you and will cause you to miss all kinds of stuff.The action is OK.  You can lock in on the person you're fighting, but many times I'll just start swinging in some other direction completely opposite of the direction I was heading.  It's not very tight, the fighting.  I just sort of swing and maybe roll out of the way until I beat the enemy(s).  Even going through your inventory or buying/selling isn't all that smooth.It's not all that fun to play, because even though you think you can't \"die\" in the game, you can.  Many times I've died and the screen just says \"You have died\".  Thanks.  Didn't see that coming.  Would have saved before had I known that was coming.  A lot of enemies early on are just too difficult to fight, and I'm not talking creatures in an area that you're not supposed to be in, yet.  I'm talking like these crab things early on which take FOREVER to kill.  Annoying.Camera angle - a few times during playing in certain areas the camera goes BEZERK!  Like it flies around at the merest touch of the left analog stick!  I have NO idea what's up with that - it's only happened a few times but it's so annoying it makes me want to never play again.But, for what I spent on it, I'm enjoying it so far.  The graphics are good enough and it's fairly entertaining.  A very average action RPG from what I can see.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Chitown Lurker","summary":"Calling this a new game is a stretch","reviewText":"There's two key elements to this game: the campaign and the multiplayer. It's pretty much unanimous that the campaign in this game is true to the Modern Warfare formula: short, loud, and awesome. It's like the video game equivalent of a Michael Bay flick...and like a Michael Bay flick, the characters are paper thin, but that's not what we came for, is it? I have no real complaints here. Modern Warfare 3 keeps the series at the pinnacle of FPS campaigns.Now for the part that matters most in a game like this: online play. Basically, if you liked Modern Warfare 2, you'll like this. I can confidently say this due to the primary issue I have with this game: it pretty much IS Modern Warfare 2. Aside from the new maps and some tweaks to how weapon loadouts and leveling are handled, and some superficial kill streak options, nothing has changed. Granted, this IS the third game in an offshoot series...i.e. it's not \"Call of Duty 8\", it's \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3\", so naturally a lot of elements will stay the same. Still, I would have at least liked to see some of the stuff from \"Call of Duty: Black Ops\" incorporated into this, like running dives, a few graphics effects that seem to be missing, and the high degree of personalization it offered (e.g. emblem customization). So while this game is a slight step up from Modern Warfare 2, to me it actually feels like an overall slight step back from Black Ops, at least in terms of gameplay and features.Now, for the stuff that makes me legitimately angry. The lag issues that cropped up in recent Call of Duty games, that have long been one of the biggest complaints against the series? Yeah, apparently zero effort was made to correct it. This results in now classic situations where you might unload on somebody who isn't even looking your way, only to get one-shotted...then have the replay show that they fired first and you never got a shot off. All this despite the game claiming you have an optimal connection. This results in wildly swinging results being very common, where a person might go 12-1 one round and then 3-10 the next, with the only variable being a change in the game host.This is due to the peer-to-peer architecture of the game, as opposed to having dedicated servers, but if they insist on going this cheaper route, they're about 4 years overdue now for addressing this. It's unforgivable that such issues remain.The OTHER massive and unforgivable issue is the return of quickscoping/no-scoping, where snipers can exploit the aim-assist to get one-shot kills on people without even looking through the scope. The natural result is people being able to use sniper rifles as massively-overpowered and hyper-accurate shotguns. This was the biggest gameplay flaw in Modern Warfare 2, and the fact that it hasn't been resolved is at best a rather pathetic kowtowing to the cheesers, but frankly reeks more of pure laziness. Why fix it when you can just leave the flaw there and pretend it's a feature, right?In summary, none of the main flaws of Modern Warfare 2 have been addressed, and very little substance has been added beyond what the Modern Warfare 2 map expansions offered. The net result is something that feels like little more than a $60 map pack for a 2 year old game with another fun-but-short campaign included. Is it fun? Absolutely. Is it worth $60 if you already own Modern Warfare 2? Not really. I struggle to figure out what these developers were actually doing for the last 2 years, because they sure weren't writing much code.Modern Warfare 3 is fun, but it still feels like a rotten cash grab.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"3 games and they still can't make a good one..","reviewText":"I guess that's why Cod sells so much and why CoD fans love the series so much is that it uses the same bland template over and over again, yes the action is good, you get to see crazy things you probably won't be able to see in other games, but it's still hasn't innovated whats so ever, same boring bland flat cliche story of kill the bad Russian, same boring game mechanics.Story was somewhat boring, it's whats called a flat story, which means the action dulls out, in a good story it's more of a roller coaster where you have you have your downs, then it builds up to a high action scene, or some combination of that. The story also makes fine use of the cliche kill the the bad Russian terrorist before he blows up the world. I also found myself once a good way into the story, not really caring about the characters, as you're switched between characters in different parts of the world, which kills any attachment to the main character, so in a way it's hard to care about your character which a bad sign for a vg. Boring, forgettable characters where if you asked me who was who, I couldn't tell you. The campaign was a bit longer than I expected but it's still just about 7hrs, also the sign of a not so good game.Graphics were pretty good, no jaggies on the 360, sounds were terrible, guns sounded like airsoft guns, and explosions sounded like fireworks. And seriously, hiding behind a mailbox should not save your life, nor hiding under a light tent should save you from a mortar strike. Gameplay mechanics, boring, nothing innovative so goes w/out saying that there's 0 creativity, bust in the door, slow-mo, shoot the guys, yawn. Veteran difficulty is annoying, instead of making the AI harder like in Halo, you have a lowered health and more bulllets are sprayed at you.Multiplayer, still just as bad, I only tried this as they said that all of the modes could be played offline, which I took as bots, which it doesn't have, the only truly offline mode is spec-ops which is MW's form of zombies. This is why I personally prefer Halo and what actually makes it a better game, balance. Only in MW3 could someone of lesser skill (noob) kill a better player, how? The noob could play more and get good attachments and guns, and be able to kill a better player more because he has a better gun, attachments, perks, etc. In Halo everyone starts out w/ the same loadout (depending on game type), meaning it's truly based on skill who kills who. It's also based on who sees who first, I started noticing that alot, once your being shot at, there's pretty much no way you can make a comeback, again, not based on skill. There's also no vehicles of any kind in the map.Overall, the campaign is kinda fun, get to see cool action scenes you won't see anywhere else, stories not so good, boring mechanics, crap multiplayer.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}

Which can be frustrating playing by yourself with bots on your team or playing online multiplayer with people that are not interested in helping you, nor completing objective. There are lots of mindless players out there that think about just scoring the most kills. This doesn't win the game! but that is not Brink's fault. Your online experience may certainly vary.Mission objectives can range from: Escorting a robot, or person from point A to point B. Protecting a computer or some other device from enemy hacking or destroying it. Then there is the, Destruction objectives, which are easy to understand. While one team takes on the role of defenders, the other team takes on the role and offensive tactics to complete the objectives.Regardless of the task, there are bullets flying everywhere! And the cool part about the gameplay is that your character is able to run fast, vault over ledges or slide on the ground and of course you can get close enough to smack an enemy with melee. Your character overall is more mobile and faster than most shooters video games. It is a lot of fun, performing these acrobatic feats in First Person View, and it is done very well without any wobbly effects.Brink has been refered to as gun-porn, because there are the usual weapon types: pistols, smgs, rifles, assualt rifles, lmgs, shot guns and grenade launchers. All weapons are initially weak and everyone can almost absorb a whole clip of bullets, but later you can unlock, attachments, and weapon upgrades including armor piercing bullets, and everything has a pro and con about it. So overall it feels technically balanced, but you should try to rake in the XP so you can level up faster, get new perks and unlock weapons.Although after a couple of hours of gameplay, you might get bored with the repetition, everything remains the same (gameplay wise) and there no standard deathmatches or capture the flag modes. It's always objective based and always the same objectives.Even though the graphics are good, they are not up to par with current gen shooters (H3, COD, R6 etc...). Everything looks cartoony and there is an over-saturation of color everywhere. The artist should have also used a different color pallet to seperate the players colors from the foreground and background,The sound effects are outstanding, with all the guns sounding punchy, loud and explosions that will rattle your teeth. The character players have good voice acting and will call out targets, inform you if they need help, and other sound bites.If you like Team Fortress, or Unreal Tournament series, you will feel comfortable with Brink's gameplay. You can play as an engineer, medic, soldier and operative/spy. I felt that this game was overall more fun, fast paced and hectic as everyone receives a bullet shower.Pros:+Fast paced acrobatics+Excellent controls+Excellent sound effects+Fun offline+Great weapons+Excellent perks+Excellent tutorial+Fun maps/level designs+TrophiesCons:-Lack of game modes-Bad coloring-Borky character designs-Campaign is same as multiplayer mode-No ragdoll physicsNote: this is an arcadey type shooter, this is not a simulation like COD or GRAW.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

The last remnants of privacy and intimacy have been swept away in what appears to be a logical progression of the explosive growth of social networks at the beginning of the 21st century. The citizens themselves have accepted this surveillance society in exchange for the comfort only smart technology can provide. This memory economy gives immense power over society to just a handful of people.Remember Me is a 3rd person action adventure where players take on the role of Nilin, a former elite memory hunter with the ability to break into people's minds and steal or even alter their memories. The authorities, fearful of her knowledge and capabilities have arrested Nilin and wiped her memory clean. After her escape from prison, Nilin sets out on a mission to recover her identity, helped by her last and only friend.

It's French, and it basically means that &#34;special something or essence&#34;.  For this game, it's the art.  The character Nilin is a biracial female protagonist.  Points.  The game is set in the futuristic world of Neo Paris...and the city is gorgeous and so detailed.  Point.  You can customize your fighting style, adding moves you want, building your strategy around them.  Points.That being said, the story is good, the art is grandiose, the gameplay is....is...meh.  The fighting was really lacking, as it if was thrown into the game.  Yes it's tolerable enough to finish the game, but not that great.  Of course, I'm coming from Batman: Arkham City, and that game has the best fighting mechanics of any third person action game released on the 360.So if it wasn't for that Je ne sa quois, I'd give this game three stars, but the world...the world is so amazing, the art is so beautiful.  I've played other games with great futuristic cities, yes Deus Ex and Mass Effect come to mind, but none are like this.

Just a small review of pros and cons.PROSIts a Blu-Ray player which some people think is a great thing, myself i still think standard DVDs are just fine and don't see a whole lot of difference.The interface is much smoother than 360, although for some its easy to get lost.Most PS3 exclusives are very unique and different than whats on the 360, and i think in the future they will beat out xbox for major Sony only titles.Much more of a multimedia device than the 360 could ever hope to be.When downloading you can actually watch and keep track of how many megs per second or minute that your downloading, still no estimated time which would be nice.The online gameplay being free is a plus, if you can find anyone who's playing.:(CONSHOME on PSN is ok but has done nothing to improve anything for the system.The graphics engine is still not up to par, close but about 3 years behind by todays standards of GPU's(graphics processing unit). The processors push as much as they can to the GPU but no matter how many CPU's you have its only going to look as good as the GPU will let it. Don't get me wrong some games look great, but still don't perform all that well.Still lacks a great online gameplay and content that you get on the 360.Overall games still just don't look as impressive as on the 360, even exclusive titles, Little Big Planet, Killzone 2, and Resistance 2 look great but still are lacking in a LOT of details and textures, in other words some games still look washed out and have bad frame rate issues.Nearly all of the library of PS3 games have a max setting of 720p HDTV resolution which today is falling behind considering everything is coming out 1080i or 1080p for LCD and Plasma tv's. NOTE:Some games are capable of this native, but others are upscaled and it still doesnt make much of a difference in the picture quality. Xbox 360 has been capable of full 1080i and 1080p since its release in 2005. And all games are capable of it. Check the back of the boxs kids.Some of the games on PS3 suffer from some severe lag especially in situations where there is to much on the screen, various updates and even being able to disable some features on the system have not helped this issue in the last few years.So why the PS3 isnt a bad gaming console it just doesnt have the means yet to be worth buying, i hope for Sonys sake they take care of these issues and make it a system for the masses. Right now its an aquired taste and just doesnt appeal to as many people as it should. The 360 still holds the title for being the best gaming console out there even though PS3 is 10 times more reliable, but its more of a do it all device which some people prefer some don't. I myself had both systems at once and rarely played the PS3 when i did have it. When i traded mine in they said there were actually more coming back and some stores have overstock of them and they just weren't able to move them(sell), i hope this changes, because i think with the right touch it can become a great system until sony comes out with something better in the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Adrian Jenkins \"southerndudeman\"","summary":"A great game, but frustrating flaws keep it from perfection","reviewText":"I must confess that \"Dragon Age: Origins\" was easily my most anticipated game on the PS3 for many months now. And immediately upon release, I played through it again and again. So, it's hard to be wholly balanced in this review, because I simply loved it (enough so that I already have the platinum trophy - take from that what you will).\"Dragon Age: Origins\" is an RPG from the makers of the excellent \"Mass Effect\" (which, unfortunately, never graced the PS3). It is story-driven, and choices made throughout the game can have significant impact on the development of the tale, as well as your party and your view in the world. It's combat engine (which the developers often refer to by \"Tactical Pausing\") leaves a lot to be desired, however. Thankfully,  the combat encounters are not so numerous as to demolish the great story. But anyway:The Good:- Story. The depth of the history of Ferelden (as well as the rest of the world) is incredible. Between storied told by your party members and NPCs, as well as the huge codex you build throughout the game, weaves a fantastical tale very reminiscent of \"Lord of the Rings,\" but somehow less...grating.- Story development. Throughout the game, your character will make many choices which will affect the development of the story. The end goal is clear: kill the archdemon. This is your goal from the beginning, and the game thankfully doesn't pull a switcheroo, where suddenly you're fighting Zeromus instead of Golbez.However, the means to an end can be very different, and often disturbing. While building your army, you can play the champion, or the devious strategist. You can play the narcissistic jerk, or the coward. None of these things can change your end goal, but all of them change the playing experience. Moreover, there are multiple story paths themselves which are made manifest (do you side with elves against werewolves? Do you slaughter a child instead of wasting time trying to redeem him?). Some choices can actually make party members leave you forever. However, there is a problem with this, as I will explain below.- Graphics. They're not great when compared to, say, \"Uncharted 2,\" but with a game of this size, they are exceptional. Human characters look reasonable and believable, while cities and landscapes are lush and colorful. In short, the graphics further draw you into the world in which you play.The Bad:- Combat. Without a doubt, the most frustrating aspect of this game. Your party will often sit around, waiting for you to make the first attack, and get pummeled by an early spell. Your own character will often fail to strike an enemy because s/he is trying to get a \"better\" angle of attack. The powerhouse spells are made useless on higher difficulties, since they will hurt (and often kill) your characters as well. This might be OK, except it is a pain to keep your party sane and sensible. For example, a trap might be discovered by your rogue, but that won't stop your warrior from running headlong and setting it off. There are some interesting ideas here (I was actually pretty excited initially by the inclusion of \"friendly fire\"), but they are not implemented very well. In short, you don't have enough control of your characters for the type of precision the game demands on even \"normal\" difficulty.- Difficulty. A joke. There are four setting. \"Casual\" is a bore. You will never lose a battle. Move to \"normal,\" and you will already be struggling. Heaven help you if you try \"nightmare\". Thankfully, you can change difficulty on the fly, but the higher difficulties turn a great, story-driven game into a horrendous battling grind which involves lots of trial and error (and loss of life).- Party respect. I love the fact that choices can make a lasting impact on the game. But it's very silly when it manifests itself in how a party member likes you. For example, I killed a child in one of my choices, and one of my party members was NOT happy about it. No problem - I just gave him a few bones as gifts (yes, literally BONES), and he was happy again. It just doesn't make sense. If an event doesn't cause a party member to leave you for good, s/he can be mollified by trifling gifts. The suspension of disbelief here is just too great to expect.Ultimately, the \"bad\" points (particularly combat) are enough to drop the fun factor by one star. But make no mistake: \"Dragon Age\" is a great tale, which has a lot going for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

Running the ball never felt so good. The running animations are new. In addition, the new auto-sprint makes the player feel as if he is really running the ball. This feature can be turned off. While running, the weight and acceleration of the player can be felt, while running. The best part about the auto-sprint is the player can focus on just hitting holes, without having to press other buttons. Players can now let the sticks do the talking. The left stick moves the player. Some have not gotten used to that. However, the player can move a lot more freely than using the directional buttons on the previous Madden games. The left stick does the jukes, spins, trucking, studded steps, and even high-stepping. Various catching animations have been added, as well.Gameplay NegativesMany of the tackle animations or lack of, are the same. In fact, the game does not have much physics or double hit tackles, at all. There are too many one-on-one tackles, and other would-be tacklers just bouncing off. This would be known as the tumbleweed. Then there is STILL the morphing, suction, and motion shifting animations. Of course, this is something that continuously hurts the game, yet it has not been fixed. I have seen some new tackling animations, but there is just not enough. It would be nice to hear pads cracking loudly on each snap, including violent hits alaAll Pro Football 2K8.Injuries are way too prevalent in this game. On every other series, a player on the user's team or the computer's team goes down. Injuries do occur in football, but the Madden producers went overboard. Passing is not so easy. Depending on the mode, players can look forward to a defenders getting in their QB's face, so get rid of the football!Some crazy things go on, while playing. I noticed when the 2 minute warning comes, it tends to happen when the play is barely over. Sometimes, the commentator mispronounces player's names. The end of quarter highlights are terrible. It is almost like they pick one random play and show it. The same can be said for the halftime and post game shows. There is no commentary. Plus, the highlights are not in sequential order. When they show the play of the game, most of the time, it really is not what I consider to be the play of the game. This really irritates me. If the Madden team wants to learn how to do highlights on halftime and post game show correctly, look no further than All-Pro Football.Game-FlowThe system automatically gives the player the best play, according to the situation. This feature is like an automatic version of the \"Ask Madden\" option, while choosing plays. Of course, if players want to choose plays manually, they can turn this option off.Strategy PadThis option gives players the various ways to make many adjustments, depending on the situation. Now, the player can see what buttons to push, so the adjustments can be made. In the past, the player had to remember which buttons to push.Graphics/VisualsJust when I thought the graphics in Madden could not look any better, the Madden team shocked me, again. This starts with the realism of the player's faces. The players look VERY real, especially with and HDTV. The faces are increasingly vivid, which enhances the realism. For example, I was playing against the Rams. I could not believe how real Sam Bradford looked. Sam Bradford has a unique face. However, the Madden team got his face 100% accurate to how he looks in real life. The uniforms are more vivid. The helmets are very shiny. The field, stadiums, shadows, and lighting have more detail than ever. Also, the player models are a little bigger than the other versions of Madden. I guess it is the way the camera zooms in on the players, once they get the ball. Many uniform accessories have been included for players to choose from, such as face paint, nose strips, new helmets, socks, and Reebok and new Nike cleats, such as the popular Nike ZM Vapor Carbon Fly TD-396256-110-Wht/Blk.CommentaryThe commentary has improved. Gus Johnson's commentary brings lots of excitement and enthusiasm to the gameplay experience. He has exciting reactions to just about every action players make, especially on a deep pass. I even heard a surprising, yet funny commentary from him, when a player was returning an INT for a TD. When the player was at the 30 yard line, Gus Johnson started singing the Batman song (da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-Touchdown!!!). That was funny. On the contrary, Chris Collinsworth's commentary is still very boring and scripted.The VerdictOverall, the game is OK. This game has many new features to keep the average Madden fan excited to play. However, the Madden producers must at least revamp the tackling animations. I believe this is the last year, which the Madden producers will be able to get by, without focusing on this issue. Until they change this, I will NOT purchase another Madden title. The lack of effort to change these issues is why I give the game a rating of three.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2010"}

However, Resistance: Retribution for the PSP is a just plain awesome game that shows what the PSP can be capable of, and ends up being one of the best games available for Sony's maligned handheld.  Playing as British soldier James Grayson, you take on the invading Chimera once again, this time using a third-person perspective.  Regardless of the change in gameplay perspective, the fast and intense style of the series remains intact, and as fun as you'd expect as well.  The game looks fantastic for a PSP game as well, and the single-player campaign is challenging, but the real meat and potatoes of Resistance: Retribution lies in its absolutely sick online multiplayer modes, which never stop entertaining.  The game also features the ability to link up with Resistance 2 on the PS3, which allows you to \"infect\" your PSP to give James the abilities of Nathan Hale and more besides.  The game's few flaws, namely its occasional shoddy voice work and getting used to its controls, are really nothing much to worry about, as the game winds up being a must play for PSP owners.

I'm not saying that it's a ripoff but if you've played that and then this, you'd notice the similarities but I loved Fallout 3 so much that it was my Game of the Year for 2008 and still one of my favorites with over 120 hours invested so far so Borderlands is basically that plus the loot system of Diablo with the raucous fun times brought on by co-op. With plenty of sidequests to partake on, various ways to set up just one character let alone the 4 available to you and of course the plentiful amount of games, Borderlands might not have the 100+ hours of Fallout 3 but it's got all the fun you'd expect from it. But I'd recommend playing co-op if you can because once you've experienced it, single player feels kinda....lonely.Story: You play as one of 4 characters: Lilith, the Siren who specializes in stealth and sneak attacks, Brick the Berserker who is basically the tank of the group, Mordecai the Hunter who has a deadly bird and a talent in sniperage and Roland the Soldier who sets up an automated turret to dish out the damage. You 4 are on a quest for a mysterious Vault on the planet of Pandora which apparently contains treasures, secrets and technology left there by alien races. You get your information by an enigmatic (and strangely attractive) female with blue eyes about the world and characters you meet. And from there you roam the land looking for this mysterious vault.Graphics: Previously, Borderlands had a bit more serious art design until a radical re-design shift brought with it more outlandish visuals and cel-shaded quality to match Borderlands completely bugnuts approach to its presentation. The result? A really beautiful and stylish looking game where enemies can explode in cartoonish ways (complete with masks that fall to the ground eventually Looney Tunes style), and some great character models, especially Lilith with an ass to die for, and it's not quite a game that's gonna make you think \"my god this game is stunning\" but you'll definately think it looks awesome. Couple of graphical hitches occasionally but framerate tended to be quite solid regardless.Sound/Music: The open world of Fallout 3 brought with it a more ambient soundtrack with moody and not really \"music\"-driven tracks but it was certainly a nice accompaniment throughout the voyage. Borderlands is similar for the lonelier parts with some acoustic guitar but then adds some cool action-y scores for when things get heavy. Voice acting is quite solid too and characters that you control will actually say things unlike the breathing and grunts of most FPS protaganists. Guns on a whole sound awesome though some lack that satisfying kick that other game guns have, especially Mirror's Edge which didn't have great gameplay involving guns but great sound.Gameplay: If Fallout 3 was \"Oblivion with guns\", then Borderlands is \"4 player co-op Fallout 3....with lot more guns.\" In fact that scene in the Matrix where Neo asks for lots of them would be a perfect descriptor in that this game has a lot and they're randomly generated too and they take various stats and features into account such as reload rate, fire rate, whether it's got a zoom, bonus to melee and other bonuses that are listed in red text. Aside from no descriptor what these do (one of mine says \"the lead wind blows\"...what's that mean? Beats me, game doesn't say), it's fun just searching for a gun and when you see a gun that can corrode enemies or make them possibly explode well the days of shotguns and assault rifles with puny bullets seems tame. Some are slightly useless though and more than once I ran into the same Terrible Shotgun variant but when that cool repeater pistol pops up with a huge increase in Critical damage, well that's just awesome.Characters as they upgrade can put their points into a skill tree WoW-style where they can unlock lower parts of the tree for better skills or better ones you got. For example my first character, Lilith's ability is what's called Phasewalk which sort of acts like Fear's Slo-Mo use where you become more speedy but also undetectable for a certain amount of time. Well when she goes in and out of Phasewalk she deals damage so why not add a skill that makes her invulnerable for a few seconds when she comes out? Or sniper dude Mordecai with his bird that can be upgraded to attack more than one enemy and even make them drop better loot. Like a lot of RPG's like this it's not so much that there's a \"correct\" way but just what you deem a personal preference and some skills you might not even bother levelling up. And like a game like Too Human, don't like how your character is? Spend money to reset your points and start over. With the right skill and right gun, you can be practically unstoppable if you can manage it, which makes it a bit more funner than Too Human's skill tree.The big fun factor in Borderlands is co-op and it's what makes this game from fun single player to awesome. Basically you pick Xbox Live on the menu and they'll be a lobby, choose your character and go, with or without others in with you. At certain parts of the game, a new character can enter the fray, enemies will be tougher and more plentiful and having a team can make a dungeon excursion completely crazy. Only thing is that the level cap is slightly high meaning how high a level someone can be to join your game and more than once, somebody 6 levels above me can own anything in the game while I had to sit in the back and fire from a distance otherwise I'd get chewed up. But this makes it funner to level since it can come quite quickly. And a player \"dying\" means they're just downed and act like Call of Duty: World at War where you can pick shots off at enemies however unlike that game where you had to be revived by another player and that was it, killing an enemy while downed gives you a Second Wind where you basically get revived and live to shoot another day. Framerate was quite solid during these parts and can enter and leave without messing up your game or needing a visit to the lobby. Oh and see that gun filled with awesome? Yeah the other guy wants it too so why not fight for it? If you melee someone, you set up a challenge, they melee you back and you duel where you 2 and only you 2 battle it out (though makes it unfair if they're the 6-levels-up guys I mentioned above).Is their flaws in the game? Slightly, in that the story takes awhile to get going and even then you might not like it, auto-equip is on for all ammo and money and nearby guns which forces an equipment visit to retool if the gun sucks and one thing I miss is that the map doesn't actually tell you where the \"transitions\" which function as entries to new areas are so if you wanted to find a specific map, it's hard to look at the map and know which one and you can't set waypoints either, prompting a Brutal Legend-like return to the map for things that are not quest driven.But other than that, Borderlands was one of those \"hope-it-doesn't-suck\" games where the concept and execution can be varying but Gearbox manages to pull it off and hope it makes for a successful franchise. Not entirely perfect but when you have this much fun setting people on fire with your bullets, then you'd just be nitpicking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2009"}

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

It's an RPG shooter with lots and lots of weapons and has the feel of an RPG, of course.What would've been great is the thrid person view of your character.  Also, the game has cartoonish graphics, and althoug violent, makes the game look like a second-rate action RPG.The town characters in the game really do not interact with you, they're practically static sprites who will talk to you only to give out a mission or reward you for one.  Aside from that, you really don't interact with them and it's all about the shooting and #$s kicking, which again although cartoonish is crude and your characters plain cold assassins.A little more thought into the story would be more rewarding for the gameplay, as the game often turns repetitive with just shooting hoards and hoards of enemies with really no different skill than using some elemental weapon of choice or getting them in the head.Aside from that, if you liked Fallout 3, don't expect this title to exceed Fallout 3 in any aspect of the game.  It's truly simplistic and apt for a tad more lazy minds who like more action than reading some story line, as happens in Fallout 3.I still recommend it for any hard-core RPG player.  It's worth the investment.  Oh, and as for DLC, General Knoxx's Fort will suffice by far the other two, even combined.  Although, don't get it unless you want to advance up to level 61 for your skill chart, not too exciting really.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2010"}

Broken down into five distinct open-world gameplay areas, linked on the game map, cumulatively these areas comprise a massive area, much larger than anything ever seen in previousMidnight Clubreleases and possibly larger than any existing racer to date. Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish. Regardless, along the way they will experience not only the visual realism of the iconic boulevards, freeways, and landmarks made famous in TV and movies, but also the realism of the living breathing LA urban experience. Here traffic backs up then clears as people go to and leave work for the day, weather systems come and go and day turns to night, then back again. All the while the race goes on. It's all part of the living, breathing LA. It's all part of theMidnight Club.The CarsMidnight Club: Los Angeleswill feature an astounding selection of vehicles in the Muscle Car, Exotics, Tuners, Motorcycle and Luxury car categories. At the time of publishing only a fraction of the total list has been announced, but a good sampling of what players can expect at launch can be seen below.

The hottest licensed cars and bikes in the world are at your disposal - kit them out, supe them up, and personalize them down to the last detail to make them all your own. Visitthe Club'sin-game garages located in Hollywood and Santa Monica and let your imagination run wild - tweaking and fine tuning through the following three different types of vehicle modifications:Performance &amp; Handling- To become a street legend, you're going to have to tune your vehicle for maximum performance. The garage offers three levels of upgrades for virtually every component on your vehicle, but it's up to you to craft the winning combination that will give you the edge on the competition.Exterior- For the Midnight Club, stunting is a habit and its clandestine Los Angeles garages have all the toys needed to ensure heads turn in this jaded town. From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior. Not a good look! You're going to be spending a lot of time behind the wheel, so renovate and make yourself feel comfortable.Beware or Befriend the Local CompetitionThe street racing scene ofMidnight Clubis tough, but tight, meaning that everyone that you meet in expansiveLos Angelescould just as easily be an ally as an enemy. One thing is for certain though, they are all willing to throw down at the drop of a hat. Just a few of the faces you'll encounter out on the streets are:Karol, Age 45- A veteran of Moscow's underground street racing circuit, Karol moved to LA in the 1990's after the collapse of the Soviet Union. If you're looking for cars, he's your man. He owns two successful garages and claims to be able to get hold of any vehicle, no questions asked. He also sees himself as a philosopher and will bend your ear if you left him. He mostly races around Hollywood and the Beaches and his rides include a 1975 Datsun 280Z, 1969 Boss Mustang 302, 2006 Dodge Challenger and a 1971 Lamborghini Miura SV.Annie, Age 31- Annie has a rep as one of the fiercest drivers in the city. She detests posers and wannabes, is intelligent and sharp-tongued and pulls no punches when it comes to cutting the competition down to size. She has been spotted in everything from a 1983 VW Golf GTI, 2006 Pontiac Solstice, 2008 Chrysler 300C SRT-8, 2008 Audi RS4 and a 2004 Ford Shelby Cobra Concept and can usually be found hanging out near Pink's Hotdog Stand in Hollywood along with her crew.Rockstar Games Social Club: Join the CommunityBeing a Rockstar gameMidnight Club: Los Angelescomes with a huge commitment to the gaming community.

Soatthiamroong","summary":"Rent first and see if you like it or not","reviewText":"I'm not a hardcore fan of racing games, but I like street-racing game. I played NFS Underground years ago and I was interesting in this game because it takes place in LA, where I live. So, I decided to pre-order this one after seeing some trailers. But it's not what I expected.Pros: Nice graphics. The environment looks great even though they cut down the size and details of the city quite a bit. Physics of driving and collision are decent. Plenty of cars to choose and customizations to play with. Many race modes and gameplay mechanisms such as Nitrous, Cold-air intake keep the race interesting. There are more abilities that I haven't gotten to yet, like EMP, Roar, Zoom. And even though you're not a great racer, you can still earn points and upgrades.Cons: The hard-core racers may find the game quite challenging. But this game could be too unforgiving for a not-so-great racer, considering the amount of the obstacles on the road. Just hit something to a stop more than once and you're done for, while the AIs rarely made a mistake. Sometimes I think they even hit the traffic cars on purpose to make you crash.Traffic AIs act like they hate you specifically. They could pop up in a distance that is really hard to swerve. Many times even though I managed to make a pretty nice drift at a sharp corner, AI cars came out of nowhere, crash into me, and that almost certainly cost me that race. Collision detection of the traffic cars could be a little elusive, so it's hard to make a tight swerve while running in high speed.You could get lost quite easily because of the open routes. It's realistic, but quite distracting having to glance at the GPS every now and then, while you have to race the opponents and avoid the traffic at the same time. Free-roaming could be tedious because of the traffic and cops. It's almost impossible to lose the LAPD cars during the early hours of the game with your mediocre car and they take away too much of your hard-earned cash.Cockpit camera looks okay, but the Chase-camera looks stiff. And many times you couldn't see an opponent coming from behind. It could hit you and send you crashing into a wall, right before the finish line, after you take the lead for almost the entire race.Inconclusion: This game could be one of those 'Hate It or Love It' games.The game has a lot of potentials, but I'm not patient enough to stay and find out.You might agree or disagree, the safest way to find out is renting it first. So you don't have to get frustrated and lose your money for a game that does not suit you.I'll trade this game for Dead Space or Bioshock. I might get about $30 credit and I'd lose another $30 on a game that I could stand to play for only less than a week. That's my lesson.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

I did most of the side quests with sarcasitc remarks and finished at 28 hours.A traditional Bioware game has 8 story sequences, each about 4 hours in length.1 - The hero finds himself embarking upon an epic journey to save the world.2 - The hero enters a secret society of mystical warriors.3 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world AB.4 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world CD.5 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world  EF.6 - The hero takes sides in the dramatic events of fantastical world GH.7 - The hero leads his party in their final mission to position them for the ultimate war.8 - The hero leads his party to victory against the endless enemy hoards and defeats the ultimate villain.Dragon Age 2 includes only sequences 1, 3 & 4. The unreliable narrator, in this case, is a cheap device, made of short cut scenes, used to patch over the missing story holes.Since having only three sequences would make the game too short, Bioware pumped up sequence 1 with an extra 16 hours of random side quests, most of which recycle the same generic dungeons over and over. This was done to reduce development costs.The game ends immediately after sequence 4, with a 30-second endgame cutscene that basically says, please look forward to a new hero and a new world in Dragon Age 3.So, knowing all that up front, Dragon Age 2 is still, for me, a 5-Star RPG Experience. Of the top 200 bestselling PS3 games of all time, only 6 are RPGs. I like Oblivion. I dislike Fallout 3, Fallout NV, FFXIII, and Demon's Souls. And I love Dragon Age: Origins.Dragon Age 2, it turns out, I love even more than DA:O. The graphics, while weak, are better than the previous. The new art design fits the world perfect. The combat is faster, equally tactical, and casting spells feels 400% more powerful. And sequence 3, with the big brooding horny guys, is one of the most intensely awesome Bioware experiences I've ever played. Indeed, sequence 3 alone, allows me to forgive all of the game's flaws.My only other regrets are... They should have brought back Morrigan 2.0 instead of Flemmeth 2.0, and given her a bigger role. They should have made the end cut scene longer, with artistic depictions of the fates of the companions and chosen love interest. They should have made the character model of Aveline a hottie instead of an ugly. And they should have allowed the freedom to have naked threesomes.But it's like they say... 50% of a Bioware game is better than 10 Square-Enix games.I have already begun my second play-through, as a male rogue who likes big breasts and awkward lesbian elf sex.

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"It's Been Awhile, Harder to Tell Now","reviewText":"November 2001 Microsoft's alien unit the Xbox is released alongside a select group of launch titles. If asked now a good majority of those games wouldn't be recognized outside of small circles. Rapid fire questioning; why are the controllers so big, four ports is that really needed? What sort of games are out for the xbox? Do they even have a Mario like mascot? All these questions sound a lot like a fit summary of what Bungie's 'Halo: Combat Evolved' could be of use for. Halo: Combat Evolved was an advanced first person shooter that dispensed more pleasure per moment than bullet through barrel. Halo Anniversary is essentially the original overhauled to the Xbox 360's specs with enhanced graphics, some extra features, and bonus content that will have you popping Halo Reach again.From the moment I was able to move around and assume the role of the Master Chief, an imortalized hero of intrigue (guy always wears a helmet) and quick wit, the  Halo universe expanded and I was now just as much a part of it as the marines who unsurredly dodge flames aboard a militant space ship. If that didn't cue you in, Halo takes place a few hundred years in the future, humanity has begun to colonize away from earth. Humans have come in contact with hostile alien specieis collectively known as the covenant. Weaponry is still of familiar basis, vehicles too.Master Chief is a top tier soldier who has all access to any and everything the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) has to offer. Whether that be an assualt riffle, magnum, shotgun, sniper rifle, rocket launcher or dibs on a vehicle it's your choice. The previously mentioned covenant have a unique array of weapons that are destructive to 'shield' technology, where as human weapons are best against flesh. Unlike most shooters, each gun serves a purpose. Choose wisely as you can only carry two weapons and a mess of grenades, which seems common now, but was a real game changer back in the day.A game can be chalk full of features can still be a let down, reality is most toppings lead to bloat. Combat Evolved wasn't mere technical trickery then and Anniversary further highlights those feats now, keeping refinement to a bare minimal (most of which is just aesthetic). Which is why the I spent so much time discussing the original, this is the beloved Halo: Combat Evolved of 2001. This is the game that so many gathered around at lan partys. This is the game that two buddies would take the time to play from begining to end over and over. Start up the campaign and hit the back button...look what we have here... the original graphics (tapping it again reverts it to new specs). Play with confidence they didn't just keep the opening musical monk chant to make you think this is it, though the audio has been remastered too. You can opt out in favor of the original soundtrack though, just look through the menus.A lot of confusion has been stirred as of late, to make it clear: campaign gameplay is identical, from the spacey jumps to the gun reticules. Even with the engine tweaks ( by Saber3D) you  will be able to spot the classic needler melee animation, ghost jump off the wraith, and glitch behind the map '343 Guilty Spark' just with the option of sleeker more colorful graphics. The multiplayer segment is all Halo Reach's department, from the new firefight map to the six iconic map remakes more on that later. People will argue \"why pay for an exact remake?\", where as another camp will argue \"you call this a remake? It's nothingl ike the original, all I wanted was the EXACT game with better graphics!\". Can't please both crowds so they say, Microsoft and Saberactive sure did give it a good try though.Some of the new features are not the most brilliant, 3D is nice, kinect users are treated with privies akin to no more than a thought out instructional booklet (seems a bit extreme).  Introduced in Halo 2 'Skulls' return and are tucked away, one per level. Skulls can be toggled for further gameplay configuration upon discovery. Different skull different option. Some make the game harder by reducing ammo intake, others add comical explosions and shifts in dialogue.If the new graphics don't merit a second play through, perhaps terminals will if you were a fan of the original. Much like skulls, terminals are hidden, as far as I know there is one per level and further bonds player to story. The second half of the game suffered from back tracking, Anniversary's graphics attend to this fatigue by further seperation (weather/lighting). The levels weren't bad, a second serving could've been passed as the first offerings had much to marvel over.One of the draw backs with the retouched graphics is that you may get slightly caught up on objects that for whatever reason don't transition, most often these include small rocks and tree roots. The AI has held up very well over the years, if a troop isn't combat alert chances are they will poke fun at that with comic relief. Seeing the marines move the same as yester year under a new looking glass is also comical in its own right. Covenant grapple to cover and evade explosions in the finest way a game of this age can handle. Still not familiar with the covenant? A quick glance will expose which ones are the leaders, which are the fodder and which ones to keep an eye out for, much like Reach.Art wise this Halo has the most saturated palet, where as the first was a bit more dry and authentic. Take advantage of the great dynamic, switch between new and old. Covenant, as mentioned above, now are scaled to Reachs caste. Ever see a lowly grunt up the ranks to adorn a leader like status? It's still a grunt, and you will shoot it down with ease. Elites go from intimidating to more ferocious as the headware they adorn expands. Flood are spooktastic, shuffling limbs, green drips, incomprehensible growls, they stir horror into the mix.The six multiplayer maps are all remakes and look stunning, ratio wise they are not pinpoint to the originals, in fact  one of two pc ported maps Timberland renamed 'Ridgeline' has been scaled back. For what it's worth, Reach's gameplay is a blast on these maps. In my books Reach had great gameplay elements but lackluster maps. Anniversary not only contributes awesome maps, it also enables a modified roaster of gametypes more in synch with Combat Evolved's damage tables and speed, exposing Reach's felxibility and depth (good news as Halo 4 will be taping into a modified engine variant). For each tributary map there is a faintly modified newer edition. All maps can be altered via 'forge 2.0', a map editor not a map maker!At the end of the day this game was released at the asking price of 40$. If you can make do without the bonus skull activation code available to those who purchased the game new, a used copy could probably be had for dirt cheap. For people who argue 'value' look at it you get: the full Halo:CE campaign with co-op which is sorta hidden, set preference to local in the menu if you wish to play offline splitscreen. A slew of multiplayer maps for Reach, additional firefight map, forge still intact, new multiplayer hoppers, skulls, achievements even extra multiplayer ones, remastered audio and the newly introduced terminals.Lastly heres a list of the multiplayer maps:Beaver Creek: Battle CanyonHang 'Em High: High NoonDamnation: PenanceTimberland: Rideline * Halo PC mapPrisoner: SolitaryHeadlong/ Breakneck *Halo 2 mapInsatallation 04 * New firefight map","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2012"}

Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"Quercus Alba","summary":"Great Replay Value - even better 2nd time thru","reviewText":"I just finished a second playthrough of BGDA II.  I first played it 8 months ago, using the Cleric character on Normal difficulty.  I absolutely loved the game that time, but I couldn't beat the final Boss for anything.  So I put the game up and played other games for 8 months.For the second playthrough, I played the Necromancer character on Normal difficulty.  It was even more fun than the first time.  Because I knew the ropes a little better, I was better able to manage the Item Upgrades system, and the Necromancer character is both more powerful and more fun than the Cleric.  So... it was even better the second playthrough.  And I beat the final boss with no problems.I will plan to play it again in a while with the Monk.  This game is so fun it is addictive, and the replay value is very high.  I also have played BGDA I as well as both PS2 Champions of Norrath games, which all use the same engine and similar setups as this game.  They are all great.

My first year I crossed over to 2K was 2K9, then I screwed up and got 2K10 which was the same game with my player added, Live 10 should have been my purchase, but 24 was on the cover, 24 hypnotized me into a purchase.Anyway, this year we don't have a choice with Elite 11 tapping out.  After playing 2K11 for the first time last night I came to a quick conclusion, this is the best basketball game ever.  I won't have as much fun as Live 2005 PC, becuase we had amazing leagues that lasted for two seasons and you could play sick D in that game, but it will be a close second on the fun factor.Presentation has IMO always been 2K's weakness, that's where Live domiantes them year after year, and makes 2K just a game with only great gameplay, but 2K11 did the presentation this year better than it's ever been done before.It's a near perfect game; there are online issues, but I assume they will be fixed.  The one thing I'm REALLY DISSAPOINTED about, because I'm an older gamer, is the legend teams.  They made up bench players, total fictional players, and it's the same bench for every legend team except for the Bulls teams.  e.g smith, jones, garcia, heinz webster is the same bench that every legend team has!?! For that reason alone for me it's a 9/10.  I rate in whole numbers.I hate paying $60 for a sports game because I'm so cheap and the rosters change every year, but you'll be very impressed by 2K11's package this year.  It truly makes Madden look like a pong.  It's better than MLB the show as well, because the Show's excellence is the graphics because that game certainly isn't perfect.Thank you 2K for this amazing game, that's coming from a Live fan and skeptical gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2010"}

Though it has always been somewhat of a third wheel when it comes to Nintendo games, the Prime series brought in many new fans, and though it was quite different from the 2D counterparts, it still managed to bring that sense of isolation and loneliness we've come to expect from the series into a new realm. With the Prime trilogy completed, many gamers wondered what was next for the series. They didn't have to wonder for long.At E3 2009, Reggie Fils-Aime unveiled Other M with a teaser trailer, and fans couldn't wait. Now that its finally here, the game has met with much criticism, and has received a very mixed response. Here is what I think.Other M is an attempt to \"return Metroid to its roots\". It utterly fails in this department, as it is nothing like any other Metroid I've played. You still have your exploration, and your item collection, but Metroid is far from the only game that has this. You can't slap energy tanks and missile packs in a game and say \"There, now it's just like Metroid!\"The game tries to combine 2D and 3D elements, but ends up just being 3D in the end. This isn't really a problem, but considering they were attempting to return the series to it's roots and all, shouldn't they want it to feel 2D?Then there is the combat. I'm torn on this one, myself. Although it is cool to see Samus dodge a charging beast, and then shove her arm canon down its throat, combat just feels too tacked on. The game has an auto aim system that is extremely flawed, and it is almost impossible to pick one enemy over another when in 3rd person. By aiming the controller at the screen, you switch into an first person view, letting you aim with the wii remote to pick certain enemies, and lock onto them. This is also the only way to fire missiles. While in first person view, you cannot move, and this can sometimes be extremely frustrating.Which brings me to controls. The game is controlled using a single wii remote held on it's side like an NES controller. This would have been an excellent choice had they actually made the game as if it were 2D like they were supposed to. This game, as much as it doesn't want to be, is a 3D game. 3D games need analog control! As I mentioned, you can enter first person by aiming at the screen, and this is just a frustrating way to handle that.The game also likes to throw in segments where you are forced in a first person view and must play a game of Where's waldo to find God knows what, because they never tell you what it is you're supposed to be looking for. This wouldn't have been so terrible if they weren't so vague 90% of the time, and if it weren't so game breaking. You could be thrown into one of these segments after a lot of combat, or immediately after an action packed cut scene, and it just doesn't work well.Speaking of things that don't work, lets talk story. Samus has just woken up some unspecified time after defeating Mother Brain in Metroid III(Super Metroid). During her time in this facility, she had a dream or flashback, depicting the end of that battle, and how the baby metroid sacrificed it's life for her. After going through some training to make sure she was healthy enough to be let go, Samus hops into her ship and goes on her way. While traveling through space, she receives a distress signal from a vessel called the 'Bottle Ship\". Because of it's annoying high pitch, she names this signal \"Baby's Cry\" and zips down to help. After entering the vessel, she runs into her old father figure/love interest/who gives a crap what he is, Adam, as well as his crew. Now, Samus Aran is a pretty amazing person. She is strong, has a suit made by an ancient warrior race, and is allegedly one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy. You actually start this game with EVERY ability in the game. This is true for most game sin the series, and every time, she loses them due to some sort of explosion or similar effect. Apparently, they were getting sick of that idea, and instead, she now simply refuses to use them until Adam authorizes them. This is stupid and goes completely against her established character. While somewhat understandable in some cases, I refuse to accept that while traveling through a high temperature, magma filled room, and effectively dying of heat stroke, Samus would not activate her varia suit defenses because she was not told to do so. As for the crew that was with Adam, we never really learn much about any of them, because most of them are there to serve no purpose aside from dying. Of course, no one cares that they are dead, because no one cares about them as characters. Except for Anthony Higgs. He deserves his own series.The game isn't all bad though. The graphics are pretty, and it is in fact, one of the best looking wii games. Unfortunately, this has no bearing on the game play. The music is kind of nice, but there are hardly any of the classic Metroid songs or jingles, which is a real drag. Even the classic item noise is absent. In fact, the most recognizable song I heard was a remix of the Ridley battle song, and that was a little late to the party. It still brought back memories, though.The voice actors are pretty flat and horrid, and the absence of an original Japanese voice option is disappointing. While this doesn't quite feel like a Metroid game, and certainly is not the Metroid you know and love, it is still a pretty enjoyable experience in the wii's library. I'm not sure why it's still fun despite all of these complaints, but it is. Let's hope Samus has a better outing next time, but in the mean time, Other M is still worth a buy even given all it's problems.I think Other M is destined to be the equivalent of Starfox Adventures. It would've been that much more passable had it not had the name \"Metroid\" on it. But it did. And those are some big shoes to fill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

I know this is supposed to be a review for GB Micro,however, felt the need to talk about DS and new GBA SP in order to make a comparison/contrast for those who are thinking about getting which system.So the ultimate question is \"Is is worth your hard earned money???\"My personal answer is YES.I decided to write a review when I was just playing Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow on GB Micro... man, D-Pad is the most intuitive control I ever encountered and graphic is just, just SWEET~  Those who are worried about being able to see anything on this tiny screen should rest assure because it has the best resolution out of three and you will not only be surprised but also be very happy and proud of it.Do you remember PSOne combo with LCD screen??  One of the reason I liked it so much is because it gives this extra 'charm' to 'less-worthy' games because of its semi-portable screen/system.  And GB Micro literally breathes new life into those games I felt not worth my time because it brings out something more from a same game I used to play on GBA SP  (Castlevania is my THE favorite game of all time, and it plays like a new game with GB Micro..)Really.. GB Micro screams quality here and there..and yes, newly designed DS will be coming out this year (coming out on March 2 in Japan) and it has same D-pad and brighter screen (I do not know about the resolution though).  So do I think it's still worth your money with that in mind?ABSOLUTELY.It really brings out PSOne with LCD combo because that system somehow, somehow turned 'less worthy' games into 'worthier' games.  Same thing with GB Micro.  Its quality brings out something you never noticed before and will fall in love again with those games you have/haven't finished.One thing I want to point out though is long game play can cause fatigue, espeically with your eyes.  I'm very sensitive with visual (had to return Half-Life for PS2 because I got 'dizzy') and I believe its tiny screen does hold you from a long game play (I don't think its the frame rate issue but rather just my case)Anyway, I can tell you that you won't be sorry and relive those great library of GBA games...

{"product_name":"B000WS97QI","reviewerName":"T. Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"This Is A Really Fun Game.","reviewText":"Battlefield: Bad Company is a fun game to play.  Right away I noticed the game has probably the best sounds of combat I have ever heard in a game.  From the sounds of weapons firing to the sounds of armored vehicles running, the game is great to listen to.  The sounds of mortar shells coming down and exploding around you is just unbelievable.  When I walk through forests and fields, I can actually hear the sounds of birds chirping, dogs barking, and cows mooing.The graphics in the game are just great too.  I love looking at the water in streams and rivers.  It looks very real.  The forests and villages in this Eastern European setting are really beautiful to look at in this game.I like how you can jump in different vehicles to drive around in and there is a car radio in the vehicle to listen to while you are driving around.  There are several different radio stations to listen to.  I love the music in this game.The AI in this game is pretty smart.  When enemy soldiers see me, they immediately run and hide behind something.  They have try to out flank me and they have tried to sneaked behind me a few times. I love the part where a enemy soldier runs into a building to hide from you and you can use your weapon to blow a good size hole into a building to waste the enemy soldier. It is also so much fun to just take your weapon and shoot down all the trees that enemy soldiers are hiding behind.  You can do so much damage to the terrain with your weapons in this game.The maps to this game are huge.  The maps are ten times bigger than the maps to Call of Duty 4.  I love the sandbox settings to this game where you can go any where on the maps.I highly recommend getting this game.  Battlefield: Bad Company is a fun game to play and the game has a lot of replay value to it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2008"}
