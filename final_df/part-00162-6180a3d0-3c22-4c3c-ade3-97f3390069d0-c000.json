{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Gets an A for effort... at least they tried","reviewText":"I was fairly excited to play Vegas 2 online. At first, the game was exciting, but after a while of play, the faults of the game were just too obvious. This is without a doubt one of the most frustrating games to play online. The blame lies in both the developers and the players. I'll explain the problems further below.List of my likes and dislikes:* Customization of your character is fun and exciting. No two players online will be the same. On top of that, you can make custom faces (i.e. your own face) to put in the game. I haven't tried this feature, but just the thought of being able to do so is thrilling. You can customize everything from clothing, armor, and camouflage. A big plus to the developers on this one.* You unlock new weapons by going through the A.C.E.S. I forgot what it stands for, but I'll explain what it does. The ACES is divided into three categories: Marksman, Assault, and CQC. You add points to each categories based on how you score a kill. After so many points, you gain a level (up to 20 levels per category) within the category and you can either get a new weapon or more experiences toward your overall rank. I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but some of the weapons within each category make no sense. For example, in the Assault category, you mainly score points by using explosives, but yet the weapons within the category have nothing to do with explosives.* Finding a match online is just flat out frustrating. The lag is nearly unbearable. It seems like the host needs a very good connection in order to host large amount of players. Indeed, the developers can't control this, but I'm guessing they could at least minimize the lag by sending smaller packets.* You will get kicked and banned a lot in this game. I don't know why too. It just seems like every other game I go in results in me getting kicked or banned. I have a mic, and I usually don't talk.* Small maps and same respawn points. I'm assuming the developers made the maps so that you play one round then load another map. The problem is most game hosts use unlimited respawns, which sometimes cause losing teams to be stuck at their own spawn point and unable to get out of it while the other team sits and wait for you to come out of your spawn point. You do get a 5 second shield, which makes you invincible for about 5 seconds when you first respawn. Problem is some people are clever enough to wait outside of the spawn point near a door such that your 5 second shield is gone. I would have loved the game if the developers made it smart enough to respawn at another location on the map once the other team overrun the current position.* Some guns look unrealistic. For example the 92FS looks like it has a huge hole in the center. Other ones look funny enough to me. I thought I was using a supersoaker when I first saw the M468.Overall, I liked the game. But the flaw of the respawn system and the constant kicking and banning and the unbearable lag makes the game not worthy enough for me to play online. Please don't purchase for the full price. Wait until it becomes 19.99 and get it then. The price and content just don't go together. You pay too much for something that seems broken.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2008"}

{"product_name":"B003VWGBBG","reviewerName":"JJ4prez","summary":"Real gamer review","reviewText":"LETS SAY THIS BEFORE GOING ON, I AM AND STILL AM A HUGE MODERN WARFARE / CALL OF DUTY FAN BOYbut when im tired of all the little kids and unrealistic game play, i trade in games like modern warfare to buy Battlefield Bad Company 2Let's start of by saying, I'm going to compare real facts of call of duty, medal of honor, and battlefield with all this review.Battlefield is a REALISM type game like SOCOM and made for war enthusiast unlike call of duty series where you can jump off a 20 foot building while in the mid air knifing some guy in the head through his helmet. In battlefield with theGraphics: 8/10Listen up everyone, the reason why the graphics aren't as crisp and nice as call of duty modern warfare 2 is because its a huge open sand box design and the FPS (Frames per second) rate of having beautiful graphics like modern warfare 2 is pretty much impossible. Battlefield has always been a huge open world multiplayer world and have their own design on all their gaming to produce a more real, fuzzy, shaky aspects of war. Call of duty yes, has great graphics, one that i would give probably a 10/10 but it can achieve that by having smaller slots for players, no vehicles, and not nearly as big of maps as battlefield bc 2.So with people saying graphics suck and comparing them to modern warfare 2, first actually know something about video game development and not compare graphics, but game play. ThanksSound: 9/10So far better sounds than any other game out there besides one, SOCOM. SOCOM actually tested EVERY sound next to many microphones and made it to be real as possible. I have a surround sound so i know, so you can easily tell like games like Modern warfare, Socom, Battlefield, Medal of Honor, who has the bestsound. This game plain and simple has it made in this category, from someone above you on another floor, hearing footsteps, from grenades blowing off, from tanks shooting off rounds, this game is LOUD and amazing if you have a surround sound. All the guns sound real, all the explosions seem like mind blowing adventures.Playability/Game play/Fun : 10/10With Customization with more realistic weapon/vehicle/body perks, it is unreal of how interesting and in-depth they can get.Vehicles, like flying helicopters, and manning tanks to take down a building, is probably the most fun i have ever had in a video game. Even after unlocking everything, with the ability to have everything destroyed, i go to work and cannot wait to go home and drive a tank to have some fun, or blow up some C4 that you can attach to a vehicle and blow up or to a building. It is simply, the most well made gaming system i think out there, including modern warfare 2. Modern warfare yet is a GREAT AND OUTSTANDING GAME, cannot really match the vehicles and fun you can have on battlefield bad company 2, sorry :(.Multiplayer : 9/10One word, squads. Squads is the only way you can beat this game online, no matter how good you are, you will suck if you run around with your pistol trying to do head shots from across the map (cough call of duty cough modern warfare). It's great and very easy to get your friends in on all the fun to have a squad based team, and its amazingly fun. The only issue i have is, sometimes you will go into a game and won't be put into a squad, which sucks and they need to fix, why i gave it a 9/10. Everyone has a mic, so if you do not have one, it is going to suck sense you have to communicate pretty much in order to win.And with addition to the VIP ultimate edition, getting maps, 1943 battlfield, this is a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}

Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions. Confront the assassins' guild, and they take out a contract on you; impress them, and they try to recruit you instead. No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.Players can choose to follow the intriguing main story line or set off to explore the province of Morrowind and the many interesting people and exotic locations it contains. Vast cities and remote villages dot the landscape, each with its own unique look and feel. Hundreds of quests and adventures await as you interact with characters and learn more. Regardless of whether you play a murdering assassin or a noble knight, the game holds endless possibilities and allows you to revisit the main story line at any time.With Morrowind, the Elder Scrolls character system is coupled with an increase in the world's richness of detail. Utilizing advanced 3-D technology, Morrowind features hyperrealistic textures and polygon counts, real-time shadows, vast landscapes, skeletal-based animation, and a complete weather system. Gameplay is further extended with the inclusion of The Elder Scrolls Construction Set, which allows players to modify and add to Morrowind in any way they see fit. Change character or creature attributes and skills, introduce new weapons or dungeons into the game, or create entire new worlds to explore.","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Ahhhh.  So much to do, so little time.","reviewText":"I have to say this is one of the best video games I've played.  I've played a few RPGs such as Baldur's Gate, but Morrowind has more of an openended, do-what-you-want D&D; feel than all of them.  The graphics are beautifully rendered, character creation is fun and versatile, and replayability is HUGE.  I intend to replay this game with different characters, various downloaded plugins, and with some of my own plugins (once I take the notion to start fiddling with the construction set that comes with the game).  This game is certainly not for those who like structure and firm story-lines.  There are simply too many things to do and see, and the game really entices you to get sidetracked, which, to me, is one of its strengths.In a nutshell, sound effects and music are good, visuals are state of the art (especially outside), gameplay is engaging (though on occasion some quests become monotonous and one does have to get use to being rather alone in a world of uninspiring NPCs), and the possibilities of the game, thanks to the construction editor, are virtually limitless.One warning: As many have said here, system requirements (that is, what you need to run the game smoothly) are quite high.  This is a game made for tomorrow's computer. Also, many players will experience at least some technical issues with the game (such as crashes and freezes), especially regarding memory management and its over-sensitivity to certain hardware configurations and settings. If you know someone who has the game, it would be a good idea to borrow it and test it on your computer before buying it.  Otherwise, this is a fantastic game that sets a new standard for the role-playing genre.Rating: 4 1/2 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An amazing game, but has some flaws on the 360 exclusively","reviewText":"The Good: Amazingly deep lore, tons of items, skills, and party members, simple yet fun combatThe Bad: Ugly, some frame rate issues, long load times, it endsJRPGs that were the standard are now being taken over by western RPGs and one of the main developers responsible for this is Bioware. Dragon Age: Origins is a very deep game mainly in politics, religion, and mythology that is reminiscent of Tolkien lore. Not only is the dialog witty and humorous, but everything piece of dialog is spoken with great acting. Each character is memorable and Bioware really does it with their morality game play because it takes ten minutes to decide a choice since they change game play so much; more so than in any other Bioware game.The game has different factions you can play as (dwarf, human, elf, then different classes in those races) and each takes about 50+ hours to play (my first play through was 41 hours). You start by customizing your character, but that isn't the deepest part of the game. When you start out with any race you learn the combat basics, and they are pretty deep yet also very simple.The actually combat itself is the standard hit the attack button and watch the characters hack away. You earn experience by killing enemies and level up accordingly. The game has a radial menu that lets you access your potion and trap making, skills and techniques as well as combat tactics. You can create traps and potions by learning the skills over time, and by using ingredients found throughout the game world (I found both of these useless). Skills range differently from mages and warriors, but warriors can learn different fighting styles such as two-handed, dual weapons, sword and shield, and even archery. Each class can learn other classes techniques and that's the beauty about Origins. There are dozens of different skills to learn and you won't learn them all before beating the game.The sheer depth of the game is mind boggling, but I know one thing that people are concerned about an that is side quests. There are dozens upon dozens of them to keep you sastified, but of course you don't have to complete them all. There are also tons of codex pages to pick up and read on this deep and wonderful lore that Bioware has created. There is enough stuff to read to fill a history book, but if you're not the reading type you can just skip over this. There are hundreds of different items to obtain from armor and weapons to ingredients and gifts to make characters like you better.After playing for about 5-10 hours you will realize how much the game relies on your actions to tell out the story. Unlike other Bioware games you will notice these changes right away and sometimes a decision in the beginning can progressively make things worse or better for you throughout the game, and it will make you regret what you did and that is brilliant.The deepest part of the game is the menu itself in which you equip your gear, check quests, codex pages, and your map, but there isn't much to explain other than your normal inventory menu. Thankfully the game strays away from unnecessary stats that boggle your mind and make you want t quite playing.Playing the game is fairly simple and the controls are easy. You can control all four party members which gives you a nice tactical advantage, but most of the time I just played as my created character. Just remember when a character dies during a battle you have to wait for all enemies in the area to be killed for them to be resurrected (unless you have a mage with that skill). I found the game very very difficult on the normal setting (almost impossible) so the easy setting had to be used and that was challenging enough. Traveling between areas is easy enough since you use a world map, but you can encounter battles in-between the areas.One of my biggest gripes about the game is that is it pretty ugly. The Xbox 360 version is the ugliest with flat muddy textures that looks like you're playing on the lowest settings. Why this is I have no idea, but there is also frame rate issues and long load times every time you enter a new area. There is also some sort of collision detection issue because when you press A to attack an enemy party members will sometimes dance around the enemy before attacking and this can kill you in tight situations. This seems to be a huge issue when many characters are on one enemy.In other words if you love deep stories that deal with Blights, an Archdemon, and a deceitful king then buy this game, but try to get the PS3 or PC versions since they look better. Dragon Age is probably one of the best western made RPGs in decades, and with so many items, skills, party members, techniques, and side quests you are in for hundreds of hours of addictive RPG game play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

As a pack-in for the PlayStation Move Starter Bundle, it works because there's really no better game to show off what Move is capable of.  As a standalone title, it's questionable whether it's really worth forty bucks.  Unfortunately, those looking for the best Move experience have little choice.  No other Move game really shows off the technology as tightly as this game.  But aside from a few really great sports minigames, it's a pretty mediocre game.The game has six sports games to choose from.  By far the best ones to play are Beach Volleyball, Archery and the spectacular Gladiator Duel.  Beach Volleyball took me by surprise, as I wasn't expecting the game to require such precision.  This isn't a mere \"waggle the Move controller to hit the ball\" game.  You're required to actually position your hands as if this were a real volleyball game.  Kudos to Sony and Zindagi Games for adding a bit of realism!  Archery is also equally as accurate, though it's only a real challenge if you use two Move controllers.  While there might be slight calibration issues with this one, it's still great to play.  You have to use the two Move controllers like you're holding a bow and arrow, and the controls feel really solid.  If you only have one Move controller, it's a mere point-and-shoot affair.  Gladiator Duel is probably my favorite minigame here.  The 1:1 tracking is extremely impressive.  Again, for the true experience you need two Move controllers.  I found myself moving like I was truly in this fight, and it's exhilarating.  It requires fast thinking, quick reactions and full body movement if you want to succeed.  This is THE showcase for Sports Champions and the PlayStation Move in general.The other three games don't fare quite so well.  I found Table Tennis to lack precision.  Not sure why this is, but it just doesn't work as well as the other games.  Disc Golf has tremendous potential, but this is an example of a game that's just too sensitive.  I found it very difficult to actually get my disc to go where I want it to.  Maybe it takes more practice, but my experience with it was pretty lackluster.  The last game is Bocce.  This is a head-scratcher. Why they decided to include such a boring game on here is beyond me.  I would rather they had just included your typical bowling game instead, as that is much more exciting.  In addition, Bocce doesn't control very well at all.  Like Disc Golf, it's just difficult to aim your bocce ball.Technically, the game is lacking all over the place.  Quite simply, the game has no polish and it looks and sounds like a very rushed game.  To start with, if you have a 1080p television, you'll notice this game upscales horrendously.  You have to manually set your PS3 to display at a maximum of 720p in order for the game to truly look like it was intended.  Scaling to 1080i or 1080p results in really blurry and pixelated graphics.  The environments in the game are bland, bland, BLAND!  The characters are really generic and lack any personality whatsoever.  The game's menus, windows and interfaces are boring as can be and the sound effects are extremely minimal.  This really takes away from the game's appeal.  It just doesn't FEEL fun.  Compare this to Nintendo's Wii Sports Resort or Microsoft's Kinect Sports, and Sports Champions seems like second-rate knockoff.  All this game needed is a massive dose of personality and atmosphere, and it could've been great.  It's a solid attempt to cash in on the obligatory casual sports motion-controlled game, but in the end it just falls short.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Ted Del Prato \"technodemon\"","summary":"Sega's long awaited sequel to the Shinobi series","reviewText":"The Shinobi series has been in existence since Sega's Master System debut in the 80's. This PS2 update includes everything that made Shinobi memorable for long-time Sega fans, only this time with 3D graphics and gameplay. Although slightly hampered by repetitive backrounds, the visuals are crisp and colorful, and the techno-esqe soundtrack provides a nice mood to the modern day Japan setting. Aside from the usual dashing, shuriken throwing, and wall running ninja tricks, the heart of the gameplay here is to use the Akujiki (a sword that feeds on souls) to demolish multiple enemies and build up &quot;tate&quot; combos...or else your energy will degenerate. The fault to this system is that the player is often forced to rush through levels with little time to admire the backrounds or search for secrets. Furthermore, some of the later bosses in the game require you to take out several of their minions before attacking them in order to do any damage at all. This makes the game more frustrating than it should be in some cases, so don't expect an easy ride here (especially if you plan on unlocking all of the secrets). Despite it's steep difficulty, Shinobi remains one of the all around best action games for PS2...so pick it up if you feel up to the challenge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2004"}

Its alot of fun. I noticed that when I started the game I recieved an xbox update before it would allow me to play the game. This had to be a patch of some kind because I have not had any of the issues people keep complaining about.I am playing this game with my console connected to a 42 inch LED samsung TV with an HDMI cable. The graphics are not the best Ive seen but they are still very good. The only thing I think they should have worked on a little more is the characters faces. They dont look quite as good as everything else but it is passable.The sounds in this game are awesome , from the aliens hissing , doors opening , pulse rifle , and even the hand held motion detector Everything sounds authentic.This game picks up right after the events of the Aliens 2 film. I have seen many complains about actually having to fight humans and aliens in this game. Many just wanted to be fighting the aliens only, but so what. If you have seen the movies you would know that the whole mission of aliens 2 was started by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Now since things in the movie didnt go as planned for the corporation , dont you think they would be sending their own people to recover what they want ? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. So the human enemies in this game make complete sense.All I want to do here is let everyone know that this is a really good game. Maybe it was a patch that fixed all of the glitches and issues that has caused all of the complaints because I have had none. Some of the complaints are very unfounded and a prime example of that are the complaints about fighting humans. If you are a fan of the movie series I really dont see whats not to like. Solid 4 out of 5.Edit :Since I played this game it made me want to try the AVP game and I must say that AVP is and awesome aliens game. If you like this game and havnt tried AVP you need to give it a try. It is a darker game than this and playing as a Colonial Marine in that game is fantastic. You will constantly be very looking side to side and behind you because in AVP the Aliens will come from everywhere and at times without notice. I had a very nervous and foreboding feeling the whole time I was playing the Marine portion of the game.

Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"Aliens vs. Predator","reviewText":"I read the reviews and they are WRONG! 5.5 out of 10? Are these reviewers crazy, or just plain hard to please? Aliens vs. Predator is a great game! It has action and good graphics, as well.The graphics are terrific! Sure, there are a few games better, but these graphics are awesome! Such detail in the surroundings like the computers, and the monsters, very good.I played all three campaigns over several days, and will outline them in the order I played them in.Colonial Marine CampaignYou get to shoot but melee is weak. Runs about 5 hours. Lots of action and guns. The Smartgun is now my favorite FPS gun of all time. Shoot crazy with that thing! The Scoped Rifle is very nice, the Shotgun is powerful and the Assault Rifle fires grenades! The Aliens look terrific. They move really fast, but you can take them out well enough! I did not play my first playthrough on Hard or Nightmare, so this game was tons of fun! You get health packs, and another soldier talks to you frequently, so it does not feel like the other two campaigns where you are alone. Watch out for the Facehuggers, they are nasty. Overall, the Marine campaign was great!Aliens CampaignYou get to melee but not shoot. Runs about 2 hours. Since all you can do is run and melee something, and then run away, this campaign can feel a little boring at times. I mean, the melee and run away tactics are the same throughout, so how long does this campaign really need to be? I found it just right. Oh, and scurrying along the walls is great fun! Just remember, the camera is set for ground level, so while you are upside down everything is reversed - easy to master, except seeing things upside down is weird! This was a good campaign, I loved it!Predator CampaignYou get to shoot and melee! Runs about 4 hours. In this campaign you play the predator, and can melee as well as shoot. You also get cool weaponry, like the disk and stick to throw, also mines. The coolest things about this campaign are the invisibility cloak for stealth attacks and using the visor. One visor setting is normal, another is infrared (useful to me, I liked that mode!), and the third setting is ultraviolet which detects aliens (serpents) with ease. Jumping is easy and great. The Predator is very powerful, and tons of fun to play!Overall, this is not a bad game at all. The controls work well, shooting is a breeze, and taking out hordes of serpents is just totally awesome fun!Anyway, I hope this review helps. AvP may not be a 10 out of 10, but it sure is better than most reviewers say it is!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2012"}

It looks like it will have more than just 50 or 100 units in a battle unlike Starcraft or Warcraft, it probably will have up to 10,000 units in a battle like it does in the movies.

NO ONE SHOULD DISLIKE THIS GAME IN ANY WAY, IF YOU DO, YOU MUST REALLY DISLIKE CLASSICS IN GENERAL. It is one of the wildest and insane games ever made, and that is a clear signature of the originality of Nintendo. The game is basically about Mario and Luigi battling their way through the island while defeating the forces of Bowser yet again and rescuing the damsel in distress YET AGAIN. As you beat the different sections of the island you move to larger and much more challenging sections of the island which get crazier as you move from stage to stage. The boss battles can be challenging and funny because of how the bosses are designed. No retro gamer should miss out on this hilarious and original game that is still a lot of fun to play despite its release almost 20 years ago (in a few more years it's going to hit 20). One problem is the fact this game can be quite challenging and confusing in some areas. And the Game Boy Advance version of this game lets you play either Mario or Luigi (it doesn't make you stay exclusive to one during segments of the game). Still, if you don't have a SNES, you can easily find this game on Game Boy Advance and it looks and plays the same as the original classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2007"}

It is just a fun game that gamers of all ages can enjoy.  I should know, because Super Mario World was the first video game I ever played, and let me tell you it was some experience.  Looking back on the game all these years later and my stance still hasn't changed a single bit.  Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo is a keeper.Gameplay & Graphics:  The animation of this game is some of the best you'll see for the SNES and is certainly worth noting when reviewing this game.  For a game of its age the game is very crisp in its presentation and the gameplay is simple enough for anyone of ages 5 and above to easily grasp, yet don't let that fool you, for the levels of this game are complex enough to entertain seasoned gamers (or parents) who wish to look back at the classic days of gaming.  It is a vast improvement over the original side-scrolling Mario adventure on the NES and offers hours of entertainment due to its high number of levels.Entertainment Value:  Super Mario World is just plain harmless fun that is fun for gamers of all ages and it should not be forgotten.  I first played this game at an age of five and I know it is the cause of my interest in video gaming so I owe it much thanks.  Playing it now I still recognize it as a fine achievement in the history of video gaming and that it deserves attention.So my stance remained firm that Super Mario World for the SNES is perhaps the best game for the SNES, and certainly one of the best family games of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2009"}

While Xenosaga carries on the name &quot;Xeno&quot; as in &quot;Xenogears&quot; do not expect to find a copy of Xenogears in this in anyway.Xenosaga opens up with an extremely long cutscene (VERY, VERY long!) that introduces a part of the plot.  The game then later shifts 4000 years into the future where you'll see your lead character Shion, a scientists on the ship: Encephalon.  She begins a simulator with the Android she created: Kos-mos.  After she's done with the simulation, her ship comes under attack and the story begins.Xenosaga takes the battle system of Xenogears and evolves it into something much bigger.  You'll string together combos and use points.  There's a guage down in the lower right hand corner that shows the battle order (like in Grandia).  The pic that's furthest to the left attacks first.  It'll show your enemies as well.  That's for each round.  You then can select to attack and string together combos to deal out some damage.  As usual, enemies have certain weaknesses. It isn't just an elemental weakness, but a attack-trait weakness as well (for example some enemes are weak against slash based attacks).  The battles can sometimes be long though as the animations aren't exactly fast.The field is unique as well.  Xenosaga eliminates &quot;Random encounters&quot; and now you've got contact based.  You can also interact with objects on the field (you can blow some things up).  If an enemy spots you it will give chase (and some you just can't outrun no matter how hard you try).  So its not bad as far as the field goes.The graphics on Xenosaga are visually stunning.  There are some parts that flash a bit but the 3-D animations and beautiful cutscenes better make up for this. The flashing is minimal and not noticeable to many.The music stands above all else... when we actually hear it.  The game actually opens up a lot like a movie and its even got the dramatic score to go with it.  But then there is music that is absent from other parts.  When we watch cutscenes sometimes there's no background music at all, and that makes some cutscenes boring and unentertaining to watch.  The voice acting is top-notch!  And while the game has a lot of cutscenes it greatly helps the character developement.But that's the problem with Xenosaga.  There are several cutscenes that further push the &quot;Videogame-movie&quot; trend.  In other words, there are tons of moments where you're watching the game and not playing it.  Not only that, but Xenosaga has it BAD!  Some cutscenes are just too long.  As I said, it opens up like a movie and the cutscene is incredibily long.  There are more long cutscenes where that comes from.  Your clock will read well over 20 minutes when you actually get to play and roam the field for the first time.  But there is good news!  You actually CAN skip these cutscenes.  If you pause the game you can press triangle and skip them.  It's great that the plot can unfold through these cutscenes but the cutscenes are just too long.Xenosaga also has lots of minigames and sidequests!  The mini-games aren't frustrating but they do take some time to get used to because the learning curve for them takes a lot of time.The game isn't bad but I'm afraid that because the cutscenes are REALLY REALLY REALLY long, I couldn't give it a five.  A great game that I'd recommend to any RPGer.The Good+Beautiful 3-D graphics!+Great character developement+Unique battle system+Innovative, original and intriguing plotThe Bad-Incredibly long cutscenes-No music during cutscenes only makes them seem longer","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Like the last one but with a shinier coat","reviewText":"When the first God of War came out, you almost couldn't escape the massive hype and praise it received. From its gameplay to its outrageous violence and \"emotional storyline\", many critics and fans alike absolutely fell in love with it...except me. Sure gameplay-wise it was slightly fun at times but it was unbelievably repetitive, needlessly frustrating at times and the storyline wasn't exactly emotional at all. So of course the inevitable sequel comes out during the Playstation 2's final days and like many blockbusters, it's bigger, it's badder but not necessarily better.Story: Despite my grievances about the presentation about the original's storyline which felt more emotionally neutered despite the scenes revealing Kratos' past, this game just feels wrong. Instead of redemption and atonement for his sins, this game is basically a big hissy fit on his part when he's \"Metroid\"'d of his powers and has to face Zeus. This is essentially like hunting Ares only this time it's Zeus.Graphics: Of course the graphics impress although not much has changed since the original. The world still feels believable and interactive and the level design, while a step down, is still nicely done. Where the game shines, as usual, are its FMV's which are very cinematic and sharp in their quality.Sound/Music: Aside from the VA actor doing Kratos who essentially just plays \"angry\" throughout the whole thing, everyone almost has a B-movie quality in their voice. As for the music, it's sound big and epic with its choir and strings but it's largely forgettable with nary a memorable hook anywhere.Gameplay: Basically the main thing is the combos. Blessed with many weapons and skills, Kratos has to fight (and fight) legions of enemies with big, complex moves. While they look cool, you'll soon discover quickly some work better than others and you'll just end up re-using them. As well, Kratos is given some new spells such as a bow and arrow, lightning and others. Nothing new really as changed, just the names. Whether it's a case of \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" or just simply a lack of wanting to change things up is anyone's guess.As for the game itself, there are times where it's a bit frustrating but it seems almost more tolerable. There's still things like repeatedly pressing a button to open doors which was a dumb idea although trying to stab minotaurs no longer requires you to quickly press the O button and have your fingers fall off like the last one. Puzzles, unlike the more brain-teasers of Zelda and Ico, are strictly relegated to trial and error. Try that. Nope, died. Try this. Nope, died. Oh ok, so you do this?  Ah, there we go. That's it, no logic benders or things that make you think, just exhaust all possibilities of a solution till you finally find it.Is this a game worth buying? Well if you've loved the last one, you'll love this one too although how much more is hard to say. And if you didn't like the last one, this one ain't going to change your mind one bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00030GS80","description":"There's always been a certain magic to Zelda games. The classic formula should have gotten old by now, but it hasn't. Perhaps it's because we all identify on some level with this shy, unlikely hero. Maybe the games remind us of our own childhood. Or perhaps these titles are consistently of such high quality that we can't help but love them. Regardless, The Minish Cap succeeds in all these ways &#x96; simultaneously embracing its links to the past while offering numerous innovations that keep gameplay fresh, exciting, and a true joy to&#xA0;play.The greatest of these novel concepts is the ability to transform from normal size down to the diminutive form of the Minish, a race of tiny people living right under the noses of the humans. This opens up entirely new realms of gameplay, as puzzles and even combat must be accomplished in different ways. When miniaturized, the smallest puddle becomes a deep lake, and the most mundane creatures become monstrous foes.There's a new item called the Gust Jar that allows you to suck up obstacles and enemies before blowing them back out in a burst of air. It's one of the cooler new power-up items I've encountered in any of the Zelda games, and adds yet another level of complexity to how you play. Another new ability allows Link to double himself, creating a ghostly after-image that mirrors his moves for a brief time. As you might imagine, this results in some clever and unique brainteasers that are a nod to the recent Four Swords games. In all these ways, the game challenges you to think in multiple dimensions and carefully remember details on your journey. A large cast of characters fleshes out the land of Hyrule, and monsters both large and small await your blade. To further connect you to the world's people, you will now collect items called Kinstones &#x96; broken halves of coin-like objects that can be fused with the Kinstones that other characters in the world have collected. By doing so, you'll open up portals, treasure chests, and secret doors all over the map. It's an addictive side quest that serves as a worthy compliment to the main adventure.One of my few complaints is that while the puzzles in the game are uniformly challenging, some of the combat is easier than I might have liked, especially against the bosses, who were often one-trick ponies requiring minimal skill. Even so, the fights are satisfying in their simplicity, and you have access to all the familiar weapons and techniques, including the boomerang, spin attack, and bow. The old and new features combine to make a game that feels both true to the Zelda heritage while offering an entirely unique experience.But more than any of this, the game charms you with its stalwart hero. This silent little boy with ruffled, messy hair is faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. Through him, the game establishes a hero whose pure heart and will are carrying him forward. All the elements of The Minish Cap (even its presence on the GBA) contribute to the idea of a tiny force for good that strives to triumph against a huge evil. It's a classic adventure that more than lives up to the legacy of a classic series.Concept:The time-honored Zelda tale retold in yet another new formGraphics:Mixing the familiar images of previous Zelda games with humorous and detailed new character designs results in an impressive success for the GBASound:Some of the most memorable and recognizable tunes in gaming sound great even on those little GBA speakersPlayability:Responsive and flexible with a nearly perfect learning curve that moves from simple to challengingEntertainment:Like many of its predecessors &#x96; a true classicReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerIssue:February 20052nd Opinion:There's a bird sitting on my head, I'm no larger than a toenail clipping, and I've been stuck on the same puzzle for the last three hours. Long story short, I'm having the time of my life. For any of you who played the remarkable Super Nintendo title A Link to the Past, The Minish Cap will bring a tear to your eye. This is classic Zelda gameplay in all its glory. The journey is a tad easy for my liking (boss fights are a breeze), but I can't get enough of the creative puzzles and new gadgets. Shrinking in height to a two-pixel speck is not only hilarious, it's one of the most compelling concepts that the series has offered up in a long time. Minigames are also in great abundance, and you can collect over 130 different figurines that shed some light on the characters in the world (which also happens to be one of my favorite aspects of Wind Waker). From its stunning visuals to its gameplay finesse, The Minish Cap is another harrowing Hyrule adventure that you'll remember for a lifetime.Rated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Classic Zelda","reviewText":"It has been almost 20 years, and the Legend of Zelda is still very much alive and kicking. Exclusively made for the Game Boy Advance, The Minish Cap is the latest instalment of this very popular series. Developed by Capcom with input from Nintendo, The Minish Cap is a classic Legend of Zelda game that entails a strong plot, mind-boggling puzzles and some very tough battles.Taking the role of Link, you must put together the pieces of a broken blade by fusing four elements (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water) into the sword to stop the evil deeds of the sorcerer Vaati. Link also has to revive Princess Zelda, who was turned into stone by Vaati. Can this woman ever get out of trouble?Link's quest involves exploring a massive overworld, as well as six dungeons. Apart from getting items and upgrades along the way, Link also has a companion in the form of Ezlo, a hybrid of a bird and a hat. Weird as this may sound, Ezlo literally rides on Link throughout the game, and provides hints should Link gets stuck. Not that his hints are any good, by the way, but he does have an important role in the proceedings, but I won't spoil it for you.The combination of Ezlo and portals scattered around the maps allow Link to be shrunk into ant-size. This allows him to interact with a tribe of people known as the Picoris or the Minish, who secretly lives in various parts of Hyrule. Basically, this is a \"Honey, I shrunk the Kids\" concept, but it works very well here. Looking at the world from a whole new perspective, Link's quest gets all the more difficult when enemies whom he can kill easily when he's normal become a tough challenge. Ever thought killing an Octorock will take you half an hour?Apart from the classic weapons, Link also has an array of items to play with. Among them is the Gust Jar, which allows Link to suck in and split out air. This comes in handy against some well-protected enemies. The Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through sand, which is very useful when finding treasures. And in a bold move, Link also gets an improved version of the Roc's Cape, which allows him to sort of fly momentarily. You'll be amazed to see Link does a Superman impression late in the game. Also, the Grip Ring lets Link climb mountains, while the Pegasus Boots helps him walk across quicksand. Even classic items get an upgrade, with bombs now capable of being remotely controlled by Link. Strategic bombing, anyone?Solving puzzles is an important part of this game. Apart from the block-pushing stunt that is so connected to Zelda games, a gimmick from the previous Four Swords game is also included. After infusing some elements into his sword, Link can multiply himself by charging his sword, which allows him to push even heavier blocks. Some puzzles also require Link to respond quickly, for example, a lever-controlled bridge that retracts almost immediately after he loosen the grip. All in all, the variety of puzzles are acceptable, and very interesting to play with.Treasures in The Minish Cap take the form of rupees, kinstones and mysterious shells. Kinstones? Mysterious shells? Yes, you read it right. Kinstones Fusion plays a large part in the game. By fusing, it simply means collecting a fragment of a stone, and matching it with someone with a, well, matching fragment. If the pieces fit perfectly, an event will happen somewhere on the map. While some fusions create random events, the more rare red and gold kinstones are essential in changing the course of the game. To put it simply, these fusions are compulsory, so it could take up some of your time finding the right pieces. Although this is a nice idea, it does make the game a little too linear for my liking. The free-roaming nature of past Zelda games takes the backseat in this time round.Now, even when Link is eager to save the world, he's entitled to have a hobby. Figurines Collection is a non-compulsory part of the game that incorporates the Japanese \"Gashapon\" concept, which basically involves trying out his luck with a toy machine. When Link meets new people (or monsters) in the game, figurines of these are made by a master sculptor. Visiting the sculptor's shop, Link could get chances to earn these figures by exchanging mysterious shells with him. There are a total of 136 figurines in all, so it could take forever. Then again, I can see the greed in your eyes.The graphics and audios In The Minish Cap complement the overall feel of the game superbly. It's heartening to see such intricate details on a 2D game. The colors are also vibrant and attractive, making it a really pleasant playing experience. The music is a mixture of old school and new scores, and to a certain extent, they blend well. Some parts are too bouncy, but on the whole, the feel is just right.In summary, The Minish Cap delivers. While the main quest is rather short, the amount of side quests lengthens the overall playing time. If you only have the dough for one game this month, make The Minish Cap your top priority.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G500s Laser Gaming Mouse with Adjustable Weight Tuning","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Error with thumb buttons after waking from hibernate, otherwise decent gaming mouse","reviewText":"The only major issue I have with the G500s is that the 2 top thumb buttons (the ones marked with an up arrow and flat bar) \"forget\" their functions after waking the PC from hibernation. Removing and re-inserting the USB cord into the PC has no impact on this, and I made sure that the profile was using the mouse's on-board memory. Going into the Logitech Gaming Software program will allow the mouse to remember the functions for the 2 top thumb buttons. I feel this is some kind of software/hardware issue. I am running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit for what it is worth, and I am using Firmware 84.9 for the mouse (it came out of the box with Firmware 84.8).The G500s has neat styling. I love the striped graphics on the top surfaces, although the large \"G\" seems kind of tacky. Logitech seems to be going with this trend as the big \"G\" even shows up in the system tray with their latest Gaming Software app. Some may feel this is over the top styling but they probably came from using the original G500.Logitech opted not to include a velcro tie-wrap for the braided cord, which isn't a big deal but I kind of liked it on my G600. The G9x did not come with one either.There's only 1 LED color that I can see/use for the DPI settings buttons (blue), which bums me out because the G600 could be set to variable LED colors that would cycle every few seconds. Even the G9x LED colors could be adjusted.In terms of usability and ergonomics, I have mixed feelings about this mouse. I'm a righty, so I don't have any complaints about how the mouse is really designed for right handed users. Southpaws may have a hard time with the thumb buttons, but that is the case with the G9/G9x and G600 as well. That said, I have a hard time reaching all of the thumb buttons on the mouse. I am normally a claw user because I have long fingers and a relatively large hand. I wear size Large gloves, but I have to resort to using the claw mode to reach all of the buttons. The DPI settings are nice, but I found myself using 1550 dpi for my laptop and gaming monitors. Anything less is too slow, and anything greater (up to 8200 dpi) is way too twitchy. It is designed for on-the-fly switching in games, but I need to take a moment to move my index over to change the DPI which slows me down in the game. The laser optical tracking is phenomenal as it is in the other Logitech gaming mice.The G500s has a weight adjustment system similar to that of the G9x, except the weight tray ejects out of the G500s! The scroll wheel is also adjustable for the clicking sensation or continuous spinning (just like on the G9x).I'd give this mouse 5 stars if they fixed the issue with it forgetting the function of the 2 top thumb buttons.Overall: 4/5 stars. Good value, combines many features of the G9x but in a more comfortable design. Has an adjustable weight system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2013"}

Controls are precisely lifted from The Two Towers, not that it's a bad thing.

The graphics were great! Gameplay, though, was not well ramped.Let's start with the graphics. I've loved each new version of DOA with how it has pushed the envelope. This release was no exception. On our HD TV, the lushness of some scenes was just mind boggling. There were active characters in the background. There were tiny details in every scene. Foot movements would stir up the water or snow.The audio was reasonably good - not nearly as awesome as the graphics, but certainly good enough that I didn't mind playing with it in the background, as well as it was turned down a bit.The gameplay in this series is NOT a button masher. You might get lucky occasionally with button mashing, but it really works best if you learn the specific combos that match up to your character's style and for use in certain conditions. Having a near opponent vs a far-away opponent, having an opponent that stays low vs one that launches high attacks, all of them need the proper response.I don't mind that at all. I respect the game a lot for that reason. On the other hand though, the game is KILLER tough without memorizing those combinations. I had several players in my home who were very, very good on the previous DOAs and they were slaughtered in the new game until they sat down and re-practiced the combos in sparring mode. Yes, sparring mode is there and a good training tool. But it is INCREDIBLY BORING. I would really rather \"learn\" in some sort of actual gameplay setting. Maybe they could have a \"beginning set of rounds\" that was easy, that advanced players could skip over.Instead, the way the game is set up, there is no difficulty options at all. There is only one \"main game\" that you take each character through, to unlock his or her outfits and endings. That one path is rather hard. So either you sit there in boring sparring mode for a while to prepare - or you just dive into it and get smashed around a lot.There are other issues. One of our household members went fully through 3 characters. I then took over and went fully through 3 more characters. When he woke up in the morning, the save games were all completely gone. He went through and re-unlocked 3 characters. Everything seemed fine when he was in the game - but come back later, and it had reset. There's just something very wrong with the save situation here.On one hand I really appreciate that there are female characters in here, and that men as well as women enjoy playing them. It wasn't that long ago that all fighting games were all fighting characters, and that male players would refuse to play as \"just a girl\". In modern times we realize that girls can be just as good at karate as guys are. That being said, some of these outfits are crossing the line into sleaziness. It denigrates a highly trained female martial artist to say she's got to have a big chest that is almost naked.If you're a fan of fighting games, definitely get this one. Just be sure to prepare for a serious round of training before you start taking on the actual combat.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Big Al \"Alan Rivire\"","summary":"A Hellish Game","reviewText":"INTRODUCTIONDante's Inferno, a third person action video game by Electronic Arts, is based (very) loosely on the first of the three Canticles of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Story is quite straight forward: Dante went through hell to save the soul of his beloved wife Beatrice from Lucifer.  In Dante's Inferno, there are nine circles of hell: Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Anger, Heresy, Violence, Fraud, and Treachery. Guided by the soul of the Roman poet, Virgil, Dante fights and slays his enemies, consisting of demons, monstrous beasts, unbaptized babies with swords for hands, tormented souls, gluttonous living organs, gigantic gorging worms, etc., until he gets to the boss fight, where he slays the boss itself and descends to the next circle of hell.  The final battle is a boss fight against Lucifer himself.  In short, the salient features of this game are not the story, but the spectacular battles (at 60 frames per second) and the engrossing graphics--a vision of hell conjured up in the minds of the men and women at Electronic Arts.THE PLOT**Spoiler Alert**In the introductory cut scene, Dante was sewing a cross-shape tapestry onto his flesh, as atonement for his sins committed during the Crusade.  During an especially painful stitch, he flashes back to the battle of the city of Acre during the third Crusade on 1191, where the game begins.At the citadel of the city of Acre, Dante is fending off escaped prisoners wielding swords with a pole axe.  This battle serves as a tutorial of the game, where players can learn Dante's \"light\"  & \"heavy\" attacks, as well as blocking and evasion, together with running and jumping.  These skills come in handy in the soon-to-be \"boss\" fight with Death himself.  (PS2 players of \"God of War\" will find the combat system in Dante's Inferno familiar.)  Players should note that they have no control of the camera.  After his triumph in the citadel, Dante heads towards a courtyard, where an assassin sneaks up on him and stabs him in the back.  As life ebbs from him, he sees that Death rises up from the ground and condemns his soul to hell for his crimes during the war.  Refusing to accept his fate, Dante gets on his feet, pulls the dagger off his back, and attacks Death himself.  This battle is the first \"boss fight\" of the game, where Death teleports around the battlefield and attacks Dante with powerful and sweeping blows from his soul harvesting bone scythe.  Players who are fast learners will eventually land enough blows on Death, after which Quick-Time-Event prompts appear on the screen.  These prompts are controls players are supposed to pull or push.  By engaging them at the right moments, cut scenes pop up showing that Dante wrestles the bone scythe from Death, slays him with it and thus avoiding his fate in hell.Dante returns to Florence, only to find his beloved wife, Beatrice, slain and his home destroyed.  As he approaches Beatrice, for a brief moment, he sees her soul oozing from her mouth, before Lucifer whisks it away, for the sinister purpose of another attempt on the Throne of God by wedding a heaven bound soul.  Dante gives chase.  Lucifer dispenses an army of the damned to stop him, but, because he has the soul harvesting bone scythe, and a holy cross left behind by Beatrice, with which he can cast divine powers, and, later, a magic spell given to him by the soul of the Roman poet, Virgil, who is sent by Beatrice, he is able to destroy his enemies, pries open the Gates of Hell with a monstrous beast he tames, and follows Lucifer to the Inferno itself, where the main body of the game begins.**End of Possible Spoilers**THE COMBAT/GAME SYSTEMThe primary weapons Dante wields are the bone scythe and the holy cross, which serves as a range weapon.  When enemies are slain, their souls are collected upon Dante.  With these souls, players can upgrade Dante's abilities by purchasing special attacks and magic spells.  As Dante successfully slays his enemies, a \"Redemption Meter\" fills and a \"redemption bar\" is visible at the bottom of the screen.  When it is full, players can activate \"Redemption\" by pressing LB & RB of the Xbox 360 controller simultaneously, which makes Dante faster and stronger, until the meter is drained.  When Dante encounter a monstrous beast, he has the option of taming it (by activating a Quick-Time-Event) and commands it to fight for him.  Health is replenished at green fountains and mana (for casting spells) purple ones.  When Dante grabs an enemy with his scythe (after players purchase \"Death's Grasp\"), he can either absolve or punish his soul, which then fills the holy or the unholy meters.  When a meter is full, Dante levels up the holy or the unholy skill tree accordingly.  There are seven holy and unholy levels respectively.  Each level has unique abilities, new attacks, as well as a larger health or mana bar, for purchase with collected souls.  There are 32 relics hidden throughout the game world.  These relics improve Dante's fighting abilities.  At the start of the game, players can equip Dante with two relics, with additional relic slots available for purchase later in the game.  In addition, there are \"collectibles\" in the game world, namely, 30 Judas Coins, with which Dante unlocks souls, and 3 Beatrice Stones, which auto-absolve the damned.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, this is what I like most about this video game: (a) spectacular and fast actions at 60 frames per second, and (b) engrossing graphics. This is what I don't like as much: (a) the combat system is dated (it is a close copy of that in God of War), nothing wrong with it, nothing innovative either, and (b) monotonous plot.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2010"}

Each of Spyro's dragon friends has fallen victim to the nefarious Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals. Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills.

The graphics are improved in this sequel not greatly over the first but definitely an upgrade from the first game.The upgrades are also somewhat different but not to much so no worries about having to learn a lot on what to do to power up your character.The voice cast again was done very well Michael Wincott did great as the voice of the horseman Death and Keith Szarabajka did a spectacular job as Crowfather and of course the rest of the cast were exceptionally talented too. Sadly though as THQ was going to make this a four game series but since their bankruptcy it's unclear if we will ever get a chance to play the last two of the horsemen though rumors have persisted that maybe we will get a chance to play another Darksider game so hopefully this is not the last of this entertaining series we'll get to play and enjoy.Update 04-04-2013A little info, some friends and others have wondered whether you have to fight every enemy you come across to complete the game and the answer is no. The game for the most part is free roaming though you do have your main mission there are a few side missions you can do as well and you will see enemies along the way. The choice is you can fight them to gain experience and level up or pass them on for now,also remember when fighting an enemy in open world and other areas you can fall back if you're being overwhelmed or find the enemy to hard to deal with.  At most the main story bosses are the only ones you will be forced to fight without retreating the area but if you use your head you can defeat them more easily then you expect.Also remember the more enemies you defeat the more experience you gain thus higher level you achieve but don't try and take on an enemy vastly more powerful then you can handle at your current level.Case in point someone complained they kept dieing so fast against this group of enemies but when you're just a level 3 and the enemies facing you are approximately level 30 and have massively more powerful weapons then you then yes of course you're going to die quickly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}

When you killed a boss and little red pixels splashed everywhere, it made the moment almost laughable. Diablo's programmers took the many comments about the graphics to heart, and they did a STELLAR job of revamping them in this expansion.I would have easily bought the expansion for the graphic upgrade alone - that makes Diablo 2 almost like an entirely new game, worth playing through all over again. However, they didn't stop there. There are 2 new races - the druid and the assassin - both of which I *love*. The assassin has cool attack moves that are great fun to watch. The druid can either shapeshift, or summon creatures, or control the elements. I love all three, but the elemental attacks are GREAT! This has become my new favorite character.There are new monsters to fight, an ENTIRE new act with great graphics, tons of new weapons, even new Cube recipes to play with. And, in a move that other game companies should pay attention to, you can now have TWO sets of weapons defined (i.e. bow and sword/shield for example) and easily toggle between them.

And while the graphics and special effects are GREAT!  They also slow my computer down considerable, even producing cursor lag, and I have a BRAND NEW COMPUTER and I turn EVERYTHING OFF while using SC.  This leads me to believe that the Foundational Software has some internal instability and that the Big Corporate CUT COSTS in some areas in order to pay for their GAAAAY DRM Scheme.A small note to BLIZZARD about DRM:  You Corporate types will NEVER stop the Software Pirates through Force.  You want to know why?  Because we are YOUR CHILDREN!!!  You're busy running the software empire or filing legal briefs against the software pirates you get reports about and guess what WE YOUR CHILDREN are doing at home?  WE ARE PIRATING SOFTWARE!  Or at least playing around with it.  What you guys are doing is the equivalent to the 'War on Drugs' and how successful has that turned out?  Please guys, stop wasting million$ and refocus on what you're good at.  Making great games!  Spend the money and time you are WASTING on DRM on more Quality Control on SC2.Back to the game.Music: 10!  (GREAT MUSIC!  It sets the campaign and scenes perfectly!)Story: 7.5 (I don't understand Kerrigan's motivation?  She loved Jimmy then became a monster.  Ok, so she forgot who she is but she's a POWERFUL enough psychic to read Jimmmy's mind across space and she seems to have no knowledge that Jimmy thinks of her everyday???  And if she is such a POWERFUL psychic, she should KNOW that he's thinking about her.  And as the leader of the Zerg, why is she wasting her time on the Terrans?  Why not consume 999 worlds across the galaxy to become so powerful that the Protoss and Humans are nothing to your Swarm?  Ok and forget the HOARD of zerg.  She is trained as an ULTRA-ASSASSIN and she can't create a Zerg Assassin creature to Assassinate the Emperor???  And WHY did she lose her ability to Cloak?  If the Overmind is really a SUPER GENIUS he would analyze the Cloaking ability and build an ORGANIC Equivalent or at LEAST use it as Duran did.  And WHAT HAPPENED TO DURAN and his Hybrids???  (Note: Only half done with the Human campaign.  Will edit this as these questions are answered for me.)Graphics: 7  (I can use almost all the graphics set to ULTRA, I am just not that impressed because most of the graphic advances are in textures, like the people's skin and eyes.  Why not just use REAL eyes and REAL skin MIXED with graphics?  For example, Starwars: The Empire Strike Back where they used Models and then enhanced them with graphics.  The PURE graphics engines uses TOO Much memory without adding that much to the visual effects. The Old Way of using real Models is MUCH better than Pure Graphics.  Hollywood has been using these GAY Graphics lately too which is why Star Wars II had better Graphics than the Newer Star Wars III.Gameplay: 9 So far it's been super cool.  I've had some SERIOUS DRM issues because of my on/off internet connection, but otherwise the gameplay is really interesting.  ROB THE TRAIN!  Harvest the minerals from the Lava Field!  Very innovative ways of forcing you to practice with the skills the technology has.I WOULD like to see a Planet-to-Planet RTS game using Starcraft or a Starcraft Battlefields, like Starwars created.

AND for $200 bucks cheaper. with that kind of difference you're better off getting a wii and a 360 for the price of one ps3. plus stuffing in a blu-ray means they are manufacturing them the true sony way (for the last ten years): the parts are too expensive and the loss is so great so they try and compensate with terribly shoddy manufacturing. i know first-hand since i got rid of two ps2s which were total pieces of junk: never played ps1 games at all (both), stopped playing dvds (1), and one even started boring circular ruts in my discs. which ended up as a successful class action lawsuit against sony. at least i've never had any 360 problems, knock on wood but i wouldn't rush out to buy a launch ps3 due to sony's track record and the percentage of problems that are had with launch systems of any type. better to wait 6 months or so, or even a year or two for the price to drop. at $600, i might be waiting 5 years or so for the ps3 to hit a reasonable price.by then i will have played all the games on the 360 anyway, all the top gaming franchises are pretty much going to be simultaneous releases thankfully. and i've got a wii (soon) and ds and gba for when i want to go a little nintendo happy.don't waste your money on an overhyped console in the frenzy...also be aware that sony has stated prices for ps3 games might be higher than $60, potentially \"...up to $100\" (sony chairman). that's insane, $60 is way too much as it is for any game that isn't called oblivion or gears of war. ***game publishers and makers note: if you sell games at $60, only hard core crazies with lots of money will toss that money around regularly. but if you drop a game in price (or really what i'm trying to say is introduce it at a reasonable price) which isn't selling(ex. lego star wars), it may fly off the shelves decreasing your per unit profit but giving you a far healthier bottom line because of the much increased volume.***a new shocker: i went to wal-mart the night after the release and both ps3s they had on display were down. one was stone cold dead. one died in the middle of me playing nba 07. i'd wait a few months for them to iron out the kinks. lots of reports coming in about dead ps3s now unfortunately.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"F. Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"Good graphics, hot villians, cool fight moves and a medicore story","reviewText":"If you are a Batman fan, you will probably love this game, but most others should probably just rent it. The graphics are very good, unless you switch to detective mode, which is actually more helpful, cause it highlights enemies and objects, and lets you see through walls. However, then you lose the colorful impressive graphics.Action wise, most of the game is fighting henchman. They is not a lot of variety in the henchman, and you can pretty much just button mash your way though them. The game switches to slow motion almost \"matrix style\" moves, sometimes zooming up close, when you are about to knock down an enemy. Its pretty cool and one of the nicer features of the game, although occasionally, the punch or kick didn't quite seem to line up to where it should.Weapons and equipment wise, batman comes up a little short. There is the batarang, the batclaw and a couple other things. The batarang is used mainly for stunning enemies and brutes in boss fights, and the batclaw for pulling down enemies and heavy objects.For a big muscle bound guy, Batman sure is flexible and light on his feet. You can glide around, almost fly, using his cape, and his bat cable thing lets you quickly and apparently silently fly up to higher objects or platforms. Comic books fans will appreciate the range of Batman villains, although you don't really fight most of the them.The story is actually pretty mediocre and really wanders around a bit. This game employs, and quite heavily, a video game tactic of having you wander back through maps you have already been through. It's a tactic that saves video game developers the time and cost of creating new maps and backgrounds. In some cases the enemies are changed up a little bit, as you go back through, but its still a cheap tactic that I personally don't care for. The batcave is for some reason located right next to Arkham Asylum.The detective mode allows you track things like fingerprints or DNA in certain parts of the game, although I didn't much care for that. The detective mode is also quite useful when you have to deal with henchman that are armed. They can kill you quite quickly, so its best to sneak up and use a silent takedown on them.Batman doesn't kill people so everybody is just made \"unconscious\", although they never wake back up.The voice acting is somewhat repetitious, although very good. Some of the dialogue though is pretty cheesy.The boss fights involve mostly fighting henchman and employing the batarang, and in some cases using a tactic and no real fight at all.The male villains and henchman almost all look like steroid using freaks, and the female villains all look like supermodels in revealing costumes. Not that I'm complaining, but the game video animation will not so subtlety focus on the female villains body parts, in case you weren't already  paying attention to their hotness.  The ending is predictably short and not really satisfying. After you beat the game you can continue playing, although there is really nothing to do other then collect the remaining Riddler question marks or audio recordings you may have missed. Also be aware, that the Playstation 3 version lets you play as the Joker, although I am not sure to what extent. The 360 version completely leaves this out.Update 10/16/2009- After a second play through of the game, I would definitely bump this up to a five star game. I didn't fully appreciate the depth of the game on my first go around. The game is definitely worth purchasing if you enjoy fighting/action type games. You can button mash your way through the game if you want, but you will miss out. The number and diversity of counter/combos moves you can do is excellent and the animation and graphics are outstanding. There are also a number of silent/automatic take downs you can do depending on your environment and almost all of your items can also be used to either stun or take down opponents. The diversity of options is really impressive.While playing the game, and even after you beat it, you can collect the Riddler puzzles and interview tapes, which to my surprise I enjoyed doing. This will also take you back through some areas you didn't completely explore or may have missed altogether. Some of the puzzles can be quite challenging to find if you don't cheat and look them up.I also enjoyed the predator and combat challenges, much more then I thought I would initially. They are challenging, fun, and bring another replayability factor to the game.This is definitely one of  the best fighting/action games I've played.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2009"}

Zack is a young SOLDIER 2nd Class who aspires to become a 1st. He spends his days carrying out assignments under the guidance of his 1st Class mentor, Angeal. During an operation in Wutai, a large number of SOLDIER members, led by 1st Class operative Genesis, go missing. The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai&#x2014;and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth... What truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance? What secrets bind the three SOLDIER 1st Class operatives? For Zack, a cruel and fateful struggle awaits...","reviewerName":"CJC","summary":"You Won't Be Dissapointed","reviewText":"I was reading some of the other reviews on this game and was surprised by some of the comments. Someone called it a hack and slash, linear game with poor camera angles...or something to that effect. I can't be more contradictory to those statements than if I just said \"wrong\".First, the game is only linear in storyline...but how many games aren't? This game has a huge optional quest menu that allows you to choose which quests you will open and what rewards you will gain along with little bonus/unnecessary missions that you find throughout the game. At many times during the game you are also even allowed to free rome many areas and talk to people and do side jobs and such.Next, to call this game a hack and slash game is even more inaccurate. This is easily a live action RPG where you select which move you want to do from a menu system the entire game. Anyone who refers to this game as a hack and slash either doesn't understand the term \"hack and slash\", doesn't understand how the actions menu of this game works, or hasn't even actually played the game. If you're button mashing throughout this game then you aren't playing the game correctly. I'm interested in knowing how they were even able to make past any of the bosses seeing as how you have 2 separate defensive maneuvers tied to two separate buttons that require somewhat accurate timing on execution to evade attacks. Button masher? Not even close.And lastly, the camera angles can be a little difficult at times, but overall they are pretty decent and easily adjusted. Not to mentioned this is an RPG so camera angles aren't overly critical to the gameplay.Now that the corrections are done, the game has beautiful graphics for a PSP game. The storyline is engaging but a little hokey at times almost as if the writers were trying to stretch the game time a little. The music and controls rock. Much of the FFVII music is used but occasionally you'll get something new when fighting certain bosses. They also do a great job tying in FFVII to this game's timeline and show how characters like Cloud and Sephiroth started out. All in all, this lacks almost nothing and feels like the creators crammed as much on that little UMD as they possibly could. But not all games appeal to all people. This game is a live action RPG for the PSP and a great addition to the PSP lineup. Don't expect PS3 or XBOX360 quality from a PSP game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS4","description":"NES","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Mega Man holding pattern","reviewText":"When it comes to a long running franchise, it goes without saying there are going to be moments of deja vu. Mega Man fans are especially aware of this, but even with games that don't truly evolve from sequel to sequel each one manages to contain a feel of its own. The first Mega Man was a rough sketch of a portrait Mega Man 2 would quickly streamline. Mega Man 3 would take some liberties with its game play and ultimately stifle the flow that would have greatly benefited the series. But what about Mega Man 4? Does it restore the flow of chi or only intensify an abstract case of mental blockage?There are several things about Mega Man 4 that are more than welcome. The robot master crew is probably the most challenging out of the NES line-up and we see the introduction of some new characters like Dr. Cossack and his daughter. Okay, so these characters aren't exactly deep (like any of Mega Man's characters are) and only serve to fuel the \"fake antagonist\" scheme employed by the following two games, but they help hide the fact that Mega Man 4 is Mega Man 3's hangover. It's dumbfounding how even the smallest things made me reflect on the last game, not the one in front of me.Because of this, Mega Man 4 lacks an identity. As laughable as that may sound given how many games there are in the series, it's this same train of thought that makes it a very noticeable and serious problem. The silver lining to such a conundrum is that this indirectly gives Mega Man 5 and 6 a head start right out of the gate, something that is of the utmost importance for the titles that wrap up Mega Man's time on the NES.Despite the fact the Mega Man 4 ends on somewhat of a downer, fans of the blue bomber will find little reason not to add this to their collection if they don't have it already. Mega Man's downs aren't usually that bad or as bad certain other blue-colored character. Mega Man 4 proves this to be true at the end of the day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2011"}

Why? Well, a number of reasons.The things that rock about this game are the depth of extras. The main story is alright, and to be honest, I enjoyed that it was different then usual. Those goody goody parents may be put off by the demons thingy, but the game isn't for kids anyways.(mainly because it is so complex)Items are literally dungeon portals, which let you powerup other items, and gain levels. The Dark Assembly is alright, yet you don't need to know it to win the game. The Geosystem is what confuses me most. Sometimes I think I do something then bam something else happens. You don't even need it though.FFTactics has a great story, which I loved mostly because of the characters. The characters in this game are annoying rather. Im fine with most of the characters, except the main one, laharal. His voice is annoying.The battles in this game involve alot more special techniques, combos which are alright, and different weapon types. I enjoy seeing guns AND swords in a game, and that was a great addition. The battles themselves are pretty easy, I just build up laharal and have absolutely no problems. I enjoy it though. It is relaxing to play a game that doesn't require every minute clicking. You can sit back, set up your commands, and execute when your ready. Disgaea provides a relaxing game rather then a frustrating one.FFT would sometimes leave you in tremendously hard battles. Those who have played it can agree probably that the battle in the castle, against that one special someone who turns into a demon is wayyyy too hard. You know, you have to be a knight or samurai with Ramza, you kill him off alone then he spawns into this demon minatour with 3 bodyguards and can kill everyone in one shot. I got over the battle after restarting from the beggining a few times. Disgaea gives a rather enjoyable setting, with good depth but not too hard.The main problems I have with Disgaea are slight. The music is annoying now. I am so tired of that castle song. The comedy is dry, I have never laughed at anything in the game, and I have a great sense of humor. Even with a spoiled brat running around, you can't make someone laugh with pure stupidity every time. O look the girl is an idiot, LOL LOL LOL!!!!!!11. Just kidding, it isn't funny anymore.  Demons sleep 2 years? thats funny, my characters seem to sleep about 2, no wait...3 hours. I'm not trying to go into huge detail, but I do like this game.The one last thing I want to say is the biggest problem, complexity. The game can't avoid this. but there is alot to learn. and you probably will spend a good 15 minutes in the help menu, which is easily built in and can be accessed basically any time.Is it worth the money? Yes it is. The game provides tons of battles, Huge levels(not like battle levels, im talking the levels your character can gain), 10000 I believe. On top of that, items are mini dungeons basically, characters have voice overs(japanese AND english), and there are plenty of special moves. You can learn moves off pupils. You can do combos. Shoot guns, bows, chop with axes, swords, staffs, and the occasional stabby ol' spear. I would reccomend this game to FFTactics lovers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2003"}

Lara Croft had her heyday between her first outing in 1996 and the last, terrible, game in 2008. The time was ripe was a new hero to take over and Nathan Drake certainly fits the bill. A descendant of Sir Francis Drake, Nathan has adventure in his blood and is determined to unravel the mystery of his ancestor's final resting place and discover the lost city of El Dorado. It's a well-worn plot, but the jovial Talespin-esque approach and likeable characters keep it fresh and exciting.Uncharted combines run-and-gun, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements as Nathan navigates hot jungles, sunny coastlines, and dark ruins, killing and fighting all the way. You have to wonder about the morality of a hero character who kills hundreds in his quest for personal wealth, but Nathan Drake's scruffy appearance and sarcastic quips will probably distract you from that.The game is relatively hard and is split in 21 chapters without a single loading screen. However, in order to unlock the Platinum trophy you will have to beat the game on 'Crushing' difficulty, which is virtually impossible. The targeting system and movement of the character can be quite clumsy, and precision shooting really comes down to chance for much of the journey.It took me 4 years to unlock 91% of the 47 trophies, and thankfully none of them are based on online play.

In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but feel it only fair to recommend it with some caveats.Story: This is why you are playing. It's a murder mystery with quirky characters.  They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.Gameplay: Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story.  If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games).  You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.The combat is is familiar to anyone who has played Resident evil 4 or dead space.  Hold the shoulder button, aim, and shoot. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses.  I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough.  there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear \"noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!\" about a million times.Difficulty: Easy - even with the glitches and poor controls.Graphics & sound: Poor and glitchy.  PS2 era graphics that have been upscaled to HD. Sound that pops in and out. car motor that makes you want to hit mute.Final thoughts:This is a very special game that is full of heart. Survival horror fans with a tolerance for some rough gameplay will be pleased. Give it a chance to prove itself and you will be rewarded. Highly recommended only after you read the warning label above.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2013"}

Taegel","summary":"An Instant Classic","reviewText":"In my opinion, BAC will prove to be one of the best video games ever made.Like Arkham Asylum, the core mechanics revolve around brawling, stealth takedowns and open-world action.  The chain fighting is simple to learn, yet difficult to master.  With a little proficiency, the game effectively gives you the exhilarating feeling that you've just beat up a room full of dudes.  However, to really excel at the combat, it takes some practice.  The stealth \"predator\" rooms pit the dark knight against a bunch of armed thugs.  Since they have guns, you can't just take them out head-on.  Rather, you've got to take them out one by one, retreating into the walls or atop gargoyles to stay out of sight.  You're an invisible predator, and as you take down more enemies, the ones remaining start to freak out.  It's really quite amusing.Unlike Arkham Asylum, the game is more open world.  There are side-missions you can engage in whatever order you like.  Where unnecessary to complete the story, these side missions are critical to leveling up more powerful attacks and armor.  Not to mention that they're simply fun.Play as Catwoman.  Catwoman missions could stand-alone as its own game.  Where the controls are congruent to Batman (so you don't have to learn a whole new combat mechanic) she has her own style and way of moving and fighting that's quite a bunch of fun.  It's also fun playing a character with a more mercenary sensibility.But the over-arching quality that makes this game so terrific is that every aspect of it is FUN.  Recently I've played games (like LA NOIRE) that, in my opinion, have oodles of technical merit but just aren't any fun.  Batman is an exhilarating, no-sleep, kill-your-weekend thrill ride from start to finish.If you've just bought your PS3 system, do yourself a solid and make BATMAN: ARKHAM CITY (along with Uncharted 2 and Bioshock) your first purchase.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead.

As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up.

The blast somehow granted you electricity-based superpowers which you are eager to improve. Over the course of the game, you make decisions which give your character either good karma (such as saving hostages) or evil karma (such as allowing police officers to get killed).In your quest to find a device called the Ray Sphere, Cole travels between 3 city islands and comes into contact with other super-powered beings, difficult enemies, and dangerous missions - after several twists and turns you come to face Kessler, your ultimate enemy.Will you be the savior of the city, or a re-volt-ing tyrant?Graphics: The in-game movies are done in a 2-D comic book format, most likely to keep the player connected to the game's comic book origin and storyline. The buildings are beautifully rendered, and Cole himself is depicted with a high amount of detail on his costume and facial features. The game falls a little short on the city's characters; as they all look the same and wear fairly bland clothes. Every lightning bolt Cole throws is shown with such realistic detail, you wonder if you need to be grounded while holding the controller.Options: In addition to the standard options of subtitles for hearing-impaired players and game difficulty selection, inFamous allows the player to choose their vertical & horizontal camera angles during gameplay, and the camera response speed. Since some players enjoy flight simulation games, this is a great option for those who want to exert a little more control over their visual horizons.Gameplay: inFamous can take as long or as little time as you want to complete. Sticking to the main missions will get you to the end faster, but in a sandbox environment like this one, it's more fun to complete the good/evil side missions to level Cole up and unlock more super-powers. Based on your karma, Cole will unlock different powers as they become available. Cole can climb up walls and other objects using a modified version of parkour running, and he can recharge his electrical powers by rail-sliding on electrical wires, train tracks, or even draining electricity from lampposts, signs, or nearby friends/foes. If injured, Cole eventually heals as long as he avoids being damaged for a period of time, similar to the health system inUncharted: Drake's Fortune.Cole can increase his battery core (electricity power storage) by finding blast shards of the Ray Sphere scattered all over the city, which are briefly visible using his radar pulse power.The controls for each power are very simple to use, and a brief tutorial is available after each new power is earned. From static thrusters to thunder drops, the button combinations are not awkward or difficult to pull off. Novice and seasoned gamers should be able to handle Cole's powers with amp-le ease.inFamous brings a breath of fresh air to the sandbox genre with save spots during boss battles. I grew up with games that were very unforgiving with boss fights - if I lost, I'd have to start the fight all over again - but not with inFamous. Here, each boss fight is usually between 2-3 segments long. Let's say you finish the first segment and then get killed - you do not have to start the entire boss battle over again, you will start from the 2nd segment with your powers fully recharged. That tiny feature makes this game much more fun to play.Extras: There aren't many extras to speak of - you can listen to the dead drop messages and watch movies you have unlocked during gameplay, but that's about it.Trophies: The trophy system for inFamous is a good mix of easy and hard achievements. Collecting 25% of the blast shards is one of the simpler ones, whereas unlocking every stunt on the stunt list can be quite difficult. There is a balance between the good and evil karma decisions, so a player is enticed to play through this game at least twice to earn all the trophies.Cons:  Since there is no complete list of stunts during the game, a player doesn't know which ones have been completed and which ones are left. The standard enemy battles get repetitive very quickly - but earning newer powers and moving to new areas help to keep this fresh.  It would have been nice to give the option to deactivate the vibration function so the power level of the controller wouldn't be drained as quickly. The in-game cutscenes cannot be skipped with button presses, but thankfully most of them are relatively short.Conclusion?This was a very enjoyable game. inFamous took the sandbox style formula and simplified it with relatively easy side missions and easier boss battles than other games in the genre. Since the trophy system requires playing the game through with both good and evil karma, this increases our chances of enjoying the game more. The game has its fair share of foul language and violence, but not so much as to earn an \"M\" rating from the ESRB - the \"T\" rating is very appropriate here.Once you play this game, you'll be charged up for the eventual sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2009"}

Olympus and the dark depths of Hades once more to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, as well a selection of new weapons, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus and the mighty Zeus himself.Key Game Features","reviewerName":"ChrisInCali","summary":"Awesome - it feels like you're playing a movie.","reviewText":"It has come to this, the final act of the God of War trilogy featuring Kratos. A culmination of rage, vengeance, and hope all come together in the limelight to reveal the breathtaking epic that Kratos has come to Olympus for. You are Kratos, a man without a future who fights for the past - a man who is brutal (oh, and brutally honest too) to the core. Will Kratos finally get revenge, or will it end in a triumphant failure? That's for you to find out; either way - in the end, there will be only chaos.God of War III picks up right where God of War II left off - climbing to the top of Olympus to wreak havoc upon the Gods and Zeus himself. For those who aren't familiar with the series - Santa Monica does a decent job at recapping some of the recent events for newcomers. Some will be picking this up on a whim, so they may be lost between translation during certain scenes, since the God of War games are bridged with one another completely and it is best to have played the previous iterations for the best possible experience. Still, God of War III will leave you floored - it's just that the story could have been presented a bit better to newcomers.If you've played previous God of War games and are looking for more, look no further. GoW3 features the same core gameplay mechanics from its predecessors with added depth and speed. You can real-time weapon switch in-between combos, adding more combo variations, cancellations, and air juggles. Everything runs fairly smooth in the game, thanks to the variable 40-60 frames-per-seconds. This is what makes combat much more fluid and responsive. The combat is just as visceral as ever, with grotesque context-sensitive finishers from Kratos, and lots of blood spillage all over the place - a neat technology employed by Santa Monica is a dynamic blood stain effect that not only affects enemies and your surroundings, but can smear all over Kratos as well.When you first start the game, you can choose from three difficulties: Spartan (easy), God (normal), Titan (hard), and you can unlock Chaos (very hard) mode after you beat the game. Starting on normal and you'd breeze through the game. For a challenging and heart-pounding experience, it is recommended that you start on Titan mode. The difficulty is balanced just about right, with some really tough and frustrating parts, but nothing you can not overcome and endure.To break up the intense action sequences, there are some light platforming sequences with puzzles here and there. The puzzles aren't too hard or too easy, some even require a train of thought. Level design is expertly catered to around these puzzles, but there might be one in particular that can leave a player frustrated. Some of the later areas can be a bit frustrating and almost unfair at times, and it's what bogs down the experience just a bit on the final stretches of the game.The visuals and artistic direction in GoW3 is simply stunning. You will be floored at times, especially during key boss battles. Parts of this game are things never before seen in video games this generation - it's just a marvelous feat from Santa Monica with the scale so HUGE, it's almost unbelievable at times. All textures are loaded, so you will experience no texture pop-in whatsoever. No load times, no install, 40-60 FPS and you've got to wonder how they did it.The stunning conclusion to the trilogy should leave fans humbled, but obviously wanting more from the series. With such epic presentation and over-the-top battles, it can't just end here for God of War. Whether you're a fan of God of War, a newcomer to the series, or someone that takes an interest in action games - you owe it to yourself to play this game and witness its magnificence.The Good:+ Visceral, fast-paced combat with added depth and responsiveness+ Amazing, jaw-dropping visuals with clean, jagged-free textures+ Over-the-top boss fightsThe Bad:- Last part of the game can be a bit cheap/unfair- Some annoying sequences","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}

I didn't see SR1 as a GTA killer but the current incarnation of GTA isn't as enjoyable to play as SR2. Sure GTAIV looks better graphic wise but once you complete it you generally don't play it again and there isn't the level of customization that you find in SR2 which contributes to high replay value. This being said, you have the option of playing a female this time, I guess the protagonist from the first Saint's Row had drastic gender reassignment surgery while \"he\" was in a coma. You can also customize your gang's style and overall look. The city of Stillwater is also bigger, not as big as it was hyped to be but it's noticable if you played SR1. I hear that there's already production on the 3rd installment of this series. Maybe Volution can work out some of the bugs which are many in this game. You better have a method of getting off the roof which doesn't require jumping off, also if you happen to shoot a safe in a store it will start crawling up the wall or be throw directly at you by some unseen force.

This is in my opinion, the greatest PS4/Xbox One game on the market as of now. The graphics are absolutely stunning. You really have to experience them for yourselves. I was lucky to live near one of the few places that had mid night release, so I am coming off of about 4 hours of gameplay. I just bought an amazon version for a friend who was a fan of Skyrim and Dishonored.And that is what this game looks like. It looks like it was published by Bethesda, rather than Square Enix Montr&eacute;al. The graphics are crisp, and clear. The interface could get some getting used to since the touchpad is new for me, but you can change the settings if you wanted to.It's not just about the graphics which really sink in about this game, it's the main character Garett who I love the most. He himself is such a great character. He steals, but finds killing wrong. He only kills when it is necessary. That is what stealth games are all about.Even if you are not a fan of stealth games, you would still enjoy this great game. It is about manipulating your surroundings to best fit you, whether that is blowing out a candle or shooting a fire pit with a water arrow. There are also multiple ways to do things. In one of the missions, you have to break into a manor. There are about 3 different ways to do this, so you control your path.Pros:Great GraphicsDetailed Story lineManipulatable SettingsGreat selection of toolsCons:Weird interface (can be changed in settings)Overall, this game is the game to get.

Excellent!  Addicting!","reviewText":"Overview:For being a GBA RPG, Fire Emblem gives me everything I need to stay captivated.  The graphics are excellent! The sound is good!  The story is quite interesting; characters are well thought out.Graphics:Fire Emblem's graphics are some of the best.  All the battle maps are fully detailed with trees, forts, castles, and terrain weather.  Sometimes the area is surrounded with white, fluffy snow, while other times its foggy or even raining.  During battle, it looks quite generic.  It's not 3D and the characters are not very detailed.  Enemies are dressed in red, NPCs are all green, and allies are blue.  During a battle encounter between enemy and allie or when an allie heals another, the screen zooms into the two characters, showing detail, animation, and their full character design.Sound:Music is good, but is used repetitively throughout.  Sounds are accurate and well done also.  All sword, lance, and axe attacks to magics of all types have individual sounds.Basic Gameplay:The only time you are in control of your characters is during battle.  Other than that, you follow the story.  Once in a while you can choose 'yes' or 'no' in whether to join a side-mission.  You get a maximum of 11 characters during each battle to choose from, (you aquire many characters throughout the game with special abilities: axemen, swordsman, healer, thief, ect.).Weapons have a certain amount of durability.  Once used, durability goes down.  Eventually, weapons will break and have to be purchased.  Items must be bought by a vendor DURING battle.  Lastly, if an enemy loses all their HP you CANNOT ever use them again in battle unless the story allows you to.  OTherwise you lose that character forever.  Be warned, it's hard to avoid sometimes.  (no phoenix downs in this game.)Fun:This game is tons of fun!  I recommend this to anyone who wants something fresh, new or even just wants another strategy RPG.  I guarantee you'll love it!Pros:Fun game play.Over 30 addicting battlesMany characters to choose from!Great storyCons:Completely linearWeapons breaking is annoyingBuying items during battle is something I wish I could avoid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2004"}

I am about 5 hours into the game and I am thoroughly enjoying it. This is one of the very few games that does just about everything right and (meets or exceeds) my expectation in every way: the visuals, the controls, the RPG elements, the weapons, the also the racing are all delivered with extremely high quality. You can take on story missions, side quests, racing challenges, or just explore the area aimlessly - the choice is yours!!! You can easily use up an hour without even trying!The only minor gripes are the saving times. The game only autosaves when you enter a new area, so you need to remember to save often to avoid losing precious work you have already done. The in-game message even tells you to do this. Saving can take up to 1 full minute to complete which can be slightly annoying but it's not a big deal.One other thing to keep in mind is this game requires an 8GB install. Again not a big deal but something to keep in mind. I had to clear out some older game files in order to make room since I only have 40GB to work with (actually probably less).*** EDIT 10/25I just completed the game on 'easy' mode after about 12 hours. My appreciation for the game has lessened over time as I realize this game is really NOT as 'open' as it could have been. Also, the ending was somewhat of a disappointment; I won't spoil it for you but let's just say some missions could have been sequenced differently to bring out the plot better.All in all, this is still a very enjoyable game which I highly recommend to FPS fans!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A worthy follow up to a unique game","reviewText":"Last year's surprise hit on the DS, Capcom's Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney provided a unique gaming experience that utilized many of the DS' equally unique features.  This sequel, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All, is pretty much more of the same game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  If you played the first Phoenix Wright game at any length, then you already know what to expect with Justice For All: engaging characters and a well-weaved storyline involving seperate cases that provide for an entertaining search for truth and justice.  Besides Phoenix, there are many returning characters and concepts in this second installment, including a big twist in the game's final twist that is worth the price of admission alone.  The gameplay itself is still rewarding and somewhat addictive, but there are a few jarring negatives that stop this sequel from living up to the standards set by the original game.  First off, many of the great touch screen features that we saw in the final case of the last game aren't here at all, not to mention that there are no new features of the DS' capabilities either.  Also worth noting is that while the first game had moments of rearing it's linear head, Justice For All has more linear moments than one could imagine.  Too often must something be done in a case to trigger more events, which in itself is annoying.  Besides all the negatives, the game still looks great with crisply drawn animations and wonderful music and sound effects, keeping the first game's top notch presentation intact.  All in all, Justice For All isn't a bad game one bit, and in fact it's one of the better third party DS titles to come out in the past few months, but if you've never played the original, you should check that out first before giving Justice For All a final verdict.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2007"}

Its so vast I think It would take easily 100 hours or more to complete everything.The story is lame and the voice acting is laughable but i think the developers wanted it that way. It probably would have not been as fun if the story was engaging because you would be focused on that instead of the world which is the REAL star of the show.Now the map as I have said is huge. And there's stuff to do in every corner of it. Whether it be blowing up oil rigs or scaling a mountain or racing planes or boats or finding all of the over 300 settlements or 100 or so drug cases scattered about. My favorite is the mile high club which is literally a club that's in the sky. It's a blimp that has several bars and a helipad and a small airplane on it(you can take off from there too). There are also over 100 vehicles to find and drive.What's so great about this huge world is that you can explore any of it at any time. It's not restricted like some games. There's also a fast travel system that makes life a lot easier.Also you can upgrade weapons and armor and your vehicles through the black market which can be accessed at any time through your PDA(unless you're in the middle of a firefight).You can also swim underwater too. I was expecting you could swim but not underwater! That adds even more depth to the world because there's seaweed and rocks down there which you hardly ever see. You can't jump out of the water though you have to grapple to something which is an inconvenience.I didn't give the game five stars because of a few annoyances like the corny accents and having to call the black market dealer to fast travel and enemies respawning constantly. When you buy a car or plane or whatever from the black market it's a onetime use so even if you don't blow it up (that's unlikely) you can't store it anywhere or even repair it. Also scarcity of ammo can be a problem when your being overrun by enemies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

Nicholson","summary":"A FPS with RPG upgrade skills...A great game but a few concerns","reviewText":"Despite some problems, the game itself is really fun to play!The Pros:Dark Messiah Might and Magic is the type of computer game I really enjoy, that being primarily a FPS combined with touch of RPG; if you like System Shock or Deus Ex then I'm sure this game will be of interest to you. This game (when it works properly [more below]) has it all; some interesting quests, first person combat with traditional weapons or magic against various groups of enemies. There were even a few individual bosses to defeat along the way.One of the nicest things about this game is its replayability; you could, for instance, play the game as a warrior/fighter and then try the game again using the skill points you've earned to develop a top flight assassin or mage. Lots of variety, lots of choices, IF, you can get the game to run properly.The Cons: (from most important to minor)1.)Crashes, but less with the latest patch. I eventually put the game settings on low (especially the video [and without any real reduction in game play enjoyment]); I found this reduced most (but not all) of the crashes that usually occurred when I tried to reload after dying or loading a new scene.2.)The audio and video were often out of sync, for both talking scenes and battle sounds.3.)Only a small number of recent saves (maybe 3 or 4 ) which sometimes made it difficult to use your hard earned skill points wisely for upgrades. (some skills were very useful [depending on your character], others less so).4.) Really annoying, grating voice acting for Leanne and Phenrig.All in all, a great game; they should have waited a little longer to fix the bugs before releasing it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2006"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Jub Jub","summary":"Borderlands 2 game review","reviewText":"Holy hot jimmies, this game is good! Borderlands 2 is truly a unique gem in the increasingly popular first person RPG genre.  The game's style and feel reminds me of a mix of Trigun, Unreal Tournament, and a little bit of Bioshock and Fallout 3. Also it's funny as hell. It's been a while since I've seen a game like this that has such personality to go with the overall fun factor of the game play. Now this is unusual for me because I usually don't really care for these massive, open world, first person RPGs like Skyrim or Fallout 3. That is part of the reason I avoided this game for awhile. It took some convincing to finally get around to playing this game and boy was I wrong. The game play is very addictive, the story is simple but good and well-done, the characters are some of the best video game characters I have seen in years, and it puts lots of new spins on the usual FPS conventions. It's definitely not the deepest RPG experience out there but it doesn't need to be. Now I have not played the first game but you don't really have to play the first to understand this game, though it was made me very interesting in playing the original Borderlands now. Review time, go now!STORY: Set on the planet Pandora (not the one with the blue cats) which holds legends of all kinds of vaults that hold mythical amounts of treasure. Treasure hunters known as Vault Hunters come from all over the galaxy come to this planet seeking a legendary vault hidden within the planet. The planet is controlled by the Hyperion Organization which is under control of Handsome Jack (isn't that the best name ever?) who has been luring hunters to the planet to kill them off to keep them from getting to the vault so he can keep it for himself and so the company can freely mine Eridium from the planet. Today, four Vault Hunters, Salvador, Maya, Axton, and Zer0 have made it to the planet and discover Handsome Jack's trap and end up left for dead near the planet's pole. Pandora itself is a land of danger filled with arctic glaciers, deserts, wastelands, steep valleys, mountains, and volcanoes. In those lands they are filled with native creatures, bandits, psycho paths, killer freaks, robots, and other horrors you must face, plus Handsome Jack as a deadly plan for those on the planet who are trying to resist him.You also encounter some strong allies in these borderlands. This game has some of the coolest characters I've seen in a video game in awhile. There are characters like Scooter who is your typical redneck mechanic that has some questionable love interests, Dr. Zed your go to person for health with a questionable medical license, Marcus the gun seller who is always trying to make a buck, Miss Moxxi the sexy bar owner, Tiny Tina a mentally unstable 13-year old that is an expert with explosives, and Claptrap. Oh, Claptrap. He's one of the silliest robots ever in a video game. Handsome Jack makes for one of the best villains I've seen in a video game who is just constantly harassing you throughout the game. He's such a condescending jerk but at the same time he's hilarious. The cast from the first game also become major characters as the story progresses. I am also happy to see that the characters that you play as are not just silent protagonists like you see in most games like this. While they do not talk directly with NPCs, they do talk and make wise  remarks during combat. I prefer to have a character with personality than one that just stays silent throughout a game even though they are the hero.The game's story length is surprisingly long. It's taken me about three weeks to complete but I've also been working at the side quests which there very many of. While the main missions are generally interesting and keep the story moving along, the side missions are a lot of fun as well. They range from massive treasure hunts, taking on a town filled with bandits, to something as simple as shooting a guy in the face who literally asked for it. While the game is long and has some epic boss fights, including the last boss, it does have a disappointingly short ending like many games these days and kinds sets it up for another game. BUT it's not like that's it, there are still plenty of side missions to do and a few open up to you after you complete the main missions so there is plenty to do after the credits roll.GAMEPLAY:  If you like shooting and looting then you will love this game because you're going to be doing it A LOT. This game has soooo many guns. I really have no idea how many guns are in it because I seem to be always discovering new ones. Not only do you have the usual classes of guns such as assault rifles, pistols, sniper rifles, SMGs, and rocket launchers, you also have elemental based guns. They have one of five elemental effects such as electricity, acid, fire, slag (a chemical that causes enemies to take more damage), and explosive. They also take the usual shooter clich&eacute; of red explosive barrels and adds in barrels that hold these elements to use strategically during gun fights. I have no idea how they have barrels of electricity but they are fun to shoot. In addition to your guns and grenades, you also have various shields which take another convention of modern shooters and makes it deeper. You can find, buy, or make better shields throughout the game and they all recharge at certain rates. Your shields recharge but your health does not. You'll need to find health items for that which I rather like because I'm tired of the easy-peasy take cover and you'll heal right up health system most games these days use. You will find money, ammo, guns, shields, and other goodies all over the place in this game and you will constantly be looting containers. It becomes very addictive. Also when you find new guns, shields, ect, a screen appears that shows the item's stats and makes it easy to compare with the items you currently have. You can carry a lot on you but over time you'll find yourself have to decide on dropping or keeping various items throughout the game.In addition to all of your weapons, each class has their own individual special ability. There are four classes: Gunzerker who can duel-wield weapons of any find, Siren (which is the character I am using) that has a psylock power that lets her hold enemies in the air with psychokinetic abilities, the commando who can deploy turrets, and the assassin who can make decoys of himself. As you level up you can develop these characters as you want and they have their own unique abilities to gain. In addition to that, there is the Bada** ranking system (yes, that's what it is called and censored for this amazon review). There are hundreds of challenges to complete throughout this game and each time one is completed you get a bada** token which you can use to improve various aspects of your character such as improving weapon accuracy or melee damage. This game constantly rewards you for your actions and improvement.The characters are customizable in appearance but not nearly as deep as some first person RPGs. You do unlock different color skins and hair styles throughout the game but that's it so if you're looking to make a character that looks like you, you're going to be disappointed. However, I really don't mind much since these characters do actually have personality to them unlike in other similar type RPGs. However, another department that really could have used the customization is the weapons. While there are many, being able to add on optics or other attachments would have been nice. If you want an assault rifle with an optic, you pretty much just have to be lucky and find one. Also there are vehicles in the game, well, two to be exact. More vehicles would have been cool to see. Also, enemies have a flying vehicle but you never get to use one. I find that disappointing especially in one mission were it looks like you finally fly one but end up having to blow it up instead, though it leads to some funny dialogue afterwards. However, the biggest complaint I would have about this game is respawning enemies. After awhile, enemies will return to an area after you kill them. I understand it's to help gain exp for leveling up BUT why do the bosses come back? Especially, if it's a boss directly tied in with the main story. You do get the same about exp but I've never seen a game bring bosses back like that. It makes you think what was the point of fighting them? Anyway, it's not game breaking and if you want to relive a boss fight you can easily do so.The final thing I'd like to point out is that this is NOT an easy game. If you are not experiences with FPS games then you might want to take it slow with this. The guns fights you get in this game very chaotic, fast paced, and intense. I've played many FPS games before I still find parts where I die over and over again. You respawn at check points, though it does cost money and you're treated to a wise remark from the automated voice from the respawn machine. This game is completely co-op though so if you're having too much trouble, grab a friend in person or online and you can play the game together!GRAPHICS: One of the things that make Borderlands' style is the cell shaded graphics. Nearly the entire game is cell shaded and gives it this comic book/graphic novel look to it. It's really cool and colorful despite the arid landscapes of Pandora. However, this does come with a price. There is a lot of texture pop-in.  It's at its worst when loading up a game or loading up a new area and you will be seeing a lot of smaller pop-in throughout the game. I did also notice some frame rate slow down here and there but it was rather rare and not game breaking. I have a feeling this is not as much of an issue on the PC versions of the game. The character models look awesome. Some of the most unique character designs I've seen in a game in awhile and excellent personalities to go with them.SOUND: The sounds of gunfire and explosions will fill your speakers and you play through this game but what really steals the show is the voice acting and dialogue. This is one of those games where you'll want to go around and talk to everyone just to hear the crazy stuff they are going to say. This is bolstered by excellent voice acting which oddly enough has a lot of anime voice actors in it. From the main characters to the crazy psycho babble of the bandits, the voice acting in this game is lots of fun. The music is sadly less memorable. While it is definitely fitting with the sci-fi western setting, it's just nothing I really care to listen to without the game. It reminds me a lot of the background music for Trigun. Fitting but nothing without its source.Overall, I recommend Borderlands 2 as one of the must play games of 2012. This game is so much fun and entertaining to play through. Considering that there are four different classes, it adds even more replay value to the game in addition to the already plentiful amount of side missions. There are already plenty of DLC missions for it as well. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but I think this is the way an FPS/RPG should be done and I strongly prefer it over games like Fallout 3. I recommend this game for anyone who loves FPS games but is tired of Call of Duty or Halo. I also recommend it to fans of Fallout and Elder Scrolls games and action junkies. Even if you aren't crazy about the game play, you should still be able to find some laughs out of this unique and fun game.OVERALL: 9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"In Short, It's the Sequel You Truly Wanted 91%","reviewText":"Visuals-90/100(Great art style make for a great looking game)Story-87/100 (Smartly written, funny, and features a lot of personality)Sound-88/100 (Great voice acting and moody music compliment the experience)Game play-94/100(Borderlands 2's RPG elements jell together with a very playable game)Replay Value-93/100 (A lengthy game, co-op, and much more make for a game you will play over and over again)When Borderlands was released back in 2009, it surprised everyone with it's unique hybrid of shooting and role playing.  Borderlands was definitely unique, and personally, I thought it was the first true RPG/FPS hybrid.  Sure, there were games like System Shock 2 beforehand, but SS2 isn't so much a shooter as it is an action role playing survival horror hybrid, and from a FPS standpoint, it's actually horribly repetitive and clunky.  But Borderlands combined Diablo-style looting and frantic FPS combat, all the while providing for some of the most intense and satisfying gun play in a shooter.  Borderlands was definitely a breath of fresh air in the FPS market, and it's a darn shame we don't have more games in the genre like it.  Now, Borderlands is back with this top notch sequel, and the series is better than ever.I won't say too much about the single player experience, but given the amount of missions available, it seems Borderlands 2 will provide a lengthy, satisfying experience.  I'm not finished with the game yet, but I can tell that it isn't going to end any time soon.  People who have beaten it already have said the game will take around 30 hours to complete, so single player fans will be satisfied.  From what I gather, numerous reviewers are saying that you will want to play through the entire game more than once (!) as well, thanks in part to it's diverse skill classes.  Even better, Borderlands 2 now let's you play the entire game with all of your stats in tow, so expect some heady replay value for single player.As we all know, the story for Borderlands was extremely forgettable.  That's not to say the single player campaign didn't have merit, it most certainly did.  The art design was nice, Pandora was occasionally a vivid location, and some of the encounters you faced made for some memorable gaming moments.  That said, the characters were extremely forgettable (aside from the awesome Claptrap), and the plot line was about as memorable as watching a modern artist craft a generic sculpture out of toilet roll tubes.  Borderlands 2, on the other hand, actually had me invested with it's sharp writing and quirky sense of humor, and some of the people you meet in the game will have you reeling with startling surprise.  It's mission structure is so far interesting, and the encounters so far have all been memorable.  I won't spoil too much, but let me just say that the creatures here will provide you with a sense of being; you will see them as creatures of fiction, not cannon fodder.Perhaps the biggest part of the game's success as a story is the vivid recreation of Pandora.  Video Game developers know that building a world is one of the best ways to tell a story, especially in a First Person Game (just look at Half-Life).  It's easily one of the video game medium's biggest strengths, and Borderlands 2 knows this.  Borderlands 2 is a great space western experience, with a mood that recalls a comic book if it were hijacked by space western writers.  Of course, the famous Borderlands 2 art style is back, and it provides for an awesome artistic foundation for Borderlands 2's vivid recreation of Pandora.  And Pandora is beautiful!  Borderlands 2 won me over with it's cell shaded, mood setting skies (Yes.  Skies), glistening tundras, jagged mountains, colorful vivid industrial areas, and other locations.  It's better looking than anything such garbage as \"photo-realism\" ever will be able to achieve.  You see, folks (*cough* as well as certain 2K executive *cough*)?  This is what happens when you get away from \"realism\"!  An antidote to the lifeless drudgery of puke browns and vapid grays; the overall dreary, narcolepsy inducing experience.  Thanks for this, Borderlands 2 is more of a beaut than Battlefield 3 will ever be.The Sound track is also very beautiful.  The soundtrack truly makes the space western mood they were going for.  Great sound effects and voice acting follow suit.Now, to game play.  The basic game play concepts remain the same.  Choose a skill class, start building your character and then loot n' gain (experience points, that is)!  With loot and experience points, you have the potential to help yourself to a seemingly endless number of play styles, equipment and, of course, guns.  Loads upon loads of guns.  If you are familiar with the original (and you should be), you will know that the basic core intents of the game play remain the same.  However, what Borderlands 2 offers new is what we all want to know.  Does it offer something new? Is this Borderlands 2 or Borderlands 1.5?  This is Borderlands 2.  And aside from it's vastly superior story and setting, Borderlands 2 adds great game play additions that pushes the series forward, and leaves the first game in the dust.The biggest addition to Borderlands 2 is the revamped skill classes.  Character builds are deeper than ever, and much more rewarding than before.  Since this is one of the biggest pros of Borderlands 2, it's nice to say that the is better than ever.  The biggest change here is that each skill tree feels way more diverse, something the original was lacking.  As you pick from four different skill classes, you can use each class to your advantage.  Each class has it's own unique abilities, such as Zero's invisible stealth, the Salvador's ability to dual-wield anything, the Axion's ability to use turrets, and Maya's ability to freeze.  Beyond the leveling up of your special abilities, the skill trees you build are diverse and the skills you invest in add a much better sense of personal, much more satisfying combat that suits you well.  You can add all sorts of abilities, from more helpful defensive skills to offensive based powers like a Borderlands 2 has some real depth to your play style, and it's combination of great combat and true RPG elements makes for a truly great RPG and shooting hyrbid.  All of this is aided by a much improved interface that makes the game more playable than before.As you defeat enemies, you can upgrade the powers of the class, which is rewarded through looting and the gaining of experience points.  Bad *cool* points make for some great bonuses, as they augment most other powers rather well.  Most importantly, Borderlands 2 rewards you with guns and the ability to use an endless number of weapons, and it's addictive and rewarding as ever.  You all know the drill, and it's even better than the first game.  The ability to customize EVERYTHING (yes, all caps for a reason), from common features like re-load, to giving your own gun acid, makes sure that you can get creative with whatever gun you want to make.  I'm not quite there making the ultimate gun that puts the BFG to shame, but according to what I've heard, anything is possible, including such crazy weapons as a pistol with ammo that doubles as a grenade dispenser, and I'm pretty sure that's not as crazy as it gets.  Borderlands 2 proves that you can never have enough weapons, and they ensure that you will never feel empty-handed.  Superior AI and a diverse range of enemies round out the experience.All of this translates to the multi-player extremely well.  Borderlands 2 offers four-player co-op, and it succeeds thanks in part to the great game mechanics.  Using each character class, you can truly uses each one to their strengths to help out each team mate, in a way that sort of reminds me of Team Fortress 2.  One can really get creative if you mix things up and assign certain levels, and since enemies get tougher as you play the game, it becomes vital and more challenging as you go along.  Aided by it's diverse abilities, each skill class truly can add something unique to every play through, making for some rewarding and challenging combat that has the potential to be unique for every band of four.  Like a good RPG should do, you can actually join in anytime, which makes the game even better so you don't have to commit to a whole game together.  It makes game play extremely flexible, and it makes for some of the most accessible and playable multi-player experiences I've played in quite a while.I do have a few, eh, issues, however.  There are some minor graphics hitches here and there, but as long as you don't give all bent out of shape over some pop in textures or the occasional weird visual hiccup, you shouldn't have much trouble over looking this, uh, issue?  You still can't really change the appearance of your character as much, which isn't that big a loss but definitely can be a tad disappointing if you really enjoy customizing your character.  Oh, and car combat is mostly underused, as you won't find either a glut of vehicle based missions, or some fun car combat a la Rage.  Thankfully, most of these niggling issues are minor.Other than that, this game is just terrific.  I don't know much else to say here, but if you are a fan of Borderlands, this is not just a mere revision, it's a whole new great game.  Personally, I really don't find myself every playing the original Borderlands ever again, and it's definitely a stand out in the cluttered FPS genre that exists today.  It's got humor, it's got replay value, it's got role-playing, it's got terrific gun play, and it's got enough things to do to keep you hooked for days.  Needless to say, if you like Borderlands, you want this one.  Easily.  Go get it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000TG72OW","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"An incredibly stunning achievement","reviewText":"It's here, it's here, it's finally here.  Grand Theft Auto IV has finally arrived after what seems like eons of anticipation, and Rockstar's flagship franchise doesn't disappoint to say it lightly.  Putting you in the shoes of European illegal immigrant Niko Bellic, you are back in Liberty City, although this is a much different Liberty City than the one you remember.  This Liberty City is so incredibly detailed and constructed that you will often find yourself in complete awe.  Not since GTA III has an open world environment been so innovative in its scope, and never before has there ever been this kind of interaction.  At its core, the tried and true GTA gameplay remains, but there is so much more to do: ranging from dating (yes, dating!), surfing the in-game internet, seeing a comedy show, watching TV, and listening to the radio among other things. Besides all that, there is a story here, and it is indeed one of the most engrossing and compelling stories you will ever find in a video game.  Niko is no ordinary crook like we've seen before, and ends up being one of the most fully realized video game protagonists in quite some time.  The rest of the residents of Liberty City are wonderfully designed as well, all helping Liberty City feel like a living, breathing place.  Gunplay elements have been much improved upon as well, as have the driving mechanics and overall controls.  Combined with a 16 player multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto IV is a glorious, instant classic that more than deserves your attention.  If there are any downsides to GTA IV, and this is just me being nitpicky for the sake of being nitpicky, is that there are a few graphical hiccups to be found now and then, but definitely nothing major or all that noticable.  Other than that, GTA IV is nearly perfect in every regard.  All in all, Grand Theft Auto IV is an incredibly stunning achievement of modern gaming that must be played to be believed.  Ranking as possibly one of the finest and most immersive video games to ever see the light of day, Grand Theft Auto IV is a masterpiece that should be checked out in the very least, even if you aren't a fan of the series.  This special edition is worth the extra cash, coming with a horde of goodies that will make any GTA fan happy.  Most notably is the bonus CD soundtrack, featuring some excellent selected songs from the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0014WJ78E","reviewerName":"Fani","summary":"Pure bliss so far.","reviewText":"I've long held out on a PS3 because1 - I thought the Xbox360 was superior - better games and Xbox Live is unparalleled2 - Cost and lack of that many games on PS3Now, after seeing the MGS4 bundle back on the Amazon site In Stock, I couldn't resist and went for it.So, here's my feedback from the perspective of my wife who is really not that technical or cares for electronics. I got her involved in the \"Unboxing\" - a term she didn't know about or cared about :) but seeing the PS3 unboxed really made her eyes shine. The slick piano black surface is captivating and the unit feels like it has finesse and class. \"Elegance\" is what my wife said.Anyways, after booting it up and playing the demo blu-ray video in 1080i ( not even 1080p although its very tough to tell any diff ), she was hooked by the PlanetEarth trailer thats on it.I played a quick game and I was mesmerized too. I mean, I have an Xbox360 for the past 3 1/2 years and I'm still giddy with a system that released almost 3 years ago. The PS3 is pretty good.I fired up Tversity on my PC and it now is a media server to the HD TV. This simple operation felt satisfying.I connected my PSP to the PS3 and lo ! via RemotePlay I'm connected to the PS3 switching it on and off remotely. That is insane ( it probably has the WOL pkt technology for this ).The PSN store seems nice and friendly like the Xbox Live Store. Both have comparable features. One nice thing is the PSN is free. However, for $4.25/month, the Xbox360 is a steal and probably the best online service. I like the Xbox Live here over PSN, albeit only marginally. 0I am excited that I can install Fedora Linux on it tomorrow as well !!!The games are also pretty nice HOWEVER, I must say that somehow I am preferring the Xbox360 for gaming more than the PS3. Gaming feels gritty and raw and enriching on the Xbox360 ( only slightly more so than the PS3 though ). For everything else, PS3 feels supreme. Who knows, in a year or so, PS3 may overtake the Xbox360 in my house as the gaming king as well.Overall, I am quite satisfied with the PS3.Blu-Ray, built-in Wifi and couple of other features make this a must have. However, here are a couple of puzzling drawbacks or missteps Sony made with the PS3 - This system is being marketed as more than a gaming device, its being marketed as a complete home entertainment system with BluRay and all BUT -1 - it doesn't include HDMI cables ??? and not even Component. It comes with SD Composite cables. This is a blunder.2 - it doesn't include a BluRay remote ??? What @!# Its supposed to be a BluRay player and it doesn't come with a remote ? I mean, its a built-in prime feature, not an add-on feature but one of the primary draws...I understand its all to make more money on accessories, but this is where they could've sold on these points more. Its like buying a DVD player and finding it has no remote control and you have to buy one separately.Anyways, to summarize -Every hardcore gamer should buy the PS3 and the Xbox360 for the complete gaming satisfaction for this generation of consoles.Buy the PSP too for added fun with the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2009"}

This game is just flat out good, period. You don't have to make excuses to enjoy this truly wonderful gem. Once you're pulled into this creepy murder mystery you won't want to finish until you've collected every playing card, completed every racing mini game, and solved the murder of Anna Graham.Welcome to Greenvale, you're agent York Morgan, but please call him York. If you've ever wondered what a Twin Peaks video game would be like well this is as close as you'll ever get to such a thing. All the elements are here: large midwestern town, quirky townsfolk, FBI agent who is enthralled by the small town, and a murder so horrifying it threatens to destroy the simple goodness of this place.When you first start the game it would appear at first that everything is as you expect in a survival horror game. Slow walking undead creatures? Yup. Resident Evil style controls? Yup. There are few surprises to find in the games prologue but those who push forward will be greatly rewarded by all of the other gameplay elements that come into play as the game and the town unfold before your very eyes. It's the little details that always make me grin. The exaggerated looks on the character models. York's cheesy smile. Turn signals and windshield wiper controls when you drive the car. When York talks about popular films such as Superman 4 with his imaginery friend Zach.The game blends the \"real in-game clock\" of Dead Rising with the open world freedom also found in that game but instead of just one mall you get an entire town to drive around in. In the same league as such great games as Mad World, Killer 7, and No More Heroes; Deadly Premonition is ambitious in it's design and most of all you can tell that the devs had just as much making it as you have playing it.There is no need to make excuses for this game.

As I've mentioned, it was short but the campaign takes you around the world and rage war in various locations, non look alike.  I agree with people saying they've not realized a difference in graphics since MW2 but it's a good looking game none the less.  Like the previous games you have your standart missions like, protect someone, be somewhere before the time runs out, stealth and snipe, use the heavy machinery or AC-130 and so on.  It all works well together and although formulaic I enjoyed the mission variety.  Since I was able to finish the game in relatively short time it felt like a good action movie.But, of course, no one is buying this game for single player only.  Multiplayer is, as usual, a hectic experience.  I guess they had to change the class system so that people won't feel like they are playing just another map-pack.  Well, at some point I certainly felt like that.  A side from couple of new weapons everything feels very familiar.  Some of the materials look like they are recycled from MW2, cars, barrels, crates, etc.After spending some time on it I decided to go with BF3 on multiplayer and sell this game since I already have MW2 hardened Ed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2012"}

I originally wanted to play this game because it was a Final Fantasy game, I was not expecting much from this game.  After playing this game for over 40 hours, I can honestly say this has become one of my favorite Final Fantasy games (with Final Fantasy IV & VI taking top honors and VII in 4th place).  Even though I never played all of the Final Fantasy games (never beat II or V, never played VIII, IX, X, XI, XII and just started playing XIII), the music is simply breathtaking.  The game can be easily beaten in a hour or so, but the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed the game was simply how much of a \"perfectionist\" I am in trying to get all \"critical\" in each song.  To keep it short and simple, you are graded on each note and the score ranges from Miss, Bad, Good, Great and Critical.  Also, each song has 3 difficulty with Basic the easiest and Ultimate the hardest.  I constantly found myself trying to score Criticals on every note, but of course I set some limits by not trying to get all crticals on Ultimate (it is super hard for some songs).  I also liked how you can collect items in the game to unlock new abilities and characters, similar to an RPG.My only grip about the game is the add-on content you can purchase.  I am not against DLC, but Square or Nintendo should allow you to purchase more than one song at a time.  That's the only thing that I found annoying.I highly recommend this game to fans of Final Fantasy and rhythm.  I don't like rhythm games (because I don't have rhythm), but this game has changed my perspective on the genre and I look forward to future 3DS games that incoporate the fun and challenge that this game does so well.Final Grade: A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2012"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"If you were forced to buy only one Sonic game at all...","reviewText":"Sonic The Hedgehog 2(1992). The second Genesis Sonic game.Once Sega established themselves as a worthy contender of the 16-bit era with the original Sonic The Hedgehog, they knew their newly successful mascot shouldn't be relegated to a \"one-game-wonder\" status, so they set out to follow it up with a sequel in order to keep the public's attention on them. Although Sonic was the true origin of the 16-bit wars between the giants Sega and Nintendo, this time Sega had a much greater challenge ahead of them. By 1992, the big N had just released their new SNES system along with a slew of outstanding games. Therefore Sega had to react fast. Sonic fast. They had to figure out how to draw people back to the ring collecting, speed shoes, chaos emeralds, and blue hedgehogs in a time when people were absorbed with Yoshis, Simon Belmonts, F-Zeros, and Street Fighters. Sega started work first on what would later become Sonic CD (for the Sega CD), but put it away briefly and made some other graphical upgrades to have a game ready for 1992. What resulted is Sonic 2. Did it live up to the original, or did the game fall under the inferior sequel curse? I'm sure you already know my answer...This my friends, is a true classic. Sonic 2 not only puts to rest any worries one would've had with a Sonic sequel, but it improved greatly upon the original game as well! I'd have to say that this is probably the single best and most well-designed Sonic game ever made (although Sonic CD is still my personal favorite, and hooking Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles together truly makes the best sonic game). Sonic 1 had awesome level structures, cool music, and fun gameplay, but its sequel takes those aspects to the next level of greatness. In addition to what's already established, this game adds great things like the Speed Dash, Tails/Miles the fox, chemical plants, 2 player competition modes, the 7th chaos emerald, the Death Egg ship, corkscrew tunnels, oil oceans, speedy bonus stages, coconut throwing monkeys, the starpost, and Super Sonic. Take a look at all the stuff that makes this game great and the (very) few small quibbles that it falls short:PROS-EXCELLENT LEVEL DESIGNS. Sonic's main gimmick was that he's fast, right? Well Sega wisely chose to center the level structures this time around his speedy characteristics and as a result, the levels are extremely fun to go through. There's still plenty of platforming action amidst the flurry of speed, so the challenge is ever present. The Zones are extremely varied as well, so you'll never get bored with the levels.-ENTER TAILS THE FOX. Joining Sonic's (then) latest adventure is this small orange fox who sports 2 tails allowing him to fly. In single player mode, he accompanies you in collecting rings and rescuing you from the clutches of robots. Another person can control him as well.-AWESOME 2 PLAYER MODE! This mode is really fun because it pits two people against each other going through one of 4 zones from the game. There's some cool powerups that make things extra difficult for the other player.-THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK HERE IS SOME OF THE BEST IN VIDEOGAME MUSIC. Seriously. This ranks up there with Mega Man 2, Gradius 2 & 3, Castlevania 4 & SotN, and Turrican as far as jaw-dropping video game music goes. Not a single one of these tunes is bad, and all are very catchy, probably some of the best that you'll find on the Genesis. My favorites have to be the Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, (2-player) Mystic Cave, and Metropolis tunes.-MUCH BETTER SPECIAL STAGES. This time around, you're put in a 3D-ish tunnel in which you have to collect a certain amount of rings and avoid the spike traps. It's still very challenging like the first game's stages are, but thankfully it eliminates the frustration by offering you A LOT MORE chances to tackle them throughout the game.-EVEN BETTER ASSORTMENT OF ENEMIES THIS TIME. There are a lot of cool enemies you'll face like the aformentioned monkeys with coconuts, armored crabs, lava dragons, claw mantis, and the extendable catepillar.-Before I forget, THE SPEED DASH IS A MUCH WELCOME ADDITION! This aids in the speedy level design because now you have a new way to  take off turbo-charged from a standstill.-SUPER SONIC!! Okay, so even if this idea is somewhat ripped off from the Super Saiyan of Dragon Ball Z, it's still awesome to be able to transform into this fiery yellow, superfast, invincible flying blur once you've obtained all the chaos emeralds.CONS-Despite being able to control Tails in the single player mode, it's not nearly as much fun for the second player because they can't really help out much. What's worse is that you can't make Tails fly and lift Sonic to higher places yet (wait til Sonic 3).-While the zones are a lot of fun to play through and there are a lot of them, it comes with the price of there being only 2 acts to complete per zone instead of 3 (except for Metropolis Zone). Some stages later on are only a single act long.-SOME OF THE BOSSES ARE FAR TOO EASY. It's true. Unlike the first game's bosses in which some were fairly easy, many of Dr. Robotnik's latest contraptions can be taken out in a pathetic matter of seconds.That's all the minor complaints I can think of. Everything else about this game rules. It goes without saying that Sonic 2 is a surefire classic, and most every Sonic fan already owns this one. It makes as a great introduction for new fans, and it never gets old, even though it technically is an old-school game. Whether you decide to hunt down the Genesis version, or would rather have it through the Sonic Mega Collection, BUY IT NOW!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2005"}
{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","summary":"Apart From The Server Issues...","reviewText":"A lot of people are complaining about the server issues.  While that is a pain in the rear it's not a valid criticism of the game itself.  That issue will be fixed.Apart from the lanuch issues this game still has some glaring issues that cripple it.1 - Always Online.I don't care what kind of foolishness has flowed out of the mouths of the reps at EA and Maxis, this game is always online because of a horrific version of DRM.  Maxis reps claimed that it was for the achievments, patches, and so on.  LIARS!!!!  The first thing EA shutoff when the the launch issues hit were...you guessed it!  The achievments and other OPTIONAL functionality. Don't lie to us we are not stupid.  If you had made a better investment you could have come up with a DRM that didn't cripple the game.2 - Map Size - Many people think that the maps are so small they are unplayable is becuase of the resources needed to run the game.  WRONG! You can control the resources by reducing graphics and resloution.  The maps are small so they can offer a DLC (that you can bet you'll have to pay for) with bigger maps.  The only way we won't have to pay for the DLC is if enough people complain.3 - Missing Content - If you have played Sim City before you know what I am talking about. There are a lot of things missing.  We will see them again and you will need to pay for them.  That leads me to my next major issue.4 - Micro Transactions - I have no problem with micro transactions if they do not de-value the game.  Mass Effect 3 does it perfectly.  SSX also did a decent job with it.  SimCity has them and it wouldn't be an issue but they are stupidly expensive. They also stick things in there that should have been part of the game in the first place.  That's when it detracts from the game. You can't kill the game to milk every last dollar out of your users when they paid top tier prices for the game!  If SimCity had been a $20 or a $30 game it wouldn't be an issue.  SimCity was a $60 to $80 game and you're charging beyond that for content that should have been included? I believe you just set a new low.I have no issues with the gameplay itself.  It's a little buggy but that will be patched.  It looks great and it has some awesome new features.  The multiplayer aspect could be really fun overtime.  Those are the only things keeping this from being a a one star review.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}

Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"She was mad I made her buy it...","reviewText":"I honestly haven't logged much time at the helm of this game, but I sat and watched my wife work her through a level.De Blob in all honesty is a basic platformer 3D game.  It's a tweak on a 3D version of Mario with little apparent resemblence - but it's there.  You'll spend your time jumping around, squashing bad guys by jumping on them, grabbing upgrades and dodging the occasional enemy fire.It's not a bad thing - not at all.  In fact it looks like a lot of fun, and the new angle of having to paing everything you touch adds a unique element to the game - you finish levels that look nothing like they did when you started them.The controls of De Blob seem to work very well.  The jumping mechanic seems a bit iffy as it seems a number of buildings are placed just slightly higher than you can actually jump.  It forces you to waste some time trying to get somewhere only to finally give up and find another way.  This wouldn't be a problem if the game weren't timed.But even when it comes to running out of time, the game never seems to punish you.  When you run out of time in a challenge (for example, painting a certain number of buildings a certain color) you are given the chance to resume the challenge where you left off.  You get more time, and don't have to start over.  The game simply gives you less points for taking more than one time to finish the challenge.  Even when you run out of time in a level, you simply lose a life and - assuming you have remaining lives - continue playing where you left off.  My wife ended the level with 6 lives, so it seems like you can never really \"fail\" in De Blob.  This makes it a fantastic game for young children and, well, sore losers, I guess!The only downside I saw right away is the sheer length of levels with no apparent save-point.  This has without doubt already been mentioned several times.  I'm not sure what level my wife was in, but I saw her stay in it for over 2 hours!!  She never even ran out of game-time - she exited the level before the timer (which you're given multiple opportunities to gain more time) ran out.  She's not a die-hard gamer such as myself - after an hour or so she usually gets bored.  I suspect she may never actually finish this game.With a unique twist on a timeless style of video gaming, solid controls and amusing game play, De Blob is sure to be a hit with anyone who has a few hours at a time to \"watch the paint dry.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

After playing pretty much every shooter, adventure, open world, and RPG game out there, they all appeared to be very similar in recent years. LA Noire was a step in a new direction. There is a lot to like about the game. The characters, the stories, the voice acting, the mechanics... everything that's there is top notch. I am about 6 or 7 main crimes into the game but I am now starting to wonder why there isn't much more to do. It's a huge world and it appears lively enough with NPCs running around etc, but besides the occasional call to solve a mini-crime, such as running down a robber or shooting a bad guy - there isn't anything else to do. I still like it, but find myself going back to other games for a bit of action. I applaud the mature nature of the crimes (finally - full nudity, in a tasteful, murderous kind of way) and visual quality of the game world. LA Noire is a good effort. I'd compare it to the first Assassin's Creed - it looked awesome, but it was as repetitive as Tic-Tac-Toe.

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Gift \"Supersonic\"","summary":"Great Game","reviewText":"This Game is to Awesome play this game you are a fan of Anime Disney and Final Fantasy Games as well :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

I basically got my wish in this game. In playing this, I found that it was exactly what i wanted.. pretty good A.I., bodies fly when hit by grenades, good graphics, air craft and ground vehicles... it's fantastic... but there are also some problems; glitches, if you will. For instance, on Dune Sea on Tantooine or maybe the Docks on Kashyyk, you can fly or jump onto the cliff or hut ( depending ont he level ) and you can prone down to be unseen. I found this ' glitch ' awhile ago when I first got the game, but it's not very useful simply because they are not in good positions. Changing that subject on the game, i'll tell you what i think about the A.I. I found that there are times when the A.I. just stands around in a corner and does not move at all ( for whatever reason ) , so to settle that, you could kill him ( on your team or not ) but if he is on your team, you could use one of the commands using the PS2 D-pad, such as ' Follow Me ' or ' Move Out ' . About the levels, there are about 8 or more ( i'm not sure right now ) different planets to play on, and about 16 levels. ( 2 on each planet, if you do the math. ) Just about all the levels are fun and unique in their own way, and you could simply place your character on a roof-top and go into ' first-person ' view, and simply watch the battle. You can also play in Galactic Civil Wars or The Clone Wars, The GCW having the Empire and the Rebels, and TCW having the Clones(Republic) and the CIS(The Evil Dudes). Either way you play, it's fun. ( Although if you are playing the in TCW and you are on the Republic side, you have to play against the Driodekas, which are very hard to exterminate. You would know that if you saw the star wars movies or played this game. ) There is also a few game modes as well, which allow you to play the battles in order, starting from the Episode IV, A New Hope. It even shows movie clips if you play in this mode. Though this is rather fun, there are really no awards except ( for what I find extremely lame for your hard labor playing this game ) concept art. I thought maybe I would be getting a Jedi and would be able to use his light saber. ( Which you can see A.I.ed players using on certain levels. ) But hey, with StarWars Battlefront II coming out, you WILL be able to play as the Jedi! One last thing to say about a flaw in this game; the difficulty levels. Easy is too easy, on Medium most cases you are the only one doing anything, and on Hard.. well.. I can't honestly say I even played this mode yet.. at least that I remember. Anyways on a last note, I got this game the first day of it's release and I do not regret it, this game is well worth your money, but only if you play a few times a day/week.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2005"}

The person that hired them should be sacked. The person that hired the person that hired the box art approval person...you get the point. I mean, it's kind of odd that a game that has been lauded for its adept obfuscation of the monster (thereby preserving the scare-factor beyond the first encounter) should slap a horrid rendering of said monster right on the front cover....What the hell was the artist thinking? Someone hires you to draw something scary and the best you can do is to rip off The Scream by Van Gogh? I digress...For those of you that slogged through the rant above, the good news is that the box art is the worst aspect of this game. If you're familiar with Frictional Studios' previous series, Penumbra, then you'll know what to expect from Amnesia. For the uninitiated, get ready for a truly engrossing survival-horror crafted by a developer who has mastered the genre and done much to drag it out of the depths of gaming limbo where it had been stagnating since the first Resident Evil games.In Amnesia, as the title suggests, you play the role of a protagonist who has lost his memory. You awake in a dark and creepy castle and set about exploring its cold and cavernous chambers, soon discovering a letter from your past self that ominously commands you to kill the castle's owner. Task in hand, you press ever deeper into the keep, typically by solving physics based puzzles such as cranking up an old elevator or draining a flooded passage etc. As in Penumbra, the mundane nature of the tasks is intentional and is meant to contrast the eerie atmosphere and keep the story somewhat grounded in reality; and this is no small feat as the levels get weirder and weirder.It is in the later levels that the true spirit (and power) of this game becomes clear - you see, part of what makes this game so haunting is how it scares you on level deeper than pure visceral shock. Sure, turning a corner to find a jaw-dangling, howling abomination standing there will make you crap your pants, but any horror game or movie can master that maneuver. What's far more difficult is to shock the player on an emotional level, especially  since they know what they're experiencing is just make-believe. Amnesia accomplishes this - the dark descent in the subtitle refers not only to the literal descent into the bowels of the keep, but a metaphorical descent into madness and insanity. You're along for the ride, so to speak, and the latter half of the game takes on a very disturbing and twisted tilt that many people will find genuinely unsettling.Saying too much would spoil the game, but suffice it to say that this is a well-polished gem in the somewhat bare cupboard of the survival-horror genre. So, turn down the lights, turn up the volume on the headphones, and strap on the adult diapers (optional) and get ready to lose yourself, and your mind, on this dark journey into the depths of evil :PHighly recommended","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME8S","description":"Originally released in 1998, the PC version ofHalf-Lifechanged  first-person shooters forever by proving that a compelling story can be told within  the genre. Prior to the game's release, first-person shooters were mindless  action games.Half-Life, while containing its fair share of action, also  contained plenty of exploration, puzzle, and story elements. Now released as a  PlayStation2 game,Half-Lifehas never looked or played better. This  version contains the outstanding single-player story mode, as well as a few new  ones. While the new additions aren't so great, the story mode is one of the best  escapades available on the PS2.The game follows the adventures of Gordon Freeman, a young research associate at  the Black Mesa Federal Research Facility. A typical day at the office goes  completely awry as numerous alien life forms invade the facility. The fate of  the facility, and quite possibly the world, is in the hands of an unlikely hero.The graphics here trump the original's (understandable, as more than three years  have passed). The character models have four times as many polygons, as well as  smoother textures and animations. The sound is also very good, with some of the  funniest voice acting yet heard in a game. Of course, the single-player gameplay  is excellent, thanks to some very well-developed enemy artificial intelligence.Unfortunately, the new modes aren't nearly as brilliant. Decay, the new  cooperative mode, seems like an afterthought and pales in comparison to the  cooperative modes inPerfect DarkandHalo. Deathmatches only  support two players, which is incredibly lame considering many PS2 first-person  shooters support four. Despite these flawed modes, the single-player story is so  superb that it totally warrants a purchase.--Raymond M.

E Jackson","summary":"mediocre","reviewText":"Please hear me out before you say I'm a strange guy for not liking Half-Life.I never actually played the game- I watched my younger cousin play the game.  Watching him play I got the feeling Half-Life is pretty much nothing but running around -VERY quickly- shooting things.  I don't know if maybe my cousin was just really good at the game, or maybe the character is supposed to run around THAT quickly.  Or maybe my cousin DID have it on hyper mode.  Either way, it wasn't that fun to watch because you pretty much ZOOM through doors and hallways.  Maybe it's more fun to PLAY, I don't know.It appeared from watching him play that basically all you do is run around as quickly as you can shooting the small amount of enemies that happen to cross your path while exploring a big, clunky government facility.  There's a bunch of games like that on the first Playstation, or rather, a bunch of games not much different.  Half-Life also has puzzles, but they seemed rather simple to complete.  It's possible the puzzles are more difficult to FIND than to complete seeing as how the game is so HUGE.Watching my cousin dash through what seemed like a countless amount of hallways and doors, I got the impression the game wasn't very interesting.  I'm a video game fan from the Playstation One days, and Half-Life just didn't do much in the way of separating itself from most Playstation games (besides having better graphics and MUCH bigger and longer areas to explore, of course).Actually, I was expecting the graphics in Half-Life to look really good because the Playstation 2 is supposed to be a graphically appealing gem, but the graphics in Half-Life were actually not much of an improvement compared to many Playstation One graphics.  I KNOW the Playstation 2 has better examples of wonderful graphics than in this game; I'm just saying they weren't that good.I don't know.  Don't hate me for not liking it.  I'm sure it's actually a good game and that it's simply a matter of waiting until the day comes when I can appreciate the new style of video games.  As long as storylines are dominating video games, however, it probably won't be anytime soon.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2006"}

The overall idea of different surfaces and different vehicles and taking the right path is pretty different. The levels aren't just a straight linear path like pretty much all other racing games I've played.The Bad: I found the heavier vehicles to be considerably better. The bike and other lightweights are just all over the place. The game's overall design is pretty old school. The different class of vehicles handle drastically different but the vehicles within the class are the same; you are just picking for the looks. Professional reviews say that they love the handling. I did not. I could not get used to the learning curve even after two hours. There are only a few levels. There is no sense of accomplishment like upgrades or anything. This game feels like an arcade game you'd find in a restaurant. Not even a patch for trophies which would provide a little bit of accomplishment.You can pick this game up used for $2 at Gamestop.

Where do I start with this? Well, maybe I should start by criticizing myself. I am a silly, silly person for ever believing that a monopolizing, greedy company that cares about nothing but exclusive licenses could know the first thing about RPGs. Now that I've given myself a firm lecture, I'll start in on this game.I'll begin at the beginning. You are placed in the shoes of an unattractive, personality-less \"ranger\" who you know and care nothing about. A few minutes into the game, he meets a female elf who, far from being awe-inspring and regal, as elves are meant to be, is about as exciting as a limp carrot. They find some sort of flimsy excuse to travel together, and off you go, finding more lifeless tag-along party members along the way. There is absoloutely no pretense of story. And seeing as it doesn't even follow the traditional Lord of the Rings storyline, the feeling that you are in the world of LOTR is just not there.Now that I've gotten past the atrocious characters and story, I'll move on to gameplay. The combat system works, I'll give it that, but seeing as it also worked in the 500 other RPGs it has been used in, this isn't much of an accomplishment. You select attacks from a menu, you watch everyone attack, and then the enemy takes their turn. I now firmly believe that someone must have snuck into the EA offices, taken out their trusty white-out, and wiped the word \"innovation\" from every single dictionary. It's the only possible excuse for such a bland experience.And here we are at yet another failure: The menu system. Seeing as you have to bring up the menu every five seconds to level up, allocate experience points, equip items, watch over-used movie clips, check to see if you have any sidequests (they just show up on the menu, there's no sort of \"you have a new sidequest\" alert) fix the skill tree, and listen to Ian McKellan talk, you'd think that it would at least be fun to navigate. Oh, no. The menu is plain black, with the tiniest, most hard-to-read text ever, and almost no pictures. After awhile, I developed such a severe case of menu-aversion syndrome that I didn't even care about trying on new equipment or leveling up anymore. Seeing as getting loot and upgrading yourself is the heart and soul of an RPG, this is a very, very bad thing.Overall, this game just annoyed me to no end. I sold it two days later, at a loss of $5. And let me tell you, it was the biggest waste of $5 ever in my life.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2005"}

It can be tough at first but gets easier to unlock cars and to do that you have to do well enough to gain enough points that come down to where you place in race. They are not all typical races though. In this game it is set up in episodes and each episode has 5 objectives. The first is the typical race getting across the finish line, another could be passing as many trucks that are dropping exploding barrels to avoid, another for example is trying avoid as many missles from a helicopter, and so on. There are plenty to keep things fresh but you have to do well so you can play the last race in that episode to move on to the next. That is also done by points you gain by placing well.Just racing isn't your typical affair because you will be able to trigger effects when you boost a better by drifting. These effects change up the environment that you can use to make cars in front of you wreck. Some of these effects can simply be a helicopter dropping a barrel to explode to huge effects that can alter the whole course, and even take shortcuts. It is really cool using the environment to take out 4 vehicles at one time.The graphics in the game are good and the controls are precise. I give a lot of credit to its cool presentation. The menu system is very slick. The online play is good by the use of environmental effects. I can recommend this game easily since its not your usual racer. Now don't expect licensed vehicles in the game. The crashes though are impressive. The music is finally done.

Also the setting of New Marais is much more interesting than grey Empire city.

Predator, you know how the &quot;save game&quot; feature worked.  You might also know that a patch was eventually released to allow you to save &quot;anywhere&quot; in the game.I'm going out on a limb here, but I'm going to guess the &quot;save game&quot; feature in XIII was designed to work on 3 platforms (PS2, XBox, and PC).  Without having to write additional code, the game could be released on all three platforms at about the same time.  For those of you who gave this game a poor review based on the lack of a good &quot;save game&quot; feature, take it a step further and complain to Ubisoft.  They just might be nice enough to release a patch for us PC users.As far as the rest of the game goes... very fun.  The voice-overs are so-so (General Carrington is voiced by 60's TV's Batman - Adam West).  The sound is good, and the graphics are a nice change.  If you've seen the movie Bourne Identity, you get the idea of the game.I got the game as a gift and really enjoyed it.  When it goes on sale for less than $40, I'd highly recommend it to anyone - especially those that thought they'd be playing the legal version of Half-Life 2 right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2003"}

I liked the weapons selection - especially the crossbow. What I detested, however, was the incredibly stupid save game feature. I guess the programmers at Ubisoft created this almost useless system so that this short game would seem to last longer. Why else would it limit you to saving only at game chapter points?Despite this annoying problem, I am still giving this game a mostly positive review since I did enjoy playing it; and I really liked the &quot;fireworks&quot; scene at the end - truly awesome graphics..","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00008Z0HX","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"&quot;XIII&quot;","reviewText":"First person shooters are a dime a dozen, and more often than not any one plays much like another. Games in this genre are only rarely groundbreaking. \"XIII\" does not buck this trend, but it does provide a visual style that is undeniably unique. The game, which is based on a popular French comic book, wisely decides to embrace its origins. From the cel-shaded visuals to the comic-like cinematics, \"XIII\" definitely differentiates itself in the visual department. In the realm of gameplay, however, it's rather standard fare.You step into the boots of number XIII, an amnesiac who washes up half-dead on a beach. From there, it's up to you to piece the plot together as you work your way through the game. Because it's a conspiracy theory, it gradually becomes more and more clear what is supposedly going on around you, and of course there are some twists on what you initially perceive. Even so, the story is a little thin, and it's ultimately pretty disappointing. The presentation, on the other hand, is remarkable in some ways. For instance, you will occasionally experience interactive flashbacks. These black-and-white storytelling segments are seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, and really pack a nice cinematic punch. The cel-shaded graphics, speech bubbles, and picture-in-picture windows certainly add the right comic book flavor to the proceedings, but the game's irritating soundtrack and sloppy voice work do hamper the overall presentation. Yes, David Duchovny is on hand to voice XIII, but the character has so little to say that the actor is painfully underused. The rest of the game's acting is too over-the-top, even when the style of the game is considered.One thing \"XIII\" has is style. The graphical approach of the game truly sets it apart, and despite some minor problems you won't find yourself mistaking it for anything else on the market. It's a slick design, though I think at times the level engineers and texture artists used the cel-shaded graphics to promote a touch of laziness. Even when the visuals are at their worst, though, you will never feel ripped from the comic-inspired universe, which is superbly consistent.The game generally relies on a shoot-anything-that-moves philosophy, and the action is decent enough. It's nothing to write home about per se, but it works. Strangely, the game's best weapons aren't available save in a few select levels (most of which rely on a more stealthy approach). The sniper crossbow is hugely gratifying, and well-placed throwing knives can elicit some glee as well. A harpoon gun makes a cool appearance in just ONE of the game's levels, and the rest of your arsenal is entirely unremarkable. Cue the usual suspects: pistol, uzi (called a \"minigun\" here, for some reason), rocket launcher, shotgun, et cetera, et cetera. These more conventional weapons provide unsurprisingly conventional action, and don't quite pack the punch that they should. It's easy to shoot an enemy in the head several times before he drops to the ground and dies.In terms of level design, \"XIII\" is far from brilliant. The very linearity of the levels can be distressing at times, and often you'll feel like you're playing a \"rail shooter\" simply because you're being shoved by the game's designers in one given direction without any opportunity to stray or any incentive to explore. On the plus side, it's very straightforward, so you'll never get lost or reach an impasse. Outdoor levels are probably the coolest in \"XIII,\" and pack the strongest visual punch. Indoor locales are clich&eacute;d and considerably less impressive. Note to game designers working on a first person shooter: hold the factory levels filled with wooden crates, as we gamers do not want them! Thanks.\"XIII\" employs a practically unforgivable save game system. Though it appears as though you can save your game at any given time (as we PC gamers expect), it's nothing but an illusion. Loading said saved games takes you right back to the beginning of the level, no matter where you last saved. Worse, the game has no autosave feature, which might spell trouble for less paranoid first person shootists. These faults make \"XIII\" needlessly frustrating at times - particularly in stealth missions, which will ultimately require some trial and error since you can't experiment freely without risk of dying, getting caught, and ultimately starting the level from the beginning. I assume this problem stems from the game's multi-platform release, but it's just unacceptable.\"XIII\" is not a long game either, and experienced gamers will probably breeze through it. Given the game's linear nature, there's little replay value to be had. Despite some serious flaws, though, \"XIII\" is a good game, atmospheric enough that, cosmetically at least, it stands out from the pack. It might be wise to let it go down in price a little before picking up a copy, but most shooter fans will find something to enjoy here provided they don't enter into the experience with inflated expectations.Final Score: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Robert evans","summary":"The Rebirth of a new Nightmare....","reviewText":"Resident Evil the Remake is easily one of the best looking Games to ever be created to a console system.

I had originally started this series with RE 2, and decided to back track to the first one for the sake of finding out who Chris was, and why Claire was looking for him. However the horrid control, horrid graphics were bearable, but the lousy voice acting was not. I couldn't stand it because here was a great classic B-Movie story (and I love B-movies) with F-Movie acting. Everything about this game became cheesy. I then bought the director's cut hoping for better voice acting... well at least I got my wish a couple weeks ago. I then bought the dual shock edition.... yeah, I'm kind of bitter, but I won't hold a grudge because Capcom and Nintendo provided me with what I wanted recently. But this game could have been better, even for the time it was released; at least the voice acting could have been better. Now that the remake is available with all the good things about the original intact, plus some fiercely improved graphics, sound and dialogue (although I miss the &quot;Master of Unlocking&quot; line) there is no need to bother with this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2002"}

We had stages that we were able to help a 4 yr old through but mainly the adults were playing and LOVING this game.Personally, I found the rock band portion of the new game more fun than the dancing one on the other game because the controls are less likely to give you a \"hit\" when you didn't actually move as the first game did (this wasn't just me other players said the same thing) but I wasn't as sure about the new shooting portion.

The game also was known for having quite the difficulty level. It was frustrating to the point where it was still enjoyable but the level of skill needed to get through the game with flying colors wasn't exactly low.Rayman Legends feels every bit as exciting and magical as that first ever Rayman title, right down to the downright difficult levels and wonderful art styles and overall playfulness. There are a bunch of characters you can unlock which all do pretty much the same thing as Rayman himself. There are a ton of levels to master and quite frankly, there is quite a bit to see and do not just offline but online as well. The daily challenge modes that are available are pretty addictive and keep you coming back for more. There are also several multiplayer modes that you can play online or locally, which is a big plus.I can completely recommend this game for multiple reasons but I think the main one would be that Rayman Legends proves that the side scrolling platformer is not dead and is still indeed very much alive.

My 360 died and I recently picked up a new one - it's designed like the XBox One and runs very quiet, but I've been having issues with this game on there - video glitches and wait glitches.  Now, I didn't apply the update - because as we all know, doing that wipes out a lot of the cool cheats / workarounds!  I hate worrying about gold!  I just WANT it!  Anyhow - I digress.  This game is so excellent, it's hard to imagine it being better.  The graphics are astounding, the load times are nothing - especially when compared to Oblivion (maybe it's my new 360?) and it's just SO much fun!  I'm having so much fun doing the side quests that I don't even care about the main one.  Exploring, looting, etc- it's just so fun!  It can get a little tedious at times, like when I try to do one thing (get at a particular witch, for example) but just get killed over and over.  Or if I mistakenly steal something.

Be warned however that the video makes it sound like Free Roam is the next great innovation in multiplayer and while I do think it's a nice step it's nothing more than a glorified lobby.  You can shoot npcs, animals and each other. Outside of that there is NONE of the minigames familiar to both Saints Row and GTA games. (ie. Bank Robbery, Horse Races, Duels, Poker)The video advertisements on this item makes it sound like you're free to do whatever you want in Free Roam with the exception of the main quest, which just isn't true.  Sure your free to walk around and shoot or be shot by anyone, but you cannot do any of the side activities from Single Player or any missions.  I bought the game expecting to play a lot of COOP Free Roam with my buddies.  We all had a blast with Saints Row 2 coop and got the impression Free Roam would blow that away.  Rockstar has said they are adding a free Coop Pack in June and a couple additional DLCs this summer, so keep your eyes on that.Now don't get me wrong, if your into Single Player games and Sandbox Single Player games, this game rocks. It's gorgeous, has a HUGE area to explore and lots of activities that will steal a minimum of 40-50 hours and more likely 100s of hours from your life. I'll be playing a lot of SP!Simply put if you want a great Single Player experience or are interested in Deathmatch Multiplayer, then this game is a definite pickup. If your looking for coop game play, keep your eyes open later this summer before purchasing. It just doesn't do justice to those of us who prefer playing with our friend over killing them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

GOODWIN \"dragon678\"","summary":"A cool game!","reviewText":"I really like this game alot, but unfortunately, the AI still lacks in singleplayer mode. Adn usually, if you don't do most of the killing, you lose. But it is still fun and very intense and you get to play both sides. It takes a little while to beat the singleplayer game. The multiplayer game is also very cool. Your basically playing the same maps as in singleplayer. But there are a few annoying things. Like when you are the allies trying to land on the beach, you can control the battleship and shoot the big guns that are on the battleship. Ths problem is you always have someone who wants to drive the battleship around and then you have alot farther to go to land on the beach. Or someone always shooting those guns and when they do that, they typically blow up their own teamates more than enemy. Another thing thats annoying is the vehicle situation. I have a cable modem, but I always seem to have to wait at the beginning of every map to respawn. By then, all of the vehicles are gone. That gets annoying since all anyone does is drive around in the vehicles all of the time. There aren't alot of battles involving man against man. The last thing that bothers me is all of the patches you have download. In the 2 months I have had this game, I have had to download 2 patches just to play on line. One day, I it kept asking me if wanted to update, so I said yes and it froze my computer twice. After downloading patch off the internet, I could play on-line again, but about 3 weeks later, I coudln't get on and had to download another patch. But overall, this game is fun to play once you get in get to play. There are alot of other vehicles you can us like jeeps, tanks, and airplanes (though I cant get the hang of airplanes). I really did like this (despite some complaints I said here) and both the singleplayer and multiplayer are cool. Not the best FPS ever, but definitley a good one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2002"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A fun puzzle blast","reviewText":"A game that has Steven Spielberg's name attached to it in some way, shape, or form deserves some sort of attention, and EA's Boom Blox for the Wii is that such game.  A fun, slightly inventive puzzle blast; Boom Blox finds you disassembling, destroying, or just playing around with a series of Jenga-esque blocks.  What really makes Boom Blox stand out from the pack though is that the game makes excellent use of the Wii-mote, and as a multiplayer party game, Boom Blox truly shines above all others.  If there are any downsides to Boom Blox, it's that the game's story (or lack there of) is more of a distraction than anything else.  Along with some moments of repetitiveness, the good outweighs the bad quite a bit: there are a heaping amount of inventive puzzles, and the game's level editor is simply spectacular.  All in all, Boom Blox is an inventive, fun, and pretty addictive puzzle blast that doesn't disappoint; and for puzzle lovers and party-game lovers alike, the game is an essential addition to your Wii library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew R. Sullivan \"cupsncakes\"","summary":"a B Movie","reviewText":"In my opinion, all the pieces of a great game are present here- inventory, levels, perks, weapons, magic, crafting and open world adventure, but they don't seem to fit together in a cohesive way, as say, in Dark Souls, Skyrim, Fallout, etc.  I never felt as if I had complete understanding of all the strange little aspects of the game.  \"I'm a soldier but I can only use certain swords? And no bow?\"  Where can I learn magic spells?  I'm warned about the dangers of going out at night, but what time is it?  Is there any way to tell?  And why do I die when I touch the water- even a small stream?  I like picking through my inventory but I've accumulated literally HUNDREDS of items that take me forever to go through, try to combine with other things, etc.  It's fun but takes forever, and takes away from the active exploring/questing.  Wandering around in the \"open world\" is fine by me, but all I found out there were lots of rock barriers, cliffs (not very \"open\" world at all) and bandits and creatures to fight.  I want more from exploring the \"open world\" than fights and feeling penned in by cliffs and rock walls.  The battles are epic, sure, but there's nothing skillful about it.  Hack n slash until your hands are numb.  The game really has its moments of greatness (eg catacombs, etc.)and I really gave this game the benefit of the doubt for a while, but it didn't seem to grab me like so many similar games have.  In my opinion, overall this is not \"GREAT\" game and we shouldn't lower our standards of what a great game truly is.  Dragon's Dogma is having its fifteen minutes of fame because it is available now when not much else is out there- that's why I played it anway, and it's ok at best.

K. Malone","summary":"You look like you need a pork bun. I have strong, strong bird!","reviewText":"I am admittedly a GTA fanboy. I play a lot of sandbox games, and I often enjoy them... but usually with the caveat \"It's nowhere near as good as GTA, but it's still pretty good.\"Well, Sleeping Dogs *is* nearly as good as GTA and that's saying a lot coming from me. Personally I think it's more similar to GTA IV than any other game. To many, that's an insult. From me, it's very high praise. The only real flaw I see here is that the driving is a tad wonky, with twitchy steering control. It takes a lot of getting used to. (So did GTA IV's driving, but once I was used to it I thought it was arguably the best driving control and physics outside of a few dedicated racing games. I don't see that happening here.) The fact that there's no option to switch to a first person or on-the-hood camera is an unforgivable sin. I can understand why they don't do that in Saints Row, but there's nothing stopping them from implementing it here. All of the driving mechanics would still work perfectly well, including the \"Action Hijack\" feature where you jump from your car to another. That's what the green arrow icon is for, after all. In the final analysis, this is the closest thing to a \"major flaw\" I can think of. It doesn't really make a dent in the overall awesomeness of the game. The relatively small city and lack of flying vehicles are non-issues.The combat is more focused on hand to hand than gunplay. As I'm sure many others have said, it's pretty similar to the Arkham games. Another good comparison would be Assassin's Creed, which also emphasizes/rewards countering incoming attacks rather than simply attacking on your own.The icing on the cake is the dialogue. The voice acting in general is surprisingly good. A lot of random dialogue is surprisingly hilarious. The kung fu instructor is a particular favorite, e.g. while you're hard at work traiing against a bunch of his students, he suggests that you previously studied martial arts at \"the School of Never Winning\" and that you worship \"the God of Weakness\".All of that said, while I still wouldn't call these \"major\" flaws there are a couple of things that do annoy me a little:* Disappearing weapons- In this game, weapons are basically treated as temporary power ups. Melee weapons break after you use them too much, I'm fine with that. But guns just mysteriously disappear from your inventory for no apparent reason. I get what the developer was trying to do, i.e. keep the focus on martial arts hand-to-hand combat. But artificially limiting what the player can do is anathema to the whole sandbox game play philosophy. It's about letting the player do what they want to do at all times. I can honestly say that I probably would have kept my weapon holstered and used martial arts for most of the combat, because the game has a robust combat system that's fun and satisfying. They should have trusted in that. It's just annoying that my weapons kept magically evaporating into thin air between missions. Breaks the immersion.* Another immersion breaking problem I had was too much \"warping\" around the world. i.e. A cutscene plays out with dialogue which indicates where to go to begin a mission, the screen fades to black, and then suddenly I find myself halfway across the city, at the location. No, no, no. Just tell me where to go and then let me get there on my own. This is basic sandbox game design, guys.Bottom line is that you get a nice decent sized city to mess around in, the missions are engaging with good variety (aside from standard combat \"go to location X and kill person Y\"  there's hacking cameras, tracing cell phone calls, unscrewing air vent covers, planting bugs, etc.) the side activities are plentiful and fun, everything looks great, they did a good job on the music... it's just an excellent high quality package in general.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2012"}

On several occasions I found myself looking at the detail of the sets and not fighting.However, once you've gotten past the eye candy you'll find there isn't too much there.  Playing through the story mode is somewhat interesting since you learn a bit about each of the characters and get to see some cut scenes, but story mode is much too short (in terms of the number of fights) and the stories are laughable at best.This game is worth having around to play against other people, as it is the only way it provides lasting entertainment.

Conard \"ExtremeAvalanche\"","summary":"Will Satisfy You Until The Next Metal Gear Solid Game!","reviewText":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a wonderful addition to the Tom Clancy games. I like Splinter Cell much better than the Ghost Recon games, and the game is better than most tactical shooters. In fact, it would really be hard to call this game a shooter at all. You really don't get very many bullets in the game, and weapon use comes second to stealth tactics. Also, killing an enemy may result in an alarm being triggered if someone is nearby. I many levels, only one alarm that is set off could mean mission over. The max amount of alarms that you could have in a level was three. Howeverm if you are careful, the alarms aren't that big of a deal. You should note that this is no Red Faction II or even MGS2. Splinter Cell is 90% stealth! You must stay in the shadows and avoid enemies. The best way to dispose of troops is hiding, then they turn their back, and then you can(fairly easily)sneak up on them. It's quiet and efficient. Also, you must hide bodies to avoid being caught. Even James Bond kills a thousand times more people than Sam Fisher. The graphics aren't as good on the PS2 as they are on X-Box, but they are still great! The sound is very good too, with humorous enemy chatter and good music and sound effects. The biggest drag to Splinter Cell is that the first time through, the game is exhilerating, the second time, it's pretty predictable, and then after that, it will most likely sit on your shelf for awhile. Please don't buy Splinter Cell if you hate sneaking around and not firing a lot of bullets. If you are a Timesplitters 2 fanatic, you might want to think beforebuying this game. Now, I love both combat games and espionage types, so I loved Splinter Cell. And this game is great relief for MGS fans until MGS3:Snake Eater is releasd next year.

Because of this, I can't exactly hop on or off the \"new Dante\" bandwagon that seems to be one of the core topics of discussion surrounding this release (although for the record I'd say Dante looks equally badass in both forms); what I can say is that DMC is a damn good game, offering some seriously stylish, fluid gameplay, gorgeous graphics and an unexpectedly compelling storyline. If you're a fan of hack & slash combo-based action games, you'll want to check this one out.The story begins with the introduction of Dante, a debaucherous yet (mostly) well-intentioned young man who just so happens to be half demon and half angel (a \"Nephilim\"). Given that he has no recollection of his presumably deceased parents, he understands little of his past or his superhuman abilities. The world he lives in is overrun by demons, whom manipulate and control the inhabitants via a series of underground mass conspiracies, disguising themselves as politicians, pop stars, businessmen, and other people of power. For reasons he doesn't initially completely understand, the demons continually pull Dante into Limbo, a dimensional rift somewhere in between the real world and Hell. While he's trapped in this netherworld, he is vulnerable to the demons in their true forms and their vicious attacks. The demons are intent on hunting down and killing Dante, which we quickly learn is because only Nephilim are granted the power to defeat Mundus, the Demon King. In the game's earliest cutscenes, Dante meets Kat, a mysterious young woman who is strangely able to see and communicate with him from the real world while he's in Limbo. She is a medium, and eventually explains to him that she is part of a secret organization (known only as The Order) intent on taking down the demons and their grip over the world. She takes him to meet Vergil, who currently leads The Order and reveals that he is Dante's twin brother and also a Nephilim himself. Although Dante is hesitant to team up with these mysterious individuals, he comes to realize that their help might be his best bet in taking down the demon overlord (whom he quickly learns is responsible for more evil-much of which has personally affected Dante-than ever possibly imagined).The impression I've been given is that most previous Devil May Cry titles don't rely much on storylines, and that this game's take on Dante's past and the story that drives his ambition is a bit of a \"Dark Knight\"-ish turn in that it's darker and moodier than those that came before it. Still, you can expect very healthy doses of trademark camp and trashiness, since certainly not every cutscene begs to be taken seriously (this is a definite after-the-kiddies-have-gone-to-bed kinda game), and Dante is still a swaggering badass above all else. The storyline is gripping and unique (albeit occasionally predictable), but the central focus here is the gameplay, which is thankfully also extremely well-executed.You'll play as Dante throughout the entire campaign, and he has a vast arsenal of weaponry at his disposal which expands as the game goes on. He still has his iconic sword Rebellion and twin pistols Ebony & Ivory handy, but this time around there are some nifty new toys to play with; these come primarily in the form of angel and demon-based weapons, respectively; generally speaking, the demonic weapons are slow but powerful and excel at dealing heavy damage in single blows, while the angelic weapons are weaker but ideal in the fray for slicing up large groups of enemies with swift, successive attacks. From sleek scythes to ninja stars to brawler gloves, there are a variety of weapon classes to choose from. But one of DMC's greatest assets is that you don't actually have to manually \"choose\" between weapons at intervals-you can quickly swap between them at will, incorporating several-or even all of them-into single combos.This is thanks primarily to an elegant, intuitive combat system in which the core diamond configuration face buttons represent basic and advanced attacks, while holding different triggers (L or R buttons, depending on whether you're playing the PS3 or Xbox version) or tapping the D-Pad immediately switches out your weaponry (even if you're already in mid-combat). One of the greatest mechanics is the introduction of the grappling hooks, which allow for ever-ongoing combos by ensuring you never lose track of your enemy even when they're knocked away or grounded. The demonic grappler brings nearby enemies right to where you're standing (or floating midair), while the angelic grappler brings you to them (useful when you need to escape incoming ground-bound hordes to work on an airborne foe). This means you can bring a foe in for a Rebellion slash, launch them into the air with Arbiter (demonic scythe), pull them right back down with your demon grappler and follow up with an Eryx (melee gauntlets) combo, all without ever pausing for a slow, manual weapon reselect. The battle mechanics are so fluid and refined that you'll feel at ease in all this mayhem, not because it's simplistic but because it just feels so right and free of clunky combo interruption or the need to reposition.If any of this makes the mistake of insinuating that DMC is easy or lacking challenge, it's certainly not-but it boasts something that too many games are lacking nowadays-a consistent fairness throughout. Capcom and Ninja Theory made the highly intelligent decision of ensuring that all enemies indicate when they're about to attack-whether it's a flash of light, a sweeping movement or a noticeable reach for their weapon, you'll have just enough time to react to oncoming attacks. This certainly doesn't make things easy, it just makes them fair-don't expect foes to be slow and predictable, just expect that you won't have to worry about sudden, random deaths from impossible-to-anticipate attacks. Additionally, once opponents are off-camera, their aggression will be substantially lessened until they're within the player's view again-this was another very wise choice on the developers' parts, because I think I speak for every rational person when I say finishing blows from enemies you literally can't see coming are infuriating. Keep in mind, however, that they'll get right back on your tail the second you regain view of them, which will surely still keep you on your toes. These noticeable efforts to even the odds make the game almost entirely void of cheap AI ridiculousness; in other words, when you die (granted, you will) you won't be cursing the game, you'll be cursing your own legitimate mistakes.If the basic challenges aren't enough for series veterans, worry not, the demonic onslaught can still be amped to insane new levels. Three different difficulty modes are available from the start of the game, and you'll be able to unlock even more from there-you can go the \"Human\" (easy) route if you're in the mood for a breezy cakewalk with more of a focus on the storyline, \"Hell And Hell\" (in which one hit finishes you off) if you're a real daredevil, or the infamous \"Dante Must Die!\" (the highest difficulty) mode if you're supremely confident in your demon slicing abilities. Each mode offers different challenges, but generally speaking as the difficulty level increases, you can expect opponents to appear in (sometimes vastly) larger numbers, have more health, deal more damage, and attack with greater aggression. The game's well-designed fairness means that you won't have to be a superhuman for peak difficulties, you'll just have to have some serious skill.The somewhat addictive style points system also makes its return, essentially making assessments of your performance in each mission. You earn more points for longer, stylish combos using multiple weapons and finishing missions quickly, and will earn less if the same attacks are spammed in succession, if you use items or if you die. This of course ultimately adds up to your overall score, and you'll be able to upload your best times and style rankings to national leaderboards to see how you measure up to the best of the best. This is nice encouragement to switch up your combos and replay certain missions, given that it also ties into earning trophies and other achievements; other unlockable goodies include different skins and costumes for Dante and his weapons.As with most every other object of entertainment in existence, DMC certainly isn't perfect; as fluid as the combat is, one of the most noticeable setbacks is that there is unfortunately no manual lock-on, meaning selecting specific enemies to attack can be very tricky and sometimes you'll flat out end up grappling an enemy you weren't intending to. Additionally, although the game's camera usually does a decent job of keeping track of you (and your foes), it doesn't always work in your favor and you will occasionally be faced with oddball close-ups or facing the wrong direction. The aforementioned reduction of off-camera enemy aggression does a great job of cushioning this blow in most circumstances, but wonky camera adjustment isn't something anyone wants to focus on in fast-paced action games. As much uniqueness as DMC has to offer, some of its boss fights feel a bit by-the-numbers, particularly as the game goes on; a wildly designed, enthrallingly paced battle (epic and arguably the game's best) is followed by one that is dull and inane in comparison; I would have hoped for DMC's boss fights to get increasingly grandiose and spectacular as the game progressed, but this wasn't quite the case. As with most hack & slash games, DMC's main campaign isn't spectacularly long (shouldn't take most players more than 10 hours or so), but wanting more is among the greatest paradoxes from a critic's standpoint of positive vs. negative.These complaints are nominal in comparison to what DMC brings to the table: an intuitive, stylish, and seriously addictive combat system, a solid and refined reboot of the series storyline and characters, and intoxicating visuals. The game offers all the style, sexiness, elegance and edginess its characters represent; rarely is this genre this well-executed. DMC pulls you into its world not unlike the demons continually pull Dante into Limbo; the difference is at its best, you'll be enraptured and begging for more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2013"}

The main new feature is that, when the buttons are pushed, the controller can register how much pressure is being exerted. This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

So, it comes as no surprise that Sony brings it to the Playstion Portable. Just how does it stand up to the console editions?? Does it matter that it was developed by a different developer? Well, I'm going to answer those questions for you. First of all, it doesn't matter a bit that it was developed by a different developer. Which in this case was High Impact Games. If you were unaware that it was made by a different one, you wouldn't have figured it was made by anyone else other than Insomniac. Anything that Insomniac was able to achieve graphically and gameplaywise on the PS2, High Impact was able to achieve on the PSP. To me, that's pretty impressive. The designs of the levels, although abit smaller, are as excellent as they are on the PS2 and the story has so many twists and turns that you'll keep playing just to see how things end. Even the control, which relied so heavily on the second analog stick on the PS2, has been worked out to accompany the PSP without things feeling out of place. In my opinion, it holds up quite well to the console editions & is a worthy installment to the ongoing series. To sum it all up in one sentence, I'm amazed. Games like Size Matters is just what we need on the PSP.Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters leaves me hopeful that Sony will bring its' other successful platformer, Sly Cooper(which is another one of my favorites), over to the PSP. Or, at the very least, continue this one on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2007"}

You will definitely get your money's worth with this game. You can probably put in over a 100 hours of gameplay if you want to.

Rhodes","summary":"Final Fantasy IV, One of the Finest Fantasies ever!","reviewText":"While the more recent Final Fantasy games stick out in peoples mind, those who have been gaming for a long time will, no doubt, praise Final Fantasy IV as being the Final Fantasy that made the series what it is!  Originally, it was released as Final Fantasy II in the United States in 1991.  It later had another release on the Playstation in Final Fantasy Chronicles in 2001.  Final Fantasy IV truly does define what Fantasy is, and it's nice to see that after fifteen years, the game is still a blast.Cecil, a dark knight, is the leader of Castle Baron's airship fleet.  As Castle Baron's motives become more warlike and disturbingly unjust, Cecil begins to question his morals.  And when he brings about question to the King, he is stripped of his rank, and is ordered to deliver a package to a nearby village.  Cecil doesn't suspect that what's happening to the kingdom could be real.  He soon sets out to conquer whatever evil it is that has taken over his kingdom, as well as pursuing a more justified course in his life by ultimately giving up being the dark knight.The story is a classic in the RPG world, said to be one of the best.  It's full of memorable characters, and was the first Final Fantasy to incorporate a love story.Aside from the story, the most memorable thing about Final Fantasy IV were the characters, bringing about some of the most well developed characters that had more than just a name, but a story of their own.  The story is told in text on the screen just like any RPG.  It has been updated from the original release of Final Fantasy II on the Super Nintendo.  The text, for example, is more legible, and it is also a little bigger.  This is perfect for the Gameboy Advance.  Some backgrounds are also redrawn and made bigger for the GBA.Those who played the original Final Fantasy II on the SNES will also notice changes in the battle system.  Each character, for example, has a special attack.  Cecil, for example, has the \"Dark\" technique which is fairly powerful.  If you played Final Fantasy IV in the Final Fantasy Chronicles package, this is no surprise to you at all.Final Fantasy IV was the first RPG to use the Active Time Battle System (ATB).  When entering battle, all your characters have a gauge displayed below them.  When it's full, they get to select a command and attack.  The difference between this battle system and the original turn based is that your enemies can attack as you're selecting a command.  This adds new challenge to the game, and Final Fantasy IV takes advantage of it by being one of the hardest RPGs you'll ever play.  Battles do, however, come to a swift conclusion, despite how challening they are.If you're new to the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy IV is not the first game you should play.  Likewise, if you didn't play the Final Fantasy Chronicles version of Final Fantasy IV, you'll also find the game a little too challenging at first glance.  This is simply because in Japan Final Fantasy IV had two versions.  Easy Type and Hard Type.  Easy Type was sent to the states as Final Fantasy II in 1991, and Hard Type was sent to the states as Final Fantasy IV in 2001 with the Final Fantasy Chronicles package.  Easily enough, those who started with Final Fantasy VII will be amazed at how quickly Final Fantasy IV escalades into being what is widely considered one of the hardest RPGs ever made.Graphically, Final Fantasy IV is right on par with GBA graphics.  They look a lot better than they did on the SNES and the PSX.  Places look a lot smoother, the backgrounds in combat are also incredible to look at.  The enemies are about the same however, meaning they don't move, but rather flash when they do something.  Despite that, the graphics are a fine update.Where Final Fantasy IV truly shines is the music score.  Branded as one of the best in the series, the music clearly captures the dramatic sequecences.  Each character also has his or her own theme (a staple that would go into later Final Fantasy games as well).  Final Fantasy IV has a captivating music score that any gamer will love.It's nice to see Final Fantasy IV on the GBA, but the question has to be, why so long for the wait?  The GBA isn't dead, but it certainly isn't lively anymore. It is better than waiting for a revamp on the Nintendo DS, though.  Fans old and new alike will enjoy Final Fantasy IV on its new home.The Good+Classic RPG+Compelling story+Loveable characters+Fantastic music score+Good graphicsThe Bad-It's short.  Ranging from 15-25 hours-The game, for some gamers, will be overly difficult","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2005"}

Use your car as a weapon and battle your way to the front of the pack -- by taking down rivals and instigating spectacular crashes.","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"Destroys the Racing Barrier","reviewText":"An email I wrote in December 2003:\"Dear Criterion Games:I hear that Burnout 3 is going to focus on wrecking opponents.  This is a mistake. It's not going to work.  Why turn your brilliant, traffic-weaving Burnout franchise into a demolition derby?  Change is good, but this is too much - it's now a fighting game with cars instead of a racing game.  Hopefully Burnout 4 will get it right.Regards, A Fan\"Fast-forward to September 2004.  Burnout 3 is now here, and I am now sending them my sincerest apologies.  I now invite them to send me a very nasty \"We told you so!\" response, because they've managed to not only prove me to be completely and utterly foolish for doubting them, they've made what is hands-down the best arcade racing game we're likely to play.Criterion has managed to tap into some kind of suicidal primal instinct all of us seem to have - the urge to fly through populated streets at near the speed of sound in a sleek automobile (or firetruck), careening headlong into anyone and anything in our path.  Better yet, Burnout 3: Takedown now adds the lovely feature of a dream made virtual reality: smashing into pieces that no-good idiot who dared to try and tap you into the guardrail.  We've all had those fantasies, right?  Now you can live em in the comfort (and safety!) of your own living room.For those of you who are skeptical, one thing should be made clear up front:  Burnout 3 is very different from the first two games in the series.  You'll still race through beautifully rendered courses at brain-searing speeds, missing traffic by millimeters.  But even though B3 now focuses on making your race opponents wreck in the most ghastly ways possible, the intensity and rush is still here...no, it's actually been ratcheted up to a realm of insanity no racer has ever attained.  It's different, but still more than worthy of attention.One thing Burnout vets will appreciate is the single-player mode has been greatly expanded.  There are a huge number of race events - close to two hundred, ranging from single races to burning laps to eliminations to crash junctions to....well, it doesn't get old.  Add a ridiculous number of unlockables (including fake headlines, signature Takedowns, forty tracks, seventy cars, etc etc) and suffice to say you could finish the first two Burnout games twice each before seeing all B3 has to offer.  You still progress by earning medals - only getting golds will unlock everything - but it's no longer just about finishing first.  Peforming Takedowns is essential, and well-worth it, as the game lovingly displays the mechanical carnage you create, but it's not always easy.  The AI is wicked this time round, and will even gain grudges for you......and go after you.  If you do fall victim, you can always choose to enable the Aftertouch, a brilliant feature that allows you to control your wrecked car, and steer it into the path of your opponents.  Revenge has never been so sweet.Screaming down a Hong Kong-ish crowded street, golden Buddha statue looming overhead, desperately trying to keep your lead when two guys in F1-type racers are inches from your rear bumper.....yeah, it's exhilirating all right.Crash Mode returns in all its destructive glory, but now it's deeper, and larger.  Power-ups litter the course - yes power-ups, ranging from temporary boosts to points multipliers.  Add the Crashbreaker - in which your car becomes a literal bomb that you can detonate at any time, and we're talking serious mayhem.  And oh yes - this mode can be played co-operatively now.  One more thing - there's 100 crash junctions now.The multiplayer madness continues with Road Rage Mode (whoever takes down the most opponents wins), Elimination (whoever's in last place at the end of a lap is disqualified), Burning Lap (boost as fast as you can without crashing once), and normal Single Race, and there's a lot more meat here than before.The bad?  Well, the default soundtrack can leave a lot to be desired (and turn the announcer OFF, trust me), but this is easily fixed by lovely custom soundtrack support.  HINT:  Causing wrecks to bluegrass is poetry in motion.  EA Games - who now owns Criterion - has plastered advertising signboards all over the courses, and they're kind of distracting in an annoying way.  There are also many minor details (you race in car classes now rather than picking any you want, the scoring system is different, no nighttime races or weather changes, no licensed cars (like any respected auto manufacturer would let their lovingly crafted creations get dismantled like this!), Crash Mode repeats junctions) that one could complain about, but the core gameplay is so sublime, well-done, and addictive, it's silly to dock the score for any of them.Burnout 3 is the epitome of what arcade racing should be: easy to pick up, hard to master, appealing to everyone, unimaginably intense, and unbelievably fun.  Mark my words, you're gonna see Burnout 3 on a lot of Best Games of 2004 lists -- it'll be on mine, without a doubt.Thanks for proving me wrong, Criterion.  But I need to ask - what's next?  You can't possibly top Takedown....can you?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2004"}

But you can say that every once in awhile for any FPS.  Where Killzone excels is that it gets every area so right.  Rather than create something new and unique, the makers of Killzone 2 stood on the shoulders of those that came before and created a game that looks and plays great.  While this won't win over and non-FPS fans, it will please anyone looking for a good shooter on the PS3.

{"product_name":"B0007P8FN2","description":"In the ancient, mysterious world of the Jade Empire, you train under your master's watchful eye and learn powerful martial arts and mystical powers. When danger threatens, you travel across the world, from the harsh mountains of the Land of Howling Spirits to the lush gardens of the Imperial City. In your adventures you face powerful human and supernatural foes, learn exotic and magical martial arts, and discover the darkest secrets of the world. Only by mastering the greatest fighting styles and defeating the most powerful enemies will you earn your place as a master of martial arts in the world of Jade Empire.Features:Epic story set in a world inspired by the myths and legends of ancient China. Jade Empire immerses you in a deep, rich storyline in the tradition of the BioWare-developedStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.Sinister events upset the peaceful harmony of an isolated martial arts school and draw you into a story that unfolds with drama, action, and adventure. Detailed followers and other non-player characters enrich the adventure by providing comic relief, rivalries, flirtations, and hostility. Stare in awe at the sweeping views of the lush environments, sheer vertical drops, and overpowering scale that provide the visual backdrop to the story. Confront wild outlaws, evil magicians, demonic incarnations, and other foul villains that protect the Jade Empire's darkest secrets.Become a martial-arts master. Using the knowledge gained in crafting multiple story-based role-playing games, BioWare sends you on a journey to become a martial arts master. Choose a character with a unique appearance and quirks, a custom voice set, and a powerful combination of ability scores and fighting styles. You can choose to act for good or evil, and these decisions build your reputation, which precedes you throughout the land, changing the course of interaction with other characters and followers. Take the role of a master of martial arts and recruit followers to your cause in an interactive, living world.Innovative fighting system. Master fighting styles and mystical powers. Jade Empire provides a gameplay experience with the tempo and fury normally found in Hong Kong cinema favorites such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Bruce Lee classics. As you journey through Jade Empire, you can upgrade your starting combat style or learn entirely new styles to tailor a character for your specific gameplay preferences. Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Astounding with some problems","reviewText":"From the people who brought us Knights of the Old Republic comes another genre-blending game with a fabulously twisting plot.  If you own an Xbox, you should own this game.  It is not only the best Action RPG on the Xbox but one of the best RPGs played in recent memory.For those who have played KOTOR, this game will be instantly familiar.  At the offset, you pick a character and are thrust into a world of moralities.  Unlike KOTOR, the morality system is a little more complex for the most part.  Instead of focusing on good and evil, your character has the choice of being endlessly helpful, understanding and tolerant of everyone (in other words believes in the power of the human spirit) or someone who reveres strength.  As an example of this strength concept, there is a decision early on about a dam that is open and has caused problems for a town because the sailors are land locked.  A wine merchant wants the dam to remain open so he can make a killing off of the sailors.  If you follow the Way of the Open Palm you would probably close the dam so that the town can prosper in what is should be doing.  If you follow the Way of the Closed Fist, on the other hand, would decide that if the town were strong they will survive this current hurdle and that it is only that, a hurdle.  It gets a little more tricky than that and does open some areas for roleplaying your character and deciding what you would really do in that situation.  Bioware is also wonderful at making you think about your decision as they give you new information just as soon as you make a decision that might change how you feel about the situation.My only complaint with the system is that while they say that the two paths are different from looking at things as good and evil, there are still some instances where there is a \"good\" and an \"evil\" way of doing things.  I might have rationalized why I would be doing something that way, yet I would get points from the side I didn't want because it was clearly delineated as \"good and evil choice.\"  So, that's a bit frustrating given that their system isn't supposed to be good and evil.  But, overall the system works well and really makes you think.I didn't really care for KOTOR because of the battle system and that is probably the reason I'm enjoying Jade Empire much more.  The fighting system is simple yet deep.  As you progress you will learn different martial arts style that you can map to the D-pad for quick and easy access.  And you will be constantly changing your styles as the techniques to defeat enemies will constantly evolve.  Some monsters are immune to certain attacks so you will have to experiment and find the best ways of devastating your foes.On the simple side, the combat is really about rock, paper scissors.  You have a quick attack and a time-consuming attack (and a knock back attack that really only helps when you are surrounded and need some space).  When someone blocks you use your time consuming attack, otherwise you mostly use your quick attacks to offset their own long attacks.  It's pretty simple and easy to used to.  However, some battles can become a button masher either way you look at it.  But it's still exhilarating and fast with many ways of deciding how you want to play.  Do you want to focus on using weapons, martial arts, magic, transformations?  A little of the above?  It's all up to you.The game is beautiful most of the time.  The art style is impeccable and really helps create a full-flesh universe.  Since it's based on oriental myth, it doesn't take place in the Orient as we know it but a mythical world that incorporates themes from oriental culture.  Because of this, the desiginers are free to create whatever their imagination can make.  And it's beautiful.  There are some places that I stood for awhile and just looked because it was so surreally beautiful and soothing.  It made me wish that sometimes our world wasn't so industrialized and that we could go back to what was a more simple beauty.  It was that affecting.  However, sometimes, the backgrounds look painted on.  Some of the hills and areas that act as blockades for where you can't go aren't that well designed.  Also my character's body type makes me laugh because his pecs are super large and his abs are indented in his body that I laugh whenever I see it.The game moves impeccably fast as well.  Your character runs and I mean runs through the areas.  The framerate is great.  But, like KOTOR before it, the game stutters sometimes when you are running and turning the camera.  When the camera pans, the game flutters sometimes as it tries to take in everything that happens.  In battles, the game hardly ever stutters.  And the battles can end up having a good dozen or so enemies fighting you and your partner so they can get pretty hectic and the graphics engine does a great job keeping the motion moving.Aurally, the game is a treat.  You will find some cameo voice actors that are immediately familiar (look for John Cleese in a hysterical role).  The music is well done and has a wonderful oriental bent to it (of course).  Also, Bioware hired a real linguist to help create the fictional language used in the game.  It is very familiar to oriental language but isn't real.  It was created solely for this game.  And that's amazing.Unfortunately, my problem with the dialogue in the game is the same problem I had with KOTOR.  It's great and all but all too often the plot developments and dialogue becomes a \"talking head\" type situation where anyone who has something important to say gets a close up of their face while their lips move and the dialogue is heard.  This is unfortunate for me because I get impatient sometimes and will just read the subtitles and skip through most of their dialogue.  It's never \"dynamic\" in cutscenes like in some RPGs I've played (hands down the best use of dialogue in an RPG goes to FFX that used dialogue to move the plot but it wasn't a novel dialogue; it was more of a movie dialogue).  The dialogue in Jade Empire is sometimes like a novel.  So, for those who aren't interested in talking heads delivering dialogue this might get annoying after a time.  But the dialogue is genuinely well voiced and excellent.My only other complaint is the load times.  While not as annoying constant as Fable where each and every small zone no matter how small had to be loaded for a good 5-10+ seconds, it still is a pain when you have to go through zones for a quest.  For instance, in the beginning of the game you have to go through the town to the school (a load screen) to get a quest, go back to town (load screen) to talk to someone, then back to the school (load screen).  And it's unfortunate because the actual quest takes maybe a minute, but a good 20 seconds of the time is spent in load screens.  That's a uncharacteristic load time though as generally the areas are big and don't usually require many loads.  Although another incident where it is very noticeable is in an arena combat situation where before and after each arena battle it has to load for a good 5-10 seconds.  The kicker is, some of the arena battles are over in about a minute or much much less and yet you have to deal with two load screens comprising a good 10-20 seconds.  So, in some areas it can be annoying and definitely pulls you out of the game when you should be pulled further in.  And, it becomes especially annoying considering that games like Halo 2 are seamless after the original load.Overall, though, this game is gold.  It's perfectly plotted and paced and has Bioware's trademark in excellence stamped all over it.  It ranks as one of my favorite games this year so far along with God of War and Psychonauts.  I would definitely recommend buying this game.  There are some problems that I have noted but you know regardless of the problems, this is an excellent game with an excellent story.  And, at 22+ hours, this adventure is worth taking.**NOTE: You should definitely pick up this, the Limited Edition of it if you can still find it.  For the initial run they are all Limited Edition and after they are gone, you will only be able to get the standard game.  The Limited edition has a new character and weapon and a making of as well as some other fun things.  Same price, so definitely check this one out if you want the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZAM","description":"Jak 3concludes the Jak and Daxter trilogy with a truly plot-driven adventure game filled with friendship, betrayal, death, and a long-awaited understanding of the Precursor civilization that has, until now, remained a mystery.One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"Cumulonimbus Harpe \"samsmylife\"","summary":"Excellent game!!!!","reviewText":"Jak 3 is one of the best games I've ever played. In this one, Jak has been banished to the desert for supposedly befriending Krew, who is responsible for all the destruction to Haven City caused by the Metal-Heads. Though Jak was ment to be banished alone, Daxter and Pecker manage to escape the ship. The Wasteland is about 3 times bigger than Haven City and has many areas like the Volcano, Oasis, The Monk Temple, and Spargus City. You will also be able to go back to Haven City and meet some of Jak's old friends.The weapons are far better in this game than in Jak 2. All the weapons like the Scatter Gun, Blaster Weapon, Volcanic Fury, and the Peace Maker are back but they each have three different types of shooting power. For instance, the Blaster Weapon can be upgraded to the Beam Reflector, which makes the bullets bounce off the walls. Then it can be updated to the Gyro Burster, which shoots out a UFO-like drone that shoots the enemies for you.The Dune-Buggy missions in the Wasteland are loads of fun. There are 8 different buggies to ride ranging from the Tough Puppy to the Sand Shark. My personal favorite is the Dune Hopper because it shoots bombs and can jump great distances. Most of the buggy missions aren't too difficult but they can sometimes be a bit tricky.Overall, Jak 3 is a bit more forgiving than the first two. What I mean is that in most missions, when you die or fail, it starts you out in the middle of the mission instead of at the very beggining. The only extremly difficult things about this game are some of the gun courses. You must shoot all the targets except for the civilians like before, but this time the targets shoot at you and some blow up. And to top that, you lose points if you let the targets blow up.In Jak 3, the series has gone back to it's roots. The music is good like in the first game and is much better than the music from Jak 2. The environments are less futuristic than Jak 2 and are more adventurous. One thing I was surprised to see brought back was the thing when Daxter stands over you when you die and says some funny lines. All in all, this is the best game of the series and it really ended the epic respectfully. Here is an overview of all the Jak games:Jak & Daxter: A great, solid platform game with great character animation and texture mapping. 9/10Jak 2: Still a great game, but not as adventurous as the first and sometimes, a bit too difficult. 8/10Jak 3: The best game of the series. It made up what Jak 2 lacked in and ended the epic nicely. 10/10There is one thing that the Jak series still needs, the ability to strafe. While you might take it for granted but without it, the game isn't as easy. Hopefully the next game will have it. But Jak 3 is still a great game. Being a fan of both Ratchet & Clank and Jak & Daxter, I can't say that one is better than the other but for those people that said that Jak is copying Ratchet, well uh, which game came first? And besides, as long as it's a good game, it shouldn't really matter, right?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2004"}

Ram","summary":"The Dragon Ninja Returns...","reviewText":"Though I previously played all three iterations of the \"new\" Ninja Gaiden (Ninja Gaiden and Ninja Gaiden: Black on Xbox, and Ninja Gaiden Sigma on PS3 - which was just prior to playing Sigma 2), I didn't get very far on the 360 version of Ninja Gaiden 2. Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 keeps many things from the 360 version, but also changes and enhances the experience.I'll just list a few things I noticed while playing:-Ryu now does a sort of \"dash\" to the side to dodge attacks (rather than rolling). I don't know why this was changed, but it's annoying - the dash is slower than the roll, and half the time Ryu either doesn't respond, or worse, goes in the wrong direction. This is sometimes due to the camera angle...-The camera does a pretty good job for the most part, but there are times when it gets in too close or gives a horrible angle of the action. Many times when fighting a group of enemies (especially those that appear in waves), there will be an enemy right behind you and you won't know it, or you'll be hit by a fireball from way off screen. I actually think it's worse here than in NGS. You learn to deal with it by moving it yourself as the game goes on.-I might as well get into the graphics issue now. The game is gorgeous overall, both in the new areas and the (few) places you revisit from NGS. The new characters (Rachel, Ayane and Momiji) and enemies look amazing. The bosses, both regular and massive (Statue of Liberty!) are impressive too. As you probably know, much of the blood was removed from the game and replaced with a \"purple mist,\" but there is still a lot of blood here, and at least the mist makes sense (the black spider clan is related to the fiends, right?). You get used to it after a while. Finally, the cinemas in NGS looked bad (as they were ported over from the Xbox versions), but here the cinemas look amazing.-There is some screen tearing in the game, but it's only occasional. The frame rate is a more frequent problem. Some fights slow down to a crawl. This mainly happens when many enemies are on screen, or when there's a lot going on (ie, if a boss is charging you and you use a ninpo attack to avoid it). It's not a game-breaker, but it does tend to happen a few times in each level.-I know some players don't like the new weapons, but I really enjoyed them. I never used most of the weapons in NGS other than the Dragon Sword and maybe the Lunar Staff, as most of the rest were too weak or too slow. Here, every weapon has its purpose - I used the scythe on bosses, the chain/sickle on fast/small enemies, the tonfa on human enemies...there are many different attacks and moves you can choose from to suit the situation.-You now heal most of your damage after every fight, and are limited to a max of three of each curative item (small healing, large healing, and recharging ONE ninpo field). Most chests contain essence, and the save statues heal you the first time you use them, so you should be able to go through the whole game without too much trouble as long as you play intelligently.-The inferno ninpo is back, and there are three new ones in the game. One summons phoenix to attack your enemies, another fires an energy sphere, and the last shoots wind blades out from your position. As in NGS, you'll mainly use these when surrounded by enemies (wind blades) or in a boss fight to avoid an attack (as you're invincible while you cast magic). Many chests contain red essence to recharge these (the statues only recharge health, not ninpo).-Most of the new enemies are pretty cool, though you could tell there were constraints in creating them. Many of the same enemies appear over and over, level after level with little variation. A few are carried over from NGS, too; the ghost fish are back, as are the purple fiends and Marbus (the devil-horned boss from the end of the last game). On the one hand, they're easier to defeat thanks to \"obliteration techniques\": once you slice off a limb, you can kill them with one attack. On the other hand, they can attack you the same way, and many times they appear in several waves of increasing difficulty. Blocking is less successful, and dodging doesn't always get you out of the way of their attacks. Thankfully, the cannon/missile spam has been reduced from NG2, as has the number of enemies in certain sections (which could cause the slowdown).-The bosses are more interesting than in NGS, but they require less strategy. If you die, you can continue at the beginning of the fight (rather than going back to the save statue). By the third or fourth time, you should have memorized every attack and figured out which weapons/tactics to use, and end up beating them using a minimum of potions. Most of them can be beaten by dodging their charge attack, followed by attacking with your most powerful weapon (the staff, and eventually the scythe). They will still frustrate you though, as dodging is difficult and they will often use a long grab/slam attack that does massive damage. As with the enemies (and a couple of the bosses in NGS), you have to fight them again (yes, ALL of them) in the last few levels, which becomes really tedious.-The developers added a few levels to NGS where you got to play as Rachel (to spice things up a bit), and have done the same here. Each of three female characters have a dedicated level in the game. In NGS, Rachel's levels were the same as Ryu's (only backwards), and only one enemy was new (the boss, Gamov). In NGS2, the levels are similar to Ryu's, but have branching off points and some new enemies and bosses. The three women play differently - Rachel is slow and is armed with a hammer and gun, Ayane is fast and uses short swords and incendiary shuriken, and Momiji is average and wields a spear and bow. Only Rachel and Ayane's stories are related to the main plot, but Momiji's is interesting to play. Having said that, I wonder why we never get to play as Sonya (the main woman in the plot). There are opportunities where they could have inserted levels featuring her (the airship, and before fighting Alexei - how did he get her anyway?), so this is a disappointment (especially since she starts out strong but ends up as the \"damsel in distress\"). Also, a mysterious woman appears twice in the game, but we never see her face or are told why she's following our ninjas (in the game at least...I had to look online to find out who she was).I know I've complained a lot here, but aside from all that, I did find NGS2 an enjoyable experience. It was a good companion piece to the first game, and though the first few hours took some getting used to, I'm glad I decided to give the game another chance...once I was a few chapters in, I found it highly addictive and fun to play! I do think that is there is a third game, there needs to be less slowdown, more enemy variation (and no reused bosses!) and better integration of any other characters you play as (besides Ryu).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0BS","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"A must have for third-person stealth fans","reviewText":"When I played SC 1 I really felt it was a wasted opportunity... Yes it had amazing graphics and was the stealth-based 'spy' game to own but its amazing shadowy look was also matched by its ultra-unforgiving realism. Trip one alarm too many - game over. Use a weapon you're not allowed to - game over. Kill someone - game over etc.With Chaos Theory that frustrating aspect of gameplay has almost all been removed. With each successive trip of an alarm your enemies don armor or get out more powerful weapons and become more prepared and aware of your presence. Much more preferable to 'mission failed' start the level again style of gameplay.Additionally, Xbox owners can now save at any point. This is radical especially on for a console game, and increases the enjoyment factor ten-fold. It allows you to experiment without fear of going back to the start and thankfully load and save times are very quick.The new toys, moves and especially the intelligent AI is also a welcome addition to the game franchise. Enemies converse with each other, share info and plan flanking moves extremely realistically. Add to that environment affected ragdoll physics and the game starts to *feel* real. Levels are cunningly designed for multiple game styles - want to go in guns blazing, then go for it, want to subdue and interrogate guards as you go or even avoid them completely - again that's up to you.Graphically, it's stunning. The mathematics and visuals integrate tightly to offer a truly unique looking game. Cloth and drapes are affected by wind and light. Water is a factor as is sound and ambient noise. Granted you'll be spending a lot of time seeing the game through Sam Fisher's night vision scope or waiting in some pitch black corner, but where the game is bright enough you can be awed by how far gamegraphics not only has come, but also how much they're part of the gameplay.Sure they are some points I didn't like. I personally hate games that have time limits and SC:CT has a parts of of some levels where you have minutes or even seconds to perform some task. I like to slowly plan my next move without fear of a 'time up'. I want to play the game at my own pace. Thankfully there's only a couple of levels that do this.Chaos Theory is the game I wanted the original Splinter Cell to be. At this pricepoint you shouldn't miss this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2005"}

As fate would have it, somebody decided to buy the game for me as a gift.  The person saw it, knew I loved The Simpsons, and figured the game would be fun.  It was actually a good idea.Everything everybody else has already mentioned about the game is true.  There is a terrible camera angle, and sometimes the camera is just \"too big\" for the area and other objects push the camera out of alignment with exactly what you need to see.  So you end up making \"leaps of faith\".  There is a crazy dizzying array of controls, and each character has a robust collection of powers.  There are tons of \"collect the item\" quests, such as flags, coupons, etc.  A lot of times, it is very difficult to judge depth and distance, and when you jump, you'll fail several times before you actually get it right.  Add to all of this, a ton of \"time challenges\" tied to the Xbox 360 achievement system, which will force you to play the same part over and over and over again until you get it right to get the achievement.  All of this can annoy you -- this game, at times, is a controller-twisting experience.The game parodies every video game since the early Atari 2600.  So I'm thinking that the \"problems\" described here by me and by others is perhaps the biggest joke ever...at our expense.  It's almost as if the developers tried their best to put every possible video game \"annoyance\" into this one game.  The reason why I say this is because things seem \"frustrating\" until you do it.  Eventually, you'll have an \"a-ha!\" moment, and once you actually figure out what you need to do, the game doesn't seem that frustrating...it actually seems fun.  In fact, I end up with a great sense of satisfaction after completing each level or time challenge.  Overall, things are sometimes frustrating, but I don't feel the game is particularly difficult.The game is well-polished.  The visuals are great, the animations are superb, and the sound is dead-on \"Simpsons\".  It feels like you're watching an actual episode, and there are tons of jokes to keep you smiling.  And I think that's the true beauty of this game -- no matter how frustrating you think it might be, something is going to happen to make you smile.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2008"}

But has Some Major Flaws","reviewText":"I have owned an PlayStation2 since it first came out. Yes, I was on the long line outside Toys R Us for it. Yes, I probably have spent about 1000 bucks on games. And yes, I am disapointed in Sony.PlayStation2 used to be the most dominant system. The games are great. Grand Theft Auto was invented on Ps2. Final Fantasy is on Ps2. All our favorite classics are on Ps2. But still I am very disappointed. This system is not being used to what it should be. X-Box is better, but they use it better. I think that PlayStation2 should have just as good graphics, faster loading time and better gameplay then X-Box, because if it did, this system would dominate.But it doesn't. it can't stack up to the X-Box expierence. The X-Box graphics are clean and not like the choppy, messy Ps2 graphics. Loading times on some games are impossible to deal with, when X-Box can load in half the time. People's faces look like my @$$ on a bad day, and I can't stand the disc read error.A Ps2 has it's advantages over the X-Box. First, the selection of games. The games they make on Ps2 are mostly going to X-Box, but you have to wait. And secondly, online. online is why i gave this 3 stars. Socom and Socom II online are the best games online, and sports games are great online. Why not X-Box? The price. If you want to spend 60.00 on X-Box Live! plus all the other crap like the adapter and starter kit and this and that and so on. Ps2 is FREE! If Ps2 operated like X-Box, and online was FREE!, X-Box would be exstinct.Another big issue is the memory cards. X-Box comes with a hard drive installed, making file management easier. You have all the memory you need, and with the growing size of files, X-Box is good for the job. PlayStation2 memory cards are 25.00 each, when they don't hold a lot of memory. One Socom file takes up half of a new memory card. Mix that with sport game franchises, settings and those damn profiles, and you got a helluva lot of memory cards. I know that PlayStation2 has the HDD or whatever crap that is, but you have to pay 100 bucks for it. X-Box memory: keyword: FREE!If you don't have Ps2, don;t consider it. Consider X-Box. If you have it, sell it. If you have an old one, sell it. if you like GTA, get San Andreas, then sell it once it comes out on X-Box.1. X-Box  2. gameCube  3.

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

It's no surprise that the game involves a lot of violence, bloodshed and mayhem.The world you're in is run by a corporation, which is harsh and controlling. You are a male or female vigilante, and you have four maps on which you can work: a suburban mall, Chinatown, a suburb, and a corporate building.Each map is full-roam - you can go whereever you want in it. Each map is rather large too, complete with cars, glass windows to shatter, trashcans to pick up, and up to 250 running civilians, each with his or her own personality. While the graphics aren't glisteningly crisp like in Kingdom Hearts or FFX, they're still rather good. You can read the store signs in Chinatown and see the flower design on your character's Hawaiian shirt.There are different modes of game play, all single player only. You can just roam around in a map killing the bad security guards and gaining points from short-term goals such as \"blow up all enforcer cars\". You can do a timed mode where you have to work through a series of objectives, gaining time bonusses as you go to keep time on your clock. Finally you can take on the almost 200-mission main sequence, where you are given specific tasks to do in order and report back at the end of each one.On one hand, you can say that the game is very repetitive. While each level has different graphics, the tasks in each one are the same - avoid hurting civilians, kill the target enemy, gather up health. The splashes of red blood are continuous (although you can turn gore off).But on the other hand, it's an arcade game, not requiring much thought. It's mindless fun, giving quick results and easy progress. There are selections of weapons, from billy clubs to swords to flamethrowers and miniguns. After a hard day, there is great satisfaction in the smash of a plate glass window.Not for the young, with its constant attack mentality in city streets.

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Saenz","summary":"Best multiplayer once again","reviewText":"First of all, I read many user reviews already, and I honestly think that the ones with bad scores are because of the do not own the game (COD fans) or do own it but expected something else (probably COD players). I don't want to generalize this, but it is important for costumers that are looking for this game to know that there is a gameplay difference between Call of duty and Battlefield; so you should be aware of this before buying the game and then say it sucks.Call of duty is an arcade shooter, focused more on team deathmatch and the winner is the one that kills the most; that is not the case with Battlefield, you can have more kills than any other player in a game session but still not be the best player of the round, and that is because battlefield is focused to objectives and teamplay rather than kills; of course is important to kill, but is not your main goal in Battlefield, you goal is to support your team and squad whenever is possible.In a personal preference, I prefer much more Battlefield because I feel is more realistic and is more satisfying when you play it with friends, the game is also more tactical ans slow paced. But you should make your decision depending on your gameplay preferences.+++ Ok, NOW Back to topic +++PRESENTATION (9/10):This game looks amazing, Is not the same game as the BETA because somehow it looks prettier (I doesn't have the same graphics level as Uncharted or Killzone, but still looks top notch); the game has great lightning effects and character models, anti-aliasing works great to. There are some minor issues like textures loading late and also the draw distance is limited (but for a console that is understandable). I played 17 hours of online gaming, and just like 30 minutes of the campaign, the last one looked better. The menus are OK, I still don't know why DICE hasn't yet implemented a proper CLAN system, is insane that you have to connect to Battlefield's battlelog through a browser to add a clan tag. Also, I miss the 8 ppl squads from past Battlefields, 4 squads feels short to me knowing that I have a clan with 12 members; I posted that feedback to dice back when Bad Company 2 was the sh!\"\"et. Still Battlefield modes are untouch, I do not like the addition of team deathmatch, I think dice added this to capture new players from other shooters, but I'm sure that a game mode I will not play.STORY (7.5/10):As I mentioned, I only played like 30 minutes of the campaign, I felt it was kind of the same as Bad Company 2, is not a story line that will blow your mind, like the Uncharted franchise, but still it is a nice way to entertain when you want to play something different, and it also adds value to the game overall. But we have to remember that this game was developer more for the online rather than for the offilne modes. So I really can judge this game for its solo mode. A nice addition is COOP mode, which adds new flavors as story to this game.GAMEPLAY (10/10):For me, this is the best ONLINE experience on the market. I been playing BF since BF2, and since then the game still delivers a great multiplayer. The controls felt good, same as Bad Company 2, with guns neither weightless (as Call of duty) or heavier (as Killzone), the perfect balance for me. For new players, play with tanks, jets, helicopters, boats and more... is unique; and the best of is that if you suck killing, you can still do well on the round supporting your team with ammunition, healing, repairing, capturing strategic points and more.OVERALLThis game is really good, and if your goal is to play online and have fun wioth friends, this is the best game on the market.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2011"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

Why can't I join a co-op game in progress? Why can this monster kill me in two hits? A little \"Why?\" may have taken this game in a different, more compelling direction. Unfortunately, for PS3-only owners, it's harder to recommend due to some pronounced technical issues that detract from its biggest selling points. If you've burned through other multiplayer or co-op options, then there might be something for you in Lost Planet 2. The single-player campaign is lengthy at around 14 hours with full co-op support, and the multiplayer has plenty of maps and modes.

{"product_name":"B0001I9YGC","description":"Call Of Duty: Finest Hour leads you back into the World War, where you will experience epic battlefield moments in the war&apos;s most legendary conflicts. Fight alongside ordinary men who fought and died for freedom and changed the world.","reviewerName":"Barry Robinson","summary":"Congratulations Activision and Team Spark on an amazing game","reviewText":"After being totaly immersed in Call of Duty and United Offensive on the PC I knew from Finest Hour's anouncment that I had to have it. First let me tell you that this is a completley new game. It's not a PC port but it does manage to incorporate familiar gameplay and levels into this jaw droping experience. In the first level you play as Alexander Solkovo, who is throw into the battle of Stalingrad with only a handful of ammo. Like the PC game, you eventualy get a rifle to use that ammo but in the begining of the level you have all that you can do to follow your sargent up the hill into machine gun fire. I would like to compare this to the D-Day scene in Medal of Honor Frontline, but that just wouldn't be fair. This game crushes Frontline and although I'll still play Frontline (an incredibly awesome game)This is what is owning my PS2 right now. After Stalingrad you will shift through roles, playing as a Russia female sniper, a Russian tank commander, a British PPA commando, a sargent with the Big Red 1, and a tank sargent in Belgium. The whole storyline is very cool and Finest Hour truely does capture the gritty cinimatic feel of WWII that most games don't. Some might need to remember that this game isn't trying to recreate the feel of the PC game. It's trying to recreate the feel of war and although I've never been in war, I'd say this game does a darn good job. Some people complain the controls are hard to get use to but I'm guessing thats because they are a bunch of hardcore PC gamers (nothing wrong with that) who aren't as good at adapting to a controller layout. Now like I said before, I own Frontline and many other FPS for PS2 and I caught on to these controls in no time. In fact, this game might have some of the best First Person Shooting controls I've ever used (well, next to Halo) With controls aside, lets move on to graphics. Thats always a fun part. They are simply amazing! Each character has around 1500 different animations thay can perform and trust me, they do perform. Really, graphics aren't an issue. The framerate in the game will make FPS fans happy. You can be mowing down twenty enemies and the frame rate doesn't drop at all. Which brings me to my next point. The arsenal rocks. It is smaller than the PC games but now you can run around firing MG42s and 30cal. machine guns without having to deploy them. This is truely awesome. But here is what Finest Hour is missing out on, the M1 carbine, the STG 44, a couple others and strangley, pistols aren't any where to be had. So when your two big guns run out, you must rely on melee attacks. The game, oddly enough, works well without pistols. Only after finishing the game did I realize, \"Hey, I never used a pistol.\" but then I said \"Hey, I never needed one!\" Now, how about gameplay. The game has wide variety of ways to accomplish each mission (something Rising Sun promised but kind of failed with) And really, almost every time you play is different. With a mixture of funny and down right awesome cheat codes this game will keep you entertained for a long time. But do understand the replay value of this game doesn't relay on the cheats but they are great. What more can I say when it comes to performance and presentation... THIS GAME ROCKS!Now, the not so good. What game doesn't have glitches? If some one can tell me one, their lying! So don't fear when I tell you this game has some minor glitches. Their nothing most FPS don't have (floating guns) But don't worry, more than likely you won't even notice it. The few glitches their are take place in the really big battles, so a couple of floating guns shouldn't bother you or even catch your eye. Another thing is that the British campaign seems a bit short lived but it is packed with action and the jeep chase more than compensates for a shorter campaign. Also a little more detail could have been paid to bullet holes in the walls. They aren't that good looking but like the floating guns, you probaly won't care. Also, Where is the multiplayer? Sure, you can go online with this game but what about split screen four player. Hopefully they will put it in the next game.How about a quick recap.Pros:Great GraphicsWonderful musical scoreIntense gameplay that doesn't drop a frameLots of replay valueCons:A couple of tiny glitches that don't affect gameplay at allThe British Campaign is shorter than the othersNo multiplayer with out online connectionSo all in all Activision and Spark have done a wonderful job on Finest Hour and this in one game any FPS fan or World War II buff should not be without!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001B1W3GG","description":"BioShock is an innovative role-playing shooter from Irrational Games who was named IGN&#8217;s 2005 Developer of the Year. BioShock immerses players into a war-torn underwater utopia, where mankind has abandoned their humanity in their quest for perfection.","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"One of the best of this gen","reviewText":"Bioshock-this was one of the earlier games of this generation, and having just recently played through it a second time, I can say that it's still one of the best games out there. Here's my review (SPOILER-FREE!):Story: 5/5Your plane crashes into the ocean, resulting in your discovery of the underwater city of Rapture. What first is an attempt at escape from this utopia gone awry soon becomes quite a different tale. Be ready for a wild plot twist (somewhat overrated, in my opinion). This is the plot you play through, but the magic of Bioshock is that there are audio diaries you can collect that give you further insight to this city. These are actually very interesting to listen to, so they're worth your while to find. The characters are also fascinating, featuring highly unique personalities and top-notch voice acting.Combat: 5/5This is some of the best gameplay you'll find. There are a vast number of options you can utilize in combat. Hacking healing stations, turrets, and security cameras makes your fights easier in different ways, saving you ammo and reducing the number of resources you consume. Your 7 weapons all have their uses, and each has 3 ammo types for specific opponents and situations. Also at your disposal are Plasmids, powers you equip that can significantly aid in combat. For example, you might find yourself overwhelmed by enemies and blow everyone away with Sonic Boom, or use Enrage to turn one enemy against another. Tonics are passive enhancements that provide various effects, including making your wrench attacks stronger, or making Hacking easier. Lastly, there are usually environmental hazards you can use to your advantage. Oil slicks can be lit up, water can be electrocuted, and explosive tanks/barrels are quick ways to dole out damage. What this all amounts to is a lot of player choice. Assigning the right Tonics and Plasmids, choosing the appropriate weapons and ammo types, and utilizing what's in the environment are what smart players will do, and the game rewards you for it since you end up saving resources.Objectives: 4.5/5This is how games should handle their main objectives. In Bioshock, you'll enter open levels that have multiple paths that you'll explore in order to complete your mission. In one level, you'll assemble a bomb, whose components are scattered in each of the paths. In another level, you'll help an artist complete his masterpiece by taking photos in different places. It never feels like the game's giving you a lame reason to explore the levels because it's all so natural. But the truly explorative player will search every nook and cranny of every place they visit. Doing so will yield more resources, making surviving easier. BUT, what I found was that playing this game the \"right\" way (being smart in combat and searching thoroughly) makes the game almost TOO easy. Playing on the hardest difficulty, my wallet was always full, my ammo was always maxed out, and I always had the maximum number of first aid kits and hypos. Nothing's more frustrating than being rewarded for exploration...but not being rewarded because I couldn't pick up any more resources. This invincible feeling really detracts from the survival aspect of the game (this is coming from a casual FPS player, not a prodigy). One more thing: most levels feature Big Daddies and Little Sisters. Encounters with these enemies are huge undertakings. Defeating the Big Daddy (no small feat) will allow you to obtain Adam from his Little Sister, which you can use to purchase monumental upgrades. The problem is, there are only 3 Little Sisters at most per level, and once you've dealt with them all, Big Daddies roam around by themselves, harmless unless provoked. The game throws Little Sisters at you too closely together, so you might quickly deal with them all and just be left with Big Daddies you'll surely avoid.Setting: 5/5The city of Rapture is amazing. This is one of the most immersive game worlds you'll ever find. Don't assume that everything will be underwater-themed. You'll visit a Medical Pavilion, a power core, apartment suites, and a performance venue, just to name a few. Small details are abundant, and you'll never shake the feeling that you're in a place full of citizens gone insane. Congratulations to the developers for crafting a setting this magnificent.Overall: 4.9/5Aside from the gripes I had about poorly regulated Little Sister encounters and the game potentially being too easy, there are also small bugs like objects disappearing into one another, textures looking ugly for a few seconds after loading, and the Telekineses Plasmid not picking up what you want it to sometimes. But in the grand scheme of things, these are very minor complaints. Bioshock is one of the best games of this generation. The storytelling is unique and incredible, the world is as immersive as it gets, the combat is full of choices, and the level and objective designing should be the template for many future games. Simply put, this is one deep, unforgettable experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}

The design of any product is a tradeoff between competing priorities, and in this case, the tradeoffs have been resolved in favor of a typical gamer's usage patterns.This means that its features can range from mildly annoying to downright irritating unless you use it for its intended purpose.What features you ask?Well, how about a bank of macro keys that can be programmed to run special actions or even scripts? If you are a gamer, these are indispensable. If you are not, they are the most annoying thing ever, especially when they get accidentally depressed as you're happily typing away.And, how about a switch that disables the Windows and Properties keys? My little daughter will accidentally press the Windows key while getting a game character to do something, and suddenly she's out of the game and into Windows. Disabling these keys using a slider switch is literally a game changer for little children.Then, how about the backlighting of keys while you're decimating your opposition in a darkened room? The only opportunities I get to play games these days is once the kids are all ensconced safely in bed. As I crouch over my keyboard I usually rely on the light from my monitor for illumination. Backlit keys are a nice convenience.Next, how about unique profiles that are combinations of macros, scripts, etc. that are associated with a given application. When a game is launched, the programmable G-keys are automatically initialized with the appropriate profile for that game. This is actually a huge convenience since it effectively means you now have 36 programmable keys PER application. Imagine the possibilities!How about a built in audio sound card that lets you connect standard headphones or a headset with standard 3.5mm plugs into the keyboard? In addition, you get controls on the keyboard that let you mute either the headphones or the microphone.Finally, how about a USB port (for non-powered devices) that lets you plug in a portable hard drive or a thumb drive conveniently?If this description just made you salivate, this product is likely going to be a good fit for your needs.Ergonomics:===========An input device is only as good as its ergonomics. I'm glad to note that the ergonomics of the keyboard are also top notch.The keys have a soft feel to them, and the keyboard oozes quality. Other reviewers have commented on a \"plasticky\" feel. I may be easily pleased, but I thought the keyboard held up well to all the other keyboards I've used over the years.Its height can be adjusted by two feet found at the top edges of the keyboard. More importantly, the lower edges have rubberized feet that prevent keyboard travel when you're in the heat of the action. I also liked the palm rest, which for my keyboard, attached very securely indeed. I'd have preferred a more comfortable wrist rest - preferably padded. However, I've used this for extended durations, and haven't run into any comfort issues yet.Conclusion==========If you are used to ergonomic keyboards, this might take a bit of getting used to. Personally, I quickly adjusted in less than a day, and was comfortable with its ergonomics.I was also very impressed with the Flash based tutorial that gives you a quick introduction to all the features that this keyboard has to offer.I dinged it one star just because its not \"perfect\". Its a very decent keyboard, but this device really cries out for a LCD display. 36 programmable keys per application sound awesome, until you factor in the limitations of the human brain. Without a visual aid, its hard to fully actualize its potential. I'm using a cheat sheet, but that feels kludgy at best.A minor annoyance: The accompanying software and help file are unfortunately shared between all of Logitech's keyboards. As a result, the help text and software will often refer to aspects that are not applicable to the G110 (such as a Game Panel Manager, or the Game-Settings-to-Go window).Despite these issues, I'm personally looking forward to a long and productive relationship with this device. From the perspective of a professional software developer, I'm truly excited about what I'm going to be able to get this keyboard to do.Happy typing!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2009"}

The fight system is not really innovative or exciting and the game can really be a bit of a grind at times.Thankfully I got the game for around $10, so eventually I imagine I can get at least a couple bucks back for it somewhere.Give it a shot, it's not an awful game or anything, it's just not for everyone.

{"product_name":"B00002STGL","description":"A first-person shooter that mixes spy and sci-fi,Perfect  Darkis both a thoroughly engrossing one-player experience and a  riotously fun multiplayer romp. Easily one of the best games of its  genre on any video game console, this long-awaited follow-up toGoldenEye 007is a must-have for Nintendo 64 owners--and a damn  good reason to be one if you're not.The futuristicPerfect Darkcasts players as Joanna Dark, a  secret agent who becomes embroiled in a sinister conspiracy involving  aliens and an evil corporation. Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Lisa Houghtaling","summary":"!!The story of Perfect Dark!!","reviewText":"Well, it's just the background that's bad that's all.

The gameplay is simple, but it is very fun. It doesn't feel repetitive mainly because the actual campaign is rather short. However there is plenty to do within the game as far as replayability. Plus the online is very fun Co-Op Gladiator matches (2 vs an army of Barbarians, not one on one) with the ability to customize your equipment.The Story:- Based off of the Roman myth of Damocles, mixed into the Nero emperor era of Rome (Nero was a horrible ruler for those who don't know).- It's very enticing and hard to put down the controller, just because you want to find out what happens next.- I'm not saying anymore because I don't want to ruin anything.Pros:- The gameplay is rather simple, like Assassin's Creed slashing where timing effects the outcome of your attacks/defenses. However, they introduced a special attack system called execution mode (this is where God of War epic stuff happens) that you can go into after you injure an enemy enough. You get a perk for doing an execution, and you can change mid-execution, which is amazing.- The controls are very simple and easy to learn.- The graphics are the best I've ever seen in a video game.- The kinect controls, which you only use in certain situations, do make you feel like a Roman commander.- Very enticing and immersive story, like I said earlier.- Online isn't all that bad.- One of the best Villain death scenes, in my opinion.Cons:- It's rather short.- Even though the story is amazing, the &#34;big&#34; plot twists are very predictable.Other:- I got 750G on my first playthrough without really trying to get everything.- It took my Xbox One 3GB to install.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2014"}

And Xbox Live makes it much better.If you like non-stop, frontal assault games (Halo), then you will probably find Ghost Recon frustrating or boring.In this game, you have to use planning and stealth.Planning means that you have to decide how to navigate 2 teams of 3 soldiers through an area to minimize casualties, eliminate enemies and protect your teammates.  Halo is a great game - but you'll never experience this element of strategy in it.Stealth means you have to be prepared to go slowly and patiently.  If you move as fast as you can towards a goal, you're bound to get shot by an enemy hiding behind a tree.  In some cases, you have to crawl into position.

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"J.

Bump mapping on faces really add wonderful detail.- Software seems to adapt well to even lower end systems. Works perfectly on 1.5GhZ Pentium Centrino with GeForce FX5200Go.- Fantastic use of sound and lighting/shadows to create a truly eerie ambience.Cons- Extremely repetitive gameplay. In some sense it is too much like the original DOOM- ie so very little innovation has been added to the genre. At least in a game like PsiOps, the physics system was used to innovate on the genre.- The eerie ambience works for about the first hour. Then when you realize the whole game looks that way, it quickly becomes tiresome. It didn't take me long before resorting to grabbing the flashlight mod from the net and turning on the cheats.My suspicion is that ID released this game realizing that it will probably lose money on the title, and that they would make money on the licensing of the game engine to other developers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired.

There's no point in having another GTA clone. Even the developers of Saints Row know this. If you like variety, you will most likely like this game.Visual Detail: You need to download the high res pack which is free. imo the difference in visuals is well worth it. The PC version is definitely superior. The city and the people just look awesome. It really is like if you were in Hong Kong.Sound and Music: The developers really worked hard on both the visuals and sounds and it really pays off. Note: I have surround sound headphones. Turning on the Cantonese option helps in the immersion.Open World: I like open sand box worlds instead of interactive movies on rails. Freedom to do what you want is nice.Fighting: For me the general fighting worked well. I liked being able to use the environment to kill people.Driving: I liked the slow mo shooting sequences. This is really different and nice. The action hijack was fun as well.Running Chases: I also really liked the running chases on foot. There are a lot of acrobatics reminiscent of kung fu action movies.Voice Acting: Overall, the voice acting quality is really great. On a side note, if they saved money by not hiring AA actors and kept the voice acting quality the same; it probably would have let them add more to the game itself. I didn't really need Emma Stone to voice a minor character.No Need for High Hardware Specs: I have a really crappy CPU (some old AMD chip) and a decent video card. I was still able to max everything out with pretty good frame rates.Big Picture: This works really well with Steam's Big Picture mode for a TV screen. It feels very natural and it just looks awesome on my LCD TV with the high res pack. With this game I just don't care much about Xbox 720 or PS4 anymore.[Bad]Story: The storyline is definitely not bad, but it's not good either. The ending could have been so much better. There aren't really any surprises.Short: Compared to either Saints Row or GTA, Sleeping Dogs is a lot shorter. (Yes, I did almost all the side missions as well finding most of the side secrets.) This could have been good if... (see the next item)No Choice (no replayability): I feel that if there were more choices that actually changed the world like choosing your loyalty to the law or the triads as well as romances, this game would be so much better. Of course, realistically they needed to get this game out the door so I can understand. For the sequel, it would be nice if they added this.Fighting feels repetitive: at its core, this is more of an sandbox fighting game. Guns are rarely used. It's probably because I played most of the side missions, but the fighting got really repetitive after a while. The fighting environments need just a little more variety.[Misc]Mouse and keyboard simply does not work for this game. You really really need a controller.This is on Steam. Personally I really love it.[Verdict]Get this game if you want something different and if you are a fan of open world sandbox games. It's a good start, and I hope that Square invests in a sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2012"}

It plays a lot like the god of war series (or dante's inferno from the xbox library) which isn't a bad thing.  Has some faults but nothing glaring.  Actually, a very good game for this price range.Pros:Graphics are very good and there is a significant reduction in the gothic atmosphere of the series.Mechanics/gameplay is extremely fluid; plays great for an action adventure game.Scale/scope of this game is huge.Game length is significant (should be 20-30 hours for a playthrough).Difficult but not so much so that you stop playing.Story and voice acting is very good.Characters are well designed and interesting takes (across the board).There are some puzzles and they aren't simple either.Lot's of easter eggs and challenges.Somewhat deep combat system.Cons:Somewhat linear (but to be expected for this kind of game); there is some exploration.Too many cutscenes.Tends toward hack & slash.Somewhere in between:Doesn't feel like a castlevania game.Gabriel has a strong scotsman accent (sometimes), other times it's toned down.  It's a departure from the belmont's being transylvanian (implied).Pan has an italian accent which doesn't really mesh with the mythology (neither does his personality).Quick time events (there are a bunch in this game)Altogether this is a good game, definitely recommended considering the length of modern games being short and the gameplay uninspired; this game is none of those things.

To review the ps3 you really need to play the next gen games, watch blu ray movies, get yourself a psn account and play online, also test it's accesory features like the 1.3 hdmi output, it's wi fi and compatibility withother products - I am very pleased in EVERY category. If you really take in everything your getting ikt is insane sony can give this all to you at this price, and I am very happy with sony for this. I never had the ps1, but I LOVE the ps2 and still play it! Also I have a psp and I am able to turn on my ps3, put my ps3 to work, then turn it off all from work or home using wi fi. Thats an example of compatibility with there other products it's really outstanding the detail they put into there products.The games are second to none with hours and hours of fun and the most detailed next gen visuals around, i'm truly impressed. There have been problems at first programming on the ps3, programmers like rockstar noted they had a very very hard time with the ps3 on gta 4 becuase of the cell chip, gta 4 doesn't run in 720p because of this but overpowers in other areas essentially getting it a better score then on the 360's version. Rockstar and most devs now praise the ps3's power and rockstars ps3 exclusive title should be announced soon, and this time they understand how to harness the ps3's cell chip.There are some other cool features about the ps3 I will mention - one is the fact you can use any laptop had drive in the ps3, also you can surf the web on your t.v. through the ps3, these  are ps3 exclusive features that I really like, infact I have a 320 gb hdd in mine.Backwards compatibility for ps2 is not in this modle and many people love that feature, but I have an 80 gb that can play ps2 games, and I still use my ps2 to play them, it's cool to have the ps2 sitting next to his big brother.I have had my ps3 for about a year and a half and it's such a smooth running, tough machine that just won't break down no matter how crappy I treat it, I would buy one again in a heartbeat and sony has a life long fan.

As things stick to katamari, ball grows and larger are the objects that you can merge with katamari. Almost all levels are time trial (I dislike time trials) and you have a size ball must reach, so you roll around and learn what levels look like in order to make katamari grow faster. All levels are medium or easy, except Poland.Game is logical, which we haven't seen in a long time, and it is really attractive: imagine rolling 5 cm big katamari to pick up nuts and batteries in the beginning of the level and , after some time, rolling katamari big enough to pick up people, cars, buildings, and , finally, clouds and rainbows.There should be a sequel soon, and I'd like to see levels that are different visually (Saudi Arabia looks like Russia). Some levels could have special restrictions, like it is forbidden to roll people, some levels should have interesting geometry, let's say sliding down the street or possibility to roll down the roller coaster. It would also be nice to have more levels with large katamari, and more levels in general.The main reason game got 4 stars is camera...but, BUY!

Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Need For Speed Hot Pursuit:  The ultimate Cop vs. Racer game","reviewText":"NFS:Hot Pursuit is a very ambitous reboot by EA and Criterion Games, the visionaries behind the smash hit Burnout Paradise.  And in many ways, it works out great.This is one of the best looking games on the PS3, with great detail to the cars and environment, and it wouldn't be a Criterion game if the crashes didn't look awesome as well.  The presentation of the game is easy and open, and you can go down either the Cops or Racer paths completely or alternate between the two, opening up new events, cars and upgrading your weapons as you level up.The real pull of NFS:HP is the Autolog feature.  Think of it as a FB-like smack talking challenging device.  When friends beat your times, you can choose to jump straight to those race(s) and try to beat them back. You can take pictures in game and post them to your wall.  Autolog is what gives NFS:HP nearly infinite replay value, because it's unlikely you'll be better than all your friends on all tracks.However, there is a drawback to this design, and that's repetitiveness.  There are only a few variations on the Cop/Racer theme, and it can get old towards the end.That being said, if you're a fan of arcade style racing, and you love competition, this is the racing game to own for the PS3.  Sim racing buffs should lean more towards Gran Turismo 5 to satisfy their tuner needs.Graphics:  5/5Presentation:  4.5/5Sound: 4/5 (mainly because of the very uneven soundtrack, but you can create your own playlist and use that instead)Controls:  4/5 (easy to learn, hard to master but absolutely necessary if you want to get all Gold/Distinction in all events)Replay Value: 4.5/5 (Once you have all Gold's, you'll still have Autolog and Online play until the cows come home)The Bottom Line:- This is not Burnout Paradise 2; if you're expecting that you'll be disappointed- This is not NFS Hot Pursuit 2 for the PS3 reimagined; if you're expecting that you'll be disappointed as well- However, if you're looking for a great arcade racing experience that isn't gimmicky Mario Kart like Blur and Split/Second, and is fair & balanced with ton of awesome cars and crashes, this is the racing game for you!(Editor's Note:  This game also just recently won the 2010 Racing Game of the Year at the Spike Video Game Awards, so you know it can't be that horrible if it's winning that award over Blur, Split/Second and Modnation Racers)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

Using the extraordinary superpowers and amazing skills of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and other favorite DC Comics super heroes, players must join the Justice League to ultimately save humanity from Brainiac and the dark forces that lurk in the universe.","reviewerName":"Alex Honda \"onyx575\"","summary":"GREAT WONDER WOMAN HERO!!! Fun-- but replay value ???","reviewText":"The Justice League Heroes game for PS2 is great fun! Nice graphics and all the super heroes are pretty much like they should be (meaning they are equipped with their individual powers, plus some special ones). Players have the option of setting the game to Easy, Medium, Hard, and Super Hero so even inexperienced gamers can play all the way through without getting too frustrated. The game's camera doesn't swing wildly, so it doesn't cause motion sickness or screw you up while you're battling bosses.When you start the game you have access to play as either:** SUPERMAN** BATMAN** WONDER WOMAN** THE MARTIAN MANHUNTER (J'on J'onz)** FLASH** GREEN LANTERN** ZATANNAHowever, the game doesn't let you choose which character you can play with. In the one person game, the two super heroes are chosen for you in each world, but you can switch between the two. As you progress through the game, characters gain experience and power and you can equip certain special powers they each have--in addition to the powers they're each known for. You also collect shields that you can use to buy different costumes for each hero and you can buy other heroes like:** HAWKGIRL** TWO DIFFERENT GREEN LANTERNS** THE HUNTRESS** AQUAMAN** THE GREEN ARROW(I might have forgotten one of them).Again, these unlockable characters can only be chosen at certain stages, even after you buy them, which kind of sucks.I'm a huge WONDER WOMAN fan, so I love playing as this hero. Snowblind studios really did this character justice! First off WONDER WOMAN can:** FLY - like in the Jutice League cartoon series** TIARA - her tiara can be used as a projectile, damaging distance objects or enemies** MAGIC LASSO -  the magic lasso has a number of different uses: WONDER WOMAN can temporarily bind enemies with it and use it to rope enemies in the distance and snatch them to her (like Scorpion in Mortal Kombat). She can also use the lasso to catch an enemy and swing him around and around in a circle--over and over, like a wrecking ball--to smash other foes or objects in the way** FLYING CHARGE ATTACK - she spins around, flying forward like a missle, destroying everything in her path** BRACELETS - last but not least, her fabulous bracelets! She's the only character that has this ability to deflect projectiles back at the shooter! By pressing the BLOCK button, Wonder Woman blocks all bullets, plasma rays etc., sending them back towards whatever it is shooting, causing damage. And if you can angle her just right, projectiles will go towards a different enemyShe's also as strong as Superman, so they didn't skimp on her. The sound effects for each of her special powers, like the tiara, are great too! You can also buy two different outfits for her, TOGA and BIKER STYLE. Near the end of the game, when the team gets closer to the final show down with Darkseid, Wonder Woman spins around in the cinematic and her outfit turns into the warrior outfit with the eagle headress, sword and shield (I think this was from one of the comic book series called \"Crisis On Inifite Earths,\" but I'm not sure). This is like a bonus so you can't change the costume and you can't choose this warrior outfit for other stages. BTW, in case you were wondering how to change the outfits back to the default, just select the outfit they're wearing and press deselect (I couldn't figure that out in the beginning and it's not in the booklet).Now here's the reason why I didn't give this game a perfect 5/5 score. Once you complete the game, you can choose to continue and this allows all the characters to retain their experience and health points, as well as their special powers. You also keep all the purchases you make, like outfits and hidden heroes. However, you can't choose which character you want to play as! Like the beginning, you start off with pre-chosen characters and progress through the game in the same fashion, so you can't play as a different hero-in a different stage. Maybe it's because I have proceeded on the easy setting or something, or there's a hidden cheat code that allows you to choose whichever character you would like to play with, but so far I haven't figured that out! Not sure if this applies to the two player game, but this is not good. It would have been better if you can play as other characters in different stages, to see how they would fair in the game and also keeps things interesting. Hopefully it's because I haven't figured out how to do that, yet, but if players can't choose, the game becomes redundant.Another thing I've noticed is that I can still collect shields, even though I've bought everything there is to buy. Maybe this means that there are more hidden characters or outfits in the game and I just haven't accessed them. Not sure!But aside from all that, JUSTICE LEAGUE HEROES is still enjoyable to play, particularly for fans of the comic or tv series. And it's much better than the JUTICE LEAGUE CHRONICLES, that came out several years ago, for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2006"}

However, Rogue Galaxy was more than that - it further include elements like Pokemon, Skies of Arcadia, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts. All those similarities could have made it a great game if mastered skilfully but Rogue Galaxy failed to accomplish that.The game started off pretty well. However, once it introduced its Revelation system, it is not hard to link this with FF XII's License Board. However, there was enhancement - you can deploy your new skills immediately without saving up more cash to buy it, which is a huge improvement. Then later you have the Insector side quest, which basically is extremely similar to Monster Hunter and probably more so for Pokemon. This is when you start think of how much originality does the game have?Space pirate RPGs - the most two notable ones are FF XII and Skies of Arcadia. Hm bounty hunting? Both checked for the other two games. A central hero looking for expansion of horizon in the starry oceans? Hm checked for both other games. Low HP with levelling up but huge damage from random enemies...hm not quite so for the other two games but wait, isn't that Dragon Quest (also by Level 5)? Change of costume...that sounds like an expansion of Dragon Quest (anybody remember Jessica's outfits?). Factory fusing new items and then available for sale - sounds like a mix of Dragon Quest's alchemy pot plus FF XII selling hard to find items to lure new items out from shops.So what's left of the game in terms of originality...really not much. It still could be a good game if those aspects were exercised skilfully. However, there are quite a number of annoying factors that really taxed your game experience. For example, low HP but huge damage will only work in turn based RPG cos you can employ strategies but in an action battle system, all you can do is to use up your potions and resurrection items cos before you know, two hits your character is dead. Also there is no healing spells and resurrection spells. So stocking up healing items is essential cos you party can get wiped out in 2 seconds if you are not paying enough attention.Another annoying aspect is the shifting of sub-weapons whenever you encounter enemies with force field barriers. This is especially annoying when you want to level up your new sub weapon only to find out that you have to switch back to yoru barrier break weapon which only does 0 damage and will run out of bullets in 4 shots. So if you missed, you have to wait for 10 minutes before it is recharged and by that time you'd have used up most of your healing items to keep your party alive because of continuous pounding from the invincible enemies.Also there are a lot of useless characters that look tough but that's all. This is especially for the Deego dog. I think a chiwahwah can fight even better than he does. He is slow and low in defense. Two hit he is dead and sometimes you just want to leave him lying there dead to save up your healing items. And all those shouting and yelling during battles by different characters are particularly annoying. Especially when you need to craw through a long dungeon. They keep on yelling \"Jaster!\". You can turn off the chatting in the dungeon but not during battles. And also there are characters that if you want a good challenge, use them as your controlled character - Yes I'm talking about Simon, who only do 2 hits and then it runs out of action point and just need to stand there all the time.Crawling dungeons is another hassle. They are long! Ok long dungeon is still ok but they recycle the polygons so much that you can only note the difference in areas by their colours and sometimes you don't even know what you are doing. You just feel like you are running in circles and then suddenly a new save point shows up and you know you are in a new area. The Twin Tower is the worst because after you finished the first one like after 10 hours of running around, you'll need to do it again to clear it another to move on. When you are looking at the same polygons again and again for 60 hours, the beauty becomes a nuisance.However, although there were so many flaws in the game, the graphics were pretty (except for the dumb look of the lead character), the cut scenes were well done and the music was good. They can be said as the saving grace of the game, but still the flaws overshadowed the good parts of the game. Wanted to give it 2.5 but there is no such option.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2008"}

There are alot of people who love Kain,but hate Raizel and therefore did not complete either of the Soul Reavers which is unfortunate esp. with the ending revelations of Soul Reaver 2:Raizel not being a mindless messiah with only one viewpoint,andKain not being the thoughtless,destructive demon who desires to end all humanity......This game is definatly one that you would want to add to your library,not only for graphics,content and gameplay but for the historic footnote that this game has made by breaking old video game stereotypes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2002"}

I mean, this game was one of the reasons why I bought a PS3 in the first place. The graphics and animation are top notch. I like the fact that the story has you playing different forces around the globe. The ending is very intense as well. Then, I realized that I really wanted to see what all the fuss was with the online play. I got one word for it......addictive. Online will just keep you playing over and over. Plus, it always gives you something to play for. For example, every kill that you get, there is a points system. As the points accumulate, you move up in rank. Not to mention, you get upgrades on weapons and weapons accessories. Now, in every match, you'll get killed. It's inevitable, but the point is to get as many kills as you can. Think you're good? You are not even as good as you think you are until you play online. You playing against the best all around the world. Still, it's all good fun. This game won game of the year. It definitely deserved.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2008"}

I'm in the minority in that I tend to enjoy the campaign more than the multiplayer. I'm just not good enough at multi to really enjoy it; nor am I lame enough to cheat/exploit/hack. Still, if you can play online with a decent group of cohorts, like I've been able to, you will get some fun out of the online component. In fact, Black Ops is simplified with better maps than MW2.The campaign has some decent stretches, but nothing mindblowing. I played through MW2 on the top 3 difficulties and never found myself bored -- not only because the campaign was short. On Black Ops I didn't have any interest in replaying the entire campaign, though I did try some specific missions.In the end, I didn't pay full price for Black Ops and I managed to trade it in for a great credit towards another game. I'm satisfied and had a good time with my more devoted online COD friends; but if you are expecting something ten times better than other COD entries you might not be satisfied.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003R783IY","description":"","reviewerName":"Gearhead Mania","summary":"Arcade racing game, stays true to the original NFS games","reviewText":"Need for Speed Hot Pursuit for Xbox 360I've been playing Need for Speed games since NFS 2, and have enjoyed each experience. NFS Hot Pursuit stays true to the original format, with jumping around to different events to earn medals as either a racer or a cop. There are some far fetched gadgets to give you an edge, like spike strips and EMP, but the basic premise of the game is to win each race.The races take place on open roads with or without traffic, and there are plenty of obstacles in the way along with short cuts. The objective is to figure out the shortest path to the finish line and balance your use of nitrous to overpower the AI. There is a lot of rubber banding going on, but the frustrating events are the ones where you retry the event multiple times to try and cut the corners the fastest and avoid hitting anything.The graphics are pretty good, and the weather/environmental visuals are top notch. This is by no means a sim racer, but is more of an arcade game. The selection of cars aren't too bad, but this is not Forza or Gran Turismo. The controls aren't too bad, except for how the cars handle on the road. I tend to scrub the corners a lot and if you brake too much on the entrance, you'll lose the races. The key seems to be trail braking, rubbing, and braking as late as possible and using nitrous to your advantage.Overall: 4/5 stars, the missions might get repetitive over time, but I still consider it a fun experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Exactly what I was hoping for","reviewText":"So, you want a game that allows you to take a leisurely stroll through New York, enjoying the sights, sounds, and ambiance of the city. Well, this game is most certainly not for you. What Prototype 2 is, much like the original Prototype, is an unabashed, gore filled, open world, romp of fun. I was a fan of the first game, so I went into the sequel with very specific expectations. I am happy to say that this is one of the few games that has lived up to exactly what I expected it to be. So, with that said, what can you expect out of Prototype 2?In Prototype 2 New York is separated into three zones; Green, Yellow, and Red. The color of the zone reflected the level of infection present in that zone. The protagonist, Sgt James Heller, has a run in with Alex Mercer who is the main character from the first game, and is sent on a story of vengeance and revenge to those who killed his wife and daughter. Heller will need to go to all three zones to find what really happened to his family and to exact his form of justice.Being an open world style game there are a lot places to explore, sights to see, and things to do. Make no mistake about this, this game is bloody. But, it's such a blast to fully evolve Heller and become a virtually unstoppable badass. Prototype 2 offers you many moments of badassery (yes, I just made that word up), anything from ripping a turret off the top of a tank and slamming it onto the tank to blow it up, to slicing the rotors off a helicopter and watching it crash. If you like explosions, enjoy gore, and feeling like the ultimate destruction machine give this game a run.There are two things about Prototype 2 that Radical Entertainment absolutely nailed. First, most games that are released now have some sort of collectible to hunt out. This is one game where collectibles make sense and have a tangible reward for finding them, aside from the requisite achievement/trophy. Collectibles are divided into three categories; Black boxes which offer brief glimpses and snippets of information (if you played the original Prototype think of the Web of Intrigue). Field Ops which are Blackwatch guards and scientists examining the corpse of an infected which you have to destroy, and Lairs that you go into and either take out infected, Blackwatch, or both. Each zone has a certain number of each of these `collectables' finding/recovering/and or destroying them in a zone gives you a certain mutation on top of the normal XP that you earn. This gives you a tangible reason to search these out. In my play through I did these as soon as I could before doing story based mission. The powers you gain have the potential to help you in your quest immensely, plus they are fun to do.The other thing that that I really enjoyed, and this one was a pleasant surprise, was the cut scenes. The majority of the story is told in cut scenes. While this is the case with a lot of games the delivery of the cut scenes is fantastic. They are done in a grey scale, almost noir style. There are touches of red scattered in some of the scenes which actually reminded me of the movie Schindler's List (yeah, I just dropped a classic movie reference). These cut scenes add a depth to the thinking of Keller and what is actually fueling his motives and why he is going after the people he does. Some of the scenes are predictable, but they felt genuine and I can honestly say I never skipped one.Make no mistake about it, Prototype 2 is all about unlocking new powers, making them stronger, and using them to cause as much destruction as you can. There are five main powers to be had and upgrades, Claw, Blade, Tendrils, Whipfist, and Hammerfist. There are also a couple others like Devastators, and Pack Leader which add a different dimension. The actual powers, and upgrades, are unlocked by consuming the targets. It's a great way to become more powerful you don't magically unlock a new ability. You have to earn them all. Once earned, New York is your playground to try them out.Action in Prototype 2 can become very hectic with several enemies, tanks, and helicopters all on the screen at the same time. During these chaotic sequences the camera can become somewhat of a detriment and cumbersome to get where you want it. This is especially true when there is a helicopter present and you want to target it. The camera's movement can be slow, it's just enough to be an issue, but not enough to get you killed or be overly frustrating. That is honestly the only thing I would try to enhance in the game.Full disclosure, I was a fan of the original Prototype. Based on playing the first one I went into Prototype 2 with a very specific set of expectations. I have to say, the game lived up to what I was looking for. If you're not sure if this is the right game for you give the original Prototype a play. Radical Entertainment took the original and improved on it in every way. If you liked the first one, by all means jump into this one with your claws out you won't be disappointed. While I certainly understand this may not be a game for everyone, for those that enjoy this genre this is one that shouldn't be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2012"}
